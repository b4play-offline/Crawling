0,Great game strategy based. Quazy fun.
1,i hate how games want you to review them after you play for like ten whole minutes. but so far its pretty good nice varaty of units and doesnt seem very p2w atm
2,Pretty good game.
3,gg
4,Crush them all!!!!!
5,"So far so good, pretty much Clash Royale but on steam. Plays well but yet to see how P2W the top end is yet."
6,"PP

5/5"
7,P2W oof.
8,"After 764 hours played I think I can say I enjoy this game! Generous freemium model, I would highly recommend everyone purchase the All Masters upgrade for maximum enjoyment. 
+ Easy to pick up and play but has some depth
+ many viable strategies and cards to collect
+ fast and furious casual gameplay
+ can play solo, with a random or with a friend
+ Mainly PvP but Adventure mode allows you to play PvE
- gets grindy if played too long
- bad matchups and occasional player discconnects can be frustrating"
9,fun
10,aesome game dude
11,actually pretty fun game nice
12,Good.
13,Clash royale but on pc and with cool cards.
14,"Simply no,this game is a waste of my time farewell for good."
15,no
16,"soooo fun. xD
"
17,Feels fresh and good to play not even gonna lie better than clash
18,Super nice strategy game. Should have a higher player base - and needs it.
19,so far so good.
20,Very similar to clash royale. Just what I was looking for.
21,Fun games
22,Epic
23,sweg
24,"Enjoyable, easy to grasp and easy to get new units without spending any money."
25,big boi clash royale
26,Very very good game. Less toxic than Clash Royale for sure.
27,Fun game
28,My friend played for awhile before I tried it out! Finally gave it a chance and have been hooked! Have had it downloaded for about a week and have played everyday! As long as you grind you don't have to sink in real money to get rubies which is cool!
29,Me and my significant other got into this game together and its super fun to play the co-op battles against other pairs! Super simple to learn and an easy and chill game for us to figure out together :D Would share with friends <3
30,Good fun
31,i love ittt
32,Games fun to chill and play. Love the change in pace as the match progress's.
33,it's ok
34,this is a great co-op game. When you are lucky like I am and grew up with a best friend that played magic the gathering with you this is a great way to reconnect and both flex your card/strategy game skills with.
35,a
36,This is one of those few games where I find dying to be a bit funny.  There are some fierce players out there.  Don't let the cartoony look of this game fool you.  It's fun!  Grab a friend and have a blast.
37,"One of the best games I've ever played. I've played over a thousand hours on Xbox, this is my backup account for my laptop when I need the fix. New content every month, these Dev's are as good as any but I still haven't spent a dime. The f2p path is very addicting, I have 230 of the 255 cards available on Xbox without a penny spent. I don't feel guilty because I've put a lot of people onto this game and a few of them have spent a lot."
38,"typical pay to win.

edit: really forgiving with lots of ways to get the cards you need, actually. still dont recomend though."
39,Lovely addictive!
40,"Its clash Royal meets League of Legends, not a bad game."
41,"Fun game, I like how it has all the factions with their gimmicks.
Grinding to get enough cards to make some decks are rather tedious but I mean you can't really complain, after all it is the main way they keep people in the game.
a decent season pass that nets you decent rewards and even gives you things for every level even if you don't buy the pass.
they are rather generous with the paid currency, allowing you to get it several ways making it so you may never have to actually buy the season pass.
The fact DLC comes out free for like a week after it firsts arrives was the reason I got into the game and I think is a great way to give players who are quick or just read the news to get free cards for nearly nothing

free game, all it costs is space and a bit of your time. I would absolutely tell people to try it, after all, what do you lose?"
42,"It's a one-and-done game in its entirety by its own faults and flaws.

I played for a few hours, lost only once (incredibly easy game), and then decided to turn the graphics down because it sets the default way higher than it needs to be, so it was making my computer run hot for no decent reason and at the wrong resolution settings.
Also tried connecting my Twitch account so I could stream it out of boredom and to get the extra rewards for doing so.
Didn't get the extra rewards and now the game can't launch at all and actually crashes my computer if I try too hard to get the game to work at all.

Aside from the serious technical issues that seem to exist, the game is way too repetitive and becomes incredibly grindy if you don't put money into it, and considering it doesn't even launch for me anymore, I seriously can't recommend putting any money into it.

Overall, it's decent for a single bored afternoon's worth of entertainment, but nothing more."
43,Cards come to life and beat each other up. What's not to like? 10/10
44,"This is a good and fun game, and there's always a match"
45,Turbo cash grab
46,"top contender, 4K ENVI @ youtube"
47,"Seems like good game. UI is awful, but core game is excellent, and F2P model is fair."
48,this game is such bs. u try out the free to play and they make it easy on u. u pay to unlock other adventures and BOOM easy has become hard. waste of money
49,If you want a seasonal card game that does not grow stale.
50,Easy going autobattler!
51,Amazing game! It seem simple at first glance but the level of depth and strategy is where this game really shines. As you climb through the ranks you will find some amazing matches. This game will be some of the most fun you'll have for a long time.
52,Fun co-op. Not based on cpm.
53,pretty fun
54,"As a big strategic, quick thinking, enormous brainweilding minmaxing god of a man I can easily see myself spending a few thousand hours on this game.
Very good game, very poggers, 10/10"
55,A LOT OF FUN
56,I played for under half an hour and the chat was full of weird fascists
57,worse clash royal but for pc so thats a plus
58,It is fun. I cannot stop.
59,I play a ton of strategy and card games so naturally this kept appearing in my feed. At first I would just scroll past it but one day I was bored and decided to try it. So far I'm having a blast and I wish I tried it sooner.
60,"Really nice game, entertaining, easy to play and difficult to master."
61,cool game <3
62,Pretty fun game and is great for casual players as well.
63,One of the best free to play games of all time.
64,"could not find the exit button in the ESC that put me into settings when i was asking for help on the manner in all chat i just get called a moron and get insulted when clearly the exit button was not there to begin with for me to exit the game i just uninstalled it and written this review.

Other then that the game is ok i can see it being fun but with people that already make you feel unwelcome i am not sure I want to be a part of that community"
65,"Really great game. if you like cool and creative cosmetics.. not the game for you.
the art team likes to just recolor and reuse the same skins over and over to the point i think they've just gotten lazy because no one complains.
for this battle pass their ""new legendary"" is just an old skin made transparent and a ghostly green color. 
do you know how much time this would take?  probably a day and that's being generous, a talented artist could have it done on their lunch break.
if they could make NEW 3D models when they want to call a skin legendary, that would be great. but these recolors slapped with a ""legendary"" tag just so they will sell is bull$#!%"
66,its good
67,GAME COOL
68,I really enjoy playing this game. It's pretty chill and fun.
69,Который год эта игруля помогает расслабиться ) Периодические обновления не дают заскучать
70,It is a fun game with good art
71,"It's a good game but one thing absolutely ruins it for me, and that's matchmaking. Most matches are very unbalanced, either you or your enemies are DOMINATING and it feels like nothing depends on me at all, every time I queue I feel like it's a random chance of win/lose ahead. The fact that game has bots posing as real players, and two separate systems - one for visible ranks, another for mm elo - doesn't help either. Oh, and did I meantion that there is NO unranked/casual mode?"
72,"Quick and easy game to get into. Card Game Tower Defense twist, and full of action. No traditional turns!"
73,FUn FUn FUn
74,"Before i played this, i had a big boobs, big ass, sugar daddy, no depression, rich life and absolutely a lot of will to live. These things haven't changed, so i have no idea if this game is any good."
75,"No one reads reviews, so i'll say that i'm gay"
76,"Very fun to play. I love the way they give me lots of free stuffs like xp, coins, glory points etc. Good game!!"
77,"Valaha jó játék volt.... egy ideje folyamatosan botok vannak csapattársnak, ellenfélnek... semmi értelme így, ki is írhatná a végeredményt simán."
78,great summoner game
79,So I've been looking for something to take my mind of of things lately and honestly no game was doing it. I love TD games and I love strategy based games. I fell in love with clash royale and this is a PC clone done properly. I hope riot steals this and makes their own version of it like they did with Dota and Dota auto chess. So far It's pretty fun PvP seems to reward strategic plays like pulls with non agro units haven't explored all the cards but some seem stronger than others but they all seem to have a weakness. STUNs is OP
80,easy to learn lets u jump right into the fun
81,"A free to play game that i often come back to, It is micro transaction heavy but not pay to win, it doesnt take much play time to catch up and be able to craft the cards you need to get to a high rank, then from there its learning what counters what and having a deck which can handle most types. 

I fully recommend"
82,Is nice
83,"Game is super easy to learn and has a very high skill ceiling.  Once you get good enough, you start to see that every match is potentially winnable if you sequence your plays correctly.  Also, has a really amazing draft mode, that let's to play around with tons of combos and legendary cards.  Fairly easy to build up a collection quick, though the legendaries are quite pricey (but often aren't must-haves to be competitive)."
84,it's so good!
85,Not worth you time.
86,"uh, yeah"
87,good game
88,fun easy and casual until you have to pay $100 to win

92,this is an overall fun game of strategy i enjoyed it alot
93,its good
94,"really just play out of habit and some matches are so bad just drop the game for a while and check back later,"
95,"Bad game, stupid teammates. you better go play with yours knees"
96,"""zounds"""
97,Very fun and addictive
98,"My husband and I play this co-op. It is fun to play together on a team against another team.  I especially like striving for the season rewards. It can be very challenging but fun to try different strategies, new cards, and different masters.  Would recommend. It even has an option for 2 against 2 (4 person co-op basically). It would be cool if you could campaign in co-op mode somehow, but I do not think this is possible as of yet. Still, the fact that it has so many options is great and it's free. We've had at least 50 hours for free so far, so it hasn't become pay-to-play yet like many say, so that's good."
99,GG EZ
100,Lot's of cards are still horribly overpowered after all this time. Just not very enjoyable.
101,"Highly comparable to Hearthstone.
That is: if Thronebreaker is the closest card game combat quality to Hearthstone, then this is the closest depth to its' mechanical quality.
Depth makes things highly addictive here, and the fairly RNG loot boxes, really keeps you striving to make the cards you want.
My main negative is that there is no 'disenchant', or selling mechanic. So you end up gathering many useless things just to gather dust. There is a mechanic that allows you to compile copies, so using the same duplicates grants you more ranking in your guild (I think?) but it's pretty underwhelming. Replacing that with just selling cards for shards would give player excellent choice mechanic, based on what they want/dislike."
102,"great pc version of clash of clans. 
"
103,awesome game
104,"Just a lot of fun and each game is very fast.  Can play any time and with the many cards and skills to use, still very challenging."
105,"Fun + Easy to pick up = good time, what more do you want"
106,"what a dry concept for a game
don't get me wrong
the graphic design is very good
my problem with it is that is not interesting enough"
107,"Rather watch Minions, haha.... get it minions :I"
108,Fun to Play and good ranking system.
109,Fun game
110,"It's free, fun and not Pay2Win."
111,Awesome Game!
112,Royal nighte eilla Minion mattirs
113,its good
114,"I started playing on Xbox but their version has almost become unplayable unfortunately through their ""updates"". My biggest gripe is that I was unable to port my account or resources so I had to start all over again with over 10k game played on Xbox and all cards obtained. The currencies and micro-transactions are what you expect from a free game but to their credit they are not game breaking or P2W. It is possible to grind it out without real money and if you're addicted like I was you will gain resources fast. All that aside the developers are always tweaking and working on the game and it's a riot when all is working well. Highly recommended for folks looking for a fun, strategic and addicting coop game!"
115,"I'm really enjoying it, but i'd love one change
for 2V2, let mana overflow from one teammate to the other. this means disconnects would be only inconvienient, and gives opportunity for more team synergy"
116,Game gud
117,Awesome Time Waster!
118,Another horrible pay to win game.
119,Announcer sounds like a robot with strep throat.
120,"Try this game its addictive, fun by yourself or with friends, and challenging!"
121,Great game fun to play
122,Macht Bock. Besser als dieser ganze Android müll in diesem Bereich.
123,"Game is a fking joke! 4 games in a row my 2v2 ally left! This crap game has no failsafe for protecting my ranked standings, so i keep falling because the devs are too dumb to think that a 2v1 is NOT FUN!"
124,.
125,"Didn't even know I had this in my library, thought I would give it a try. Not for me. Couldn't even figure out how to exit the game without alt+f4. Maybe it was because I was drunk at the time. Oh well, I guess we will never know."
126,cards go brrrrr
127,didnt think i would like this but after winning a few team battles and getting to gold level i am enjoying it more than i thought.
128,"I reccomend
"
129,"The game mechanics is similar to In the Clash Royal,but I am just a green hand when I am forced to play the PVP pattern,when makes me sick."
130,Still no cross platform parties.
131,Very fun in team co-op with people you know on mic.
132,"There are two ways you might get some enjoyment out of this game :
1.) You check in once in a great while to see whats new, try some new / changed cards.
2.) Play 2v2 with a pre-made teammate, even those these games are also (mostly) boring, there is at least a little variance once in a while.

Otherwise sadly the game has no real value for a few reasons :
1.) One vs One in this game is so incredibly boring, if you can tolerate playing more than 10 of these a week you likely have some sort of condition and need help.
2.) Random team Two vs Two is unplayable if you are looking for fun. The matchmaking is awful ( likely due to low player base ) you can be a Master v 2 Masters and have a SIlver teamate.  One out of every 5 or so players is afk for periods of time that ruin the match as well."
133,they dont care that there are hackers
134,Very fun and easy to play. Everything feels good. Hope its not P2W later in the game
135,"This game is still working out some bugs and dynamics but I really enjoy playing it nonetheless. It's creative, visually engaging without overwhelming my workhorse PC, and fun to play with/against friends."
136,"Toxic players have ruined this game
Revision- the Autobot is good, but toxic players can just tick i'm back and continue to not engage."
137,Yes
138,"Does not work properly, I can not use any Dropdown field in the options, and cannot even play a card, I can select it but then not play it."
139,7/10
140,Fun
141,dats phun
142,"I played this game in 2020 but the reason I quit still persists. You won't be playing against other people - you'll be playing against the AI. Yes, even in ranked matches. It's very, very noticeable to and it one of the reasons why you'll often get these super high winstreaks. Don't bother unless you're fine with viewing this game as PvE experience."
143,+1
144,Nice game.Fun and nice.
145,NICE LITTLE GAME. RELAXING.

148,"Fun game to play, not too hard,  nor are the unlocking of cards too challenging either, very free to play oriented, matches are really easy to find, around 5 seconds in queue time :)"
149,Deceptively amazing
150,"awful game, most of the time your vs AI even in match ups. The game even forces fake text to make it look like your guild is talking to you, it forces random text like ""hello"" and ""lets do a match"" even when they are not online to fake activity to make it feel like you are playing with real people, but in-fact you are not. Another point I noticed, you go with some crazy win streaks, then after about 5 or 6 you get hammered by over powered AI. Its just an awful game and should be removed from steam."
151,"TL;DR: The game has a very immature or young community with very little policing from devs. The game is really fun but is hard to enjoy socially due to obsessively disruptive characters in their discord and in-game chat. Balance is okay, they consistently make changes based on feedback. Cannot suggest game due to the toxic atmosphere.


This is not easy for me to do... I would absolutely never give a thumbs down to a game like this. The GAME is GOOD and the BALANCE is FINE, and the devs are consistently changing things up to make the game more fun. You can spend IRL monies on cosmetics and cards, but everything is earnable by playing the game. I would definitely highly suggest buying every battle pass and completing it. It's probably like 6 bucks only I think and gets you cards, gold for tokens, and some random skins and icons. It's also important for me to mention that this game is majorly non-communication between players. 

The only ""chat"" is outside of matches, and it is guild chat or general chat. Nothing special or crazy. However... general chat is wildly toxic. I understand that a lot of free games draw a... special... crowd, and usually a lot of kids too... but this game clearly does not value maturity in either their discord nor their in-game chats. I literally cannot recommend this game to any of my friends because of how embarrassed I have been seeing the in-game and discord chat. It's seriously like someone filled a room with middleschoolers pretending to be 40 year olds. 

"
152,Fun game
153,"fun card game, has a little bit of a learning curve if you're new to card/tower defense games :)"
154,just clash royale with even worse graphics
155,good
156,Gooba
157,Awesome PVP game. Matches are quick but watch out they are also very addictive! I never played Magic the Gathering but I imagine if it were a video game this would be it except much better.
158,pretty sweet strategy game worth trying out especially if you like rts games
159,its fun
160,"I have a lot of fun playing this game! Its like a TCG but flows much differently then one.  The gameplay is fast paced and complex but easy to get a hang of.  Like most games like this there is a definite pay to win feeling in the game but it dosnt feel like a brick wall that you need pay to climb over. The rolls for new unit cards feels fair and not like all im getting is low rarity units. The balancing feels good, it feels like you can make just about any unit card shine if you use it the right way. Que times are low and matches go by fast so your never sitting long. Plus the 2v2s with a friend are a great time! The only thing i wish for is a way to play with 3 people, 2 is good for duos and 4 is a great time fighting my friends but theres always someone left out when we have 3. Other than that 9/10 really enjoy this game"
161,"Don't get me wrong, as a long term player I do love Minion Masters but I am recommending against it for new players. If you want to play solo or passively lurk on twitch streams for gold to do draft, it's not so bad. Duos (premades or random) are very toxic to new players. If you do randoms as a new player, you will most likely get BMed by a salty teammate in chat. If you do premades with a friend, be prepared to fight some bots (which makes you think you know what you're doing) and also real cheese wildcard decks (which you most likely won't have proper cards to counter as a new player). If you don't have a lot of cards or multiple copies of good cards, duos can be extremely painful. This is especially true since due to falling player population they allow you to end up fighting people with a much higher rank. Plus higher ranks can get easy fights by teaming up with their low ranking friends (or alt account)... Some long term players know how to play the system.

The cheese issues aside, the game feels mostly abandoned as BetaDwarf is working on a new game. We were supposed to get MM 2.0 with mobile, so they let the game suffer while they were working on that. Then they cancelled mobile (possibly forever, we shall see) and started opening more tests for their new game. We also got puff plushies, yay?

Minion Masters had (and still has) a lot of potential, but the game devs don't really seem to know how to balance or promote the game. The player base has mostly left and those that remain are very split in which direction the game needs to go. Taking a step in either of those directions would be good though as the game isn't in a very healthy place I feel as I write this review. If that changes, I will update.

PS- I unlocked all the achievements while the game was available through discord and I still can't get credit for that on steam 2 years later.... Oof."
162,its a great game you should try it
163,Could be a good game. But the amount of bugs is just too high (gets with each update worse)
164,"A lot of predatory game design, including not having a ""quit"" button until you finish the full ""new player experience."" I had to alt+f4 to get out of the game.

My high play time is in part trying to figure out how to exist without doing a hard exit."
165,awesome to play with my fiance
166,"You can make it to the top 50 players within a day, play it to feel like you earned something"
167,This game is awesome they really put of thought into the game and rewards are fun! :)
168,Fun with friends
169,Like Heartstone + clash royale. Timegating rewards is the reason I will stop playing fast.
170,when you have a good run it will put bots with perfect counters against you.

177,"Fun game, but Pay To Win"
178,"This game is SOOOOO much better than I thought it would be! They are very generous with dealing out their cards, gameplay is AWESOME and graphics are awesome as well. 

I bought the battlepass just to say 'thank you' to the developer because of how much fun it is. Even though I feel I didn't need it because I was winning fine with my freebie cards. If you're looking for a fast-paced, high action games that are usually less than 15 mins, then this is it.
"
179,Bullshit Adventures! Paid zero money for this game and still feel ripped off
180,"fun, easy to learn complex to master"
181,"Awesome game! I love the game play, I only wish for more minions!"
182,"Pay to win, if you don't pay you don't get access to all the gold, exp, card tokens, rubies, crystals, etc., etc., etc. in order to buy all the heroes with top tier abilities and all the cards. It's no different than any other ""Card"" game. Just like Magic the Gathering, if you don't spend tons of money you will never have a competitive deck. If you don't pay you do nothing but feed other people wins who have paid. Free to play means ""Frustrating to Players"" unless you pay, and pay, and pay, and pay. $80.00+ for the heroes and card packs on a pay-to-win free-to-play game?

It's a good thing I haven't paid one cent because I would be really upset right now if I had. Instead I get to dodge this bullet and give my money to another company that actually gives you a ""game"", not a tiered payment reward system designed to milk users.

Remember when games were made to be fun? I do.

I am so very thankful for games like Minion Masters because they let me see all the frustration and headaches up front without me spending a dime. It is games like these that make me appreciate other real games all the more."

184,Over complicated clicker bs
185,"nice game

186,"Terribly optimized, as soon as I launched the game my GPU went to 100% and it's not a bad GPU either, it's an nvidia 1060 6GB vram. Additionally, I couldn't change the quality options on the settings menu, clicking the buttons did nothing.

If you don't mind buying a new GPU 3 months after getting this game, sure go for it."
187,fun game that is interactive and the avatars having their own abilities is legit
188,Perfect mix and unique game. Can recommend!
189,"I have 812 hours of gameplay off and on throughout the past few years. It's an incredible game and the only one that always brings me back, and it's free!! In recent years, they've switched to a season pass meta each season, with a certain OP card that you can't get unless you buy the pass.. but if you're like me and you don't mind supporting your favorite F2P game it's really no big deal. General rewards either way are very generous."

Its good for fun and chill game, but u can on ""try hard"" mod🤣
The first 10 hours of the game flew by very quickly.

Interesting gameplay✨
Matches are found quickly🏃‍♂️
A lot of cards🎴
Donate is not important💰

Cannot edit video settings🖥
Need some good music🎼

Recommend to try it!"
192,This game is way more than fun than it has any right to be for free. I've not spent a cent on it and am still having a blast.
193,"it's fun, make sure to look up codes to redeem. :)
Also watch at Twitch.tv/Raikah_ if you want to see some premade teams gameplay. (Currently Plat 3 and rising)"
194,Tactical masterpiece.
195,GREAT GAME
196,"fun time killer, enjoying so far"
197,"Definately one of my go to games, quick to win, quick to lose, great to strategize."
198,amazing game!
199,They guilted me into leaving a review... why don't other games do that?
200,W game
201,<3
202,"Recommended, but ironically, not for children.  The graphics and art style make it appear to be a children's game at first, but the content frequently displays things children should never see.  But, it's fun for Dad and maybe my oldest child here soon.  

It helps to get a bunch of free stuff by checking one of the top player guides for codes to redeem (you need to be a certain level before you can redeem them)."
203,"Fun deck-building autobattler where the main tactical choice is where to spawn each minion. Once they spawn, the minions walk toward the enemy and fight for control of two bridges. Each bridge gives XP over time to the player who controls it. The XP unlocks extra abilities for your player, over the course of the match.

It's pretty easy to unlock a lot of cards and some champions and skins just by playing. There's free stuff every day, sometimes including the premium currency. You get a lot of the non-premium currency from quests that the game gives you, and occasionally some premium currency too.

Definitely has monetization, but doesn't feel pay-to-win, mostly because there aren't a huge amount of cards. It's easy to get enough cards to compete without buying anything. The stuff they're really trying to sell is cosmetic."
204,"I want a refund...

Seems like its unpolished, looks like it was made in the early 2000s.... There are far many other better examples of this exact thing and the first that would come to mind and absolutely smash this game is Magic The Gathering Arena....

Even for a free to play game, this is lacking care, time, thought.... rather rushed it seems and clunky..."
205,"good
"
206,game is garbage.  there is no actual deck building involved in this.  you just put random stuff and spend money to unlock more cards.  if you dont use money it takes you forever to get anything good.  on top of your leaders are shit and have no actual benefit since you dont have cards unlocked to use with them.  played all of 3 games and found this has no strategy or any skill involved.  its all about how much money you spend to unlock cards.
207,It seems like every update I see they remove more and more free to play options and make it so you have to spend actual money on the game to get anywhere. You can't really just experiment and play whatever cards you think are good or have synergy together anymore you have to play the new masters and then play with the new cards that come out every set.  Really good 2 vs 2 gameplay and it used to have interesting player expression with the master selection but now most masters are rapidly becoming outdated or borderline unusable.
208,cool
209,"There's enough variety in the early game to make the game interesting. It looks and feels like a simple game, but still feels satisfying to figure out. And it's also a free to play game, they push microtransactions in your face like you'd expect."

211,Game is dope
212,Its kinda good.
213,seems intriguing
214,"Game is quick and does not need a lot of commitment. Getting repetitive because we never knew which enemy will play which strategy, which sometimes to win means we need luck or the enemy make mistakes. Best for casual gaming, ranking is kind of just for serious people and losing streak because you pull worst possible cards is very very annoying. Probably I'm just average at gaming in general haha, probably there are better ways to play"
215,lil motherf***ers
216,"It's not a bad game really.  Good to place once in a while.

Graphics are nice, and finding matches is quick.

If you like card building games, this game is certainly worth a try."
217,F2P is fun to do. You win a lot in the beginning stages wich is nice. I recommend!
218,Fun 2 Play
219,"Small download
Free to play
Straightforward & intuitive mechanics
A mixture of luck & skill - mostly skill
Niche playerbase
Competitive ranking system
Smooth gameplay
Minimal investment
Enjoyable co-op game"
220,easy to pick up with a lot of mechanics to unlock. i find it more fun the hearthstone
221,Pretty fun so far.
222,This game is way unbalanced at the moment not even worth logging on.
223,GAME IS FUN
224,Fast paced and fun. Strategic with little to no pay walls so far.
225,i luv dis gam
226,"MUCH BETTER THAN CLASH OF CLANS!
"
227,"bepic bungus

228,good
229,This game is pretty fun so far. I'm really enjoying how easy it was to get started. I'm still learning things but I'm sure I'll be playing this for a long time.
230,Walmart Clash Royale
231,"Over 1000+ hours of gameplay and I'm done a 2nd time.
The matchmaking uses your cards to determine your enemy, so the match making becomes unbearable repetitive and boring. (Enemies all using the same ""counters"" to your cards) and the glitches just get worse the older the game gets."
232,Fun and quick 5min games that hit the spot.
233,"Like the game but no solo progression (PVE). That really really sucks. You can play solo but only with premade decks. I have played hundreds of matches agains the AI, but no rewards. (Why do devs think that the player's time spent ingame is expendable.) Also I been playing since it started, game had thousands of players on steam. Not so much now haha. I still don't understand why we don't get PVE rewards for playing with our own decks."
234,Better clash royale
235,"Great concept ruined by greed and incompetence.

The game often crashes and disconnects, random parts of it stop working and work next day (like chat for example). However the developers seems to be completely obliviuos to it and nothing got fixed in a couple of months I've been playing it. Imagine getting pestered with ""special offers"" after the crash in a ranked game while trying to quickly get back.

The matchmaking is not centered on giving you a fair game, instead it is designed to keep you in the game longer. Prepare to get inept teammates two leagues lower than you after you go on a win streak, while both of your opponets are in the same league. Fun, isn't it?

I really wanted to give this game a chance, but ultimately it only brings frustration."
236,"Even though the game has crossplay, you can't party up with people on different platforms.
I literally installed it on PC so I could play with my Brother on Xbox Series X.

The game is in a borderline unplayable state on Xbox One, it drops to like 12FPS, it freezes, it crashes.

Please fix the Xbox One version and let us have cross-platform guilds and parties."
237,balancing system is on league of legends level
238,"i really like it because there is a new character
"
239,ho hum
240,It's fun. The matches are laggy at times. If servers improve this is a 10/10 banger :)
241,i love this game very fun.
242,"Cannot edit video settings, recent update broke graphics with hyper contrast and over saturation of brightness.  Upon searching for the config file (since there is no way to change these settings in game) I was greeted with the developer response on a steam thread that you can ""just hold shift on launch"" to see more settings.  well as you may have guessed, fellow steam user veterans, there exists no such thing, nor has there ever been such a thing in all of steam."
243,"I like that this isn't like any games I've played before. I'm usually a strategy type game person so I think that's why I like this. I would recommend at least give it a try, it took me a while to learn the cards, there is a lot of them. Be patient LOL and yes I get MAD when I lose!"
244,Better than Clash Royale imo
245,Really addictive!
246,funny man.
247,Fun game but I keep getting disconnected even in a solo game
248,"I don't usually play this kinda genre, but I like it. Polished, tons of free stuff out the gate to get you going. Easy to pick up design and it's intuitive what the units do so it's fun to play on day one. 

After hearing the devs poured 9 years into this I gotta say it shows, every inch of this game is complete. I can't wait to explore it more until I can't stand the meta but still try to enjoy it anyways! Great game for the value you pay upfront and I think I got it in a bundle."
249,Fix your shit
250,Good game!
251,Great Game
252,the most free to play card game out there
253,"I'm addicted to the cards, I'm like Seto Kaiba but better at cards. I am the one who plays the cards."
254,"all in all i really like games like this especially ""Gwent"" for example so something as just basic but sort off complex as this is quite enjoyable, yes i know not really complex but still fun and all around a pretty good game i don't usually review games but eh it asked at the right time so yeah its pretty good definitely recommend
"
255,ITS REALLY FUN
256,"Servers are kinda messy, I keep getting disconnected every match and it's definitely not my end"
257,"Good game play, finally a fresh game for me to play, nice graphics and game style.."
258,TROUBADOOOUURRRRRRRRR
259,Yeah not my style.
260,"I like card games, with that said, This is a cool way to bring your cards to life. It is a lot of fun. All the different ways to play are just more hours of something to do that you can manage when you have limited time.  XD"
261,Always fun to beat the top players and streamers in 1v1 or 2v2. Recommend for both casual or hardcore
262," not bad. def pay to win. Also, match making isn't really fair for duos. single pvp wasnt to bad. sounds great! i would give it a 3 out of 5."
263,uses 80% of GPU and CPU for basically an idle card game. it's fun but can't recommend playing something that will cost $50/mo in electricity.
264,clash royale but funnier lol
265,"for team matches: when you win too much, you get paired with people who are far below your opponent's skill level, leading to unwinnable matches. This leads me to believe there is some form of engagement based matchmaking going on, which is evil and exploitative. despite what the research says such matchmaking systems are not fun and does not increase my engagement but makes me want to stop playing."
266,"After beating the final boss of the free adventure, the game disconnected and quit. I got no rewards, and I lost all progress."
267,"Fun game to play with a bud. You get lots of free stuff so you can play without spending much, and when each expansion comes out you can get a bunch of free cards."
268,"While this is a fun and exciting game to play, its not offering much new to its genre but worst of all, this is a micro-transaction-based game despite the fact that you've paid full price for it.

The good news is the looks amazing, the humor in the voice announcements is great, he animation itself is very smooth, I noticed no drop in frame rate even during the most intense battles, but then we come to micro-transactions.

First, there is a CONSTANT ad in the upper left asking to spend at least $4.99.  Second, every time you log in you are FIRST reminded they want your money.  There's the ""Season Pass"" tease after every single match, and you can only win a certain number of games PER DAY before it stops rewarding you chests and tells you how much longer you have to wait.  THAT'S MOBILE GAMING, NOT FULL PRODUCT PURCHASES!

Honestly, if they developer gave the game away for free or had it out on Mobile, all of the above issues I listed would be moot.  But after charging us full price they still nag us for more money?  Come to think of it, I may just uninstall for a game that lets me play it as much as I want ... you know...since I gave them money and all."
269,"I fucking hate this game
Random multiplayer is shit
You can play when you have nothing to do
But I don't recommend playing every day, it's not cool
CBT players get nothing"
270,Jerma985 is a Liar.
271,Pretty fun
272,I feel joy playing this game LOL
273,big fun

279,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1.6 tablespoons unsalted butter 
2. 1/2 cup white sugar 
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 
4. 1/4 cup water 
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt 
7.5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 
8.1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple, filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. 
Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Was this review helpful?"
280,Very fun took all my money
281,clash royale on roids
282,I've had the game for quite a while but I've just given it a go. It's really great!! Grind isn't so bad plus summoning minions is really fun.
283,Very addictive. Really dedicated devs. For a FTP game it is extremely generous.
284,"Minion Masters is a pretty awesome game with regular content updates and a great marketing model. The Premise is simple enough: You choose your champion and build a deck of spells and creatures that you throw at the other player until you win. It gets more complicated depending on your strategy, but by playing you get enough materials to craft/buy cards you want or gacha them with an in-game currency that's pretty easy to get just by playing the game. It's fun and I recommend it."
285,"This game is like Clash Royale, but if the devs actually cared about the game and updated it more than twice a year. Pros to this game: multiple heroes, tribes, and a large array of cards so that there is always a new deck to try and something to do. Very free to play friendly, in comparison to Clash Royale. Fun to play with friends. Cons: Mana frenzy often decides who wins and who doesn't, so sometimes the game feels less like ""who can kill their opponent first"" and more like ""who can hold the bridges longer."" Daily quests sometimes repetitive. Overall, very good game, and something I will be playing for the foreseeable future as a long time Clash Royale player."
286,good game
287,fun
288,"IT IS GOOD IT IS FUN BECAUSE sum times you spam people next you are making strategy i like strategy fighting games good job by the way this is a good review nice game my friend nerfgun_bro likes the game to no the loves it keep up the good work and give more ruby's to players it feels like pay to win game don't make it pay to win your game will not do well in the future but keep up the good work i like your game from and by Sabastian see ya

289,Pokemonstone
290,Fun time killer; would be better on mobile.
291,"It's pretty much what you would expect. Pretty fun. Pay to win. charge you money for each chapter of the campaign plus all skins, etc."
292,"Fun game with fast paced combat.
Matches tend to last 1-5min so its ideal for people who wanna jump in for some quick games."
293,"Was fun for a few games, and then it just wasn't..
Not a game to play serious, just a game to play when you have nothing better to do.
PVP matchmaking is a mess, win or lose it's always a stomp, it's never really balanced and fun.
Needs a fun CPU mode then it could be worth playing, but until then it's a big nope from me."
294,"What Single player does this have?
I did the tutorial after that it's just online battles
which i lose easily due to an obvious imbalance in the games match making process

Total waste of time nothing is offline no single player and no balance in field of play

Just more cash con online pay to win bullshit

Verdict 0/10 = Instant removal from account"
295,Very cool wee game a mix of hearth stone and pokemon
296,"Ive played this game on xbox for over 100 hours and on pc for 12, the first disappointment is that you cant share accounts from console to pc, the cards you get at the beginning of the game are what you will carry for TOO long and they're only good up until late gold! Matchmaking isnt a thing, you constantly get a partner who has too many high cost cards or low cost cards which arent good, not to mention the constant DC's from your ""partners."" The tokens arent worth it since you'll get the same garbage cards over and over so you have to spend money for a chance to get decent cards from the store which also seem to change on the constant so the card you thought was good most likely will be nerfed to the ground only for a card that shouldnt be strong to get a godly buff. Not worth it,"
297,awesome
298,It's mostly based on luck and it often shoves in-game purchases in your face.
299,game card gud
300,"An enjoyable card game with some compelling strategy.  Fun cards, cool spell effects, and a Jack-In-The-Box minion.  What more could one ask for?  Oh?  It's free?  Even better!"
301,trash
302,"Its a fun and chill game, you can easy get hooked if you have a friend that you can play with."
303,10/10
304,Fairly simple but higher level starts requiring strategy against the real people. It's a good but quick transition.
305,"Very funny, fast pace game. No steep entry difficulty. Dialogues are hilarious. playing as a team is very engaging and remove completely the gameplay limitation of solo-play. You can win or lose, both cases you are having some fun. Suggested for everyone."
306,gg
307,Pay to win like every other piece of shit on here. Don't bother downloading to save the frustration of losing every game in 10 seconds.
308,Start mashing the buttons do something
309,"Minion masters used to be awesome but now with the latest patch they made the graphics a horrible blurry mess of low contrast with a way too high number of effects applied on what were previously good 3D models, textures etc. Even after adjusting graphics settings it remains a mess. So much so that I have to stop playing until they fix it. Don't fix what ain't broken! There is a discussion topic here about it that the devs seem to ignore.

I will update this review into a positive one if they fix the new issue that broke the game."
310,Fun game!  Sort of like the pc version of clash royale.  I wish more people played the game and more modes were added but I still really enjoy it.
311,Muy entretenido para ser FTP
312,"It is so by-the-numbers and has very little stuff of its own. It has the ranking tiers from League of Legends and a lot of in and out of the gameplay stuff from Hearthstone. Also the annoying card battle trope that unless you do not make your deck specifically to counter certain cheap setups (rush spam, minion spam, flier spam), you have lost before the match has started. The only good part is that it is not a laggy Unity game like Hearthstone. All you do is lay down units and repeat. For some reason the game insisted on having to buy the Kaboom Island adventure even though I had its DLC installed and all. I understand it is easier to sell a clone game to the funding investors as you have the sales numbers of that game to use as a prospect. Too bad that kind of content planning creates games that are deja vu and old before they get released. This is soul-crushingly boring."
313,"Player from ""Agressive Russians"" clan won against me. Well, at least they can beat us in video game. lol

Game is okay, it's a clone of mobile clash of whatever... not worth time, really, just as mobile original game."
314,"Fun game, not a long grind to get some cards. Nice graphics."
315,!
316,Imagine Clash of Clans but on PC
317,"Like Clash Royale, but with added complexity and for PC. I like Clash Royale."
318,"Amusing enough. It is pay to win, though. If you are fine with that, have some fun. If not, it is still amusing in small bursts."
319,Yep
320,really fun
321,"Great game, the style is interesting."
322,"I'd categorize this as a ""lunch break"" game. All the fun of deck building and watching hordes of colorful monsters whack each other. Yes it is f2p but the model looks okay."
323,fun game
324,"Fantastic!

I didn't want to play it ant first, and decided to say screw it... and i don't regret it! it's worth for me!"
325,Miniony
326,Good Games
327,"I am playing from loong time ago, and i cant tell you today... YOU MADE A REAL PIECE OF SHIT! Glitches, bugs, every menu stucks on screen, and freezes. And these graphics - resolution is... bloah! You talk about optimization? I can run genshin on our ancient pc, 2gb ddr2 and core 2 duo. This game freezes out there. Here Genshin looks amazing, but this sh1t crashes, and couses glitches. 
Yes, we need g@Yracing technology, we want to see the sunshafts and mirrors of all minions with own shadows in each raindrops when its raining. I want to see the sun, how its shining when i look the particles of bridges.... YES GUYS. IT IMPROVES G@yMING EPERIENCE.... RIDE THE MAINSTREAM TRAIN idiots... xD
"
328,Amazing real time deck building. After 3+ years it does feel that evolves a bit slow but the game is still very enjoyable.
329,"Incredible gameplay, very generous F2P model. Needs bigger playerbase.

A rough gem. Rare and precious, still stuff to iron out.

Heavily recommend."
330,Fun game. Lots of varied and playable strats. Fairly monetized in that you can get all the cards just by playing a lot and they give the new DLCs for free for a short period after release
331,Its a very fun game.
332,"Gentleminions, rise up!"
333,"the amount of cheaters in this game is ridiculous . u wont see them in the lower levels, but often diamond+. If u not diamond and want to get butt fucked by cheaters then go straight into 'draft mode'. where cheaters can simple pick high mana card and dump them on the board like it are 1-mana-cost minions."
334,I identify as puff
335,"Pretty good so far, enjoyable and strategic, plus a match doesn't really alst longer then like 5 minutes"
336,
337,Nice game.

340,Just digging the game so far
341,Game is fun
342,nice quick fun game
343,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
344,ITS GOOD
345,"Casual, bite-sized matches, easy to pick-up, forseeable mastery-driven domination."
346,"It might look like that i'm judging this game on its cover, but hear me out. 
This game suck."
347,fast fun
348,bib fite so fun play dayly bases
349,"so basically, i enjoy this game, its a fun game, about monsters battling for sport, i don't have many complaints other than some things
1. the daily chest system (aka the thing that gets you progress in the pass) is limited to three per day, which limits the progress per day to nine wins, other than that you have no other insentive
2.the slow gold, each game, even with the premium DLC, its slow at the least, way to many games are needed to get a tower token(aka how you get new cards)
3.if you want a hero for free, prepare to grind for tower tokens and hope to RNGesus for supremes or legendarys,  because those are the only two card types that provide a decent amount of crafting shards
and then the rubies, which make the hero's overpriced aswell, so grind, or pay a pretty scam like price for the hero you want

other than these complaints, i have had a rather enjoyable expereince with the game, and found the hard to make decks enjoyable, and the sastisfaction of finally making a good deck, is great, and the fact that you can always improve on your deck, your placements, and your strats are great, this game is great. 7/10
none of the flaws make the game less fun, i just want to stop hoarding my crafting shards."
350,"A tactical game for the simple minded.

When I first started playing it was actually a pretty decent game but they keep adding more and more cards but that isn't the problem, the problem is that every card they bring out is more powerful than the previous card they've brought out so basically made it pay to win. Its full of bots. It doesn't take much skill or tactics to play. I wouldn't waste your time."
351,"This game is going down hill fast I use to love this game. However recently its hard for pay to win. Cause you will keep getting the same items over and over again forcing you to pay money to get the cards you need. Also the game modes like Advantures is a damn joke and half. Easy mode plays like hell. You litreally will get walled off from winning every round. Then they want you to pay for the others to unlock them its. The fact they want you to pay for everything and they don't even try to balance out everything. Easy mode should nobe played like hell mode. I now only play this game when i am bored but honestly Id go with another game that actually lets you have fun. 

FYI game creators if you make the game adventure free hard to play no ones gonna wanna put money in the adventures to play the other ones. Also stop walling people off from winning not everyone wants to dump money in a game you call free."
352,IF  YOU LOSE UR GAY
353,"Is very fun, would recommend."
354,"been coming back for years to play a few games a night, easy to learn the cards and their abilities with plenty of powerful and interesting cards/spells. Fun casual competitive game and fun to play multiplayer"
355,I love this game!  It becomes addicting
356,I do enjoy the game at times.
357,fun
358,You're only as good as your last haircut.
359,Endless fun. The devs are really good too by updating the game every season. Although the different modes can be improved the basic game is just endless fun.
360, fun
361,It is fun
362,"Heed my warning! Stay away from this game its not worth wasting time on :/
Only reason i played so long was the community who try make up for the Devs lack of competence and prospect of Minion Masters 2.0. 
Then they announced MM 2.0 was no longer happening, the community/player-base has dwindled so thankfully i came to the realisation it was no longer worth playing.

Main Cons  ~ Shop is awful don't waste your money on overpriced packs
                   ~ Bot games until Master rank, then really long queues vs same people if you make it past Grand master.
                   ~ Guild Conquest mode is boring and repetitive, lacks actual social interaction. (Was part of the top guild who always gets 1st place reward... no real sense of competition)

363,"good game, but I think change the view from up when battle will be better"
364,"call back similar to duel links
"
365,"This game is entertaining and unlike other card games, generally not pay to win.  If you play consistently you will get plenty of rewards.  Games take 2-5 minutes and are fast paced."
366,This is as if Hearthstone had movable minions like YuGiOh
367,"It's one of those games where you get lulled into false progression. You think you're leveling and upgrading your stuff, only to face opponents that basically counter it. That, plus constant error messages when you try to get into a game, makes this game very unappealing to me."
368,Great time waster! Fast paced.
369,"it's basically real action tft hearthstone. addictive and fun. you get handed so many packs for free and i havent spent a cent and im doing pretty good. good combos.



100 hours on xbox wish it was X-platform prog"
370,ok
371,Good
372,nice one
373,This game is honestly really fun once you get the hang of it!
374,nice game
375,lots of fun. team battle is my all time favorite.
376,"I've waited until I logged 100 hours on this game before posting a review.

It's a good take on the genre and a great casual game. Easy to pick up. Each game lasts a few minutes.
At the core it is still a collectible card game, with some strategy on how you construct your deck based on the cards you have and then pilot the deck. Don't feel obligated to sign up for newsletters for gifts, you don't have to.

Good game to play as a free game? Absolutely. If you like the gameplay and want to spend some cash to support the Devs, then I would recommend you read some guides on where to get the most bang for buck. Otherwise, it is perfectly good as a quick game in between daily life stuff or more serious games.
"
377,"Quite gripping, fast and a great tactical game."
378,Fun little yugioh like card game with armies.... not to many fun Co-Op games nowadays but this is one of them
379,Dig it
380,"Great game to play something quick and fun, plus it is replayable."
381,Been playing this game for couple months and overall its great. Wish it was a bit faster for free to play to unlock the cards and minions. I've ranked quite quickly but am lacking some good cards I fight against a lot. But either way this game is great and 10/10 if your into battle type games. ( I'm coming from a mobile clash royale games)

💋🤘🚬"
384,plus for minions!!!
385,"I am surprised this game is not more popular than it is. It is well balanced, a lot of fun and there are thousands of ways to build decks. Team battles are amazing! Come play! :)"
386,"It's a fine enough card battler. This game type (I first encountered it in Clash Royale, but it's been all over, including a minigame in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part II) has been around long enough that the basic setup is perfectly polished, and this one isn't trying anything wild. It isn't too obnoxious on the pay-to-play, either. For free, it's quite worth the price."
387,"With every update it decreases the play value. They have to make major changes to everything that was just put into the game. It's like they don't even test them against what is already in the game. Making it much too over powered for anything to be countered or such. Other than that, if they stop adding things that make the game too unfair than fix fix things some time later it's a fun game."
388,PRETTYYYY GOOOOOD :D
389,Sh*t goes hard. Enjoying it very much.
390,LOVE IT CUZ
391,"It's fun, it's free and it's catered to the strategic minded gamer. If you're into games like Chess, Shadowverse or any type of TBS tactics game this is something you're going to enjoy.  This is a decent game with a small playerbase but it has potential to be something fantastic in the future so I am giving it a 7/10."
392,Reccommended.
393,i have one hand and can play the game and its so fun!!!!!!
394,-
395,"Your game is so rigged, firstly pay to play, secondly if you are winning with the minions, they simply just shoot your base with spells and blow you up, this is what it becomes, the more money you spend on this game, the more spells you get, then you dont need minions to kill your opponents, the most sly and disgusting way of building a game - Beta Dwarf, NEVER GOING TO SUPPORT SUCH SAVAGE AND GREEDY WORSE THAN EA TACTICS!!!! DONT SUPPORT THESE MUPPETS"
396,Starts off great but eventually becomes very cheesy in higher ranked games.
397,I LOVE THIS GAME ITS GREAT ITS ONE OF THE BEST CARD GAMES I HAVE PLAYED
398,good game
399,Fun game with friends
400,"They have a zerg problem and it seriously needs fixed. Here's the problem with most large units, they are SINGLE TARGET. Meaning you drop a giant golem who attacks slow and he has to whack away at 10 small units, when really his one hit should swipe 10 shit units away in 1 go. But no...., and what i've read online, watched on youtube, and studied and there's very few ways to counter zerg decks. I enjoy the game but my god its annoying when everyone plays the same deck because they know it can't be stopped. Buff the large 7-10 cost units ffs"
401,Neat!
402,Has the atmosphere of an old Warcraft 3 custom game. The deck-building is fun and the game-play is addicting.
403,niggers
404,really fun and quick w.out money investment
405,if you ask me it sucks
406,"This game is almost criminally underrated. I hope when the mobile version comes out it gains popularity / traction, it's a million times better than the crappy clash of clans version."
407,"The game is a fun minion pvp game but what I really dislike about the game is that some of the challanges even on normal mode are strait up broken! even the the easier ones on normal arnt forgiving but hardest ones arnt balanced at all! and are almost impossible and are quite possibly the hardest challange in a vidoe game ive seen, for example the last instance for chapter 3 of uprising I cannot complete on normal despite 15 tries and trying everything I can think off, the lack of ballance for whats meant to be a normal challange is a silly mistake for a developer"
408,It is too bad they canned Forced Showdown for this which is a vastly superior game from them. While this is an entertaining game for a short while it gets boring on the long run.
409,very epic
410,Good game and really fun it keeps you hooked from the ranked system and the cool cards you can collect
411,"Fun game. Get a decent amount of stuff as a free player, doesn't feel pay to win. Matches are fairly quick but keep you making decisions the whole time. Decent variety of units, more would be better though but more is  better most of the time ;) 2v2 is also fun."
412,Good game but very toxic community. Super free to play friendly which is great but I tend to buy the battle pass to support the devs.
413,"PAY TO WIN, CHALLENGES ARE IMPOSSIBLE AND ALSO COST MONEY TO EVEN DO. WHEN YOU PAY YOU CANTWIN ANYWAY EZ MONEY GRAB, SHIT GAME, SHIT PEOPLE. JUST SHIT SAVE YOURSELF PLAY MY LITTLE PONY OR TETRIS, 10x FUNNER AND CAN ACTUALLY HAVE FUN"
414,"This game was epic when I played it. I haven't played it for a while, however I did hold rank one for a little while when I was playing and yes that's a flex."
415,"The game is great. But the reconnect after disconnecting due to network issues is so bad its basically nonexistent. If you disconnect just for a moment it kicks you out of the game and by the time it loads the main menu and then the game you already lost.

But do try its fun."
416,"Fun game design in principle. Yet constanty disconnected players or being disconnected oneself, terrifying ingame lag plus flabbergasting matchmaking lastly suck any joy out of it."
417,"very fun game but we need more minion with true new style like tank , not same old brand new card like all frost"
418,if you like clash royal you'll like this
419,"A well-balanced, war of attrition. This game offers many different styles that will allow any player to find their desired path to victory. The best part of this game is how quickly you can hop in, play a few matches, and be out for the day. It doesn't require a heavy time investment to stay up on your daily/weekly/monthly challenges."
420,Clash Royale > Minion Masters
421,nice game
422,clash royale upgrade
423,is pretty good
424,Pretty sure my hours speak for themselves
425,"sick
"
426,"I've been playing this game for a long while now, two years at least, and I've enjoyed the trip. It's a free game, that's really quite exquisite. This game is like a few others you may have heard of, similar in style, but the game-play in this is just fantastic, along with the artwork, soundscape and lots of other little bits that make up this fantastic game. 

In terms of being Free-To-Play, I'd certainly agree that it is. While there's things you can buy to boost your collection of cards, nothing you can purchase gives you an unobtainable (without microtransactions) advantage. The game is reasonably balanced (there's always gonna be a few little bits, here and there, especially when they release a new card), and there's a lot of stuff to unlock, and strategies to discover. Often, when they release a new DLC, they put one on sale for free (which is a great way to boost your collection); they also, now, give a free item in the shop daily. 

I used to be rather unstoppable at this game, but I've not played it as much recently due to many reasons, but I still own majority of the cards ;) (221/249, at time of publishing). I've got every achievement, and played almost all of the things the game has to offer at this time, and still am finding new ways to enjoy it.

Although there's always gonna be room for improvement, overall, a great game with still much potential. Oh, but a little warning, you may want to watch out for the [i]sweats 'n' spammers[/i], mostly at higher levels, but most people are generally good-sports."
427,"
Nice game
"
428,I consider there is a place for this game that shines through the spaces .
429,"great game, not pay to win, just have to get gud"
430,fun fast games
431,clash royale pc dank
432,"Minion Masters is simple to learn yet difficult to master, which is one of the reasons it's such a great game to play. Minion Masters is a game that everyone should try at least once, thanks to its thriving and active community and its low cost."
433,"I really enjoy playing this game. However, after every update it seems like the game revamps everything to where what used to be a good combo is terrible and what used to be terrible is good. Other than that, there's a few lagging issues that seem to occur if you play over an hour at a time. All in all, this game is a great alternative to another moba-like game I used to be top in the world at. Props to Minion Masters and its creators. Keep up the good work."
434,Great game. It's Free
435,this game is like clash royale but sideways
436,"Playing it often, simple yet fun game. Never paid once."
437,"Great free to play, it is possible to grind out everything, with the free hero rotation and conquest cards you don't need to pay to win."
438,Fun game to do for a while.
439,"I enjoy playing this game. It is definitely a fun take on the genre. Granted it's not the first game of its type, but it does what it does pretty well."

444,"very fun. high speed fusion of moba, tower defense and card game"
445,"Strangly fun to play, thought first it was shit but damn. i was WRONG"
446,Love this game. Have a ton of hours on xbox and it still feels good on pc.
447,no
448,fun
449,"easy game to pick up , when you have a few mins to spare, no obligation to buy anything, i have not bought a thing, i liken it to chess with adrenaline rush, good for a gamer whose life can be interrupted"
450,GG
451,Very fun! VERY Good for a free game
452,"the bow guy is lame, he can shoot across the entire board. I guess that means pick him or lose."
453,"Probably the best TIME WASTER game I've played
5 minutes here 10 there its great,  I'll do it forever
are there a few areas that could be improved - yes, but it would turn into a complicated game that requires too much time

I love logging on at the same time as my friend and doing co-op
I love the simplicity (just point and click/drag)
I love being able to freely try all the cards (every week try a few more)
I love no pressure to spend"
454,"Easy too learn. Supported cards. Recommended by friends. Great game. Awesome effects, great audio, and nice graphics. Currently nothing else has been spent other than the initial game, and it allows me too be competitive. Buying items in game isn't something I really/ enjoy. When someone develops a game, and allows for expansions / squeals, people will purchase those on there own because it's a great game. A good product. Not much into purchase exotic items too be competitive. Thanks for the game."
455,Fun little game
456,great game
457,very good
458,3 years ago i played this game on xbox. My paypal was connected. My son was 4 at the time and bought over 500.00 worth of gems. Microsoft wouldn't refund me or anything. I contacted minion masters on their social media and they refunded me with no hassle. I appreciated that. Long time player. 10/10
459,fun game
460,"Games absolute dog water, get AI most the time and ranked is dead asf complete waste of time and hours do not reccomend"
461,"Not unlike Magic the Gathering this card based game is quite awesome!

Pros: Real time card play producing units in a strategy level on a arena and the most important part is a genuinely amazing co-operative team battles which is not unlike two-headed giant in MTG (Which MTGA is missing) making it highly addictive being able to play a card game with your friend against opponents is a feature sorely lacking in most card games online. Many different factions to collect and play and I enjoy making my decks themed and tribal :)

Cons: None, free to play with the ability to upgrade to a lifetime premium edition and starter army faction packs for new players to collect the army they wish. If I had to give it a con, its a to addictive and a pleasure to spend money on!"
462,"Mobile-game level.
Can be fun.

But the monetization system is such that it targets whales (people that spend huge amounts on money on games to get close to a pay-2-win state), and people with addiction (huge focus on lootboxes, rarity, 100€ packs for lootboxes that can be bought fast, etc). And it's so invasive, I got like 10 pop-ups to sign up for newsletters and buy things and so on. In only 2 and a half hours.

So pretty awful, not worth it, and to avoid if you have addiction / gambling problems.
Else, it can provide a few hours of fun, but that's it for me."
463,"Großartiges Spiel. 

Macht immer wieder Spaß. Kein Pay-2-Win Modell. Ihr könnt euch alles ingame erspielen. Auch das Freischalten eines saisonalen Battle-Pass, ist durch das Erspielen von Rubinen möglich. 

Wenn ihr neu seid, tretet ihr auf den unteren Rängen immer gegen Bots an. Es kommt schnell der Eindruck auf das Game ist leicht .. aber keine Sorge: Das ändert sich ;)"
464,"Greatest game ever
"
465,"i eat ass on the weekends 
i love it"
466,is good
467,"Truly free to play. Has always been awesome, but lately the mana cheats have basicly taken over everything and MM can not be recommended anymore, it was a good run for an excellent title!"
468,"Its like a mobile game but chill for PC. 

Gotta pay some mean dosh to get a chance at good cards, but you dont need to do it.

Its addicting AF, and I already dropped a stack to support devs.

470,its a simple game in my opinion but its not brain numbing.
471,not bad
472,"No option to switch to my xbox account.....Why would anyone want to grind that again. The only fights you're likely to come against are bots as it's always ranked. You even go against them in diamond so that should tell you something.... I honestly can't believe these good reviews as this game is just too greedy, they're most defiantly buying them as this is NOT a good game."
473,Would recommend
474,better clash royale with 2v2
475,"Collect powerful cards, battle with powerful master. Take your deck and prove you are the Minion Master."
476,goo

"
478,yeah its pretty good
479,"This game is really fun, challenging enough to get into but simple enough to just relax and not sweat while playing. Quirky designs, nice card/minions and a hell of a lot of interesting ways to build and play. I dig it."
480,"fun so far, nothing too complicated"
481,Nice game for some quick rounds in between...

483,Its fun
484,"when I have a stat deck,
(does he have all epic cards or what?) and he just kills me with 0 damage on my part, ******

it's either a lack of balance, or pay and win....
in any case so balance the starting deck *****

than something that looks like a hearthstone from Blizzard,
cute, nicely made creatures,
there is a plot, events and other activities,

bad balance ****

by and large, the main disadvantage is the balance,
the rest is quite good

когда у меня статовая колода, 
(а у него все карты эпические или как?) и он убивает меня просто с 0 урона с моей стороны, ******

это либо отсутствие баланса , либо плати и побеждай....
в любом случае так балансить стартовую колоду *****

чем то, похоже на хартстоун от близард,
симпотично, миленько сделаны существа,
присутствуют сюжет, события и остальные активности,

плохой баланс, ****

по большому счету , главный минус это баланс,
остальное вполне хорошо"
485,"I really like this game. 

I used to play magic IRL and heartstone. But this game is more interactive and better balanced in my opinion. You learn fast and it is not pay to win :)"
486,this game is great been playing for 2 years and I am still having fun
487,"It's a better, deeper more f2p friendly clash royale type game. You don't have to level up your cards to be competitive. Metas come and go and they can be good or bad, but the game itself is well structured to allow for fair matches."
488,A card game with extensive deck building and amazing community and developer support. The amount of free in game currency and gifts that are given exceed any game that I have played previously. Couldn't recommend highly enough for casual or competitive players.
489,Minyon Üstadı B)
490,pretty cool
491,"Gameplay is great. Lags and disconnects on console so don't waste your time there. Play only on steam if you want to spend money on it. It's quite addicting once you get a hang of the basic strategy. Hard to master of course which makes the game attractive. Replaying is a bother sometimes unless you have other friends playing it as well. Doing daily quests and going for achievements should past the time. Some of the community though is very toxic for some reason. Personally, I give it a 4/5 overall. Have fun playing and worth the download."
492,"Minion Masters is an exciting game that allows to to have either fast paced or technical PvP that can last for as long as ten minutes. The game itself is the essence of a fantastic strategy card game that doesn't rely on pay to win methods unlike a popular mobile alternative. Great to play with friends.

493,"I have been playing this since it came out and continue to be impressed by the dev team keeping a handle on balance, and adding new content regularly.  There are mechanics that reward constant play, so I find myself logging in every day to win 10 matches or whatever the challenge is.  This means if you're a good player who plays a few minutes a day, you actually don't have to BUY anything; but it's not game breaking if you do since it's all the same cards available to everyone.  They desperately need a new engine, but I think they are working on a remastered version.  I do recommend this game, it has some depth."
494,"This feel like a refreshing and new experience. i only recently started playing, but im sure that i wont be stopping any time soon. i will gladly recommend this game to my friends!"

505,"i FUCKING LOVE minion masters.

This game saved my life.

I am 8.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
506,"Don't get me wrong. The game is fun to play, good looking (even if a lil questionably optimized) and certainly is addictive with its gameplay loop. However, I have too many ""buts"" to give it a pass.
I find it as a major problem that there is no casual game mode. It's all ranked PvP (solo, 2v2 [or 1v3 really] and pre-made 2v2) which naturally at the beginning matches you with new players or bots but this win-streak dream ends quickly and you find yourself in grind hell. Fact that you can encounter bot players even as high as Diamond rank doesn't ease it up that much as you will hit a wall somewhere and will never see anything but meta because, obviously, it's a competitive environment. Thus there is no space to play your Timmy decks, rest from laddering or even do daily quests later on without risking your rank (unless you're done for the season and don't mind descending).
It's not all that terrible though as getting a meta deck is rather simple even for a new player as most of the good cards are commons and Legendaries don't run the show (so unlike in, say, Hearthstone you will not be hard-stuck at rank20 forever). Which means you can grab your desired rank (like for free premium currency reward) if you commit to it but then, again, it's a grind with an actual dead end.

There, of course, are other game modes like Draft but one has to like it. If you didn't like drafting in one card game you will not like it in any other. Mayhem mode is constructed with-a-gimmick, x-win prize based mode. Sounds fun on paper until you realize that EVERYONE tries to maximize the cheese for whatever is the condition of the day. This one however is the one where not having all the cards can hurt a lot. In a way it reminds me of Hearthstone's Tavern Brawl but few liked having to make their own decks for that.

There are solo modes but... Challenges are just a brief collection of easy duels so you can grab 2 achievements and a few Power Tokens (equivalent of card packs). Adventures have to be bought either for gold or premium currency, are very poorly balanced and draft dependent (easy to get obliterated, especially by the end...or at the very start) and also as people report rather buggy (loss of progress, soft locking etc. Although I've been lucky to not encounter any myelf). I thought Hearthstone dungeon-deck kind of adventures were annoying and bad but I've missed them now.

To leave the game modes there are other things that don't sit right with me here: Straight after tutorial I was bombarded with ""flash deals"" to get me to spend money, join places or even different games, sign up to mailing list and a feedback request...Literally like in a mobile game which rubs me the wrong way from the get go. Not that I mind shop deals, a free game has to make a living, but sheesh don't plaster it on my face before I could get into the menu.
Community is a real mixed bag: In-Game and on Steam forums it's as toxic as your regular ranked match of League of Legends, which is not surprising given it's ranked-only game so people are very sweaty; you can find griefers, emote spammers and completely cluless people even in high ranks. However there are nice people on Discord so do join that if you decide to try it out.

It's not that the game is all bad even if I make it sound like it. With ability to meet bots the game does want you to progress despite it being a frustrating grind-fest. With each expansion the DLC can be grabbed for free for limited time (I bet you have some already). Promo codes with goodies. Seasonal events with more goodies. Free twitch rewards nor requiring any subscriptions. Starting hero is strong so you're not screwed from the start, heck as said you can grab a meta deck from leaderboards very quickly. You can earn premium currency from ranking up, random shop freebies, achievements...enough for battle pass or cosmetics. Devs are reachable on their Discord. Achievements are very reasonable, good 100%, just will take a while (for which I'll be sticking around).
It's just that the ability to have fun is limited or sometimes even erased due to being always-ranked so at the end of the day your fun deck will get ruined by all-card-games-staple rush or other aggro decks so there is only so much to do in a season. One may even fear to try a different Master or deck to not lose their efficiency (I sure would rather test something in casual mode first). Adventures are annoying for the most part despite being designed to be replayed...and I wish the bugs weren't so widespread as you will encounter weird card interactions or inconsistent minion targetting which will lose you a clutch match, or even brand new batch of bugs when a new season patch drops. Seen many people struggling with maintaining the connection. Bug reporting section sure is very active and if it's not about actual bugs then it's about recent ""balance"" changes.
It's just all the things keep building up into a bad big picture. At the very least the core is fun and rewards are good. If you don't have ladder anxiety and most importantly won't get competitive addiction or if you have a friend to duo with then you could give it a try."
507,"This is a great game to play with your friends. It’s a game that’s similar to Clash Royale, less pay to win as well."
508,Good gameplay
509,Really Enjoyable and fun game. On first take it seems to lack some tactical depth and somewhat confused about whether it has an unranked option.
510,Copycat of clash royale lawsuite? Think about it the scrats is the goblins and the dragons is the baby dragons the skeletons are just skeletons Bruh
511,ye

Really nice game and chill to play. coop is amazing :)"
513,"I played just a little bit that game since December 2018. 
It's good, great arm wrestling gameplay, all about counter and placement to take advantage of the opponent.

One of the best free to play model I seen :
Free stuff in daily rotation shop. DLC for free on release for a week.

After 2k hours played I decide to support the devs and buy the prenium upgrade as a tips and so review the game.
I discover the studio with FORCED: Slightly Better Edition, a nice puzzle, RPG and co-operative title. I invite everyone who has friend to try it as well."

554,"The developers have no idea what a beautiful female body is.

The game has a bunch of tall female characters with thin long legs.

But there are no shortstack females.

But seriously, the main disadvantage of this game is old good pay to win style. Opponents will destroy you with decks containing 2-3 legendary cards. Each legendary card costs 2000 shards (which is a lot and you will farm them for a very long time)."

572,"It’s a quite decent, casual, deck building, minion battler. It’s basically like the Clash Royale mobile game but with more depth. It’s nice to have something like this for PC even though it plays like it’s made for mobile (Steam Deck has entered the chat).

Over 240 cards, lots of deck building potential. You can get basically all the resources necessary through free means, but you may want to spend some money if you want to get certain cards faster. At lower ranks you are playing against bots. Real players are in diamond, where you will most likely get whooped unless you have a proper deck. Around 1,000 daily players which is not bad at all."
573,"Been playing since beta. Has only gotten better since ive last played. Great to see! You will enjoy thing game if you like summoning waves of creeps that fight each other while also having a ""summoner"" who has traits on their own. Very fun and addicting. They also have a season pass with plenty of free rewards thrown at you."

601,"Interesting game that you can play solo or with others. Rewarding leveling system, cool UI and fairly easy to navigate, game itself has a competitive side, so you can grind a lot in order to reach the top medals. 
It comes with Steam achievements that are fun and kind of easy to do. 
Battle pass every month where you can obtain new cards/minions to empower your deck. 
Read Steam guids if you want to build truly competitive deck that is in the current meta. 
Other than that, its good for a few games per day during your coffee time."
602,sweet game
603,"Addictive fun that comes with a ""pay to progress (faster)"" system. If you don't spend money on this game than you reach your progress ceiling very easy, very fast. 
You need to have access to all the Masters, to stand a fighting chance and yes you need to pay hefty for that.
You'll need rubies and shards and cards etc to build and buff your arsenal and yes you'll need to pay heft for that as well.
If you choose not to pay then your progress will be hindered. You wil;l unlock cards much more difficult and slower and you Master options will be limited. That will make you lose a lot aof games and remain stuck in a rank for much longer than others that probably have paid what is asked to have all the options available.

It gets a thumbs up from me as a game/concept and mechanics but a major thumbs down because of the greedy money grabbing system."
604,"This is a fun & addicting game, for the most part. i like the quick matches that are designed to not drag on too long, so even in the toughest matches, you're not likely to be in longer than 7 minutes; this makes for quick & entertaining in-n-out gameplay. While it is a free-to-play game, you can participate in Daily & Special Quests, get rewards, and play through their free tier of game-season rewards, some of which are pretty nice.

The downside is that I suspect this game itself cheats/is rigged. I have nothing to prove it except for experiencing too many times to be coincidental:

- Team Matches in which the teammate (likely a BetaDwarf bot player) has a full 10 points to use on playing cards in their hand, and no cards get played, costing me/us the match
- Team matches that are close, but I/we end up winning suddenly get ""mysteriously disconnected""', and the match ends up not being credited as a win. (I've proven this to myself multiple times when I have Daily or Special Quests)
- I've seen other players in the in-game chat chatting about the game being rigged for them (e.g. when playing conquest matches vs, playing non-conquest matches)

I want to give this a thumbs up, because I like the game, but it HAS to be a fair playing field. Because of the internal cheating/game-rigging, I have to give this a thumbs down/1 Star. If the internal cheating/rigging seems to have stopped, I'll change to an enthusiastic Thumbs Up/5 Stars.

BetaDwarf, STOP CHEATING YOUR PLAYER BASE!"

2vs2 team battle is a great way to get into the game toghter with a friend.

612,qwer
613,Pretty Fun! I have only been playing this game for a couple of hours and it is pretty newbie friendly and easy to learn.
614,"Let me preface this by saying I actually enjoy this game. The idea is good, it's fun, has coop, and no two games feel the same.
Here's the bad:
- The devs don't fix anything of significance and from a player standpoint appear incompetent or uncaring.
- Balance is somewhat of a mess, this is the only thing they appear to be really working on. 
- It's riddled with bugs. How bad is it? Well let's just say the reporting bugs system in game will bug out and not work 90% or more of the time. When the bug reporting system in a game is bugged, you know the devs aren't even trying to acknowledge their player base.
- Some systems are just bad. Enjoying team matches? You won't when teammates disconnect on you 30% of the time at the start of them game. Hope you like 2v1s! No system of preventing you from being penalized for it. Enjoy!"
615,"Insanely buggy, it's okay when you are just playing amatuerly but anything where you need to be more precise and accurate is total BS. I also can't buy any of the adventures I saved up for because there's a bug. I can't even report these bugs because their reporting system has a bug and doesn't work either. There are also a couple cards that you see everyone use because they are way too overpowered and completely unbalance the game. Also don't bother doing teams because if someone gets dropped from the game or leaves early, which happens often, you are stuck defending yourself against 2 people with 0% chance of winning. I would love to see this game do well but it seems like the developers don't really care so I can't recommend it right now."
616,Clash royale but worse
617,tcg + 1v1 MOBA. very nice
618,"good
"
619,"Really fun! Been enjoying it so far, I love card games :D"
620,Fun Fast Free
621,"Easy to learn, fun to play"
622,"Go in this game, make sure your teammate loses, make sure to troll everone and make everyone waste their time. 

The devs don't care. You're not gonna get banned. Ruined the game for me."
623,Live the game expecially team matches. Has really good cards and is a fun experience in general. Kinda clash of clan based game.
624,good
625,.
626,dope game
627,"Don't bother with this game. It's only good for a few hours of fun, if that. After about 6-7 hours, you'll run out of resource rewards and be stuck wondering how to build your deck further without spending real world money. Gold comes in slowly, but gold is only really useful for power tokens or whatever they are, and like 75% of the time you spin the wheel you just get a card you already have. Crafting is a thing, but the game is criminally stingy with the shards resource you need to craft new cards. 

There is not enough content here to justify spending actual money on anything. There are something like 250 cards, and only a handful of Masters. If you do spend actual money, you'll just stomp everyone who didn't. That's not a fun dynamic, but I guess some people enjoy winning due to unfair advantage, so if that's your bag have at it. 

This game feels empty. It came across as a flimsy excuse to bilk children out of money. There's the bare minimum of dopamine-inducing gameplay here to keep a kid distracted, and all manner of not-so-subtle psychological manipulations to nudge people towards spending money in the shop. The game's overall aesthetic is kind of unappealing, cartoonish in a bad way, and most of the models are evocative of better games. Not a single new idea here, pretty much every character, unit, and mechanic is straight up lifted from some other superior game. Some of the features feel like tacked on afterthoughts. There was something called ""Challenges"" that seemed like it might be fun, and I beat all of them in about 10 minutes with my crappy free-to-play garbage tier deck, some of which were labelled ""expert difficulty."" 

I made it to Gold league before I got bored. I don't know how much further I could go without spending money, but I assume I'd have hit a wall soon, because the only games I lost were those to players who had themed combo decks with multiple legendaries. That said, this game is so easy and simple as to feel like it was made for babies, and that kind of makes me angry given how hard it pushes players towards spending money. It certainly felt like I was playing against mostly children given how easily I obtained 40+ wins in ranked play. Why can't a developer just make a great game that they want people to enjoy playing? I really don't appreciate the predatory nature of these pay-to-win ""free"" games."
628,:) YYYYYYeeeesssssss
629,Very Good Game !
630,cute game monsters and characters. pretty simple and good for a small break time
631,Game is P2W
632,"It's fun, except for three things:

1- whenever my level points reached around 90% or above, the game algorithm/mechanism will make sure that my next 3 to 5 opponents will get more xp and stronger cards no matter what. 

2- there is no way to control cards deployment. if it's possible, the game will be so much fun.

3- it's not fair to not be able to get seasonal cards.

EDIT: 

I unlocked the fallen dragon, and played match after match after match and still not showing at all. what the hell?

and before that I unlocked the other dragon but the defrost ruin the experience for me, I wish I can refund my gems. or if there is a training mode to try them before unlock them.

really annoying. :steamfacepalm:"
633,Very fun card style game with you cards battling it out. Very easy to unlock good cards as you play and it does not take a powerful system to play. A toaster could run it.
634,very polished!!
635,fun game
636,I love this game. It seems so simple at first but there are so many different strategies for winning. The matches are quick and it's the most fun when you team up with a friend in the 2v2 matches. The community is great and the rewards are plentiful.
637,Good Game.
638,"I 4,732 hrs like this game and I'll probably 4,732 hrs more like it one day.
It's a great strategy game.  There is deck building, timing, placement, and more to the strategy aspect.  
It's great if you just want to get in a quick match.  Matches seem to typically last around 2 to 8 minutes.  
And after you've got the hang of it, it's easy to play it while watching movies, television, or whatever.
Like I said, I like it.  Thumbs Up."
639,fun
640,good
641,"Fun, f2p"
642,Dopamine hhh
643,pc version of clash royale. obvious pay to win factors but it's still pretty fun
644,Help
645,Best game ever!
646,Simple and easy to play.
647,idk how to emphasize how bad this game is.... Hope this reaches you well... <3
648,Lowcost minions go brrrrrrr
649,"I mean its absolutely great when your playing with new people who arnt, but after 5 hours in when your now fighting people who all have full legendaries thats completely unbalanced, it starts sucking.

Example, o cool a mayhem mode, normal mode with a fun twist, whats it this time? ooo a burning bridge that gives bonus exp should be fun!, o nope persons using muliple of a cheapmana  cap both bridges card, so for almost no mana gets it instantly... I look it up LEGENDARY! wooow 2k cost to get the card! great i think i get what 15 gems a match? whatever, ok hes prolly the only one cheesing this... next round nope this guy has a person who is immune to dmg unless attacking, walks right over it no dmg.  ahh ok.

But it starts happening after your sucked in, new players who neither are sporting broken cards its good, but by now, even if they ARNT paying money for it, its been around long enough that even casuals have legendaries. 

Also, a lot of cards are unknown to new people, a few matches i lose simply because i have no idea what a card is, o this person FEARS units when he kills them, would have great not to try swarming the big guy!  Which itself would be annoying, but when i have cards that create random NEW cards, and the card description doesnt tell me at all what the effect does just that it has it, it sucks.

IDK it has just enough strategy to make you think YOU can win this is you are clever enough, then you just get infuriating spamm tactics with legendaries.

PS solo has a few things to do you can blow through in an hour, so PvP is the only real way to play."
650,"You need a good strategical mind and minion card build. That should be suffice. It is pay to win games if you want a stronger and rare minion card, however it is manageable since other low common card can be use to counter the rare.

I am enjoy team battle since you can see variety of strategy and cards. Good for casual and leisure player."
651,"Minion Masters is very simple, fun and addictive. Once you start playing it is difficult to stop :)"
652,good game
653,fun to mess around with
654,Great fun and a refreshing take on a popular game type
655,good game yeyye download uhu uhu
656,is gud
657,great game to play with friends.
658,Game is pretty dank
659,"It's good, check it out.

It's Clash Royale meets MOBA. Fun stuff, if you're into this type of game.
"
660,Pretty fun so far!
661,ye
662,"Game's not fun anymore :(
Edit:
A great core gameplay loop, unfortunately ruined by years worth of balance issues and directionless updates."
663,just another game to get on my nerves
664,"Surprisingly fun game, but it is not so much fun for me in 1v1 mode, especially single player. It is slow paced strategy where you place your minions on your side of arena, by slow I mean you have time to think and place your own units to counter. You have to wait to recharge your card costs and your hero who is defending is also levelling up. You can create a nice synergy between your hero abilities and your minions, even between them. There is a huge pool of them to mix and max. The goal is to destroy enemy tower which needs just a few hordes of waves to destroy so while the game (units) is rather slow it ends within a few minutes.
I enjoy 2v2 much, it has some ranked system and the tutorial achievements taught me well about how the game works. There were some challenges against AI which were in fact pretty easy to beat but good for practicing.
I find this game very easy, I keep winning against other players in Silver league. I see this does not have hardcore community in the low leagues which may be very good point for newcomers to dive into this."
665,fun and easy to play
666,"Big Brain Fun, Good Devs"
667,"
[h1] I do only recommend this game if you are not going to spend money on it.
[/h1] 


The gameplay is short and enjoyable matches, yet not fast-paced in nature.
There are several adventures available to play versus AI, too.

There are synergetic combos and good cards even among the common cards, so building a deck that works out  can be done early.

[b]There are also several bonus codes that can be looked up online for extra cards, i strongly recommend doing this. 
[/b]

All of the rarest cards, the legndary category, are pretty much indispensable for building a full deck.

The grind to get such cards can be annoyingly hard. 

As for [h1]balance[/h1]


Its good enough.

The Developers are doing mostly good changes to balance cards, yet there are clear ""meta"" cards that are the superior choice.
You can either build your deck with meta stuff or win on your own.






[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Gameplay is good.
[b]Do not spend your money in this game. Buy a happy meal or other foodstuffs instead. [/b]

Game description key-points: A pleasant and good looking card game! Must have for fun!

Overview:
My first though was: a silly mobile game with p2w.

Plays very well as F2P !
looks much better and pleasant than a table game!
with a simplistic concept, it`s easy to understand and offers a lot to learn and discover.
245 cards allows to create flexible decks with the random draws it might never get boring!

Good concept and is genuinely a good game with strong potential.

As for the beginner, with no knowledge on how to match cards - it looked balanced.
Quite often on the edge of a WIN/LOSS"
670,It's aight
671,"Very Polished and fun game, Have little game time in it so far but it has been enjoyable. I expect it will struggle with METAs if you play too long or go to high ranks, and the games will be rock paper scissors or luck based but I have not reached that point yet.
Thus far the game is polished, simple and fun."
672,I will promote Minion Masters in my twitch content
673,e
674,addicting game! Very fun
675,surprisingly fun game!
676,"Great game. Played only one game but understand how this game works. If you've played Warcraft 3 and enjoyed maps like raccoon wars and other similar custom maps you'll like this game.

A solid 6.7/10"
677,It's a Fun game
678,Nice game to play little matches with nice people.
679,It honestly feels like paladins but with cards

682,"good job guys, keep up"
683,yes
684,The game is fun to play with your kid!
685,like
686,Nice
687,easy to start
688,"Yeah, fun. Real time stategy TCG in a nutshell."
689,"Fun so far, it seems to be a nice little deck-building game.  Not too simple, not overly convoluted, nice casual fun.  New cards come in at a decent rate and they aren't stingy on the number of decks you can build without purchasing of more.    

Visually it's a decent looking game in a stylised way but some of the avatar animations are pretty janky.  Music and sound are pleasant but a bit repetitive, but not to the point of getting on your nerves.  None of it is going to grate on most people for the long haul.

That right there is probably the game's main problem.  The game is a bit at war with its monetisation in that it seems to want to be a casual deck builder but it also wants us to be hardcore players of that shallow but fun content and spend money at every turn.  What will grate on many is that the monetisation tries to club players with FOMO at every turn and, even for a F2P game, it's kind of over the top. Multiple types of timed content, limited-time ""once only"" offers of purchases in the store, limited-time offers/discounts on the main screen, it's all a bit shonky.

I think realistic expectations will help people enjoy the game and I'm certainly going to have fun with it in the short term.  I will certainly spend a bit of money on it but I have set myself a limit of $40 (US currency, not my native dollarydoos) because, going with the theme of being realistic, it's a $40 game at most.  When the novelty wears off I'll just walk away.

I can't help but think that this game would have more long-term appeal if the account upgrades and DLC were simply more realistically priced.

Still, I'm having fun so...  Yeah, give it a whirl."

727,"I love this game.

But the constant Error messages that kick you out from games to the main menu are unbearable.
It automatically reconnects you to the game, but if you have to be AFK for 30 seconds in a 4 minute match you might as well just give up instantly.
I am currently in Master 5, but how am i supposed to get a better rank if i have to start every 3rd game with a massive disadvantage?
It has been this way for months now. Fix the game already."
728,funny game
729,good game clash royale 2
730,Very fun and easy to hop in and do few games :). That few may turn in to many :D
731,"Better version of clash royale
"
732,"You can play this game without spending anything but after playing for about 4 hours i felt like it deserved $20 for the premium upgrades. As far as i can tell its not pay to win i have managed to hit Gold 5 in ranked without spending more then the 20 dollars and i am not using any of the paid units to do it. The game plays like a unit rush / tower defense / minor deck building based on the units and spells you are awarded as you play. This is a live action game where you can face computers or real life people and even team up with friends in tag team battles. Mana goes up steadily as you decide what minions to spawn and where (very important) max mana 10 mana costs with cards i have used range from 3 to 10 so the whole time you are making choices to counter the units your adversary is playing at the same time you do.  You have a champion that stays mounted at base and gains levels based on the stages you currently hold by sending creatures from one side to the other during combat ( only ground units can activate the zone to your control) and once your champion's health has reached 0 or the enemy's champion has reached 0 there decides the victor!

ALL in ALL its free until you will want to spend money you can play for 5 minutes or hours match's only last about 3 - 6 minutes! I highly recommend giving it a go!"
733,"Great game, enjoy it so far"
734,its good
735,Nice relaxing quick games
736,Great Game
737,"Good game, Just suggest that there be more map variations like maybe a map with one bridge, another map with three bridges, perhaps a map with a lake in the middle to slow the movement down. Perhaps a lava map with ground units taking damage over time. Forest map with a fog of war and obsacles all over. Cmon give some variations. Good game so far though creators can add some creativity tho."
738,i never met a gorgeous game before this
739,"This game takes me back to Warcraft Castle rush or what ever it was called.

Its also seems pretty fair. rank wise. I am only thinking further up it's gonna be a pay to win game.

756,"Fun game so far. 

It incorporates multiple existing elements from other games but seems to be self aware.

With limited experience it remains to be seen how balanced the game really is in terms of rarity and cost to power ratio as we can see in already existing games of this kind.

Hopefully the gap between skill and wallet is narrow.

EDIT: Gap between skill and wallet was wide"

762,stratagy is your best friend in this game... and building your deck to best suit each fight... power and fun... battle... team up is cool when its not glitching out and disconnecting you...  alot of Freebie Codes... and you get boxes to lvl you thru the game... but can also pay if you like to get more... a good bit of DLC if you want to pay for them all...

804,"Though I've played this game for 3 years now, I do not recommend it anymore. Same day the same problem. My team holds the bridges 80% of the game and the opponents  8 of 10 games make mana frenzy first, without any other mana income units (shrine, sniper, puff...). It became outrageous. The game was fine untill they've changed something, something that cant be understood. It is either a bug, either something else.  I'm out. It was nice while it lasted."
805,fun balanced game!
806,"For a small development team they pack a big punch. This game continues to impress! With a battle field where anything goes, as long as there is a card for it, it's always a blast. Watching Dragons fight Futuristic battle tanks and skeleton fight the hordes of Scrats. I would recommend it through and through."

811,"Well I've been a big fan of this game for years and just realised I never wrote a review for it. So just want to say this is one of the most fun free to play games out there. Sure there is DLC for it but you don't need it. After you get into the game you'll start to see so many different strategies that can be used that it forever keeps it interesting. The game is updated regularly with seasons and I usually play dual (2v2) matches as I find them more fun. However the 1v1 matches are great too. I've spent well over 1200 hours playing this game and I still love it. My top game played on steam, what more can I say."
812,"I luv this lil game, he is fun n good, best point he is without charge, this game surely better w a friend heh. I recommend te!"
813,"This game is pretty fun and have some original mechanics in it BUT the game is pay to win and become repetitive really quickly. Conclusion? The start is fun but more you play, more you have to pay for have more fun, therefore I don't recommend it (although it is free)."

817,i've only played this briefly but seems like a fun game.
818,I love the game please keep come out with new updates and I keep playing and sometimes buy in-game content thank you for a good game
819,When are devs going to figure out that P2W Microtransaction gacha bullshit is the worst possible mechanic for any game?
820,"First off, don't get me wrong, I love this game, I have well over 2100 hours in it and played long competitively in tournaments. But I just cannot stand behind this mess anymore.

Minion Masters has everything it needs to be a great game, it has an amazing concept and the gameplay is amazing, not even to think about how easy it is to get cards and how non-p2w it is, it really isn't p2w, you will notice that more the better you get. It is genuinely a good game with so much potential. But this also saddens me on how much they just screwed up the game, and that is in balance.

The devs are actively trying to take away any skill from this game, years ago it used to be sucha  enjoyable game, now all you see is ""faction decks"" that look the same or extremely cheesy decks that are just unfun to play against.

They buff and nerf cards based on their winrate, which in some games makes sense, but not always here, as the winrate stats show less how good the card is but how easy it is to win with it.
This is a result of not forcing players to improve but rather making sure that they don't improve and just rely on busted cards. 
Needless to say they buff cards that do not need buffs every season, not slightly, but by a massive amount, turning them into bulldozers that everyone uses in their decks.

One example is the clown-card dragon nest, a card that gets either a buff and becomes cheesy unfun meta or ""too weak"" which still makes it unfun, it's not even funny how often they nerfed or buffed it.
""But why is Dragon Nest that hard to balance"" Because spells are OP, even after the ""big spell nerf"" they are OP, it is beyond easy to get massive value with spells, now add Dragon nest for tons of free value and you end up with cheese. Just let the card die, it's better that way.

They try to make everything ""as easy to play as possible"" meaning that so many of these cards just promote placing them randomly that with an actual tactic, resulting in players just straight up not improving at the game, there's people with hundreds of hours if not thousands that barely play better than some new players.

Faction decks pretty much look all the same, it's really strong cards from a faction, now on top of that they get ""faction buffs"" which makes the already strong decks stupidly busted.

They even managed to ruin flying minions, flying minions used to be great to play, they were essential in a control setting deck and very interactive.
What did they do? They took away their ability to take bridges and make anti air cards weaker.
Now flying is only cheese, ""let's put 7 flying cards into my deck and hope that the opponent player doesn't have enough anti air so I can spam my cards randomly till he dies"".
There is just no use of flying in a proper control setting.

Now what if you don't want to play 1v1 and go to 2v2 randoms.
Well prepare to go bald, because there you will see just how bad players actually are. how stupid and braindead the games are, randoms is not something for the weak willed, as you will go insane with some teammates.

Well what about 2v2 premades, you can have fun there right?
Well have fun waiting 15 min in the queue and then queuing every time into players that spam 5 rammers non stop on your face.

The only good mode at this point is draft, but even that gets boring after a while.

This game turned over the years from a super interactive fun game into deck lottery simulator, technical skill barely matters at this point.

I honestly don't think that this game salvagable anymore, there are so many balance issues it's baffling, these balance issues were built up over years of not thinking stuff through.

I honestly wish instead of buffing anything, they should nerf a lot more than buff. The idea shouldn't be ""this is not performing well because other stuff is outdoing it, let'S buff it"" but rather ""other stuff might be too strong so much that it outdoes alot of other stuff, let's nerf it""
Constantly buffing cards will take away the interactive part more and more.

""Why make a well blanced 10 card deck if you can just use 1 or 2 cards to win the entire game"" - Minion Masters.

So try it if you want to, but I promise you, the higher you climb in ranks, the more unfun it will get, because no matter how good you are, no matter how much you improve. The meta player that is your opponent will beat you no matter what, actually it's not him that beats you, it's his deck that beats you."
821,dommy mommy morellia
822,"Minion Masters is a super fun game that is unfortunately plagued by it's abysmally toxic community. The cards are fun to play around with. The graphics of the game are very silly if you turn on ragdolls, and it's overall really enjoyable. The developers of Minion Masters also show compassion for their game by constantly implementing balance changes, and adding new cards to play with. So it's constantly getting new things to try out.

The only ""thing"" that sucks about Minion Masters is that it's way too easy to be toxic in this game. Don't be surprised if you play random duos, and get spammed with toxic emojis by your teammate just for having a certain kind of deck, or playing certain cards. (There's no option to turn them off or not view them from others). Sure, lots of games have toxic fanbases, but Minion Masters in particular has a terrible one.
You will also often find that people in the global chat are often spouting awful things with no way of turning off the global chat when you open the game.
Minion Masters really needs to work on moderation above anything else.

Overall, Minion Masters is really fun and goofy to play, but if you cannot handle people being awful to you, you should not play this game."
823,good good good good good goood goooooood goooooooooood gooooooooooooooooooooooood
824,"A simple, but deeply strategical game, perfectly balanced battles, astonishing decks and possibilities!
The game is really good and I'm personally waiting for the full game version in Google play :)"
825,I like clash Royale So this Is good game. Yes I have dementia
826,It`s very smart strategy game. You have cards with unique skills. 1 vs 1. Who will use this cards better - win. Also you can play this with your friends 2 vs 2. But graphic design not good. Make HD textures and its will be 5\5. Now 4\5. Recommended.
827,I GOT FU**ING AIDS FROM THIS
828,Game EZ
829,"Has a pretty huge pay-to-win aspect, one of those classic ""you can pay us to win or 'earn it' with 500 hrs of grinding"" type games. Very pretty, simple and fun concept. P2W is cancer though, that's the real price of a poorly made free game."
830,"Seriously. This game could be fun if you could report other players. You get high rank and you have team mates rank dropping who just AFK. its frustrating af. There NEEDS to be a report function to ban these low lifes as it is hard enough as it is versing the same meta over again. I reported this as a bug, then the devs blocked me from reporting anything from that point on. They must be Russian, or just ignorant. The devs are trash, and do not like constructive criticism. If you want to work hard and get high rank, be prepared to spend more hours than you need to due to people pulling you down. Solo is limited to literally 2 meta's."

836,"It's there, but not there."
837,"Great and fun time killer, Just needs a cross platform invite system!!! For that its 9/10 If it had a system to invite pc to console it would be just that much better. It has the capability but it does not support invites or clans."
838,adsaddas
839,"Very fun, very colorful, unique unit"
840,"Worth a try, but don't spend a single cent. These developers are garbage. Horrible changes, pushing microtransactions down your throat, and seemingly having no idea how their game works just makes it not worth spending on.

Simply can't recommend this game. You'll enjoy a few hours then hit a pay wall. It's not worth your time.

Edit:
Sunk deeper into the rabbit hole. Don't do it. The developers put out more unrefined, p2w, and seemingly poorly balanced patches every month. ""Season passes"" are monthly and not season-based, btw."
841,love this card game its a mix between hearth stone and league of legends.  i love it
842,ITS FUCKING GOOD
843,Error code 1-95 i forgot to claim mayhem 1 time and can no longer play mayhem due to a bug that u guys havent fixed for a year. Do better.
844,"good game. cute, but good."
845,"It's a very interesting game that can easily take up tons of your time. The matches and queues are quick, and the game is fun to play.

Would definitely recommend if you like strategy and deck building games."
846,"meh
"
847,"FUN! FUN! FUN! Easy to learn, hard to master."
848,"Would be a good game if the match making was remotely fair, but it feels like I'm just being paired with partners who can't play/opponents who always use the exact same rarest cards. This is the exact reason I stopped playing MTGA, we're just the daily grinds for the people who've been playing forever, or purchase content. 

I'm tired of seeing the word ""Free"" on shit that is conditional. It's not free, we have to endure countless losses just so the privileged can get their dailies. pathetic."
849,10/10

855,fun stuff
856,"Great game! Amazing combination of a card game and real time computer game. Infinite variations with just enough ""luck"" to keep it continually new. This game is addicting. And, with an avg of 5 min long games, you can play 10 or more games in an hour. The cards are wonderfully animated and have so many different pros and cons that its always interesting. Not to mention the diversity of Masters and their unique advantages. Definitely buy this game. You'll thank me when you do :-) Just don't forget to do your chores, or go to work, or get your mom a Mother's Day card ;-)  It's pretty damn fun!"
857,"Light-hearted fun. Sometimes a game will go one-sided within an instant. Hilarious, but could need balancing. Fun mix ups so far."
858,So fun!
859,190€ is not a good deal for DLCs and game can get frustrating.

881,"The slowest, QoL-denying developers if have EVER seen working on a game.
Not even possible to copy, move or delete a deck since i started in 2019.

New cards / expansions regularly. No P2W, you can be Top 100 with no money.
But you need time to grind the cards. Much less rewards nowadays if compared to 2019.

Community reaches from toxic, to meta and smiley spamming, unfriendly folks.
Sadly a small player base, so if you player in higher ranks, you meet the same guys every 3rd to 5th game at least. Still recommended, cant deny 1300h+ hours"
882,This game is awesome!
883,Lovely hurling all in all!

907,just play it
908,i'm out of mana :(
909,Are you tired of Clash Royale? You're in luck. the skill gap here is MUCH higher. nobody disconnects on team battles and griefers are virtually nonexistent.
910,"This is 100%, complete, utter garbage. Riot and Gearbox should jointly sue the pants off these ripoff artists.

Never seen something so pathetic."
911,It's a fun little game and free little game.
912,fun!!
913,Funny :D all need to play this game <3 :D
914,its good and its free
915,Fast and fun and free
916,"Pay 2 win, but still fun and addictive."
917,YES
918,its great if you like this type of game. Build your deck. summon your minions. destroy the enemy tower.
919,clash royale but better :D
920,"The power creep is obvious in this game, 2 v 2 is pretty fun, 1 v 1 can teach you at lot as well but generally speaking just like any other game the power creep is blatantly obvious as many older cards are pretty bad. There's also the issue of mana cost not matching how useful some of the cards are at all, there are some cards that cost more mana than others that perform the exact same task and cycling your deck is generally better than wasting your mana on that card when a lower mana card will achieve the same effect.

Also shielding is 100% broken in this game. You either have damage over time abilities or you are screwed because anything else you could do against the shielding would be countered by the enemy player which should be expected.

IMO I don't think this game is worth it, the balance is bad, spells are honestly too strong ie. a person can literally delete more than twice the spells worth in mana with ease and that isn't very balanced at all among other things.

I'm giving this game a hard pass, you could try it out if you want to and see if you like it."
921,Latest update this game is very broken and unplayable.
922,better than clash royale
923,"kinda pay2win. no good cards, good luck losing to a jimmy who has maxed out n will end u in 3mins."
924,"This game captured my heart and soul.  Then they destroyed 1 cost minions and the ability to use a control based strategy. Then they demolished spell effectiveness. And now it seems littered with bugs where something isn't stunned when it should be or fails to attack the right target.  I probably have hundreds of hours from before it became a steam game, now it's uninstalled... again."
925,Better than Clash Royale.
926,;D
927,Nice
928,"Minion Masters is a fun and easy game. You pick cards, you play cards, you win games. Usually games takes between 2 and 8 minutes, so a couple of them fit into every day."

938,"When you have literally nothing better to do, this is the game to turn to. If you have a friend that has nothing to do as well, make this the game they turn to as well."
939,Fab
940,"Too many people online who are either clueless about what to do (even in Platinum/Diamond Teams) or spamming to oblivion their way to a win due to lots of balance mistakes (In which case being stuck with a team mate as mentioned first basically means a instaloss).

Used to be fun, but as of now I would recommend to stay away especially if you are just beginning."
941,"I love the mechanics of deckbuilding and RTS blended together. The theme of the universe feels odd with regard to each card and world, and there isn't that much synergy between them which feels incongruent. Overall the gameplay is great fun and matchmaking is faster than most games."
942,"I find the game enjoyable, and could even play it on a low budget computer."
943,"Game quits out constantly mid-match, i lose more that way than legitimately. i wouldnt recommend anyone waste their time until they get their sh!t together and fix the servers"

948,"Chat banned me for saying n1gger

Otherwise decent game, but clearly I cannot respect such a spineless company who is hysterically afraid of a silly word."
949,Not Recommended
950,the game is unfair i have seen player plays a multiple cards and the matching is horoble like it is disaster value your time and dont try this it just skip it if you can even after 227 i could not be master.
951,Kind of fun kind of cute! Entertaining.
952,"Since they patched the ""claim all"" button this game is really fun ;)"
953,pog
954,"very epic game.
It's like clash royale but good."
955,nice game
956,"Easy to get into, hard to master. Theres a big selection of cards (roughly 140-170), which is a lot considering you play with only 10 cards total at a time. I REALLY enjoy the fact that it has 1v1 AND 2v2, along with a handful of single player modes that also allow you to earn coins to unlock more cards. Theres plenty of different strategy combos so not every battle will be identical just because your opponent has 1 or 2 similar cards as you. The Queue times are nearly instant, ive only waited 45 seconds one time, and that goes for both 1v1 and 2v2. Rankings a separate from the 2 modes. The Ranks are traditional, bronze 1-5, silver, 1-5, etc. The game has great potential IMO. The matches are quick, no more than 4-5 minutes tops because it starts to increase the amount of mana you get per second so you basically throw down cards as fast as possible. most matches last around 2-3min. Definetly worth checking out considering its FREE."
957,
958,"Matchmaking is pretty much always one sided now, may be deleting soon."
959,Easy to pick up and fun to play with a friend! Dont feel pressured by microtransactions at all

972,Very strategic game super fun with a friend! Can be very intense also.
973,I was Empty Before i played this game now I am whole.
974,"Its a very good but simple card Game and its 4 free. So at all there is not much to say.
I´ve played the the game for quite a while and i like it very much. 

What i would wish from the Game:
3vs3 mode
4vs4 mode 
maybe some new maps ( not only 2 briges and a linear way)
they could add so much fun stuff to make the game even more fun
"
975,Probably my favorite game. I play it a lot.
976,its similar to a game i played in the arcade of star craft 2 and its like a tower defiance combined with rock paper siccors i enjoy it.
977,it's ok

981,good
982,friendly game
983,"Played this game for a long time now. We sure had a lot of fun me and a friend playing this but this is no longer the case. The devs manage to screw this game making it now pay to win. 
Every season there are new units coming that are only available for those who pay monthly. Only after the season they become available to everyone. I was ok with it until they decided to make those units absolutely broken during the first season. Now this game is just about who's paying each month for the new op cards."
984,pretty fun
985,he he haw
986,"Fun, simple, and witty game, does'nt feel pay to win, can't wait for crossplay with xbox so i can play with my friends!"
987,"I had this on my account for a while, and never bothered try it out, now I regreat I hadn't, this is so dam fun, hope they release the mobile version soon!"
988,"I am the most picky gamer in the world. For some reason I got hooked on this from the first time I started playing. It's the perfect game for me. It's also the perfect game for you, if you love...

- Frequent updates
- You believe in fair play for everyone
- Amazing character models and animations
- The ability to always find ways to beat the meta
- Exploring new game universes
- Real time strategy
- Chess (but not as boring as real chess)

After almost 2000 hours of playing this game (February 1st, 2022) I still tell people it's my favourite game ever. I play it so much, half my friends list send me messages such as these when I load up the game: 'MINIIIIOOOON MASTEEERRS' and 'AH, IT'S TIME AGAIN ISN'T IT?' and 'DO YOU EVEN PLAY OTHER GAMES?' -  the answer is no, I do not. Lmao

Fun fact: I spent 0$ on this game and I'm super competitive (mostly play 2v2 random because it is hilarious and a big challenge in higher tiers). I've been working in the blockchain industry for a few years now and see opportunities for Betadwarf to take this game to the next level via NFTs."
989,My room is starting to smell
990,"Total unfair unbalanced game  full of bots  ,every day  over 10 reports  ."
991,"Better than Clash Royale and makes tons of games similar to this look like a Joke
like do you see the NEW DEATH ANIMATIONS ??? 
Damn amazing"
992,"Heck I enjoy this type of game play, the twist on Minions take on the two sided (or 2v2 one) is a nice one I easily got into!"
993,"It's like Chess with moving pieces, real time. Fun!"
994,i approve as a white alpha male just agree plz
995,it ok
996,"In many ways, it's a little rough, but it's a lot of fun to play. It would be ideal if there were no paid items."
997,.
998,It was ok...
999,very good game so far. fun and easy to play. totally recommend it.
1000,"balance team is very clueless, not sure if it even exist in this game, all top players use the same champion and same cards, they keep nerfing whats already bad and it's basically a p2w, the 50+ years old players have all the cards in the game, that you wont be getting by playing for 5 years.
soon a dead game."
1001,"I've loaded this up a few times trying to get into it and I just can't.  You jump into a match, start clicking buttons to spawn different types of units and hope they march forward and eventually win.   I'm sure there are strategies but it just feels like a generic mobile game clone on Steam.

I'm sure there are plenty of ""pay2win"" features that die-hard fans will claim don't exist.  How else would a PvP Only free to install game continue to stay in business if people weren't motivated to spend money to get a competitive edge?"
1002,good game but pay2win
1003,Clash of Clans in free and not pay2win enjoyed it a lot with a certain friend <3
1004,"Cant suggest this Game because it is a extreme Pay to Win at least for new Players!

Each Time you log in, you get a Popup buy this for discount or this for discount. 

Than 2 Options the matchmaking is absolutly broken or it has to do with the PAY TO WIN option when you start playing and get an enemy with a lot of legendary cards in his deck and you get simply anhilated. 

The rewards for playing the game normaly are miniscule you simply cant build a better deck without paying."
1005,Good
1006,really is a good game solid and fun and visuals are on point. just needs a little polish to the characters but other than that this game is deff worth the download!
1007,this game is p cool
1008,Love the game but you guys need to start up some anti cheat cus I have gone up against people summoning a 7 cost into a 10 cost right off the bat
1009,Yes x10000
1010,"Well, Minion Masters won’t cause you a wow effect for a second, won’t make you forget about all the games in the library and bury yourself in it to the state of a zombie, but, which is very surprising, the game is good both in its niche and in terms of general characteristics in general.

With an almost 100% focus on real-time PVP combat, every aspect of the game motivates you to play matches as often as possible to avoid lobby queues.

That is why the battles last for several minutes. And in these few minutes you manage to get a sea of ​​emotions, trying to overcome the enemy. After one fight, I want another one. That the rank system is logically screwed up in order to gradually climb the ladder of professionalism. Every month, the rank is reset and plus a certain portion of experience in order to start not from scratch. In parallel with the ranks, there is also a level system. For getting a new one, we are given all sorts of useful loot.

In Minion Masters, the entire combat system is based on passive control. You choose a card from the deck, put a unit on the field and watch how he goes to rush the enemy using his skills and features. There are a lot of cards and there are relative analogues of each other with minimal differences, and there are also very unusual, unique cards. Accordingly, there is a gradation of the value of the cards. You can get them in the process of leveling the hero, as well as purchase them in the store for local currency, and for donations. It was not difficult for me to collect a pack of various cards and, by brute force in battles, find my ideal composition, which I am unlikely to change soon. Although sometimes I introduce a new card for running.

Another plus in Minion Masters is its simplicity. Simplicity can be traced in all aspects. Intuitive interface, minimum unnecessary information. Even the graphics, pleasing to the eye, look rustic. Why I consider this a plus, because a person who wants to play half an hour in such a game will only need to spend no more than five minutes in the lobby and the same amount of time in battle to master all the mechanics of the game and enjoy it.

With the development of the game, various experimental innovations are added.

There is a 2v2 PVP mode. The mode turned out to be very interesting. I was constantly trying to cover my teammate as my card stack is oriented towards ranged attacks.
There is also a single-player adventure mode in the game. The glade divided by hexagrams is filled with resources and monsters. Sort of like Heroes. To move around, we need food, which we can get in duels, and in the mode itself, you can collect different currencies. Battles can be fought with bots, or you can find an enemy online.
Judging by the number of players in Minion Masters, there are no problems with downtime so far. The developer is trying in every possible way to stimulate the presence of players in the network. Let's just say it was right to move the game's price tag down and give away n copies for free. This filled the game and so far, coupled with the fact that they don’t put a bolt on its completion, it maintains a good atmosphere in it.

Personally, the game went to me, my result:
4/5"
1011,Definitely not P2W.
1012,"Very fun strategic Game.  I hope it continues to keep its charm and strategy as it evolves.  Not many people know about it and may judge it, but it is sooooo goood!"
1013,"As a completionist of minion masters I can say that the game is honestly a ton of fun to play

-_Positives_-
-A large amount of cards with diversity and can make some stupidly overpowered combos.
-Not just a ""Clash Royale ripoff"", the game has a lot more depth thanks to exp and the use of different masters in different decks.
-Available on many platforms.
-When the game gets a new DLC it is free for around a week.
-There is a campaign (adventures) which allows you to unlock very rare cards with little to no experience.
-Despite many people claiming it's pay to win you can unlock everything a paid player has but at a slower rate and if you get paired against a paid player you can still win with enough experience.

-_Negatives_-
-Matchmaking can sometimes be unfair and sometimes pairs gold players with champion players.
-Matchmaking on unpopular gamemodes like Mayhem can take a long time sometimes 8+minutes.
- Constant rebalancing, I know that sounds like a normal thing for games but when you spend ages perfecting a deck and then all of the cards in the deck get changed drastically can sometimes make or break a deck, gives hearthstone vibes
- Blood imps F̴O̸R̸ ̴T̷H̷E̶ ̷L̴O̷V̴E̵ ̵O̸F̴ ̴G̸O̶D̷ ̸R̵E̴M̷O̷V̷E̴ ̸T̸H̵E̴M̷"
1014,"After reaching high ranks, the game no longer finds matches for me, as of writing this review I'm currently 26 minutes into a match search. Taking your money is the only thing that works with this game. Stay clear!!!
"
1015,"When I first played MM I loved it. The concept is so good. One thing I and the community said was the game had so much potential. Unfortunately the devs have done nothing to harness this potential, in fact it feels like the game just gets worse little by little. Will summarise my main gripes

1 - Seasons are a month long. Stupidly short, but hey there is always a paid battle pass available. I pushed hard for one season but realising the time I would have to commit to maintain a high rank every 30 days I shut off.

2 - Patches/balance. When they drop a season patch that is it, aside from a hotfix (almost never for balance just bugs). So if, as happens a lot, there are certain cards/strats that are overwhelmingly strong you get stuck with that for a whole ranked split. Leaving you with the choice to play only the OP strat or the specific counter to it. No fun allowed, only meta

3 - Community engagement, there is none, if there were the issues above would have been addressed 

4 - Bug or feature. So on April 1st of 2021 the devs thought it would be fun to include some apparently obvious April fools jokes in the patch notes. Problem was they weren't obvious. Such is the level of stupidity in some of the changes they had been making the community had no idea what was real or not. Some of the real changes we honestly hoped were a joke. Then you start playing and you aren't sure if something is a bug or deliberate. Often game ruining or strat ruining bugs either not inconvenient ones you can just get round.

Overall what has happened to this game is sad, I would love to be playing and streaming this game as  much as I did in 2020 but alas no. I hope they get it sorted and I can come back down the line and enjoy what is a great concept. For now don't do it, you will be wasting your time. 

"
1016,"OP game! Easy to get into, hard to master. 8.5/10!  My only complaint is that the shop runs on a daily refresh system. You have to wait and hope and pray that the avatar/arena skins that you want comes available. You can't just buy things that you want straight from a shop. A better achievement system would be nice too, the rewards are a bit lacking for completing something like 100 dailies lol."
1017,"best cool game!!! cool things!!!
"
1018,"Minion Masters is awesome no doubt. The reason for the low review is because of the wait times between games. When you get to upper levels you are waiting between 2-3 min between games on solo and and after Master level waiting for a team is a real joke. You are usually lucky to find them. I waited 30 min last night for one game and didn't get anything after that. It sucks to wait for so long. My last grip is that Minion Masters freezes every now and then and when it does you already frustrated because many times you are doing well, but then when you come back from being frozen, you have lost points as well. It sucks.  Don't get me wrong I still play and love it but those things suck!"
1019,Fun fast free.
1020,fun to play for relax!!!
1021,Good fun so far
1022,so far so good....
1023,"it was a very nice free to play game until recently.
nowadays each season starts with premium units that are overpowered until end of the season or even for a seconds season so the players get forced into getting the pass.
getting some passes for free is quite possible, but the overpowered units just damage the balance greatly.
also i think it is a very bad habit to place op units over and over again ... sad but bye bye minion masters."
1024,"GIGANTIC GAME
"
1025,Just extremely enjoyable game. There's no other way to describe it.
1026,So fa so good. I worry about pay to win though. Let's see in a bit. I'll update the review.
1027,"Best card game since first seasons of Hearthstone, discovered by accident on the GeForce Now platform, I have already 20 hours in it :)"
1028,"Generally good. I couldn't play Crash Royal on my computer before, but now i can play something even better!"
1029,"It's fun to play casual.

It's pay to win,  you can buy season pass with legendary cards and other package...
Right now in the season pass a legendary OP Tank... with side cannons who shoots other minions ground and air... 

playerbase around 1000 so yeah..."
1030,"They throw rewards at you like crazy for the first few hours of play, then they just immediately stop. The GACHA gambling card system is trash, and currency comes in at a snails pace. Avoid this game unless you are willing to put quite a bit of money to MAYBE get a chance at building fun decks."
1031,Very good. Extremely addicting.
1032,Get's boring very fast.
1033,"Games plagued with cheaters,another game that relies on scuzzy microtransactions and devs that dont care about their community.Its sad to see a good game fall like this.
Game forces you to play in a ranking system so these cheaters are hurting your rank 
being 10 seconds in and having opponents play several 10 cost minnions is complete bs
report system is also bs.

Games fun to play,feels kinda like the old MTG battlegrounds,but the cheaters ruin the entire point of playing.

1037,"Minion Masters has a relatively straightforward premise for its core mechanic, but it involves a much deeper execution of strategy, timing, and deck building that ultimately makes it fun to play. It's a great game for a quickie. A 10 minute match can leave you feeling satisfied. Progression is fair. Card acquisition/Deck Building works in the player's favor. 

The game is Free to Play. I find that MM does a great job of not becoming a Pay to Win model. 

I see a bright future for this game. Easy to pick up and play. Very hard to master. There is a lot of strategy to be had under the hood.


(Minion Masters offers a ""Premium Upgrade"" for $20. I recommend grabbing this upgrade WHEN IT GOES ON SALE. Personally, I feel that $20 is a steep asking price. I bought the Premium Package during a Steam Summer Sale for a couple dollars. Worth. It.)

More people need to play this game!"
1038,fun
1039,Very fun game!
1040,BEST OF THE BEST
1041,"The game is both very simple and yet very challenging. It offers a good amount of variety of strategy and chill gaming experience at the same time. Free to play with pay to advance faster mechanics. The adventure mode is very tough. You'd recommend if you are looking for a game you can play either ""try hard"" or ""relaxed"" depending on the mood."
1042,good game to play if you have nothing to do and it's free!
1043,Waste of time.
1044,its fun :)
1045,$$$ Powercreep $$$
1046,Fun
1047,"This is a fun little time waster game.  The fact that matches take a few seconds to find and only take 5-10 minutes each means you can jump in and out with no problems.  
There are some insane card combinations  that have destroyed me on a few occasions but, it's  not off-putting as it doesn't happen often.
If you like games that are kind of a combination of hearthstone and a defense game give it a try.  Your download will take longer than your first game and you'll know pretty quick if it's a good fit."
1048,Clajg Royael
1049,"Like clash royale, pretty fun."
1050,Fun
1051,"So come back find out that there so many dlcs that cant play anymore, the giving it free to people for limited time then making it price insanely high puts of people from coming back. Sadly I can't compete anymore so good bye. Oh well liked the game, sadly mankind heart is always on money, they learn hard way when pass from this world capitalism was soul destroying."
1052,EPIC
1053,"fun until you reach diamond or higher, then people will troll and quit early if you aren't playing the meta (in teams mode). with only ~1000 people online at peak, the higher ranks are a small community that probably all know eachother and will throw or wintrade"
1054,"Surprisingly addicting and fun! It has its problems, like groups of friends playing together to force a win or loss.. (your teamate purposefully does not play to allow the other side a free win, etc). But I don't encounter it often enough to ruin the entire experience. Fun graphics, easy to understand game play, and a lot of strat and creativity is encouraged. A good time!"
1055,
1056,Prety  disent card game
1057,Fun game with my gf lol
1058,Fuck this game and its stupid fucking pay to win bullshit. Gives you a fucking blatant advantage as a new player you just get fucking completely dicked!
1059,"After a certain point of matchmaking you will face player with legendary cards (p2w) or smurfs, i would still recommend this game aslong you dont care about you're rank, then it can be fun playing."
1060,put wheel of doom in your deck

1064,Fun :)
1065,this is awesome
1066,Like the game so far. Doesn't seem like you can have OP powers or anything like that yet. Just have variety
1067,"Fun, but the singleplayer content can throw a massive curveball at you"
1068,"Did you know that powder from fire extinguishers made your nose bleed? I sure didn't. I once stood in the rafters above a stage and made a fog from a fire extinguisher descend upon the drama club. It was supposed to be an innocent prank. How was I supposed to know that it'd dry out all of their nasal cavities and cause a swarm of screaming children to be spewing blood while running like it was the apocalypse? And yeah: Maybe doing it in 2003 while everyone was scared of anthrax was a bad idea. Was I supposed to have thought of that? ... Maybe. I just wanted to make red cylinder go ""POOSSSHHT"", and I did. The moral of this story is that Minion Masters is a good game. Not the best, but very decent."

1073,Enjoyable game so far.
1074,"Ye, is pretty good."
1075,Pretty fun game. Similar to Clash Royale but with a lot more cards and strategies.
1076,I haven't played much of the game bit so far I am loving it has good gameplay

1078,gg
1079,"Игрулька супер, и на винде и на маке, прочитал что и на телефоне скоро будет"
1080,I love being a minion master. (Dominating minions is pretty nice)
1081,"Minion Masters is good for killing time in short bursts. The unique mechanics and learning curve make it addictive up-front, and while it becomes samey after a few matches -  you'll want to play it again later. There's lot's of minions to create your own custom decks from, with a rock-paper-scissors counter dynamic, and from this you can come up with your own strategies / thematics / style. The minion master you choose also has benefits which work in conjunction with the units, however you'll see alot of the same mixed groups of minions and masters together as the better ones stand out, and certain approaches just won't work.  

It probably won't be your 'main game', and that's just due to the lack of prolonged-play incentives. It's good for casuals, but as usual this means that if you like to binge-game and want to see your time-spent rewarded, it might become stale when the daily tasks are done and you're just grinding shards for days, which are used to unlock cards. The adventure mode also provides some deviation from the pvp, and is a good way to use cards you might not have or discover combos in the process. It's designed to be re-attempted until you nail it, but unless you're a glutton for punishment you'll probably just burn out trying. 

Despite the limited amount of things to do, the concept is cool, the game is fun, you can pick it up or put it down whenever you feel like. With more minions / masters / modes and activities.. and a more active - less immature community in the chat talking garbage all day -  it could be pretty epic, but it's still a free download and decent time killer."
1082,This game is not addictive. Quitting it is easy; I've done it a thousand times.
1083,its fun
1084,Awesome and funny game
1085,"the best game i ever played beside roblox and minecraft
"
1086,"I support this game, yes kinda pay to win but like it's a good game, if you like clash royal you'll like it, and that games alot more pay to win.
Just playing completely free I was able to do pretty good. You get what you pay for no matter what, simple."
1087,tis fun
1088,"Fun for a mini (quick) battle game.  Although there seems to be a limited selection ATM, there is a lot of room for addition and improvement and I expect some really interesting things.  As long as they don't go total PTW and keep things balanced this game has a bright future."
1089,nice game
1090,"Trash game, if you disconnect me from THE MIDDLE OF A MATCH that I was in the middle of playing to tell me that I received the result of a previous match or that I couldn't get the result of a previous match or whatever the message was that I couldn't see because I clicked OK so fast BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING A RANKED MATCH, and then I come back to a losing board state and lsoe A FUCKIGN MATCH THAT I WAS ALREADY PLAYING THEN THIS GAME IS TRASH. WHY WOULD YOU DISCONNECT ME FROM A MATCH THAT I WAS IN TEH MIDDLE IN TO GIVE ME A NOTIFICATION ADN THE RECONNECT ME WHERE MY OPPONENT HAS HAD 30+ SECONDS TO FLOOD MY SIDE OF THE BOARD MINION MASTERS U FUCKING TRASH GAME BRO WTF."
1091,Bruh I just love strategy games!!
1092,"cool game, i like this so much"
1093,coolio
1094,I Dont have a phone to play clash royale so this is the best thing ever
1095,its cool
1096,"played 1.6 hours at time of review, i give it 9/10.....ill give it 10/10 at 1k hours."
1097,A really well presented game very similar to Clash Royale that is unfortunately completely ruined by some incredibly overpowered cards that are not fun to use or play against.
1098,good game
1099,I only recommend this game to people who enjoy mobile games that want a more polished feeling. I believe most mobile games are trash because of there platform. They're directly made as a cash grab and the developers are lazy. This game isn't exactly excluded from this type of development but seeing that it has a different player base it definitely is better than what you would find on mobile.
1100,Terrible game with even worse devs who let Discord essentially erase a years worth of players accounts growth and refused to offer help when swapping off Discord.
1101,"Great game you dont have to p2w
Theres a DLC here and there and they often give them away fro free.

The game is in constant development spend tons of time here :)"
1102,"100% gpu usage, 90% cpu usage - sus ඞ"
1103,"fascinating game , especially in n 2v2 the action is none stop"
1104,GOOD
1105,Game runs like absolute shit and you need to restart every so often or youll crash but other than that its p good.
1106,largely mindless fun but fun nonetheless
1107,Its fun to play casually if you're bored at 2 am with a friend
1108,Fun game if you like clash royale type tower defense games

1110,Literally best deck building game ever!

1113,ok
1114,Not bad!
1115,Funny game
1116,"I went into it expecting it to be bad, but it's actually really fun little game to play when you come from work tired, and don't need to think TOO much :D"
1117,Amazing game pick it up grab some cards AND GET SOME SPINS BABY
1118,Gave me 50 chests even before my first match. 10/10
1119,"Jogo dahora demais, muito interativo. o modo 2v2 da vontade de jogar por hras"
1120,Excellent mindgame for everyday.
1121,decent mobile
1122,"I played too much for my own good. The game is fun, but only if you got all the DLC packs and included cards for free when the DLCs launched. The game feels kinda unbalanced at points and most new cards have a bit of a powercreep going on.

Voicelines from the enemies masters sometimes play as loud as they can and you get no real feel for where the sound is actually coming from, units ragdoll around or get stretched when they die and some minor audio or graphics glitches can happen.

A very good thing about the game is that it's free AND that BetaDwarf gives out DLC for free during the first week after launch, which gives you the new legendary unit and a bit of stuff to overall boost your decks, but after that week the DLC pricing goes up to 12,50€ (in Germany at least) which is a very, very steep price for what you actually get.

Also the game has a season pass for around one year now, which also gives you access to newly released units, but only when you pay with rubys (which is the in-game real money currency). So yeah, take that with a grain of salt.

Overall it's a fun game that can feel very unfair at times and you have to invest either a lot of time or money to get a decent pool of good and viable units.

7/10"
1123,Is kinda fun game take a free dlc
1124,"Potatoes, boil um , mash um, put them in a stew!"
1125,"This game has free stuff all the time. I tried it, it's not that great."
1126,its fun yo
1127,"Combined deck building with moba games. If you are familiar with those type of games you have a head start. Enjoyable, easy to learn hard to master. 
Difficult to communicate with others in team battles but I enjoyed it as a casual game.
"
1128,FUN!
1129,As soon as I get a few more hours under my belt I'll form a concrete opinion.
1130,"It is fun, but this game will have you questioning if you're playing with bots. It's like Clash Royale minus any clashing. I place minions and they win. Played for a day and reached high Plat. It's fun game to duo with a friend, but doesn't seem to be competitive. 
Art is nice looking and sounds make me happy so cant complain."
1131,AMAZING GAME
1132,Was an Alpha/Beta tester. Fun simple game. Definitely worth checking out. Not sure on the price of the DLC being so high but if you catch them on sale pick it up. Grab some friends and get going.
1133,"League of legends lite, quite fun."
1134,good game
1135,great game if you are an avid player its definitely worth it to buy the bundles
1136,gut
1137,"A pretty fun casual game that i'm enjoying a lot more than i thought I would, matches are quick usually finishing up within 3 minites and rarely exceeding 6. Good if you're considering playing something that you don't want to spend to long playing in one session."
1138,good!!!
1139,"I remember the launch of this game few years back now, its very similar to the likes of Clash Royale with two sides battling it out with cards that you can pick two bridges to cross with one tower. A ""Master"" sits a top the tower each coming with there own abilities that can be triggered over time by controlling the said bridges. Destroy the other players tower to win. I played it on Xbox One and loved it. Bought the extra pack dlc's and at the time had every card damn feels like yesterday. Still a good laugh now, just hope to see Minion Masters 2 or something... but as of the writing of this review a new dlc has launched that is completely free... I mean can't go wrong there. So all I can say is give it try you may even end up wasting a few hours away, its free and not hard to play at all."
1140,"A decent version of Battle Royale for PC. There is no pay-to-win elements, the graphic is nice and smooth, the devs are active on Discord. I hope this game will grow bigger in the future because it is worth it!"
1141,"Average match length is less than 2 minutes.
Match wait times can exceed 10 minutes (at least that's as long as my patience lasted before I quit.
Don't waste your money on a waiting game unless you are using it as a break from doing something relevant.  The short match time is nice"
1142,"Minion Masters is a tower defence game that is card driven. The makes for an interesting strategy game.

1143,"okay the cash shop is super lame.. but the game play here is actually really good, i made gold in ranked pretty quickly but i did pick up some dlc off steam XD"
1144,"3D Chess, with the level turned up to maximum.  It takes some hours to learn to build a proper deck, and how to counter your opponents. Small developer who could listen more to their players, but its not game breaking. Download it, put a few hours into it, you will get hooked."

1158,"Fantastic fun for all ages, bring your grandma, bring your dog, don't forget pretzels!!"
1159,fuego baby
1160,"The game is fun and I play it when I have little time to actually play. Problem is this game performs terribly at times and has caused me some losses. The game freezes and stutters at times to the point of my game crashing or timing out. Fun game being held back by performance issues. How could these play-doh graphics cause so many problems. Overall 7/10, 9/10 if they fixed these performance issues."
1161,"Great game! It reminds me of a Warcraft 3 custom map but polished and fully fleshed out. It's definitely worth at least a try, we'll see how many hours I end up sinking into it!"
1162,fun addicting time waster... i enjoy it
1163,<3
1164,"A fantastic damn great FREE GAME so FAR! 9.5/10! Impressive most addictive long awaited for game so simple and perfect like this!

Amazing amazing amazing"
1165,soild niche game
1166,"Pretty good game, while the top of the ladder does require some good cards there are a lot of solid cards that can easily be crafted and allow you to be competitive. But some of the legend cards can be frustrating to fight against. Main draw to this game is that you can play with one other teammate."
1167,The game is fun and changes often.  I play casually.  I enjoy the fact that most matches last under 5 minutes.  It's easy to play this game even if you only have a few minutes to spare in the day.

1175,applesauce
1176,"another rubbish to be aware of, when I got laggings and lost one game to MIF, he sent trolling emotes (guess he holds grudge after many losses)
---------------
a lot of laggings these days. 5 DCs in a day and a lot of laggings.
also some players are just toxic, they keep playing OP decks , keep quiet when they lose,like to send emotes when they win (especially when you are trying new decks). i.e. krammjohn1997 . guess no parent taught him any manner
devs rarely give much thought when they balance anything
even after witnessing how newbies can win a tour guru with ROS, devs do not have a clue how they overbuffed ROS 2 months ago
----------------
I did decide to stay though.
Draft is still the best mode there, random cards v.s. random opponents without worrying about the meta. You can even play against katt and dragon in draft sometimes!
Tournament is what keep some old players going. Enjoy the competitive matches and earn some pocket money. (time zone is not in my favor though)
Do hope devs put more resources into the game and especially its mobile version to keep it alive. 
-----------------------
Random was never very decent but new ELO system obviously makes things a lot worse. You gotta carry a lot of trash. Once you got high ELO , the game stopped being any fun. If solo is a senior center where you meet old faces on a daily basis, then random is a trash center where you'd meet all kinds of trash.
-----------------------
Sometimes I cannot even tell whether I like or dislike the game nowadays. Still participating in every month's tournament though. Anyway, this is how the game will be like once you get somewhere(usually from Master 1)
With the current ELO system, it is pretty fast to rank from any rank to Master 1. And then 

in Solos, you'll see all kinds of cheese, one push deck, spawner+ building deck , Dragon nest...Moreover, it is like literally like a Senior Center where you always match against the same few faces everyday. 
in Randoms , you 'll have to carry a diamond (who might also keep pinging) to play against 2 masters
in premade, well, you'll have long queues and will probably waste a lot of time on waiting. For me, I only do conquest in this mode now.

So, where have the fun gone :(

--------------------------------------------------
But now it has a bad balance and devs do nothing about it. Spawners in this game are just like brainless retarded decks. You just need to place spawners and then maybe some walls and stun units to defend those spawners, as time passes by, you get the extra value and win. Moreover, this game has always been unfriendly to asian players esp CN players. Lots of laggings and stuffs, sometimes you even lose all your decks, a bug that has been there for years, after a disconnection. 

------------------
If you are a big fan of card games, it is worth a try. I bet you gonna love it. 
It has a well-built masters plus minions plus bridge-grabbing system. And most importantly, the game is fair. You would not need much grind or purchasing to get all the cards and masters.

It is a pity though, devs here are just a small team. And sometimes there are network issues for players in some regions. And it seems that devs like to make bold and frequent changes. But generally speaking, it is good."

1187,one of the very few deckbuilding games i actually like!
1188,"Honestly, not a bad card-playing tower-defense style F2P game. It has some aspects of mobile gaming, Gachapon-esque sorts of loot, but the matches go quickly and you never need to take it seriously.

Can probably run on a toaster and isn't a massive download, so that's a plus for people with older systems."
1189,"Just a really fun, done well game to play."
1190,good game
1191,Клещ Рояль лучше
1192,Good stuff
1193,"An excellent example of the Strategy Card genre. Reminiscent of the mobile game Clash Royale, but it is a completely different project, which is much more interesting to play. The game has nice graphics and character physics, so that during the battles you will watch a miniature version of the battle from some Strategy similar to Total War. Of the rest:
1) A huge collection of cards to create your unique deck
2) The ability to use your hero's abilities to help your minions and defend against enemy minions
3) A wide variety of PvE and PvP game modes"
1194,.
1195,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW GAME TO PLAY : DONT PLAY THIS ! It takes forever to get good cards, you buy power tokens with gold and guess what you get from those ? common cards... ALWAYS shit ! I got so many hours on this game and I don't even have everything that I want because I don't want to pay $$$$. If you are rich this is the game for you just spend lots of money and you will have fun. FREE TO PLAY NEW PLAYERS = GRIND FOR MONTHS (YEARS)"
1196,Is gud
1197,"This is a very fun game, reminds me of Southpark phone destroyer but much better."
1198,"quite bugged and, in all honesty for what it is, it is poorly coded cause it requires quite a bit of resources to run something that is a joke on a phone... but... the game is quick... round takes anywhere between 1 and 5 minutes... a short and a rather satisfying experience. certainly beats stuff like hearthstone."
1199,just a fun game overall passes the time fun both solo or playing with a friend highly recommend playing this
1200,"Connection issues, a cheap copy of other similar games.. meh"

The so-called card tower defense, the games are very fast, my longest game lasted 6 minutes, and the shortest 45 seconds. Good balance, you can climb quite high in the rating system with a self-created deck even without knowing the rating decks. Frequent add-ons that when they go out there is an opportunity to get it for free. Despite the fact that the game is shareware, you can play it absolutely without donations. In a word, other card games need to take an example from this one."
1206,Fun xd
1207,"pretty good. 

this is my greatest tool for procrastination. something to do? how about 5 minutes of minion masters before doing it. hmm, maybe another game wouldn't hurt... i have plenty of time...

1208,"I'm really enjoying the game. If you like games like Clash Royale, i think this is a good PC version of that formula. Quirky and fun characters."
1209,best $0.00 ive ever spent
1210,"Alright so I played at initial launch and a few weeks after - overall solid game to drop 2-3 hrs at a time into. Came back 1 year after the insanity of Covid, and this game is trash, I spent 30mins just ""getting rewards"" when I log back in and all I want to do is play.

I look to post feedback and I get sent to a google docs that doesn't load - trash. Sorry devs but simply put if I want to spend 2-3hrs gaming, I shouldn't need to spend 30mins ""receiving"" awards to eventually hope to play your game. Waste of freaking time. Aggregate your rewards for returning players!"
1211,Not a big fan of card games with the exception of this gem. It is a blast to team up with a friend and to try all kind of weird build. Matches are very short which makes it perfect for a short session.
1212,"it is not bad, be prepared to lose sometimes and also be prepared in genarl"
1213,Yes.
1214,e3
1215,Game would not start
1216,simple fun  level 23  still not spent a dime still having fun against paid players my win means money as i have game free item vs player who bought junk
1217,Tip top gam nice time! TNX
1218,GOOD
1219,Pay to win game.
1220,good
1221,"It's Clash Royale for PC. It's made for PC though, the graphics are impressive. the gameplay is engaging and it's easy to play. 10/10"
1222,One of my all time favorites
1223,Fun card based tower defense
1224,Clash Royale at maximum settings
1225,"Minion Master is a cool Game, I like it. 👍🏻"
1226,sorry no
1227,Fix your ridiculous shop prices in the remastered and more people will come join the community of Minion Masters definitely
1228,Fast fun game :)
1229,ok game fun and fun and fun
1230,this game really makes you FEEL like a master
1231,"I am not a big deck building game fan. Coz there is always some butt that tells you you're doing it all wrong. This game actually has me interested in the logistics of partnering a rat hoard in a deck with a huge giant with a ram. It is surprisingly fun, and I think it's a game you're either going to love or hate. For a (basically) FTP game that has a daily free bonus in the shop is a big sell for someone that doesn't want to put money just to get a 'bargain"". Either 1vs1 or 2vs2 are available with you being able to partner with randos or guild mates. You won't know until you try it :)"
1232,"Very good game if you enjoy clash royale and want something similar on pc. Its also a lil more in depth adding features that clash royale didn't have that don't ruin the core fundamental gameplay. Due to this I'd say its just as competitive, if not, more than clash royale. Its also not as pay to win as clash royale was due to this being a pc game compared to mobile."
1233,great game
1234,great time killer
1235,is gud
1236,"Easily the best Dev support of any game I've played. Gorgeous graphics, exiting game play, and unlimited replay-ability.
Incredibly fun!
I love playing this game with friends. 
Buy it and buy it for a friend!"
1237,"While this isn't P2W, you'll definitely get a little more variety in your decks in exchange for money. However, 
50 hours and I've spent a grand total of nothing. Worth a go, and you definitely don't need to spend a tonne to feel competitive."
1238,Basically horizontal Clash Royale for PC.
1239,"pre good card game, recommended for ppl who like card games :), 3d view of battle and power ups (as well as changeable playable characters with abilities) and ranking system is a great feature of this game."
1240,good
1241,"Very fun game, great game if you have 20 min to burn or 2 hours to burn. very fun alone or with a friend. constnantly balancing and growing."
1242,great game and its my first time playing it <3
1243,"pay to lose, even worse than pay to win"
1244,"They made a great game 5 years ago, and every passing day has been worse than before.  Great concept, but they have no idea how to make improvements."
1245,game is the bomb guys.......
1246,fun
1247,"I've given this game about 20 hours or so, but have gotten to the point where it is thorougly unenjoyable. New players, you will win your first 100 matches or so but eventually get stuck in a rank where it is literally IMPOSSIBLE to win. Feels like a boring time sink at that point. Ever since the game went f2p, it has been heavily monetized and you have to spend money to get good decks. Definitely would not recommend this game."
1248,"It's a good game. Dev's are morons sometimes (often) making nerfs, where nerfs is not needed and boosts where boosts are not needed. But all in all it's a really great game."
1249,"The game feels great, it has good graphics, it's reasonably easy to understand and it's enjoyable to play, it's definitely worth trying."
1250,"It's pretty darn good mate

1252,"Wouldn't recommend this game. Previous versions were better, but the constant changes to key features of the game and the annoying bugs are enough to look at other games. 

I really liked it up to this point though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1253,It's like Clash but with less royale. 10/10 would play Clash from the side again.
1254,Super good.

1260,Quick tower defense game with good mechanism.
1261,"really approachable game. It's relatively easy to get exactly the cards you want to get without having to pay money, and the matches don't take long at all. It's been a fun go to since the game has launched for me."
1262,Fun and the game is free
1263,"Real addictive game.
Quite fast-paced one. 
Neat hybrid of card games & tower-defense."

1267,"see the other positive reviews - all pro and cons are true
It is a [b]free[/b], strategic card battler with regular updates and new cards which keeps the game alive. It is fun to play (and win), receive rewards and no pay2win. Give it a try."
1268,"Wow I couldn't even quit the game without them trying to force me to play their qualifiers. 
I mean there is a cool aspect to it but what kind of braindead audience are they targetting? That after my first win I have to be stimulated by 8 big glowing chests and unboxing. 

When i unboxed the chest the shiny LOOT BLASTED OUT and the crazy loud music dude was SO EPIC. This is the best This is insane man."

1275,good for time pass XD
1276,"I feel fun and recommend the new face keep it on free to play, ""play to win"" and no need to pay more (Pay to win?) because they always change it. When all setting have to change then some packs likes to out of date."
1277,"I have play it at fews years but I dont like ""Now"" and why? The wild-cards system have to destroy my purchase wish, and that's the duel tactics limiting. They have not give the choose for switch of this function in games, just an not smart one game mode... And I hate the bot teammate hacker!"

1281,"It is a nice game and I understand that the community must support it.. but 125 EUR for DLCs ... it is kinda of greedy. Instead of making useless DLCs, just create something like battle pass or some in-game stuff and make the game REALLY to be free to play!.. The DLCs are preventing this game for being actually top 3 in steam, free to play section and in one of the most played game in steam in general!"

Great game mechanics keep you think and reacting.
Definitely worth the download and your attention."

1312,Great game!
1313,"Best game ever! Play it all the time. I like how you only have to dedicate 5-10 mins to each match so you can play any time of the day and come back to it. Lots of strategy involved! My husband is an avid gamer and loves it. I am not a gamer, stay at home mom and I love it too. It's for everyone."

1322,Fun game but as with all F2P games it is clearly P2W
1323,"Total fun

Just for completing nomination task ;)"
1324,"This game gives you a little more than you pay for with a free game lol.  On the positive side, you are not frequently badgered to make in app purchases, the leveling system moves rapidly so you feel like you are getting cards that you want and need frequently, the interface runs much more smoothly that other free-to-play games, and the small gambling system is fun and can be used with in-game currency as opposed to the predatory gambling mechanics we have seen from other triple A titles *coughEAcough*  The game also provides consistent updates and new events to keep game modes fresh.  

On the negative side, it's a free to play game.  There isn't much in the way of character customization, meaningful progress, or card alteration to increase variability during games.  But if you want a fun, smooth, and moderately rewarding game that plays like a much better Clash Royale and is supported by Steam, this is the game for you.  Definitely enjoyable if not completely fulfilling.  Kudos are exceeding my expectations, BetaDwarf!"
1325,I really like the team battles.
1326,"before downloading my marriage was failing, my drinking was heavy and my kids were terrified of me."
1327,"Fun, quality game!"
1328,"Needs more content. For a game that copies Hearthstone, and also takes the sound effect of a potion bottle from World of Warcraft, making the game like a Mobile Game but doesnt treat the game as a Live Service, you are
asking for players to get bored, and leave.

I was told that the game wasnt gonna get any bug fixes or any updates any time soon, i started to notice the game
disconnecting, dropping my teammates, making me have to battle 1v2, me doing all the work!

We end up eventually losing because he lost connection. Then the same thing happened to me. 

The game tends to drop frames. The battles whether is 1v1 or 2v2, even if you bring down the quality
of the game, even if you have a monster pc machine, you are going to get dropped from the game
due to their Server Connections, not yours. The game takes a pause for like 5 seconds, sometimes longer. 

Its deciding whether you should get disconnected or not. Once its back, what you didnt see in that pause is 
monsters swarming at you and you have to start dropping monsters to defend before you die.

Very annoying.  

The game is fun for a week or two but if whoever is in charge of fixing the game is not doing his job to fix these
bugs, and keep the game updated with new things, and not be putting behind a pay wall against new content.
DLCs is great and all but dont just only make content for your bank account.

The game will only last by new players but they will find out about the lack of updates, and the lack of hearing
players in their concerns or even demands.

If adding new content brings more business, why wouldnt you do it? 

Feels like Armello. Its sad to see Companies make this a popular trend. 
They make the game, they only care for the more noticeable bugs but leave the small ones.

I will still play this game, but i will wait and see but one person said to me, not hold your breath because
they still havent done anything yet. 

Ill change my review once i start seeing more content, and bug fixes such as their Server Connection,
FPS fixes, but just like what the guy from the discussions told me, i wont be expecting anything and he said
not even the far future.

So developers or whoever is in charge, do something already!

Players need more dammit.

1329,Looks and feels awesome. Thumbs up from me.
1330,Good game

1332,Liked it

1341,IT GOOD
1342,Its very fun!
1343,really poggers game bro
1344,game gud :^)
1345,"Kinda bad, but also really fun. Give it a shot."

-Free to play        
-Addictive

Cons:
-Rage
-Very grindy"
1351,"Played a good bit, a lot, actually. Consistently achieved the rank of Master or Grandmaster every time I chose to pick the game back up. The only Free To Play game I'd ever recommend."
1352,"Fun game but EXTREMELY Pay To Win, after you reach Gold or Platinum level the game is starting matching you with the much stronger opponents and it's impossible to win. C'mon if the fight is not fair then what's the point to play. I understand that devs making money but to do it so blatantly is an utter shame. Here you go [middle finger]"
1353,It's fun
1354,Really fun would recomend
1355,"been playing before the game changed any of the models and I find this game is nice and fun but it could definitly use some balancing.
a good example is have a look at stun lancers and then look at the defenso chopper. It was balanced before were stun lancers could spam stun infinitly so long as there alive and defesno choppers could stun ANY melee unit.
now stun lancers are worthless as defenso chopper can out tank, do more dps and is more reliable for stuns.
if that is not a good example lets try one of the newer ones the diplomancer, this mage is able to use the hypnosis ability which causes the enemy unit to not only take swift damage at small bits but the enemy unit will also contribute to your dps as it destroys your enemies around it making the diplomancer a walking spell with infinte uses so long as it has hp.
these are just 2 examples but it's obvious the devs don't play there game enough to balance anything properly."
1356,actually a lot of fun.
1357,This game is a f****** pay to win. Don't play this sh*t
1358,cool game
1359,Fun enough~ Haven't played much yet. Will edit later maybe.
1360,great game

1374,The game requires thinking for a battle engaging and interactive. Fun and well developed. Looking foward for more content.
1375,"Fast gameplay
Different game modes
Lots of freebies

After reading the backstory of this game I'd give it an extra thumbs up. Especially since the devs are so generous with giving out freebies at certain times and in game. Just had to add this in my review, so maybe other people might take the time to read about the story of the developers and their games~!"
1376,good game
1377,Some like candy crush. I like Minion crush. Fun and keeps my mind going.
1378,:)
1379,Very fun with friends
1380,"ExceIIent game. AbsoIuteIy Iove the unit variety.

Edit: I have an issue with the way they ""balanced"" units. Especially the stun lancers. They were nerfed into oblivion. They have low health, low damage and low attack speed. Their only strength was the ability to stun the enemy. Why did the game developers feel they needed to nerf their ability, too? Now they can only stun with the first attack making them almost entirely useless."
1381,i love this game
1382,Give me award
1383,nice
1384,"I used to like this game, however the owners and developers are greedy little kkkunts. They are constantly changing the game, so by the time you put together a great team, they change them, or add new ones, especially masters that weaken what you have.

Talk about sexism (feminism, but that's just another term for a sexist moron) if there is a female master you can virtually guarantee it's going to win. 

I can no longer recommend this game. It is a complete time waster."
1385,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live.
None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
1386,If you like card game go for it https://youtu.be/0rdu1YnbKNM
1387,i love it ^^
1388,super fun and addicting. But u can tell they used blizzard characters to make the playable toons in game. However it still fun.
1389,Super fun to play with a friend. Really enjoying this game. Cute character selection ^_^
1390,Fun game.
1391,fun game
1392,good game
1393,Its fun!!
1394,mutha fuckahs took me out of the game just to write a review. 4/5 stars cuz interuptions.....
1395,good game
1396,fun
1397,"I found myself playing this game more out of rage because of how unsatisfying the game was rather than how much fun it should be. I really love this kind of game but even with that I had enough. With team plays I keep getting stuck with people who lose on purpose or even just sit there and do nothing and reporting them does nothing I keep reporting the same people twenty times and still get stuck with them. On solo the game is just fine until it starts giving you cheaters who either start getting mana five times faster than you or get exp faster than you without having the bridges or using cards that would give them the exp. On special rules mode without exception I win the first two games and on the third get cheaters literally 100 percent of the time never have I won more than two matches and never less it's like the game knows who are the cheaters and gives them to you on purpose. Many years ago before the game was on steam and possibly was called something else I already played this games because I remember the exact cards that the game has and then there was a situation where I kept loosing the entire day until I realized that I kept getting the exact same teammates until I started reporting them and finally when I tried getting someone from global chat to play with got stuck with people who did nothing during the game after which I blocked them don't remember if you can do it now and when I continued to try and get someone from global someone said that there are people who want to but I said oh I can't see them if it's the same people who lost the games on purpose who are answering in chat then I blocked them and can't see their messages, the next thing I knew I got banned, so I'm guessing a mod banned me because I blocked some loosers who were loosing the matches on purpose. The game was dead already then and was long dead from the first day on steam with the people in charge of the game not caring about it at all. So do yourself a favor if you like this type of game just stay away, can't give you an alternative but still better even not start with it."
1398,Super fun game to play with your partner :D
1399,"The game is fun and addicting, the playerbase though is one of the most toxic ive encountered. Nothing the devs can really do about that though."
1400,Game better clash royale big collosus win 100% baybee
1401,very nice and fun so far. has a lot of potential.
1402,The game is not very populated but I consider this as underrated because the game is seriously enjoyable!
1403,boobies.
1404,"Game is fun and has a great design!
Definitely a game to play with friends!"
1405,"Games are quick. When I don't have much time I can play a few rounds, then move on."

1411,I always take breaks from playing this game.. But I always seem to come back to it.  <3
1412,yes really good game but i get super bored by the amounts of decks possible ... guess ill check it again in 2 years or so they drop new cards so slow and till you can play them you need to wait for the end of the season so fked up xD
1413,"Pretty good, surprisingly very balanced and not pay to win at all. Developers give free DLC away aswell as coins and rubies randomly.
UI feels outdated tbh, and not too big on the aesthetic of the game overall. Gameplay is very solid though.
Give it a shot,"

1417,great game
1418,"Surprisingly fun for the first 20/ 30 minutes, after that it is very repetitive. The entire game 1v1 or 2v2 relies pretty much mainly on countering the opponents mini lane, and timing...that is about it...so there is not much depth in the game whatsoever all the unlocks feel meaningless, and actually are more of an annoyance, than a benefit..which there is none to them. Overall it is extremely easy, even vs human opponents...thus leaving one just waiting for the points to tally up to use the next up card, or wait for a stronger one in this tug of war...Overall cool concept, visually not bad, yet its lackluster."
1419,not bad to lose some time
1420,Is pay to win
1421,it is good
1422,A fun and fast paced game either played alone or with a teammate. Good fun.
1423,Good
1424,"Fun game with a healthy blend of genres

1425,Awesome shiiiiiiit
1426,POGGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1427,Very good game. Recommend
1428,Great time waster and overall a really well polished game. Good game especially for being a free title.
1429,"You can play with a teammate 2v2, it's fast paced and fun."
1430,lol
1431,fun game
1432,nice
1433,Easy to get into but it is still complex enough to hold interest.  Matches are quick and fun.  It is worth trying out.
1434,I recommend it. Fun and easy to play.
1435,"Great game. ""Completed"" it on Xbox. On both versions they have never added any more achievements which I find a shame as I like to earn those. Oh well. It's an odd stance seeing as Gems of War, World of Tanks and other FTP titles have added additional achievements."
1436,Nice
1437,"7.5/10

Very simple, short games, a 2v2 mode, ranks and satisfying to play."
1438,its alright
1439,"If you like the feeling of being unable to do anything correctly and the general vibe of competitive league of legends, this is the game for you. If you know the kind of people who love competitive league, run."
1440,Fun!
1441,its fun to play with friends
1442,such fun quick yame
1443,"-shitty game
-nor sucks
-i hate all of it

1444,great and  nice game
1445,Box Opening simulator when you havent played for ages.. dont bother you gotta open 400 chests to be able to play.
1446,Very Pog.
1447,good
1448,Really simple but fun game
1449,"Despite looking like a typical pay to win mobile game, it's actually playable without spending money.  It also has a surprising amount of strategy involved.  Definitely worth trying out."
1450,"Great game, has a lot of potential but doesn't hit the mark. It's worth checking out however some of the cards are ruined by the downside to them, it's like oh hey heres a cool card but oh heres a downside to balance it but don't worry the downside isn't that bad... if you like getting F**ked in the *ss everytime you play it ;)"
1451,.
1452,"Short matches, fast matchmaking, high skill ceiling."
1453,"It's kind of like Clash Royale, but this game You can play on pc and get on steam. It's fun the battles don't usually last longer than 3 minutes, quite fast progression. A nice way to spend that bit of your spare time!"
1454,So the game is amazing but it does have times where your deck feels lacking the game works with mana that adds every few seconds which you would save for higher costing cards. Overall I have been having a fun time with it just having a hard time get past gold 3 which is where the game will generally put you where you will have the hardest times in my opinion.
1455,Its very good game and cool !
1456,Very nice free game
1457,love it
1458,Mom's strategist appreciated it!

Please put an actual function on the report button, because so far it's only cosmetic and we ALL know it.



But I will commend you for making the only TRUE STRATEGY game that I know of."
1471,"Where do I begin? I have been playing this game since it nearly came out. Back when it cost 5 bucks and when you could get a free key from watching twitch streams. 800+ hours. 

The core element of this game is amazing, however it is poorly executed by terrible devs. Betadwarf might possibly be the most clueless developers I have ever encountered. You don't have to take my word for this, you can look at the steamdb info page to see the player base has been in a steady decline. They had a bit of a surge a few years back, but its back on its decline. Why? Its because the Betadwarf can't seem to get anything right. From broken game mechanics, bugs, and horrible balance changes that leave most players bewildered as to why they made the changes they made. Most of the time its because they look at match analytics and make changes based off that. That's not a good measure to make balance changes, it leaves you wondering if they even play their own game. And to top it all off, don't mention any of this in the in game chat, cause you'll just get banned. 

Ive put a lot of money into this game, including buying the battlepass every season, I feel like I should at least be able to criticize the game without getting banned. The other thing is that its not an isolated incident. It is YEARS of horrible decisions that I side step, thinking, ""they gotta get it right one day...right???"" Well that day isn't here and with as long as its been I don't think it ever will be. 

From horrible balance changes that last for MONTHS, to broken game modes for MONTHS. Bugs that last for MONTHS. A report system that DOESNT work.  So what does Betadwarf decide to do? Well screw Minion Masters and fixing what we already have, we are going to work on MM 2.0 that will be optimized for mobile as well, as well as making changes to the current game to fit the average mobile user, faster matches, ect. I can't even begin to list all the miss steps Betadwarf has made in the years that this game has been out.  They have such an amazing and wonderful core mechanic that is ruined by the terrible decisions they make month after month.

My advice is to stay away from the game, its dying, and doubtful the mobile is going to save it, I've seen footage of it, and it runs like garbage, not to mention how are they going to manage rage quitters on that big of a scale when they cant even handle it now with only an average of 1k players. I only have so many hours because I was holding onto hope that one day the game would have balance issues worked out, or at least a meta shift every couple of months. But after being banned for speaking my mind in the game, silenced for expressing my opinion and pointing out the faults? That's garbage Betadwarf."
1472,"if you would find my account

1473,fun free game! easy to play
1474,"- I recommend this game, you waste your time, it is soothing.

1475,"too much of the game depends on randomization for my personal enjoyment. 

also crashes on a regular basis, which further limits enjoyment."
1476,"so much fun, endless decks you can build"
1477,"Fast pace (1 to 10 minutes). Minion Masters quickly connects you with partners and opponents, who are real people (not AI). All game add-ons can be obtained either slowly for free or quickly with funds. No single strategy wins, and the server does a good job matching you with suitable opponents. Fun variety of deck builds possible."
1478,Lots of fun!  Plenty of tactics to choose from.
1479,"Good beginner experience, looking forward to playing more of the game and collecting a good deck!"
1480,"interesting game at the moment, while they dont ask too much to donate"
1481,"I am not very good at this game but it has interesting and fun mechanics along with the champions. The different races that you can combine creates fun combos and other times it just does not work well. I prefer playing 2vs2 so we can create unique complimenting decks. It is a time sink in terms of improving in this game and requires some meta game understanding, which I don't care much about. You can get most of the stuff over time without paying too. Overall, It is a quick and fun game. Average match last around 3 to 5 min."
1482,Is a good side play for every one the's be Main'd'de'd!
1483,"An sich ein unterhaltsames Spiel, um gute Synergie Decks zu bekommen benötig es sehr viel grinding."
1484,Simular to clash royale and is very enjoyable!
1485,"This game used to be incredible. In terms of the core gameplay it's by far the most fun I've had with any game ever. Sadly the developers have over a long period of time changed the game into something that is less and less skill based, to the point where there is little reason to actually play something that requires you to be good at the game. So if you just wanna have some casual fun for free go ahead, there is enjoyment to be had. But for someone like me who takes the game seriously it's a big fat thumbs down from me. I also have tried to approach developers for explanations as to the state of the game but was completely ignored, what little response I've gotten borders on hostility.
"
1486,"I have been addicted to this game since I found it. It's incredibly satisfying building a fun deck and watching the minions march across the arena. It's super easy to pick up, and I don't feel punished for not logging in for a day or two either. All in all, I highly recommend this game. Good job devs!"
1487,"It's a pretty good game assuming its your extremely, particular flavor. rather, you really enjoy custom made, ""mini games"" based on Real Time Strategy / isometric games.  However fair balancing, like any other technical and competitive game, is impossible to achieve. i don't doubt them for trying, only accusing them of failing. i feel like whatever number theory they applied was flawed or insufficient. certain cards are either way to easy to use, or way too hard. not sure how else to break that down in as few words as possible without any further elaboration. cards have a mana cost and do things.. minions (obviously), structures (which degrade health over time) and spells. I had some fun experimenting with this and that.. some things are contrived. like there are ""sets"" or assumed decks.. the thing is they aren't really viable competitively.. even when you are going for what they intended you to do. 

anyway i dont even care to elaborate any further. i sunk time and money into this game and might do so again in the future.. but i went from really loving it to.. getting to better understand everything and not loving it so much. not sure how else to encapsulate that. hope it helps. its free so wroth a try.. but keep in mind they will rope and bait you into dumping money. regardless if you want to pay to win, it may or may not work in your favor.... been ripped off many times felt tricked with their store system. like i spent a valuable resource on something cosmetic that i didn't even want or will use assuming it was something i could actually play with. so thats fun. i'll just call myself an idiot for seeing the same exact artwork along with a certain colored ""legendary"" text along the bottom and assume im not getting that card only a dumb looking avatar instead.

also the emotes are gross. even if people are trying to be wholesome and cute i always hate it. i dont need to flirt with my chess opponent.. id rather not try and have a strong emphatic connection but focus on the match. .literally no option to disable all the cringe emotes from the start that people are tricked into paying money for. it could be a fun a game and theres not many other alternative options out there, but then again, why are you trying to play mods for RTS games that appeal to lazy and weak minded players????? can't micromanage a base?? here, have a dumbed down face to face version of the genre. SAD! maybe good if it was touch screen only.."
1488,AMAZING. Takes inspiration from Clash Royale (not plagarising it) and improves most of the problems with clash royale while still feeling like something different.
1489,tghis game is is epic
1490,nice
1491,"[h1][b]General Opinion[/b][/h1]
I have played this game for a long time and it's fun. This is one of the games I have spent a lot of time and money playing. I recommend that each player tries the game and enjoys it. You won't get bored easily and will spend hours playing and creating decks.


[h1][b]Game Description[/b][/h1]
This is a type of a [u]card collection game[/u], where you build a deck of 10 cards. This is a 3D game viewed from a 2D perspective. Two players are placed in an arena at opposite sides to fight each other. The two opposing sides are connected via two bridges. Each player draws 4 cards from their deck - this is the player's hand. When a card is played, it's put again at the bottom of the deck. [u]The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent's HP to 0[/u] by playing cards - summoning minions/monsters, playing spells or playing a building.


[h1][b]Not Pay-To-Win[/b][/h1]
This game is [b][u]NOT[/u] [/b]pay-to-win. The gameplay is very similar to Clash Royale ([i]a famous mobile game[/i]), but Minion Masters is better in my opinion. [strike] Soon Minion Masters will be available for smartphones as well, so you can play with the same account on your smartphone.[/strike] The development of the mobile version was stopped.


[h1][b]Some good and bad things[/b][/h1]
The game is not perfect and has its faults. For example, the UI is not polished and doesn't look too good. It is buggy and will cause worse game performance. The game is full of minor annoying bugs that are still existing after several patches.

The good thing is that the game has an active community of players and content creators. Joining the Discord server of the game is a must if you want to take part in the community. You can play Minion Masters with friends too and you can have your own guild. The game is updated regularly and new content is added on a monthly basis, which keeps the deckbuilding interesting and brings some change in the meta."
1492,I am not much for strategy anything. But this is fun
1493,"Games lit, also, its not pay 2 win, its pay for more options
"
1494,fun
1495,total brutal underground
1496,not a bad game at all
1497,You gotta love a game that doesn't take itself too seriously but is deceptively loads of fun. AND has two-player competitive gameplay.
1498,"- Free to play
- Some common cards are pretty good
- Generous with loot chests by just playing the game
- Fun

"
1499,"Quick, fun and in times happy competitive."
1500,fun game to play in your free time
1501,"When I first played this game it was actually pretty fun, but not much to do. Came back and the game seems basically a 100% pay to win, yes you can get cards without paying but not at a rate that brings you close enough to people with deep pockets. The adventure mode which gives some rewards but is stupid hard at times. Overall I would avoid this game unless you don't mind paying loads of money for cards. Sad to say because I thought this game had loads of potential. They should focuses more on cosmetics for your minions, cards, and master instead of making everything cost money but I think it is to late to change that now."
1502,"pay to win game. all games have great start to get good review. just remember this type of games if don't buy buy until you broke, you will be pray for big coiners. how much would pay for this game, with out buy pack thingy. new world $40  Ark $30 7DTD $25 $10 in special. etc.  you decide buy allot pack or something else. I understand developers need get pay which is fair. if like game there is a pack that offer perm gold and exp. that pack might be good. still I think over pay for value of this game."
1503,<3
1504,Fast-Paced.  match making seems fair
1505,"It is my first time playing, but having fun so far."
1506,"Always encounter error mid-game, especially frustrating when doing mayhem, but the error reporting system is also erroneous itself."
1507,"It's a fun game, reminds me of Clash Royale and a little bit of Hearthstone."
1508,"this game easy to play, but if you play in weak PC like me, you will get frustrated because sometime is disconnected with no reason, and you lose rank just like that !"
1509,Waste of my time.
1510,+
1511,pretty fun Clash Royal type game
1512,cool game
1513,Good game so far
1514,"so nice.so many interesting spells and minions.another interesting thing is masters that have different powers.
how ever,the Queens dragon (Morellia) skill is so OP and unfair."
1515,Yes.
1516,Pretty fun
1517,good
1518,"Plays like clash royale, but has a very intuitive interface. It does have mobile game elements, but other than that it's a good game."
1519,"If you are looking for a game to have your child play and entertain themselves, you've come to the right place. if you are looking for a game with a changing meta and dynamic gameplay and developers who engage with their community... look elsewhere. when playing this game after a patch you get to play a fun mini game called ""bug or feature"" where something got changed but it wasnt in the patch notes so you have to guess if its supposed to have been changed or not. streamers are lead to believe they will get rewards but the only person the developers will consistently talk to is badasafish80... who isnt even on their payrole. shoutout to that guy for keeping this game alive, it would have died much sooner without him. 10/10 on the concept though, in theory this could be one of the top esports games in the world if it was managed properly"
1520,this is fun
1521,"Got banned for trying new decks in a game that encourages you to do so.
GG"
1522,"Not sure why; but I was never into card games. I have found this game interesting enough to try. I have won and lost. Over all it is something I think anyone would find fun to play. That is the point right, to find something FUN! Well, it is fun, still working on the whole deck creation and what works the best. I would think if you are looking for something different then this game is worth trying even once. If you find you like it, as I have. Then I hope to see you in the game."
1523,"Nearly at 100 hours. this game is a sleeping gem, fantastic casual arcade pvp."
1524,START SPENDING YOUR MANA! GO! GO! GO!
1525,Having to click through 9 loot boxes upon logging in and noticing the weird (lack of) optimization has put me off of trying this game more than I already have.
1526,Great game even for free players.
1527,Very well put together and simple. Keep adding new characters and it'll live on. 10/10
1528,This was so much more fun than I expected since I don't really like tower defense. For a card game the basic minions and master are pretty strong which makes successful theory crafting feel so rewarding if you overcome them. 2v2 is also a great fit for the two lanes and lets you see a much larger variety of decks.
1529,Have only just begun but so far it is very fun.  I started playing and after about 30 minutes of play I realized I had been playing for 4 hours.  Nice change of pace game I would recommend to everyone.
1530,its a great game also my son love it !!!!! he used to play Tabs  - and I used to play warcraft - smite - we both happy playing this
1531,"good way to pass time. PVP. Team Battles. Deck Building. I have not spent any money but it looks like you can if you want, not sure how competitive I will be at higher lvls without spending money thou."
1532,This game is constantly expanding; I had all the cards early but its so expandable and quick to play that I anticipate it will remain a casual favourite for a while to come :)
1533,entertaining
1534,"i think is a cool game to kick back and just have some fun such as deck building, completing challenges, and playing as a team or solo against other Players."
1535,It's addicting and very fun!
1536,"enjoyable, been playing for an hour."
1537,I dont usually review games but this one deservers :) such a nice game to play
1538,Nice diversion
1539,"good fun game, doesn't mean anything since im new, wait til i get better"
1540,I am the master of minions.
1541,mmmmyes very good il ikethe game thanks you
1542,Simple explanation. Deploy your minions in battle.
1543,fun
1544,"Absolutely amazing deck builder/tower defence-ish game with 1v1 or 2v2 options to start off. 
The only issue with the game is the stalling of progression once you hit about 20-30 hours in, the crafting system is great for crafting decks you like, but this slows HEAVILY to encourage paying real money."
1545,"Enjoying this game, fun and exciting."
1546,Colossus Cum Guzzler
1547,fun niche coop game
1548,"I cannot recommend this game enough to all who like collectible card games. It is a refreshing take on the genre that plays excellently and has great dev support. I stress to all that are considering getting it to give it a crack, at the very least it will be a new experience."
1549,Good game

1566,"Good stuff, too lazy to write but it keeps me busy"

1568,Better than dying light well everything is better than that
1569,"FREE TO PLAY EQUALS PAY 2 WIN?

Yes indeed it is free to play [b]BUT[/b] you do not need to spend your money! In fact EVERY Card, Skin etc. is completely accessible through playtime. This is where Minion Masters is different from a lot of other P2W games. Of course you CAN spend your money to get specific cards faster and at the beginning you have no expensive and cool cards but as you progress - which happens quick - you certainly will and you can achieve good ranks without them anyways. Thus, I would not recommend spending money because it's expensive - In my opinion only spend money for the Pass or/and the Premium Upgrade.

Unfortunately the community seems not to be as big which is why there are not many guides to get started. Especially at the different events you have to be creative and develop your own decks and playstyles but that's where the fun comes from!

If you are looking for a good and fun TCG game please give Minion Masters a try!"
1570,"It is a very interesting game, and a great time killer. Matches are very short, mostly up to 5 minutes. There are tons of different cards with countless combos, so that make this game an endless exploration. Important fact is that this is NOT pay to win game even though it is free. You can unlock everything simply by playing."
1571,"Excellent game. Fast, fun and rewarding. Especially in co-op mode!
The developers work hard to include the player base in it's decision making process which is great.
My one criticism would be I miss some of the cheese strats when I first started playing which made the game more fun. Switching between vastly different decks and playstyles kept the game really fresh. To succeed at the higher levels at the moment, everyone seems to have a fairly similar vanilla deck which is a bit of a shame."
1572,loved this game for years
1573,.
1574,Fun game.
1575,sussy
1576,"i like ass
"
1577,"F2P. Same genre as Clash Royale, similar mechanics, give a try."
1578,Game crash too often . whats the point if the game is unplayable and it loses rank for you
1579,the game is great and will do well on mobile too
1580,had this game on my xobx and enjoyed it and its even better on my pc
1581,Fun.
1582,"game is nice =)

1583,Fun game to play now and then. Short games (<5 mins) and it requires some kind of strategy.
1584,super fun
1585,Its so much fun and easy to learn! I highly recommend this game.
1586,Fun little card game.

1597,It's fun
1598,"banned in chat until 2048 for calling out a chat mod and beating him in a 1v1... Would highly recommend.
PS was alot funner when it first released. all these tweaks to various minions kinda took the fun away. 536 hours in and still playing every now and then."
1599,"Straight Pay to Win just like on a mobile card game, ohh you want to just have all of the best cards max level? you can buy that with real life money.... Microtransactions ruined this game. we only made it to silver 3 ranked before we hit the pay to win wall. so unless you want to just spend a ton of money have fun losing every single game to people who do."
1600,Game is ok. Why doesn't it allow me to stream to my other device??? all other games on steam allow me to play in m living room from a server to my thin client... except this one.
1601,So much more fun than I expected! Really quick and exciting gameplay.
1602,"Very fun game! New content seems to be added often. Many others who play so usually pretty easy to get a match quickly. Most players are helpful, friendly, and patient. Lots of variety within the game. Many modes of gameplay. Overall I recommend to others!!"
1603,good game
1604,hahaha minion go brrrr
1605,Pretty fun and fast paced game once the game gets rolling. Multiple different cards and hero's to choose from.
1606,"10/10 
Nice Game 
"
1607,"Frantic, confusing but led by the hand if needed and as fun as hell. First cardy type game I have ever played and loving it."
1608,"So, you have to spend real money to get the best cards. In today's fatties-against-the-man, I'm surprised the ""biggest"" of the nerds are not up in a jiggle of impotent fury. To add to the ""pay to win"" method of this video game, there is an ACTUAL prize wheel you HAVE to use that doesn't even give you control of the wheel; the prize is predetermined when you click to start the wheel. Did I mention that prize wheel provides drops of the rare material you NEED to construct those ""best"" cards? 2000 of this material is required to START to get the best cards. You maybe get 15 at a time. I picked up this video game when it was actually free. I still feel ripped off.
Gambling for children, pay to win business structure. Do NOT support this video game. Denny Crane."
1609,nice game
1610,"Hands down the worst end of season collections screen of all time!!!! Been sitting here for 10 minutes clicking chests over and over and over and over again with no end in sight. CHANGE IT!!!!! Just do a ""claim all"" feature for the love of god."
1611,"You will either be facing bots or people with 3000 hours or dollars invested into the game. bots are an easy win and the latter is a guaranteed loss with no chance of winning whatsoever the winning side is always decided before the game even starts - absolute garbage, don't play it."
1612,Fun casual type game. Team mode is even more fun.
1613,It's a fun game.
1614,cool
1615,"ES BASTANTE INTERENSANTE Y ME GUSTA ESOS ESTILOS de juegos. mas no entiendo por que me dice que baje el juego original si ese fue lke que baje.

1617,Loving the game so far! A lot of potential for this game in the future!
1618,yes
1619,Amazing game and vert enjoyable <3
1620,This game turns a genre that I hate (mobas) into one that I can actually enjoy lol
1621,"all i can say is this game is trash, ranking systems is stupid pair a bronze 5 with silver, and there is a meta that can 100% block the other player from sumon is just stupid game design."
1622,Parádna oddychovka ;)

1630,"This is really enjoyable. It's quick to get you into the game, polished hand-holding to get you started, and nicely paced."
1631,This is great game
1632,is like clash royale for pc very good very good
1633,good game.think magic the gathering and clash royal

1644,"i actually played minion masters for a while and i enjoyed it, me and a friend started playing it but i really didnt like when the developers gotta cheat to beat me and a friend"
1645,op
1646,"This is just a really fun and simple game to pick up and play. Its all fairly straight forward, with even the most basic of strategies being viable in some way. there is also a team battle option, which i found immensely useful to learn about the game whilst also being alot of fun. the art style is very pleasing and the combat flows rather nicely, albeit a little hectic at times when your base is being rushed by 101 minions (exaggeration). oh, and theres absolutely no need to pay a cent to be competitive. ive spent a small amount myself, because i like supporting good games, but everything can be grinded for and earned in time. spending money on this game is more like a shortcut then anything. all in all, its a nice well rounded game with some interesting units and strategies in my opinion. plus its free.... what reason is there not to try it out"
1647,nice game similar to clash royal
1648,it's a good game
1649,so fun and  good
1650,"Fast and fun and free to play. Very strategy based, but you need to build up a decent collection of cards which will take a while or a decent chunk of money. Sometimes you just get countered by a cheese deck but every cheese deck has its own kryptonite so dont feel too bad about losing to them. If you have a good deck and play your cards well you can win almost any game. 
Pros - Its free and battles usually take <5 mins. 
        - It looks and sounds great.
        - Lots of variety and viable decks.
Cons - Starting out is a bit rough. 
         - Every season hard resets your rank so you have to grind quite a few games that are mostly stomps in low rank."
1651,69 like .. noice
1652,"This game is mediocre at best, can be fun to play a bit, but won't stay fun for long. It also sometimes gives you steam pop-ups, that forcefully go in front of all other windows, with steam right behind too. This is incredibly infuriating, and you have to remove the game from your library to make it stop."
1653,this game is addictive!
1654,FREE GAME WITH FREE DLC WHY NOT?
1655,!
1656,Very good.
1657,good

1662,Game good.
1663,"Kind of like if Nexus Wars, Squad TD, TFT, and StS had a baby. In other words: great. 

Love the attention to detail in the art and sound, really shows they went above and beyond to provide the same level of quality you'd expect from a AAA studio funding an indie game. An old concept with fresh ideas, great execution, team should be proud of what they've made!"
1664,its like chess but its interactive
1665,👍
1666,Fun game.  I like how it's not just what cards you have its how you play them too.  Isn't pay 2 win from what i can tell.  Works well with my potatoe internet too.
1667,Balanced game imo
1668,Great game! Love the card and art design.
1669,Honestly the best card strategy game ever made. And I have played quite a few games in this series but no game even comes close to Minion Masters. Excellent!
1670,So far the game is very fun
1671,fun
1672,It simple and fun to Play // Love the commentator
1673,It's really quite fun. I do recommend bringing a friend though.

1685,good game yes yes
1686,It's nice because so far I feel like I have an equal chance against players who spend money. It's a nice f2p game honestly I think you should try it out at least!

I then played for 4 and a half hours straight. Try it out! Very simple with a charming and funny presentation."

1696,Interesting and easy to play game
1697,its great
1698,"Mildly but consistently enjoyable. Good strategy, but not too deep. Slightly multitaskable in that I can also play OSRS during it or even occasionally Pokemon Go as well."

1705,Fun time!
1706,they asked me to write a review and i guess i'm havin a good time. i'm gonna go play more bye.
1707,Fun!!!!
1708,Honestly I don't really give reviews but I'm enjoying this game. It's like hearthstone with actual minions on the battlefield with strategic placement of each unit. ive only played like an hour though so take it for what it is.
1709,"Is fun Co-op spawn game

1710,Good F2P Elements
1711,I LOVE Minion Masters. But until they create a deck export function from the leaderboard I'm leaving a negative review to get their damn attention. I want to try out all kinds of new decks from the leaderboard but I have to screen shot it and scroll through pictures like a monkey and I'm so pissed about it it made me leave a negative review.
1712,This game is a fun and colorful card battler. The presentation is enjoyable.
1713,"Hidden gem, such good much wow :P"
1714,Non-invasive mobile gaming comes to desktop for free. Keep it up Devs!
1715,litty
1716,solid game.  Surprisingly simple and fun.  Similar to clash of kings.
1717,"This game and another finally got me out of my bad headspace and was what I needed to relax with tonight. It's fun and the fact that it is easy for me to play with  my disabilities, is a win as well. Keep in mind, I'm quite new and just  learning it, but I'm having fun so far and it allows building and modification; not crazy about the pay-to-grow model, but I never am with micro-transitions. I'm curious as to when I'll grok it and can start with the meta part of the game. For now, as I go and learn, I'll see how it holds up for me. All looks promising to me at this time though."
1718,fun game at times
1719,This is a fun game for short or long sessions.
1720,nha
1721,"It's been a very fun and positive experience playing this game with me friend, and coming up with decks and strategies to climb the ranks. For a free game this is a very high recommendation if you have a friend that you play card/strategy games with."
1722,i love super grindy p2w games so this is right up my alley. S+ 5 stars
1723,"Honestly, I was not expecting much of this game, not at all. Not even the slightest-tinniest-smallest bit, however this is actually a REALLY good version of a CARD game, I usually find card games like Heart Stone to end up being boring.. not much going on, but even though this is a card game, the game keeps you on your feet, and it keeps you administrating strategy in real time"
1724,"had fun for fortyish hours. wondering why I can't pull a ""coax"", lets try and craft one, seems like a good card. oh this game is pay to win, you have to purchase the season pass to access that card, enough of that game. I'm sure there's a more fair tug of war pvp game out there I just barely know the genre, gonna check out GUNS UP! next. the inclusion of stuff like adventure mode almost brings it to a neutral rating"
1725,"Minions master > Hearthstone
This game is pure gold, try it!"

1727,Great Game
1728,Great time killer
1729,"Fun simple game 
No need for a great computer and has good mechanics"
1730,Game is fun but 2v2 is rng. so basically have to play 1v1 or premade because 2v2 random is bad.
1731,Legendary spam
1732,Seems small at first but is actually very fun.
1733,you can also play it on mobile!
1734,The game is very fun if it loads

"
1740,It's really addictive lol
1741,you've gotta try it :)
1742,Minion Masters has had its ups and downs but overall is a fun game to kill the time.
1743,Awesome!
1744,:P
1745,honestly how do i have 51 hours on this?
1746,"I like the game very much, wish you can buy any avatar you want instead of waiting for them to offer ones you want in store though"
1747,"Recommend the game for 2v2s.
My partner and I were looking for a good cardgame to play together, but there are very limited options if we wanted to do anything beyond 1v1ing each other.

Along comes Minions Masters, a good cardgame that is not too p2w, but with one of the best and most developed 2v2 game modes.

The game is combination of tug-of-war style game play and card games, allowing for strong deck interactions that rely on communication and planning. It is easy to get into and very fun :) 

I would primarily reccomend this game to couples/people looking for 2v2s, the 1v1 mode is fine but there are better alteratives for 1v1 gameplay.

Overall, I highly recommend the game!"
1748,"Has gone way down hill.
I doubt it will get better.

Had the makings of a top 20 steam game."
1749,For Clash Royale users on PC
1750,Its a good game
1751,"This is a fun game and I normally would recommend it. But the rank system takes no account of your individual contributions, which is a major factor considering the number of players you get paired with who either outright leave the game or just don't play any cards. I've even had a teammate intentionally use cards to grief me. The system should be able to track when players play no cards and ban them from queueing for team events. The report system is worthless and the ranking system is too basic and poorly designed. Should they fix these issues, I'd be happy to edit my review. But it is a huge pair of black marks for anyone queueing for the team events."
1752,ES GOOD
1753,SUPER FUN AND EASY TO PLAY HARD TO MASTER
1754,Played for 30 mins i immediately dropped the game krazy game
1755,Better than Clash Royale!
1756,good game
1757,"Absolutely brilliant.  Quick battles, easy to understand, lots of giveaways, and currently has a growing player base. Opportunities to engage a streaming audience.  Provides real-time feedback as you play - your unit placement, unit-vs-unit strategies, and other decisions are rewarded or penalized in the moments you make them, allowing you to learn quickly from good plays / bad plays. In turn, you'll find high accountability for yourself.  ELO system is fair, and friends can be made on this one.  And you can't beat the price - FREE TO PLAY!  Even the DLC comes at no cost. Big recommend!"
1758,Really like this game so far.  Really freaking good.
1759,Such a buggy game don't bother.
1760,"they got rid of Wild Cards.
then only brought them back to the game type i strictly avoid, 2v2
can i have all the money i spent on this game back please?
ritual of servitude is dead. i spent countless hours saving shards to finally deck test with 3 of them in 1v1
but 1v1 doesn't get wild cards. i constantly am deck testing new decks almost after every match, and i stick to 1v1 for that so i dont flame a random for a terribad deck. please bring back Wild Cards to everyone"
1761,This game is like a father to me
1762,"Fun free, very competitive, but be warned, you can spend hours and not even realize it!"
1763,fun and fast paced. seems some cards are a little O.P.
1764,"If you are a new player and do not want to spend money without really getting into a new game you will have to grind a lot.
Previously we would get dev notes on updates each week. Now they at most come up in the client and link to their website.
On login, so once per start of the game. It is not a seperate page in the client.
They are also much less detailed. Or not there at all so we don't really know if a small new update that just happend fixed a problem or not.
Currently wildcards are disabled so getting a duplicate card as a new player just means that the deck can not be updated or expanded by doubling up on a card.
If you are a new player you will spend many hours to just get a decent cardpool and to figure out which commons to actually craft to extend your collection.
Oh and you will have to hope the random shop reshuffles show you the option for more deckslots at a discount. That requires premium currency, so more grinding.
Expect to empty out and rebuild decks a lot until then.
We used to get rewards in a different spread too, but now its more cards and less ressources to just make cards that you want.
The game can be fun, the devs may just be taking a break from communicating with their playerbase but currently this is a ""can not recommed unless you spend money or grind a ton"".
As a new player you should not spend hard won rubies on anything but adventures and deckslots. Which are somehow free for the old ones currently. The devs just didnt actually tell anyone in the community on steam outside the connect info screen..."
1765,Quick match longest match to date is 10 mins average match lasts 4 mins
1766,"For a free to play game, this is easily one of the most relaxed AND fun games I've played."
1767,Fun for a free to play game. Takes a bit of grinding to make a versatile deck. Wayyyyy too much grinding against bots before you play against players.
1768,good
1769,Fun and casual game.
1770,ok
1771,"There are only two things bad about Minion Masters.

2) ""Stop Spamming!"""

1775,"YES

1782,"Didn't really expect to like this game so much.  However, from the beginning, it eases you into a very fun take on this genre.  I for one am extremely pleased so far!  Ty devs for putting in the time.  I'd say give this game a try."
1783,I really enjoy this game. Its great fun and has lots going for it. It can be annoying to get bad teammates but that goes for any game with team mates
1784,Nope
1785,"A good distraction when waiting on loading screens for other games. Matches are short to around 3-5 minutes for solo, 6-12 minutes for duo. I have not played pre-made games, so I have no info on those games. There is a Draft mode and an Adventure mode similar to Heartstones modes. Mainly played this when waiting for Dead by Daylight matches, so my real played time is probably half of what is shown."
1786,"If it was 2 years ago, would recommend this game. But now, it is a literal mess. The more update the more worse it gets.
You will play against many players who happen to use the exact same deck and strategy. And you can't do anything about it except playing like them, or you will be losing most of the time. No more room for your creativity."
1787,good free game
1788,"Amazing game! fast paced (games are usually 2-5min), playing only f2p you will get enough cards to heavily modify and eventually create your own decks. 
Devs are very open to feedback and are making changes based on preferences from community"
1789,me likey
1790,Best Card Game ever. Lots of fun !!!!
1791,"Easy to learn hard to master. Variety, combos, replay ability. Seemed a tad corny at first, but give it a chance. Announcer dude is great. Way beyond a deck building game, really brings things to life in live action. Manage your mana, manage your minions and be the Minion Master! Enjoy."
1792,e
1793,"Minion Masters is a free-to-play strategic minion brawler from Danish developer Betadwarf. Minion Masters offers players one verse one or two verse two competition taking place in small arenas. Players choose between different Masters with unique hero abilities. They then use these masters to summon collectible minions to the field. Once they’re on the field, it’s pretty much up to them what they’re going to do, so choose carefully.

Minion Masters offers several modes, standard one verse one and two verse two, one verse one draft, mayhem, expeditions, and solo challenges. In one verse one draft, players build their deck from a random selection of cards. During this mode, three loses means the player is out of the game. Mayhem offers different rules every week. Expeditions are the game’s story mode. And solo challenges allow players to practice against the game’s AI.

To progress in the game, players will need to learn how to utilize their masters as well as unlock or craft an increasing number of minions and spells.

Minion Masters promises nearly constant new content, with the developers adding new things all the time, including events and cosmetics. 

Minion Masters taps into an unused format seen in free to play titles, let alone gaming itself. A combination of charming characters, visually appealing graphics and an addictive progression system weave together to present a game you won’t want to miss."
1794,love it
1795,very nice
1796,Real fun to start off with so far
1797,"Before I played this i had a big penis, two girlfriends and a lot of will to live. None of these things have changed, so I have no idea if this game is good."
1798,"Just started playing and I got season pass.  Beat my first opponents 10/10, beat thru hard challenge so far and won first team pug random battle.

Ended up buying premium cuz its one-time permanent bonuses!

So far I like it, but can be frustrating.  Even though i never lost even one match, challenge or tourney match.

Too early to really give a 100% review, but so far I would give it a 7/10....just because they ask you to give a review too early in your experience of the game...WAY TOO EARLY!!!

1805,"A better clash royale that I still have no interest in playing! I was an early supporter but unfortunately, not an early enjoy-er."
1806,"I love playing this game, but it has horrible optimalization, it has broken down my previous PC (I was hoping it was accidental) and yesterday it crashed my PC 5 times, no problems with other games that use more resources, only with Minion Masters. Also - I hate that wild cards got removed, game seems boring now. I will be taking a break and wait for better times hwich means better optimalization."
1807,A fun game. I like the deckbuilding aspect and appreciate the fast progression system :)
1808,"Minion Master is a deck builder strategy game where you use your army to defeat your enemies in a 1v1 or 2v2 game with over 200 cards to play with from monsters to spells.

Difficulty- depends on who you are against
Story- not really a story
Game time- it's depends on how many games you wanna play

1809,a fun quick game
1810, clash royale but better.
1811,This game is a very good take on this style of game im obsessed. Please add more
1812,"Welcome to spam-fest!

Quite generally it's a pretty fun game and I sunk many many hours into it. However lately, the meta of the game seems to be to just spam the opponent with countless minions, without the other player ever having the chance to recover, not to mention counter.

Usually you were able to counter the dominant strategies within the game accordingly, but lately this has become almost impossible - as long as your opponent doesn't commit any major errors in his routine. From a certain rank and up, this current meta has taken any gameplay variation out of the game - everyone is just spamming.

Cannot recommend it currently, as it's painfully imbalanced and frustrating to a point beyond which I'm willing to put my freetime into a game."
1813,"Heroes of might and magic meets clash royale. But with less pay to win bullcrap that exists in clash. yes they sell cards, but you don't get rewards that make them stronger from infinite money investment (and you can earn cards in this game via in-game currency, the shop and some patience). It's a true strategy game with light pay to win elements. 

You can buy every master from now until eternity with one of the bonuses for a reasonable price.

Cards don't rank up. Yes getting extra copies of a card increases your glory, making it easier to earn the current season rewards, but as soon as you get a card, you're done and you have it for all your decks (i guess getting a certain level allows you to have multiple copies in a deck as well, but I don't feel the need to pack my decks with multiple copies). It's a true collectable strategy game without the infinite power grinds I've seen in so many other similar games -> clash royale, magic:legends, and other games I've played with card mechanics. 

The match length is also great -> usually 5-6 minutes, rarely goes over for me. 

I've been doing pretty good on my F2P account so far. I haven't invested anything and my win rate feels good. Granted I looked up good strats for the starter master, but it seems to work. Normally I'd expect the starter hero to be garbage in a game where you can pay for more."
1814,gud game
1815,"Cards and RTS, Nice!"
1816,good game
1817,"Quick matches invite new players to experiment with new decks without the frustration of wasting long amounts of time. This is also why I have spent more time than I thought in front of my screen playing! Quick matches that are full of fun and strategy, whether alone or with a friend, makes the hours FLY by!"
1818,yes
1819,Weird nerfs to things that weren't even strong.  unfun changes to duo play.
1820,The real time strategy elements mixed with the deck building make this a pretty fun game.
1821,"It's Clash Royale on PC but with cooler animations and not P2W. 
Well played!"
1822,Initial game play is very enjoyable. Not enough time playing to see if monetization is bad yet.
1823,Will happily take your money for cards you then cannot play because they disabled them.
1824,I've been playing this game and its been alright. Tried to play the game mode mayhem; except for the past two weeks theres been an error 1-1. I went to report a bug and it failed to report it. Really unhappy with how this has been handled.
1825,Game is dead played the same people 4 times in a row and I am barely in Diamond
1826,"Bruh, No Wild Cards, DUMB! Ya know you can just put a cap on each minion right?"
1827,Great game. Not as good as when Wild cards were available.
1828,"What could have been a genuinely fun card game has been ruined by the dev team. I used to absolutely adore this game but after their constant incompetence to make changes that don't piss off the whole playerbase they've made it clear that they just want this game to die. 

This game has gotten into the habit of removing features and then not adding anything new to the table. The final nail in the coffin for me was removing wild cards which invalidated a lot of fun decks to play since you could have some creative freedoms and cover the weaknesses of your build with a couple of the same removal spell or further bolster pushes with an extra warrior or something. I'm extremely disappointed in their dev team for making such idiotic changes. 

There is absolutely NO casual play. Everything you do impacts your ranked status and playing for fun is a thing of the past. Only purchase this game if you're looking to be competitive. (However that this point you're better off with hearthstone or Clash Royale, which are not only also free, but better)

Normally I'd try to look on the advantages this game has at the end of my review, but it just has nothing to offer to the table anymore after they've removed everything interesting about the game. I'm sorely disappointed. 

Conclusively, this game just isn't what it used to be. There is no hoping to bring back the past, so what this game had is now gone forever. I wouldn't even recommend you download it just to see if it's for you. This game has nothing to offer you."
1829,fun and easy to play. i like it
1830,Fun game with great animation and a good progression system.
1831,That is good
1832,Great game
1833,Noice game
1834,"The game's numbers are lower than ever, and yet the game's closer to healthy than it's been in years.

Felt like the right time to write this review.

This game starts with a premise that is rock-solid, an addictive concept that keeps you coming back. 

Yet with that solid foundation, the game has been mismanaged by a small team of developers that have put roughly a year and a half of tone-deaf blunders into their game.

Fast-forward to today, and the game has received 2 to 3 patches that have turned the game upside-down in ways that no one expected, and few have been able to properly keep up with. You could call them growing pains, as the development team is finally starting to realize many of their mistakes and slowly learning to listen to their Discord community.

Is it too little too late? For now, it kind of looks that way. A lot has been sacrificed to make the game ""accessible"" on a mobile version that never seems to arrive, and all the while players have just kept leaving and leaving, being replaced with more casual players that just seem to use the game to wind down after their 9 to 5.

But now, with the most recent changes, wild cards have been temporarily removed, and the casual audience has been sent running to the hills.

I'll go ahead and say it, if you left because wild cards were temporarily removed, you're a scrub, and good riddance to you. I'm sure there are thousands of options here on Steam that can please your short attention span without this game needing to be sacrificed for your sake. 

On the other hand, if you're one of the hundreds of players that left because wild cards were ruining your experience, now is the time to come back and prove that they were the worse part of this game. The devs have extended an olive branch (despite most players preferring wild cards), and you need to take that advantage and run with it.

To wrap this up, my main message is this: The developers have offered us a rare opportunity to play the game without wild cards for one to two months at minimum. If you ever liked this game, you can help things stay this way by coming back and rewarding the devs for their attempt to reconcile with the more competitive half of the community. If the player numbers keep going down, wild cards are coming back and the game will be just as it used to be. So get on it guys.

[b] IT'S TIME TO SAVE MINION MASTERS"
1835,"As far as free to plays go, this has an awesome economy. Very fun, very colorful."
1836,"This used to be one of my favourite causal games - there was always some spare time to have some fun by experimenting with creative decks and test them in short fun fights. 

But since about a year the Devs are struggling to have a clear vision about the game and its future and how to monetise it in a ""better"" way; so they startet aimless changes / nerfs / buffs - all over the place with only one consistency: ""Ignore the player base at all cost""...
(Instead they listen to the 0,1% TTV players on Discord playing in Contender / Grandmaster  - thats for sure the majority of the player base ;) )

From fun f2p with some time- shortcuts or cosmetic stuff for real money (and I get it - Devs have to make their livings from it), we now have seasonal cards behind a pay wall which are kind of OP until the next season when the next ""OP"" cards are released and the cards from the previous season getting nerfed. You can't even invest time instead of real money - there is no option to get hand of this cards while they are good without paying. So if you invest any money the benefits will not last long and to show you how the dev team treats their paying customers check this out:

In the last Update the whole wildcard system was removed. This feature allowed players to put the exactly same card multiple times in their decks. This system had a lot of problems for sure (at least it was a counter to the OP season cards in some way) and needed a lot of tweaking and changes but it was in the game for month so people started to build decks around it and the Devs even promoted this sh** with special offers for multiple copies of one card and now these copies are really worthless! I saw people on Twitch and reddit spending hundreds of dollars for rubies to get more cards to use them with the wildcard system.

I feel really sorry for all those players spending hours (and sometimes even a lot of real money) to collect multiple copies of some cards so for me THAT'S the icing on the cake and shows me the mind state of the devs.

So what?! ...the game is just boring now - matchmaking is really bad (probably too many players left already) and as always - Devs couldn't care less... 

So do I - game ""lives"" now in the ""Hidden Games"""
1837,pretty fun and easy to get into
1838,it's really nice with all the surprise card combos u can do
1839,"Well at first when i got it, it was a replacement for clash of clan royal then a few months past i get a few things for my wife cause she is a pro league diamond league pro. but then even after i spent money on this game. I get hit with a pay wall tp finish a chapter on the single player comp ok whatever let that slide then it got ot he point were i couldn't level or be competitive with out dropping cash i already dropped this game is a money racket....ok if YOU dont believe me look at how many reviews i have given..........like one and look at how may years i have been a member of steam every since arma 2 and the day z mod so quite a while without a review that makes my validity flawless it yo dont take my word for it then you will see when you play through the single played which isnt that god and get hit with a pay to continue BAD DECISION."
1840,"Great game,
good graphics"
1841,"A poorly made game that regularly freezes meaning you lose matches because you're unable to play for 10 seconds at a time.

The balancing of the game is terrible, there's Master's and cards that have been overpowered for months that they refuse to nerf and end up nerfing cards that actually deal with the overpowered cards and Master's.

I know balancing a game isn't easy, but if a card or Master is in 70% of matches you would think the dev's would actually do something about it but nope. Blizzard levels of balancing honestly.

Report and feedback doesn't work so there is literally no way the community can have imput on this game.

Game has quite a few hackers at the higher end of the ranking system, people who are able to constantly spam out 4 mana minions, without mana frenzy and xp hacks"
1842,"very well put together monster card game, i find it very fun to pass the time. i just wish their multiplayer was more user friendly'
"
1843,"It's fun. Team play is a little shite. Mana frenzy normally saves the other team more than half the time. It's pretty much hose***. I hardly ever play solo, but I guess I should more often. If you like spells... FUKK YOU. Devs will absolutely destroy any spell they put in the game. They nerf a lot which makes a lot of cards just suck. Decks are pretty easy to build. Team and solo need different builds for a better experience. I've put some time into it and I'll put more. I just wish spells were better and that devs would buff other cards rather than nerfing everything. It makes for a poor experience. 

On another note, It's an absolute blast in the beginning. In lower levels you will probably stomp if you are halfway competent. Higher levels are still fun, but expect to lose about half the time unless the opposition is just shite. 

You don't need legendary cards to win. It's about timing, deck building, and ultimately strategy. You won't be able to win every game. Some people just have a hard counter to whatever you do with some deck builds. Get to know the cards and try different things. Team play is probably a little more forgiving in some respects if your teammate is decent. 

It's free so it's definitely worth a go to see if it's the beads you like to plunge deep into your anus. If not you can always pull them out and uninstall. 

P.S. I LOVE YOU :3"
1844,Fun Game a friend of mine recommended it to me and i am glad I would recommend this to any hearthstone player or Clash of Royale player fun and entertaining so far.
1845,"Nothing against the game itself (although it is fairly scuffed and reminds me of something you'd see coming out of Hi-Rez), but against the studio.

Here's part of the blurb under the internship section of their website:
(https://www.betadwarf.com/career)

""We treat our interns as regulars on the team from the get go, you will be doing real work that has a high likelihood of ending up in game. As such, we hold our interns to the same high standards as everyone else in the company, so it's important that you are passionate about working on games. Internships are unpaid. We require all internships to be at least 3 months in length.""

Seems very odd and disrespectful to say ""we treat interns as regulars,"" and then go on to say ""internships are unpaid."" To me that reads like they just want long-term free work from people who think this is a good ""in"" to the industry. Pretty gross, and the game itself isn't even good, so it's not like wasting 3 months of your life doing QA here is going to be resume gold or something. Especially considering you'd be working for a company so unsuccessful they can't even afford to pay QA testers minimum wage."
1846,Devs have been consistently nerfing cards and perks for some time now. Wildcards have now been removed and I'm done playing the game.
1847,"its really good. i dont even like these types of games tbh, but i do recommend it to others."
1848,"Criminally underrated amazing game. 1v1 or 2v2 battle arena, where you summon minions to attack each other's masters - who they themselves are dif chars with dif skills and upgrades.  And of course skins!

Would highly recommend to everyone who's into dota/Lol/the modern spinoffs, for a faster, more explosive and fun experience.  It's similar to clash of clans / clash royal but much more fun, and 3d. Also no grinding of millions of resources. There's just daily quests and gold, and season pass content (pay to unlock more bonuses). Fairly generous to f2p players with new sample content launches being generally free.

There are viable strats for higher rankings using basically any cards and there are tons of combos. Can specialize in thicc boys and defend them while they crush, can spam little guys whose collective dps is sky high, and everything in between. Ranged flying mobs are not common for a reason - they'd be hella strong. 

I'd love to see this game get to 10k monthly players! It's definitely worth trying (FREE and FAST). 
The skill cap, as well as resources (cards/masters) is high if you get into it and get to plat or above! But it's still fun and winnable at low ladder."
1849,"sheeesh
"
1850,Nah. 4/10
1851,"This is a very good game, you dont need to spend money on it and its easy to learn and hard to master."
1852,very fun game clash royale simularity
1853,donate rubbish! Absolutely not recommend! Just waste of time!
1854,"As far as free to play games go, I find this one the least offensive.
With free dlc released almost constantly and free codes everywhere on the net for cards and ingame currency, it feels almost like a treasure hunt looking for this stuff outside the game.

Said game is an enjoyable tug of war type game where you summon units who move across the battlefield to destroy your enemy. Seems pretty straight forwards but high level play is well... high level for a reason.
In all my time playing, I've never had a problem finding a game and the best part is the coop.
Trust me, this is a good game. Give it a go, it's literally free to play.

Watch my review here:
https://youtu.be/HFhSBzLW7aU"
1855,This game is a great free game based on skill and luck sometimes games end very fast because you and or your team will have the correct card combination. This game can also be very frustrating but that's what keeps a game fun and challenging.
1856,Simple and fun time waster
1857,shitty F2P pay to win garbage
1858,It's really slick. It plays really really well.
1859,yes xD
1860,Fun
1861,its fun
1862,awsum
1863,"really recommended game, even your not top up for this game you can still survive for competitive or aim the leaderboard.. f2p and not p2w"
1864,I like it. quick and fun
1865,ok
1866,nice one
1867,Solid game thus far. I enjoy the fantasy elements and the diversity of units this game has to offer. Overall would be even better if I had friends to play with. QQ
1868,Non stop random tandem droppen in bad guys.
1869,"This game was one of my favorites for quite a while, but after the last few patches, I just don't enjoy the game anymore.  Lots of bugs getting introduced, significant changes to how cards work, and then finally this most recent one, removing the wildcard mechanic from the game.
For me, this meant every deck I own cannot be played.  When faced with the decision of rebuilding every deck in a game I am enjoying less and less with each patch and quitting, I chose being done with this one."
1870,it's been fun
1871,"Enjoying the Team Battles. Fun to play with teams. I think the game would be boring otherwise, not going to lie. But great game!"
1872,"Wild Cards removed after years of being in.
Don't spend a dime on this ip. You'll appreciate it more than they appreciate their paying customers."
1873,"coop, free, gives a lot of stuff for u doing almost nothing so basically very rewarding and very fun"
1874,"Hack, Slash, Repeat. 
Click click click
Open chest. Open chest. 
But stuff! Buy stuff! Buy Stuff!"
1875,This game is fun and interesting ..
1876,Pretty good.
1877,"Update ruined the game, was fun but not any more."
1878,Disconnecting from game too much.
1879,"This game used to be a fun time waster but somehow the devs are making it worse with each patch. It's almost like they purposely want to kill their own game. Basically if there's anything that's remotely fun, it's gonna get nerved or down right removed."
1880,"One of the great things about the game is that lately, every new expansion has been made free for a limited time. If you get the expansion while it's 100% off in store, you get some nice freebies. Eventually, you can get a good bit of cards and build them up.

The combat is very PvP but is simple and well oriented toward finding great card combos, balancing mana cost among your deck, and bringing a nice bit of competitiveness to the game.

It's definitely worth the price if you can nab it on discount during a sale."
1881,"Fast   , short games"
1882,fun
1883,Can confirm.  Game is fun.
1884,"worst update ever, they ruined the game.
gonna uninstall and look for an other game to play."
1885,"Great game, blows my mind that its free!"
1886,"Terrible changes that made everyone leave, screw you guys."
1887,"fast, familiar, but different enough. will keep playing"
1888,please stop nerf-ing accursed
1889,This new expansion is trash I spent a lot of shards on cards to wildcard them for no reason and they did'nt even remove them from the game yet. I really wasn't a big fan of the last patch but I figured id give it one more shot but they blew it. Another great game goes down the toilet. Alt - F4 and uninstall.
1890,amazing
1891,"(edit - With near double the playtime after disliking the game on the positive side, it's BadAsAFish80's fault for fueling my addiction to this game going I fully blame him for having a fun and funny stream with an animated community to further this dark pull to play just another few games and try a few more decks and then a few more and then what if I used nothing but monkeys and...you get the point.) 

I don't even know what to say, the latest update ruined half the fun, removing wildcards...meaning no more stacking the same card up to 3 times - which really isn't unbalanced. but the main reason I'm giving one of my favorite little games a no is due to the lack of innovation with any of the cards. Nerfing a card makes sense if too many people complain about it - but who wants to play a game after most if not all cards have been nerfed so that there's no advantage to playing them anymore? What kind of logic is that? There's no counter to the nerf, hardly any mechanical changes, the units are less cost effective and the scale of bigger units has also been nerfed into the ground. This is just nerf masters now - getting to master again seems pointless and even if the game is saved, the community is pretty unhappy and that's enough for me to lose interest. The worst part is the expensive in game item shop - these are blatant cash grabs and heavily influence what cards you can get when. The mobile trap is strong within this one and I'm kinda hoping this game crashes even harder just so the developers can learn a lesson about cutting content without putting any effort or forethought into anything but ""Weaken stats of most complained things!"" Son, I'm disappoint. Oh well, it was dam fun while it lasted. *grabs nerfed tissue that only has 1/4 of its original volume that falls apart mid use* I'm out!"
1892,"Was great.
But so much balancing from ppl that don't understand the game ruined it for me.
Make a test server to run new balances."
1893,"Great game, very addictive!
"
1894,"there are many positives to this game. however, ill advise a few things first. dont go so heavy into this game. while there may be mayhem and all these other modes, its only fun once in a while, personally i dont really go into those other modes myself. ill give it a go once in a while but honestly when i get down to it. the only benefits in terms of seeing yourself grow stronger/better comes down to luck and persistence. in just about every time i get 1000 gold which is needed to possibly get another card. i go for it. i dont tend to get the things at the first page of the store or save up my gold cause its almost pointless. 
ill say this, one of the reasons for my successes in the game, is due to free dlc and twitch prime. i was able to get good amount of good cards from that. there are special deals that are very good to take advantage of when its offered, so pay some attention to that. then there's the once in a while code that is offered through email, which is a good idea to do as well. id say that by my 50? maybe 40 hour mark, taking advantage of i believe 2 maybe 3 free dlc and codes, i was able to get about half the cards in the game at that time and i think i still have about half as of writing this."
1895,"If the minions are on the field and the masters are the ones controlling them, then I'm definitely a slave to to this game."
1896,"I like the developer, but I don't like this type of game. Got boring fast. 

4/10, at least it was free."
1897,Instead of content you get a month long battle pass and a bunch of balance 'fixes'. Zoomers will enjoy this game now.
1898,nice!

[h2]Minion Masters Review[/h2]

Minion Masters is a fast-paced online battle game developed & published by BetaDwarf. After an early access period of roughly two years, Minion Masters released on 24 May 2019 as a free-to-play game for Windows on Steam, Discord and Xbox One. The game is a hybrid of Deckbuilding & Tower-Defense.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
MM has a relatively straightforward premise for its core gameplay & mechanics. It’s insanely simple but challenging to master both for competitive and casual players. The game features online 1v1 or 2v2 duels along with full cross-play between all the platforms.
In the gameplay, you are a master who summons their minions from a deck of 10 cards to do battles across a field and capture and hold two bridges. Your goal & objective is to destroy the rival master by bringing your opponent’s health down to 0. You can unlock up to ten masters & get to choose between them; each with their special perks & unique abilities. The player also can collect 200+ fierce demons/cards and spells to aid in the battle. Spells can change the tide of the battle with healing, stuns or mind control effects which can prove devastating when used skilfully.

However, Minions have a mind of their own, so when they are summoned, they can no longer be controlled, so placing them wisely on the field is a must. Minions also have unique abilities such as mana regen, flying, teleportation, healing, and many more. Hence building your deck around your master is also a crucial part of Minion Masters as each minion card utilizes 0 - 10 Mana which refills over time.
Apart from that, you can embark solo adventures in different ages and continents. There is a story mode called The Quest for Mountainshaper where the protagonist goes on an epic quest to obtain a mystical artefact called the Mountainshaper. It introduces five different playable Masters, a new mechanic called Revelry, unique boss-fights, and after finishing the chapters, the players will also get access to more challenging hard mode. The story mode is rewarding as well as letting players earn XP, Power Tokens, exclusive Avatars or even a Legendary Card!
The game also features a battle pass purchasable through an in-game currency called rubies or with real money. MM also has a lot of community features, competitive scene & events such as challenges, friend events, tournaments, etc. and developers keep adding new bonus quests and modes actively as well.

[h1]Game Modes:[/h1]
1v1 – fight solo against other players and hone your skills in the leaderboard.
2v2 – tag along with a friend or queue up with a stranger and take down the enemy duo in this mode. Double the minions, double the fun!
Adventure – the single-player story mode with a different deck and combos with epic boss fights
Draft, Mayhem, Expeditions and Challenges – these are various game modes with a variety of rules and challenges pitted against AI. In Draft, you play with a random deck of cards with increasing difficulty while Mayhem’s rules keep changing every week. 

[h1]Review:[/h1]
The game is the more complex equivalent of the mobile game Clash Royale with even greater fun, colourful graphics and an endless number of strategies to experiment with. The game is merely addictive but needs more game modes; and since the game has a F2P model, there are extra DLCs & a lot of microtransactions as well in the form of loot boxes. However, developers are very proactive listening to the community, keeping the game balanced and fair, without forcing you to spend a dime, and I’m sure in future the game will receive major updates as well to keep the game more balanced and engaging. Overall a very impressive and one of the best F2P games of this generation with a healthy community & compelling gameplay. The game is free! Why are you waiting? Go ahead and try it out yourself!

Rating: 9/10"
1900,"This game is malware, it makes your computer do things it shouldn't. In ONE GAME I managed to get the blue screen of death which restarted my computer. I have NEVER had the blue screen of death before on my computer.  Logged back into the same match and then got a server timeout (my internet started working again after I closed out the game). Coincidence? I think NOT!"
1901,"I played Minion Masters for quite some time, sadly the last patches ruined the game for me. I got every card and season pass so far but i will stop to support them. They made a decision against the majority of players and removed wild cards. And because they did not want to be called ""Spell Masters"" they made said spells more expensive to play but also decreased the time for mana generation. This results in ridiculous spams of minions which you can't really stop because hey the spells are more expensive. This removed a lot of tactial depth from the game because it is much faster now you can't think much about what to play next you need to react fast. Have fun playing ""Spam Masters"" I am out."
1902,Fun. Pretty addicting.
1903,very nice game but u need to keep ur nervs away
1904,fun game. pretty chill. Better than hearthstone. enjoy the real time combat play from cards played
1905,Just like Clash Royale :)
1906,"Fun game.
EDIT: Until newest patch removed wildcards essentially making draw chances exact same across the board removing my synergy the way I configure my decks. To my understanding there are a few players who didn't like the option that in no way was forced on them. I might just stop playing on Steam and play on mobile which is better with some card/character designs for now at least."
1907,Well crafted card game. This is the most fun I've had on a card game in a very long time!
1908,great game
1909,it's good
1910,"Nice Artwork. Was interesting for the first few hours but then bored me out quickly, although fighting was entertaining. The main screen was too convoluted for my taste and I was annoyed by the In Game offers. There seems to be an active community in this game. At least, my guild chat was brimming with messages. Probably not a bad game if you are into such kind of games, but all in all not my cup of tea."
1911,gooods
1912,"Fun for a free to play game, heroes seem balanced and paying only get you cards a bit faster than free to play."
1913,Great free game. Fun to watch the cards come to life and battle each other.
1914,Great game!

1917,no thanks. just like every other of its ilk. heres just enough to make you think were different bam pay wall or grind.  these games are really only for rich sweaters

AND THE BEST PART IS ITS FREE XD

1920,This game is fun until they ruin cards that never needed changing while leaving broken cards to remain broken. Used to be a fun game but its not anymore
1921,"good quick play game

"
1922,Surprisingly good game
1923,it fun an make me chuckle
1924,It good.
1925,"This game is fun, I wish i found out about it sooner. The combat is both frantic and calculated, and matches usually last 3 minutes or less, which is perfect for anyone who has too little time to sit down for LOL or DOTA or any other moba. The Masters look and feel unique, each with their own play style, and the Minions are all pretty cool too."

1927,"Simple, fun. (the main screen is a bit distracting with all the various crap...  hard to figure how ..or what to do there... just hit battle or make decks is all i  know."

1929,Good card game to play with a friend.
1930,gg
1931,Mobile game money grubbing tactics. Avoid
1932,"editing review because the last one was cringe

this game is still garbage though"
1933,"Kind of mindless but also kind of fun.
Has some waifus.
Needs more waifus.
People don't seem to like playing team battles, so it's annoying when you need to fight one to complete a 'quest'."
1934,Nice
1935,sax game penchod
1936,Brilliant Free Game
1937,"Not the type of games I enjoy playing, but I can see where the fun (and addiction) lies in this one. It is a weird blend of Hearthstone and tower defense games.

It has a very smooth learning curve, making it highly accessible, but also offers a fair amount of strategy and card combinations to experiment with, that can entertain both new and experienced players alike.

Also, the monetization does not appear to be too aggressive, so you can have some fun without paying any money. I have not played enough to really be able to distinguish money traps though.

Overall an interesting experience, and since it is free, you lose nothing giving it a try if Hearthstone+TD sounds interesting to you."
1938,"Best game in 2020, then they changed too much in 2021, no recommendation anymore"
1939,"(TLDR near bottom! Sorry for length - serious reviews get this way)
So out of the 300+ games in my library only about 2(?) have brought me to the point of, ""leaving a review"" - not because I just don't care enough to review a game.. nono, quite the opposite actually - it's because these games had nothing needing to be reviewed. If it's a good game, leave a comment - not a review saying, ""Yes - this game plays like game"".

But let's get to it shall we? ~
If you would like to skip the whole, ""I wonder how it's going to be?! I'm so excited!"" experience - let me tell you what to expect when you download and install this game. (Please note: This review is intended as constructive criticism, especially after about 90 or so wasted hours of gameplay, I have reached the conclusion that this game should be re-classified as, ""Early Access"". (Since it doesn't meet most of the requirements that would otherwise classify it as a fully playable release))


So far, from my experience: 

(1) Matches range anywhere from 20 seconds -> ~5 minutes (<- These 5 minute games are REALLY RARE, but I just had one yesterday so.. yeah - 5 or so max, maybe more if you're very lucky and can get into a team battle with the only 3 other good players in this entire game!~ ahaha)(yes, even in gold and plat, which are surprisingly low ranks in this game when all things are considered!?)
(2) The tutorial will teach you EXACTLY how to play the game.. From my experience though, every player just ignores this part of the game - I mean, except maybe those 3 good players I mentioned earlier.. they most likely paid attention to it - The rest just helplessly flail around and should probably go back to, ""learning how to pay attention & follow instructions"". Honestly, sometimes i'm surprised they were able to beat the tutorial in the first place..
(3) You get 1 emoji to express yourself.. and since everyone plays like apes using a keyboard for the first time it's REALLY a hindrance to the fun that could be had in this game - there is also NO in-game chat for communication besides in the main menu, which is useless cause no one uses it for actual communication really - it's mostly just flooded with kids talking about the memes they saw on their dads iphone today. Not to mention the emoji's range from a smiley face, to a smiley tongue face, to a monkey with a smiley face, and then another smiley tongue monkey face, - and oh, I almost forgot the not so smiley - but still kinda smiley - smiley face with a mask on!! The variety of human emotions they have included in this game blows one's mind - but yeah.. i guess it's not all happy smiley faces kids, atleast there's that 1 angry face thrown in there.. which is coincidentally the only useful face in this game~ Especially when it comes to communicating with your ape in team battles. Toss an angry face in with 1 or 2 green thumbs ups and you can tell them, ""you should go back and play the tutorial if you're playing like this in platinum :D"" - instead of just.. typing it out like a normal human would.
(4) Best for last: None of the cards have been balanced** - or have been attempted to be balanced. - Get this, there's this one card, a flying dude - that spawns a MASSIVE BIG OL' SPEAR, and then CHUCKS IT at a target.. right?.. then there's this other guy who has a whip and SMACKS the ground with it instead! (AOE) - they have the SAME DAMAGE yet the one who should have a faster attack speed (the spear guy) instead has the attack speed of, ""restart your HDD, reconnect to the match and i'll either be dead or half way through my attack animation"" while the other (the whip guy) has, ""Don't blink or you'll miss me winning the match for you cause i can even out-range most towers that counter me""

But I should digress here, shouldn't I - 
Give us a way to communicate and call eachother names - this game has blood in it as an option.. why can't I tell someone, ""you shouldn't have this game installed"" if they only queue matches up to troll others via a toggle option aswell? (like, team chat toggle/all chat toggle or something!)
PLEASE hire a balancing team - I appreciate the wide variety of cards, but if none of them get balanced, you'll end up having to continue paying for fake reviews to get your game this far~ Remember!! Quality over Quantity! That's what gamers want! 
(Honestly, i just looked at it too - most, if not all of the positive reviews are from people who have played less than 100 hours on record! The one that literally reads, ""Cool developers"" has only 90 hours in total!! Ahahaha sorry, i just noticed this!!)

Sorry sorry,
I'm gonna leave it there - I left a TLDR below for those of you wanting to, ""Get to the point of the review"" - but at this point you don't need it.. aha
All the best,
Sincerely,
A truly tired gamer begging for the slightest bit of balance!


TLDR: 
Wait until this game is out of Early Access imho - The game just isn't balanced enough to be considered complete.


**: I REALLY want to clarify here because some of you will most likely misunderstand & I don't want one of my only directly critical & serious reviews to be misunderstood in a ridiculous way - But yeah, as I said, NONE of the cards are balanced, and no I did not mean SOME, or a FEW, I meant None. BetaDwarf's balancing team is either very small (like 1-2 people TOPS), which would make a lot of sense considering the state of the cards currently. They are probably just flooded with work and overburdened by the lack of interest the team leaders actually show/have for the playability of this great game - OR - they just don't have one all together to cut costs.
I want to believe it's neither of these but after 90 or so hours of unrepayable lost time trying to prove myself wrong, this is the only conclusion that seems to make a lick of sense.. If you think of it logically - if this game went through a balancing process, games would PROBABLY last longer than 30 seconds minimum..  

Ps. For those of you who don't care for balance though, there is currently a sweet spot for a guaranteed win! I have yet to perfect it but I've proven it's existence in 7/10 of my most recent games & can reproduce it if I time things right.. but If you spawn a set of units at a specific spot on your side of the map when you are getting rushed, you will reach a point where those minions will not die (due to their unbalanced stats & dmg assistance from tower) inevitably placing you and your ape into a position where your mana gets replenished while your opponent's just drains as they spawn creatures attempting to defend against the massive push coming their way. The only way to beat this move is to counter it EXACTLY on your end of the map and pray one of you makes the mistake of mis-timing it in the end.. but yeah - enjoy free wins if you find the sweet spot? (I hope this helps prove to the developers of the importance of balance!)"
1940,"Long time player here, been playing since late 2019. 
I cannot personally recommend this game in its current state. The game seems to be in a phase where they are constantly experimenting and reworking aspects of the game in drastic measures. 
With the latest update, the champion Mordar, once powerful, has become redundant with his rework and is now a choice if you wish to throw a game. Seems no one knew how to counter Mordar, it was simply stun his tombstones or destroy them.  King Puff has been reworked also, to benefit teamplay and deck building (no longer limited to 4-5 mana cost minions). However, the new King Puff to me seems to be in an odd position, I prefered his old set of abilities. The biggest change being the mana regeneration rates, it has been increased, matches were 1-13 minutes long, now you would be lucky to reach 6 minutes. As a result, there is less strategy, gameplay becomes dull, whoever controls the bridge and xp gain better wins. 

Of the +200 cards in this game, many of them are underwhelming and unused, there are staple cards that are obviously well used by the community and some cards are in need of a nerf. Nyvir's Breath being one of them, it can wipe an entire lane's ground minions at only 7 mana, and with the faster generation of mana, 7 mana is essentially nothing. 
Accursed Toll Decks are insanely powerful in both 2v2 and 2v2 premades, if 2 players are running Toll Decks, they are literally unstoppable. Their deck gets increasingly stronger while their opponent cannot do anything about it, they are left with their deck and cannot possibly counter a Toll deck duo.

The game is playable from ranks Wood - Low Platinum. Once you reach Platinum in premades, you will be paired with nothing but people who play the same/similar decks that are difficult to counter, decks that are well thought out and clever, it forces you and your teammate to resort to similar tactics, you cannot play whatever deck you want. 

I've enjoyed my time with this game, don't get me wrong, I've also brought many friends into this game and they've played it vigorously but eventually dropped it, it's about time I joined them. I will only play now, if I am invited to play by my friends. 

End of the day, this game is free, you've got nothing to lose by playing this game, but I advise you to not be too competitive, play at your own pace, and enjoy it within your own boundaries."
1941,"addicting, challenging."
1942,P2W
1943,actually really good
1944,"There’s no better feeling than gaining mana advantage through playing a clutch spell or a card that completely counters an opposing players’ massive push. There aren’t many games like this, I can only think of Clash Royale for the phone. It’s a shame because this genre is interesting and unique. After playing Minion Masters for a consecutive week, I believe this game and genre are not more prevalent because of hyper-aggressive monetization and gambling.

After my week of play, I reached player level 25 out of 50 and the rank of Silver 1 in both solo and team play. There’s an excellent draft mode, but after three drafts, a fee of 750 gold or 55 rubies is enacted. A win in solo or teams earns about 40 gold, while a loss earns about 5 gold. There is a season pass in which I reached level 25 out of 50. There are daily quests and chests that go towards both player level and season pass level. The premium season pass is 1250 rubies, which is $4.99 if you save up enough achievement rubies, or $9.99 for 1650 rubies outright. There were ~12 days remaining and there was no way I could reach level 50 or earn enough rubies to buy the premium pass. An adventure mode, which playing does not count towards your season pass, is extremely challenging and unique. However, past the intro mission, individual chapters or bundles need to be bought from a range of 700 rubies to 2010 rubies. 

The only way to unlock cards outside of level and season pass rewards is to use power tokens. Power tokens are the roulette wheel of the game. Each spin earns you a new card or upgrade points toward a card you already have. The only way to earn the currency of shards, which crafts specific cards, is to use power tokens as shards cannot be bought or earned. In the game, there are ~229 total cards. I unlocked 88 of them, 55 common, 21 rare, 6 supreme, and 6 legendary. I have 15 common cards remaining, one of which is locked in the premium season pass. The Masters themselves cost shards or rubies to permanently unlock. There is a $20 bundle to unlock all masters, as well as a $20 bundle to permanently increase xp and gold gain. 

	Outlining the above details on what a player can achieve for free is important. Minion Masters is fun while playing, but the feeling of FOMO, confusion, and exhaustion are how this game operates. Every screen clicked shows a shard or ruby price, the loading screens are of cards not owned, Steam lists a DLC cost of $189.88, exclusive deals and limited time offers are always coming and going, and the prices are obfuscated behind different currencies. 

	If you were to play this game, play with a friend and only touch solo queue, team queue, and save all gold earned for the draft fee."
1945,"I really like this game because its fast paced easy to play but hard to master< its a fun game and it makes you want to know why your using different minions, its a beautiful game.  Try it you'll"
1946,destroy
1947,pay 2 win and keeps crashing.
1948,nice quick game
1949,good game
1950,"Has potential, but bad player retention strategy. 
The game is bleeding player (see SteamDB.info); some players only came back when developers 'bribed' players with free DLC. Nice gesture, but sadly those who came back (to give the game another try) quickly dissipate again when they find that the game still leaves them with the same bitter taste that made them leave in the first place. 

From the charts, we can see that even 'DLC bribes' is becoming less and less effective (half the peak). Developers really need to rethink their player retention strategies."
1951,"decent game , i smurf hard. looks like players who plays this this game kind a weak haha !! iam good or what haha !!!!"
1952,Game is really fun. After a certain rank it is pretty much pay to win. Some of the cards and skills do need some balancing. If you are looking for something to kill the time or spend some money this game is for you. If you don't want to deal with pay to win then this game is not for you.
1953,clash roayle
1954,"This game is really fun when you can communicate with your team mate, I'm new but the help my friend has been giving me after being a long time player really helps."
1955,great gamr
1956,"This game is a bullshit cash grab by a company that will install spyware on your computer during updates. Save yourself the fucking trouble I've gone through and don't install this. I've also heard the developers are famous for their anti black sentiments. Actual human garbage masquerading as game developers. Install this ""free"" game at your own peril."
1957,Its pretty fun.
1958,"Simple, Fun, Strategic Depth"
1959,bussin
1960,"10/10 AAA game. This game is undeniably the best. This is evidenced in the quote ""10/10"" where IamBarney08 is giving his judgement of the game. The 10/10 suggests it is better than 10 in every 10 games, therefore making it the best on the market. In particular, the determiner 10 connotes a well rounded game since 10 is an even looking and perhaps a ""pleasant number""; this is due to the fact that the developers can make a flawless and entertaining game, which is supposed to be a sport or activity to fulfil ones enjoyment which Minion Masters does for a matter of fact master. This relates to every day life where most adults and possibly children slave away working completing an unsatisfactory spiral to crippling depression. However, Minion Masters challenges these roles by putting ""minions"" or slaves on a battle field. The symbolic way of presenting people as monsters could suggest humans are ruining their own lives or could connote a sense of anti-government. The hope brought by Minion Masters is that there is entertainment in the form of this monolithic, terrific, magnificent game. These actions by the developers could be from past relatives, whom lived lives like this but he chose to wake up and prevent this epidemic of depression. The developers have certainly done this to create an awakening in society, raise awareness of the global issue and finally inspire the player to continue his effective legacy"
1961,so funny
1962,"Fun game, similar to an old Magic game I used to play. You summon different types of units and they go battle."
1963,pretty cool castle fight style deckbuilder :)
1964,"It's the same genre of Clash Royale.
The big difference is that here you don't level up units, so the ranked system actually works.
Updates are frequent, bringing both balancing adjustments and new cards."
1965,I enjoy with team battle. FUN!
1966,"It's a great way to kill time, but it's a pretty obvious low effort cash grab"
1967,"If magic the gathering was real-time.  Great, but needs massive 3 and 4 and 5 player coop modes!"
1968,good game for wfh
1969,"Minion Masters is really fun to play, the cards you get for the minions are amazing, will be playing this game all the time. can't wait for more add on's for the game"
1970,".........
"
1971,"Just started the game - pretty engaging so far. I'm eager to test its options and become the 'master', ruling the arena with my cute little minions! The world domination shall be mine."
1972,"Its Clash of Clans for desktop. There is more depth and cool effects but it relies on multiplayer for games. Looks great and theres more to unit types and heroes but its a time sink due to unit familiarity.
If this is you cup of tea, by all means."
1973,Awesome game! Free and has pretty balanced matches.
1974,"No pay to win.
And with a simple spam deck it is almost ensured to win, as long as the enemy has no spells."
1975,Very good game and has lots of potential. I suggest you to give it a try!
1976,Pretty fun so far
1977,"The game is a phenomenal game. There's one major problem that I've found. Every game is considered a ""ranked"" game. Thus, you're either gaining or losing points every game. No big deal. I win most games. My major issue is 3/5 games for team battles, I have a disconnected teammate. He stays disconnected for over 75% of the game, then comes back literally as we're about to lose, so in return there's no coming back. Again, no big deal because I don't care if I lose. However, my major issue is, even though he was afk for 75% of the game and I have no chance of winning, I STILL lose 100 points in my rank because he wasn't ""disconnected"" at the end of the game. Which I find ridiculous. You need a system to be able to detect afk/disconnected people so the people who are actually playing in team battles don't lose points. 3/5 stars just for that factor alone."
1978,YES YES YES
1979,"This game is a little bipolar i think.  team battles you have teams that either disconnect or just dont play there cards.  i have network drops, i get loaded into games and then it takes me out and i get loaded in again just to be told that that game was not recorded and if it happen to be a draft, well.... i guess your sol on the in game money you just got.  which by the was is earned at a trickle(slow).  the game is fun, but man....its got some issues for sure.  you can play for free but i wouldnt spend any money on this."
1980,I like this game.  Easy to play.  No commitment required.  Announcer makes me laugh.  I also like South Park Phone Destroyer which is quite similar to this.
1981,gimme more Puffs
1982,fun game
1983,"great small game to play for hours. very friendly to new players. card game and MOBA all in one 
"
1984,Highly recommended to those who played clash royal on their mobile devices. They can get the same lvl of satisfaction here.
1985,cool
1986,"Its good, play it."
1987,"Got right into it, very easy to learn. Reminds me of some old Wc3 Custom map like Summoner Wars.

+Graphics is pleasing
+Nice music/sound
+Quick Tutorial
+Easy to learn

I'll update my review once I've played some more. I can see my self be playing this for 5 minutes or 1 hour every now and then if Im bored."
1988,Minion in ass
1989,actually a good game
1990,"It's a really nice concept until you realize they only do balancing on cheap cards while buffing legendary cards with multiple uses, AOE damage and able to hit things in the sky and ground making them so overpowered you HAVE to pay to get legendary cards. Once again greed has ruined a nice game."
1991,"Fun simple, follows ""easy to learn, hard to master"" concept. Good progression even in late game, updated often love it!"
1992,Unique game for pc ..great for relaxed gaming ;)
1993,"This game is great. It's a solid little game to play with a buddy for a good time. Super addictive, free, and you can get a good deck pretty quickly. It's fun, matches last 5-8 minutes most times, and you can knock tons out super fast. For me, I'll never say no if a buddy asks me to play minion masters. Ever."
1994,Devs destroying game
1995,"simple and quick rounds great time killer
"
1996,good game
1997,"been my favorite strategy game for a few years now. Can play it with my best friend or girlfriend or alone. 
-addicting
-2 v 2 strategy 
-1 v 1 strategy
-awesome deck building"
1998,"Fast-paced, perfect for a gamer who has multiple distractions (and still needs to game!). I can easily jump in and complete a few games and hop off when life calls. Choosing a minion master was hard for me because the skill sets vary greatly but you can compile multiple decks so that you are ready to go for whatever mood (play style) you are in. Fast and fun!"
1999,fun little game with a surprising amount of depth If You get into the strategy around deck building and where you place ur minions on the field. It has become a little more anoying to play free to play but still doable.
2000,it is wacky but good
2001,I downloaded it BC it's free... Well it doesn't suck. it's actually kinda fun.
2002,Pog
2003,"Fun and addicting. I have always loved the concept of summoning AI controlled minions. One part card game, one part auto chess. The only downside is that it can feel incredibly pay-to-win at times."
2004,"I've been watching this game go downhill for quite a while now, hoping that there would be some type of redemption arc.

Effectively, how the patches and updates work is like this:
""We broke things, and we will leave it up to the meta to fix it.""

""The Meta"" in and of itself doesn't even account for skill. The difference between grand master, contender, master, etc. does not involve skill, just time. During this time, it's basically just a matter of abusing previous balance oversights to win. These are the ones the developers cater to, while generally putting off other players' issues. 

What this means is, if you've already been playing, you're fine. If you're thinking about starting to play, you will not really find much enjoyment, since you won't even have all of the cards/masters to know what you don't have a say in. (But that can be fixed with money, of course.)
As an example, a poll recently went out asking basically ""Should [x] be removed."" The majority of votes said no, so you'd expect that nothing would happen. However, the majority of the yes votes came from arbitrary ranks, so the developers decided to remove [x].

If this is the type of team you want making changes to your game, you should try playing."
2005,This is so awesome..
2006,A chill game to play for fun
2007,Matchmaking is litterally a joke. Don't bother playing unless they fix it
2008,"I don't understand how people can put so many hours into this game unless something has changed. It didn't take long to see that this game is on a profit taking, downward glide path. Still thinking of playing? Check out the decks on the leaderboards and note how similar they all are. Boring waste of time."
2009,"well after 456 hours i can safely say: it's an okay way to occupy your hands when you're listening to music or podcasts or something, but it's mostly really boring"
2010,"After playing this game for several years, they have ruined it in the name of ""balance"" they keep nerfing cards and and reworking them.  Mostly because unskilled players whine about something not being fair, when they simply don't know how to deal with a situation.  This game used to be a lot of fun.  Now it is becoming a boring slog."
2011,Quite addictive...
2012,fun interactive card/tower defense game.
2013,.
2014,"I hate that this game just became my most played game, but it scratches an itch I didn't even know I had. The rounds are so short that I can squeeze it in when I only have a few minutes. It is such as simple concept that a can easily pick it up and put it down. It is advanced enough that when I do have time I can design a  deck for the next couple of weeks of battles. 

It's like speed chess with explosions. 

"
2015,This game is amazing if you like  clash royal but better then you would like this game
2016,"1300 hours played, but no more... every change is for the worse.. every change removes strategy, i've purchased numerous passes to support the devs but no more. 

they've ruined the game with the speed boost to cater to mobile crossover and a younger age group, and are still ruining the game. kudos to the people i met in chat such as toddlife who tried to reign in the toxicity but the chat is racism and nazism all day.

color me bummed.. it used to be fun, but no more.
 
~ e v i l"
2017,"Id avoid this,  this is poorly run with random and wild changes to existing cards each week.     I highly recommend spending any real money on this as any card you may be looking to purchase will be nerfed or completely changed to no longer fit any build you wanted to work on."
2018,"Love this game, uppdates keep it fresh, lots of combos and cards to try, not pay to win."
2019,Very good game and nice gameplay. Good multiplayer and co-op. Announcer's voice is amazing and it is everywhere. Overall it is 10/10!
2020,"Pretty cool game, basically a boneless Clash Royale but still very good"
2021,fun way to pass the time
2022,Fun for about a week then becomes a huge grind and matchmaking against endgame players with fully upgraded cards. Dont waste your money on it.
2023,Easy to play. Fun and engaging. This is a combination of a tower defence and a card game.. Take turns trying to destroy your opponents tower. Watch your mana!
2024,Awsome
2025,"Good strategy PVP game but be aware, strategy and tactic and in some modes team play is important so prepare to play with a lot of mentally challenged individuals devoid of all functional brain cells along the way."
2026,"Free to play, and it has a variety of mechanics to make the game interesting. Not too shabby in the graphics department either."
2027,i like it
2028,Pretty shitty game
2029,Nice
2030,i feel you guys copied a mobile game called Clash Royale but even so this game is amazing
2031,meh
2032,"At some point this was a great game, patch after patch, season after season of devs don't listening to the players who obviously invest most hours actually playing it, ruined it. 
 
Ranks are just something cosmetic, it doesn't reflect the ability of the player but the time it spent grinding.
 
Meta decks are meta for some reason, the balance allows them to win most of the time whitout actually making the players think on using anything different. 
This doesn't mean you can't try something different, but after hundred or thousands of games seeing the same decks season after season it gets awfully boring.

Of maybe 10~15 matches I usually enjoy 1 at best, the only reason I keep playing is because the game has become someting so mechanically easy to play and win that you don't even have to think anymore.
 
Is not pay to win, but pay to fast, either way not worth it.

Betadwarf, I feel betrayed. Get it together. Make Minion Masters Great Again."
2033,mon eh paladin
2034,"It's like Clash Royale, but much better. The best choice for this type of game on PC. Very generous with free DLC at certain times. I spent some money on this game to support the devs."
2035,"Last patch totally ruined game. If you want to win, you need to play only meta decks."
2036,Best game ever! Changed my life for the better!
2037,"I mainly play for fun and ""fun"" if you know what I mean.  That said its a fun game with some fun things to do."
2038,"I liked this game in general until recently but its become pretty obvious that the devs either aren't interested in balancing the game or simply don't put any effort into testing ""balance"" changes before they implement them, the latest season is quite literally the most simple, boring and unbalanced to date.  Things should improve with time, this is ridiculous.

Edit: And all that is of course ignoring the pay to win aspect which is understandable for a free to play game.

2nd Edit: Played about a hundred more hours to give it a second chance.  Even worse than it was before.  Be wary of all the recent reviews that are like three words because they've definitely begun paying for reviews for anyone to give this any kind of thumbs up, newest season is the most laughable joke yet, they absolutely took the gloves off even the tiniest but of the illusion of balance and that the game wasn't straight pay to win."
2039,"The interface for this deck building game is fun and easy to grasp. being able to create synergy between various cards and ""types"" for masters is fluid. You can grind and play numerous types of game play in order to obtain cards without pay to win methods. The ability to view the leaderboard and it showing you their decks gives insight to a beginner in what to look for or craft. The free season and paid season still gives players the choice in which to go from leisure gaming to more competitive nature. The fact they include rotation of free masters and the daily quests in order to obtain shards and cards makes this game very ""Free to play"" and fun at that."
2040,dis good
2041,Thanks for ruining Apep.
2042,Y
2043,"Really awesome game!  Easy to pick up, not super grindy.  The 2v2 mode is SUPER FUN!  Everyone should have this game in their list!"
2044,I play this game too much. Save yourself.
2045,"LITTY LIKE KITTIES

2046,easy and fun
2047,Bin akt lvl 10 bis jetzt macht es spass
2048,im addicted
2049,great game so far
2050,a decent relaxing strategy game. good to play every now and again when you need a break from other stuff.
2051,It's Free and it's fun.
2052,gud
2053,"Super fun! Easy to get the hang of. 
Did I say F2P? Oh yeah its free! Great game! Great fun! 
Everyone come join!"
2054,fun game
2055,This game is pretty fun no lie. Lots of free stuff just for playing a few seasons.
2056,"Really pleasant PvP game. Quick Matching, Lots of possibilities, Fun to Watch."
2057,"Warcraft like clash royale? I am down
8/10 Recommended."
2058,good shit
2059,is fun
2060,Great game. Better than Clash and I love Clash.
2061,"Not a very good game, if you didn't bother with the expansions early on then don't bother with this game. Extremely grindy and most matches are not enjoyable, as its a stomp most of the time."
2062,1
2063,gud gaem
2064,I love it easy to play yet many options  and charters
2065,"A simple yet challenging game consisting of relatively short matches. You need tactics to win. 
You determine how effectively you repel an attack by deploying minions that counterattack."
2066,GREAT GAME EASY TO GET IN TO
2067,Addictive and simple
2068,Fun
2069,"It's like Clash Royale, but horizontal and better graphics.
And more synergies. More technical."
2070,"I was originally drawn to the game because it was free and it reminded me of clash royal. Now that I've played it, I can certainly say I prefer this game so much more. Not having to upgrade cards to get to higher arenas is a blessing. You also get to unlock new cards quite often but there is still the RNG part but it's fairly reasonable."
2071,"Ridiculously addictive, crazy fun and very well balanced. The best game I've played in a very long time."
2072,a great free game for any of you who have played clash royale this is cr but much more balanced more cards and more combos it's very fun
2073,naisu
2074,the game is really fun
2075,Very good game
2076,veri gud geim

2080,"After years of hopping in & out of the game, now the game it's really interesting, try it and you will se something that's not new at all, play more and you will discover some of the mechanics but you will need to play even more to fully understand the potential... this game is absolutely entertaining, every card, no matter how powerfull it might be, can be countered by something else, every card can be crafted no matter if you spent or not money on the game. And playng is rewarding.
As said in the beginning: this game is nothing new, nothing special: it's well done, not p2w but pLay2Win.

suggestion for new players: entering a guild will let you add to your deck cards you don't have, so it might help to try cards before forging them, wich is better than ""forge and regret"""
2081,"Really good game 10/10
"
2082,"Well worth the purchase. While the graphics might not have held up over the years, the story and gameplay definitely have, and the mods produced by this games active modding community can assist in modernising the appearance of the game. All of the DLCs produced for this game are superb, and a must have for anyone looking to experience the game as a whole. The biggest issue for me is the amount of bugs and crashed I encountered during my multiple playthroughs, which undoubtedly put a damper on the entire experience. Despite this I still recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of fan of other fallout titles or RPGs in general."

2086,"Easy, mindless self-indulgence. I like card-esque games and this platform is easy to use, cute to watch, and just enough competition."
2087,"After many years this game not only retains playability, but continues to get better.  I've been around since this game was not free to play, and making it free certainly was the right choice.  There are tons of people playing, never is there a wait for a game.  And the devs not only continue to add cards but game modes as well, they remain very active and should be rewarded for this masterpiece.  So go play for free, and then put some money into this game, because you deserve to craft yourself some kick ass cards and the devs deserve to get paid."

2092,good game
2093,Fast and Fun. :D
2094,Fun and Free what else?
2095,"Had a fully charged ""power tower"" the game stated to highly increase odds of a better card. You will never guess what I got... a common card that already had multiple of. This happens every time I use this ""Power Tower"" I feel like i lose cards when I use it. Very debilitating experience. If you play, avoid this ""Power Tower"" at all costs!"
2096,power tower hates me 0/10
2097,"Ya sure, why not?"
2098,clash royale bu t cool
2099,Worth it. Even though it's free. So worth it. Kids get rekt in this. So worth it.

2102,"Nice, simple fun."
2103,"[h1] Great Free Game [/h1]

[b] Notes from someone with 500 hours play time. [/b]

Play this game a few days get a understanding of the currency before you spend any money. You can be 100% happy playing this game spending nothing just like my friends do.

 I have thrown 60$ at it and this is somewhat regretful. The reason is now I have everything. Every card and every hero. While this is nice I would have eventually got everything threw just playing.

I recommend buying the heros to keep it fun, allow for a wide variety of play styles, and to be a part of the metta if your trying to rank up, but other then that i don't recommend spending any other money.

Single player stuff is cool but far over priced.

 The biggest complaint: when new cards are released, you can not craft them till next season, in an attempt to make you spend money. Straight cash grab.  I have to mention I have not bought the newest cards in the last season and i still competed at masters easily"
2104,.
2105,Fun and addictive!
2106,its a fairly solid game
2107,i love this game very but i want this game for android too.pls creat a android version for this game.i love this game.this is amazing
2108,"This game has become a pay2enjoy game. Just like Hearthstone, Clash Royale or Wolrd of Tanks. Gameplay itself is not bad but to play what you want you kinda have to spend money, or much time/grind to achieve it. For me the gameplay is not that enjoyable to sink the time in. In Early access this was more like a single payment game, buy once and get all the content inside (except heroes). I prefered that model much more."
2109,"This is my go-to late night time waster, thanks to its great mix of strategy and deck building."
2110,wow poggers

2113,Fun game ..super easy to play. Tough to master. It's akin to Clash Royale but way cooler. Free to Play and not Pay to win. GLHF
2114,"cool game, is a bit like clash royale but still really different"
2115,its basic n pay 2 win
2116,awsam
2117,"Let me start by saying that I've played this game for several years now, and intend to keep playing it.
The creature and spell diversity is quite good, and relatively balanced.  Plus, the werewolves are just so tapable.
But, there are certain things that SHOULD have been dealt with years ago, and deserve some down votes for this laziness.

Key Bindings:  They are near non-existent, don't work, and can't be rebound what-so-ever.  This means you have to try to move very quickly with just the mouse, and card selection is far too unreliable at speed.  Which leads to:

UI:  Frequently, you need to select a spell or minion very suddenly then place them somewhere immediately for your action to count.  Well, forget it.  On top of the built in delays, there is a level of UI sluggishness that makes responsiveness a fantasy.  It's a bit like driving a car with slop in the steering.  On a racetrack.

Social:  No!  You are relegated to a handful of emojis in game, and unannounced steam invites if you want to get to know a player.  And if someone is being a total prick, you can only report them if they are your teammate.  The other two on the opposing team have no recourse.

I understand the social portion is complicated, but the UI, and especially the keybindings, are simple matters, and most every game from decades back managed this just fine."
2118,nat a very good game
2119,"Fun, fast paced or slooooooow, easy to learn, hard to master!"
2120,"It would be great, but it's pay to win. You can obviously play hundreds of hours to get the best cards which almost guarantee your victory, but you literally have to play HUNDREDS."
2121,The game is fun.
2122,"Nobody reads the reviews for sure, so I'll say I'm gay"
2123,trash
2124,"Do I recommend it? Yes and no.

EDIT: After a little while of playing, unfortunately I'd say it's more on the ""no"" note than ""yes'...
There are way too many features that are simply locked behind a paywall with no way to go around it.
There are way too many too unbalanced things. Some cards are next to useless, while some others are just destroying everything. Some are way too good, and you can exploit them for total domination if you have them(and if you don't, then well, enjoy getting destroyed by them.. or you can always just obtain them trough... $~)


Why yes:
+It's free
+It has multiple modes, I really like the 2v2 and PvE (I wish there were more single-player modes, and possibility to complete some quests with them. Also, possibility to access them without paying real money.)
+Graphics, models and animations are pretty cool.
+It has multiple characters, each with their unique abilities and weaknesses.
+Screw Blizzard! Man... I used to love them... 

Why no:
-There needs to be way more cards. (I suspect there will be many more added in the future in the upcoming updates[at least I hope so], but I'm talking about things ""as they are"", and as they are, there needs to be many more cards to choose from.)
-There are some pretty unbalanced, overpowered cards, and even more unbalanced combinations of them.
-To play some of the modes, you need to pay real money, and you can't unlock it any other way. Not cool.
-The ways to obtain in-game currency (gold, mana, rubies) are very, [b]very[/b] limited.
-You can get any card for real money(for rubies, that you purchase for real money), so you can pay-to-win to some extent.
-It would be cool if you could customize in some way your master, and I'm not talking ""skin-wise"", but gameplay-wise. Have multiple skills to choose from.
-There should be more maps, bigger maps.
-You can get a lot of stuff if you pay for the game, while if you're playing it ""free to pay style"", you can forget all about it. Season pass, extra adventures, shop offers for legendaries or mana crystals(card crafting resources), cosmetics, say bye-bye to all those.

Extra thoughts:
It's both a plus and a minus of the game that the deck that you can bring into battle has a [b]very[/b] limited size. I think there should be a possibility to build larger decks. 
For an example - minimum deck size being set to 10(as it is), while the maximum size being 20 or 30. Then there would be both larger and smaller decks, each having their pros and cons. Both this, and adding more cards, would create more strategies and diversity, something that this game definitely needs, I keep on coming across the same units or even whole decks.


At least that's my take on it. Feel free to comment and express your own opinion on the matter."
2125,"This Game gives overpowered cards to the enemy team when they buy the battle pass, and gives a fcking rat over powered summons even if you use normal summoning cards for minions, NERF THE SCRATS THEY""RE NO FUN AT ALL! ,THE IQ TO EVEN USE THE SCRATS META IS FOR PUSSIES, THIS GAME CAN BE FRUSTRATING EVEN IF YOU HAVE POWERFUL CARDS THEN HERES COMES THE SCRATS, EVEN IF YOU USE AN AOE DEALER YOU JSUT CANT, THiS GAME IS PAY 2 WIN GARBAGE"
2126,simply the best of its kind
2127,Optimization is just...bruh. I mean I'm entering eveyday and 70% it's crashing on first time. And you are going to ship that on phones? Ok
2128,Cool game. its like magic for stupid ppl xD fun to play with a mate
2129,DEVS MAKE A FUCKING ACCEPT ALL REWARDS BUTTON AT THE START OF A NEW SEASON JESUS CHRIST
2130,"Pros:
Simple game design, with a surprising degree of variablity and skill required through tactics.
Many different cards and approaches that can be used to achieve victory. Excellent gameplay balance from this perspective.
Fun to play either alone or with a friend.

Cons:
There are certain tiers of cards that are necessary. A player who doesn't find themselves willing to grind for cards will find themselves at a severe disadvantage at higher levels of play.
If you're someone who comes from a mainstream game title where updates are at a blazing speed, this game's updates progress will seem very slow to you. This is obviously understandable, but worth noting."
2131,"Kinda cool... Like decent balance and all, sooo what else would u need?"
2132,This game made me feel happy.
2133,it rocks
2134,What is this fucking cellphone bullshit game? Please leave my fucking steam inventory alone.
2135,Fun game destroyed by awful balance.
2136,"So far, I have had a lot of fun playing this game. Whether playing solo or with my siblings, it always keeps you thinking due to the fast-paced format and brings a lot of excitement.
The one thing I would love to see in the game is an update that brings categories into the deck creation section of the game. At the moment, you just see a mass of cards and have to search for what you are looking for (which could be quite frustrating for new players). For example, being able to categorise cards based on their types (eg. Scrat), based on being melee or ranged, based on the star value, things like that. I feel this kind of change would bring a great quality of life to the game and to me.
If this was implemented, I think the game would be 5 stars."
2137,Great game. Simple with so many interesting combination. the effect and graphic is very cool and fun to watch~
2138,fun
2139,"most well made games have two track strategy.

it's like focus for heavy play user contents and light play user contents.

this game has no light play user contents. and main contents also not good for heavy users.

every time, card change and adding are not balanced. and make some idiot users.

they make also more and more bad trend at this game. like 3 WC restless dead.

and most important matching system not working properly.

sometimes people meet and fight contender vs diamond(or more low)

it means this user pool so narrow. and random team match also not fair.

there is no future at this game. only have beta dev."
2140,Nice game
2141,"Very fun and somewhat easy game to learn, basically horizontal Clash Royal so those who 
played said game will have an easier time."
2142,a fun take on card games.

2144,Better than clash royale.
2145,fun

2147,Fun so far!

2149,only few hours in & already enjoying myself. fun & simple game. recommend to try. Btw. it's p2w.

2153,"Minion Masters is an alternative to things like Clash Royale, but the depth and content is has the feel of Magic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds. Truly a classic title from the age of no updates and the god tier development! Great Work, I am sincerely addicted to Minion Masters!"
2154,Haven't play much but it's easy and fun to play.
2155,3/10
2156,"good game that needs a lot of balance, too much op cards and combos"
2157,has an easy learning curve but still maintains some level of difficulty
2158,I NEED HELP i cant get in the game it always it says not found (1-28)
2159,NICE
2160,Fun game and not much money needed.
2161,"A unique and awesome game that reminds me of a MOBA in that there are lanes to go down and a core to destroy, but also a card game in that you build a deck of minions and spells. This game also has chess elements in it in that you have to predict what moves your opponent is most likely to make while setting up defense and counter attacks while being mindful of the strengths and weaknesses of each piece has. I see that you can also be successful in playing either a defensive or aggressive style, much like in chess. Very cool game, I highly recommend. Only con I really see so far is there is only one music track and one map. For this, I give it 4.5 stars =:3"
2162,"Fun and ez lawls


**Old review above - changing review on 8/5/2021**

All these changes are ruining the game. Most recent update is going too far, removal of the wildcards is a huge impact to players who have invested shards and real money into getting extra copies of cards to utilize as wildcards in deck. To remove wildcards players should be compensated with the blue shard value for each extra copy of a card in their deck (gettin bonus XP for extra copies is not enough value for people to have invested in acquiring multiple copies).

Review stays negative until they stop ruining the game."
2163,Only ranked play.  No place to practice new deck ideas aside from a few lame challenges.
2164,Nice little time killer. Lots of different strategies and champions to employ and lots of decent offers and free stuff through the newsletter.
2165,"8 hours to download, almost 45 minutes to install, won't load at all. Black screen and blue thinking circle is all I get. I've tried rebooting but everything shows my system is fine (even my internet wasn't that slow)"
2166,this game is very interesting and fun
2167,"9/10 needs more scrats
"
2168,"Haven't played a lot, but pretty decent game sofar. Gotta love the free DLCs you can grab if you are early from time to time and the fast-paced stategy makes me think of that one damn Zynga cardgame... Warstorm, was it? that I got hooked into while trying to give people more choice over what to play. If you like long drawn-out matches and complex synergies and strategies, it might not be for you, but if you're short on time and just want to enjoy a game, this is seems fine."
2169,clash but better
2170,"Normally don't play these games, but, this one has been fun so far :)"
2171,Master
2172,"I think I’ve been diddled

earned by playing matches with cards that have high glory.
every tier requires the same amount of xp
lol my season pass tier is 30 ,next tier need 50000 XP

I want my money back"
2173,really good deckbuilding game a lot  like clash royale
2174,A quite fun Clash-Royale-like game
2175,+
2176,Nice time killer.
2177,game fun play cards win
2178,Minion Masters is a great deck building game with a different element of strategy than tcgs.
2179,I came across this game by mistake and it was a happy mistake glad I wasn't wearing a condom.
2180,I'd say its a pretty swell game.
2181,Great game!
2182,Paladins but instead of FPS its a deck card game. Quite fun.
2183,"178 hours, still enjoy the game A LOT"
2184,awesome
2185,Solid card design and built-in game pacing make this feel smooth and engaging.  I've been playing for an hour and built 3 wildly different and equally successful decks. Fun game!
2186,I like it well enough
2187,fun
2188,amazing
2189,is master
2190,great game
2191,"If you've ever wanted to play horizontal Clash Royale, then this isn't a bad game to pick up. The best part is that the devs are really cool about expansions and gives them out free for a week."
2192,"Buenísimo el juego, al principio no le entendía mucho pero termine enganchándome, las partidas son super rápidas y el gameplay es bastante fluido, es un juego de estrategia y además es casual, que mas puedes pedir, juégalo!!!"
2193,"Good example of how to do free to play games with premium currency that isn't pay to win.

Fun, simple gameplay that does have a little bit of strategy and tactics involved
Lots of different ways to play
Constantly being updated, solid player base as well

Gameplay can be repetitive and become stale but you can take a break and come back and trust the game will still be alive, at least as of this writing.

I suppose my only real complaint is that it seems every time I go on a 4-5+ win streak, I then get matched against ultra difficult opponents and more often than not there is zero chance of winning.  After losing the streak I seem to get matched with 'regular' opponents.  Maybe I'm just a scrub lol"
2194,I can't finish this review because I'm too busy opening chests.
2195,its a very simple yet addictive and fun game.
2196,easy to get sucked into.

2199,very fun u will get hook to this game
2200,yes

2202,very good.
2203,Clash Royale On PC
2204,Support is retarded
2205,"Why not, it's fun and a good waste of time"
2206,I LAVE THES GAME
2207,It's like clash royale meets amazing 3d graphics. I like the commander system with their own unique abilities and synergies. The only downside is how the game shoves in your face that you should spend money on it. It's a great game but it just begs so much. 8/10
2208,fun but weird lag spikes? anyone else?
2209,"I play clash royale and this is like it, but there are ALOT more options to spice the combat up a bit more. Ways to heal your tower, units that have some more unique buffs and mechanics, and a champion system rather than just a tower."
2210,It's good for what it is

2236,"I played this game for the last 4 or 5 months. I like it but even I can see the game isn't growing and the 5 friends I had playing have all left for the most part. You end up getting matched with bots in earlier matches so when you rank up you lack the experience  against players that have been playing for a long period of time.

In card games like Minion Masters you need help with managing decks and since the userbase is small and cards change often so you never get on the same level. The few people that consistently play offer no real help and just complain about other players in the chat.

I really like the core of this game but its not growing. I really like Friday night streams and having fun with the seasoned players that help me out. Friends have moved on to other card games and I'm thinking i may do the same.

update: still playing but not as much as i did before. The developers keep releasing crap minions with each update. Playerbase is stale for the most part and not enough new players coming in to replace those that are leaving. Neads a decent update to get players back or new players in the game."

2239,"P2W so strong it would make EA blush
It's pretty easy to climb to Plat with garbage cards, but then you start hitting Legendary spam stacks you can't do fuck all about, while the game intricately offers you to buy some P2W garbage as well half the times you lose.
Plays victory/loss animation you can't skip after you win/lose, wasting your time. Does the same at the start of the match.
It also crashes while in main menu every 3 games or so...
Garbage card manager.
Can't dissolve cards, so when you want a card, you gotta craft it for garbage you get minuscule amount of from ""Orbs"" = loot boxes. Usually you get 15... Legendaries cost 2000... yea..."

I've been a long time player on South Park Phone Destroyer on the mobile app store, but it's nice to find some new games after playing for over two years on SPPD. This is a great alternative for anyone who's also a fan of SPPD, strategy oriented, and/or competitive PvP games. Whether you're just looking for something new, after playing another game with a similar style, set of features and game mechanics to another CCG/TCG you love, that is made in a similar mold, just to spice things up after playing for a long time. Or maybe you are still relatively new to games like this and others like it, such as SPPD. Either way, I think that this is a great CCG/TCG, that has a lot of fun and interesting features and mechanics that make it fun, easy to pick up if you're just starting with these types of games, but that is still incredibly fun, and possible to keep learning some new trick or strategy you had never thought of until the light bulb clicks and there's some new that tactic or strategy that you come up with after that [i] ""ding"" [/i] goes off when you figure  out something new that will work great. Or at least, you think that, until you tested it out... Then it's back to the drawing board, and waiting for new inspiration to strike, haha.

Great game for anyone who likes tactical games with collectible unlocks to make introducing the amount of content and different things something that doesn't just shock you, and make most people feel that there's no way they are going to be able to learn all that, in order to compete. It makes it have a longer lifetime that way too, in my opinion. So I'd definitely recommend checking this out, if you are into any of those feature and/or mechanics. Great game if you're like me, and really love games in that genre."
2241,YES!
2242,"gg game so far, play about 1 hour and hard to stop"
2243,"fun, fast and silly"
2244,Fun game. Good characters that make each fight unique. Easy to pick up but also allows for alot of strategy
2245,Ye It fun.
2246,Easy to Play and thank fully not pay to win
2247,cool cool
2248,"Impressively ethical f2p game - after a day or so you can have a deck capable of being near the top of the leaderboards. the common cards are strong and reliable.

And the game is good fun too. Easy to learn, hard to master. Good fun with a friend in 2v2. 1v1 and 2v2 queue times are almost instant."
2249,"Quality PVP tower defense Clash Royale style game. Seems balanced but what do I know, I'm just a noob.
"
2250,Pay2Win
2251,fun
2252,minion go brrrr
2253,"It's a fun time spender, quick to get into and out of matches with a decent game play loop that makes it fun to play for hours."
2254,"Easy to learn and very fun, solo or as team. Nice Game!"
2255,"Just people dumping money into a game to win. If you aren't going to sink a ton of money into this game for gems you won't get much further than the gold tier. The game is fun but the ones that have paid money will always win since they will have the severely over powered cards. If you play it, just play it. Don't put any money into it. You'll just be wasting it."
2256,"its a fun game when your bored and have nothing to do
"
2257,"Fun, Addictive, and not Pay to Win. You can climb the ranked ladders with all common cards."
2258,fun!
2259,"its a great game until you go against someone who has paid real money for better characters which changes the abilities of some cards, im constantly against characters i havent unlocked/bought and i lose time and time again but go against the ones i have unlocked and they become far easier which just makes the game feel ""pay to win"" which i hate. As much as this game is addictive its definitly not something im goinbg to play much as it just feels way too unfair most of the time, Huge shame because its very well made."
2260, Very fun game! simple yet difficult!
2261,Good game !
2262,"I've been playing this game on and off for quite some time now and as lovely as the game is and the potential it has, some things never changed.

Pros:
- interesting art style and look of the game.
- easy to gather cards and interesting ways of deckbuilding.
- a forgiving but interesting learning curve to the game.
- easy to learn, not so hard to master with a lot of room to improve and adapt.

Cons:
- Same Characters always being OP.
- Certain decks that are considered ""meta"" are game breaking.
- Half the time teammates being AFK and you being punished for it.
- Reporting system doesn't feel like they actually act on it, no sense of feeling you made a difference.

All in all, this game has provided me hours of fun. But playing for 2 hours and 90% of my games had AFK teammates or teammates only playing 2 cards the entire game is just not fun at all.
Meeting the same opponents with the same game breaking decks over and over is just tedious and this game quickly loses it's charm.

I would still recommend to play this game and hope you can look past it's Cons and be lucky enough to avoid the issues I've run into."
2263,"This game is actually cringe, dont ever make another game, dont download this game, a waste of space"
2264,"counter the counter which can be another counter that counter the counter of the counter.
overall fun. except some dark meta periods. and not very monitered community which leads to unpunished leavers afks and griefers."
2265,much fun! :3
2266,es similar a clash royale
2267,It's easy to play and addicting!
2268,"Minion Masters is a unique piece out of nowhere. As far as I can tell, there are no games like it in the market the day this review is posted. A different approach to strategy games elements with cards play. The art style of the visuals and sound are fine with a rather funny cartoonish appeal. There are decent tactics and strategies concerning its gameplay which makes it stand. Needless to say, the whole game will make a player feel like a cartoonic joke and still like it."
2269,"Fun, really Free and Balanced"
2270,"I usually don't review things.. but after coming back 3 years after I last played, I still find this game really fun. I never stopped playing for any reason against this game, I am just a casual player who happens to get distracted by other games.... like a train that makes dozens of stops. If I stop playing for another game, I know I will still be back to this game eventually. 

If I had to describe this game... its basically Hearthstone, if Hearthstone was a tabletop MOBA. It's less strategy intensive... however from my experience the best decks are the ones with a lot of synergistic minions, and a few win conditions. My main deck has 3 cost efficient minions that attack the enemy Masters/buildings, and the Master I use is Morrelia (she summons a dragon at lvl3) and the rest of my minions are meant to be low cost minions with a lot of versatility. I use those to support my building busters, take and keep bridges longer than the enemy, and keep me alive until I can summon the dragon. Pretty basic strategy... but I can (and have) won games by attacking the enemy masters 4 different ways. The decks I tend to win against are decks that weren't thought out very well; too many high mana cards, and too inefficient low cost cards. So I wouldn't say its devoid of strategy where you can just plop down minions and win.

Still a fairly moderate roster of minions... Con: You see a lot of the same minions a lot. Pro: You don't feel like you are left behind because you joined the game late or took a very long break like me. There is a DLC you can buy to unlock all current and future Masters. I think its definitely worth it. Card packs/power stones (I believe they are called) are super easy to obtain for just 1000 gold... there are daily quests. Playing for an hour got me like 6 of them. Team games can go anywhere from 2 mins to 6 mins. Solo games can take anywhere from 4 to 10. 

There is barely a learning curve, and you aren't going to run into broken decks like Hearthstone often has. There are times in Hearthstone (or any other TCG) that you just feel outclassed because the opponent opened way more card packs (probably bought dozens on day one of a new expansion) and they just have win conditions that your deck couldn't hope to defend against. You won't find that in this game. Its pretty much a level playing field... some minions are absolutely better than others. But there are just so many minions with different attack; Ranged, flying(out of reach from ground minions), there are stun minions, poison minions, minions that can taunt... If you play games and see a pattern of where your deck is vulnerable, you can be creative and change up minions to make it less vulnerable. There are always minions that can counter other minions regardless of cost.

All in all, I'd give this game 8/10."
2271,Better than clash royale.
2272,"I enjoy playing this game after a long day. It's fun, relaxing and free to play."
2273,10/10 that's it!
2274,Its actually kinda fun.
2275,Fun!
2276,fun game to dame bugy to play
2277,well made game will be continuing to play for a long time!!!
2278,iv only played an hour but so far this game is alot of fun.
2279,Game is fire
2280,Great game! Nothing more to say. :)
2281,Tiss fun
2282,clash royale but good
2283,"Game has its ups and downs, I still find it fun though. I've obviously put in a few hours into the game ;P"
2284,A little bit too grindy in my opinion but still worth to be tryed.
2285,"Just started this game but it's enjoyable. Although I am usually terrible at these games!
"
2286,Awesome game! Really like it!
2287,Fun casual game. Although the seasons are too costly for what you get out of them.
2288,it's fun game if there is MOBA lane...and play like this would even more fun.
2289,why is hearthstone so popular when this game exists? haha
2290,nice
2291,This game is kind of CooooOOOOoOoOoOooOoOOoOooOoOoOOoOOoOoOOOOoOOOOoOO
2292,i had this game on xbox an i still cant stop playing it on here sad thing is i cant get all my cards lvl an rank but its ok
2293,Simple and fun
2294,"This game is the best game ever.
However I have to write a feedback because they posted a new update, every month they have a season pass which in the past the season pass lasts for 2 or more months. This is really bad for me for 2 reasons. 1. It gets really expensive to keeps buying the season pass, well well, good for them, bad for me. 2. I have to be forced to play the game every single month just to chase that season pass rewards, no, no, after more than 3 months, I have no choice but to gave up. My wallet is empty so is my soul."
2295,very nice
2296,is fun - yes
2297,what I love is the free stuff npcs that you battle are unfair sometimes
2298,///
2299,"amazing, easy ot learn too"
2300,very epic
2301,"not bad honestly, i played it and basically kicked everyones ass somehow. it's like hearthstone or something mixed with dota, its weird. but it's fun. kinda laggy for me though, like my connection was fucked up or something. it was frustrating but i dealt with it."
2302,"it's fun challenging and all out great
"
2303,"Fun, quick games. TD and card building is a good combo."
2304,"Fun, easy to pick up and lots of room to expand your playstyle and unit base."
2305,ITS GOOD
2306,"Hiding one or two new cards behind a pay wall is not MASSIVE EXPANSION dead game fun if you have money to throw away. with super weak ""season""/ monthly  pay wall your left with the ""is this what a paid for?"" feeling"

2309,"Absolutely loved the game, the different faction-like cards are absolutely awesome, and their different synergies are really fun to play with. But obviously as any good game someone had to come fuck it up with some pay-to-win features. You can unlock a variety of 'legendary' super rare cards in a matter of seconds if you drop your money in this game. One of those super rare card in question completely breaks the game and makes it unplayable. What is that card you ask?

 Imagine the most tanky unit, that deals a fuck ton of damage and attacks super fast. So now any Clash-royale type gamer out there is going to argue with me that you must swarm him ( drop a load of minions around him so he has a long time dealing with them) but that doesn't work because every single kill that this lovely creature gets fears everyone on your team (fear meaning running in circles like chicken for 3 seconds). Oh okay, so then since the swarms are completely useless, let me drop my own big tanky unit to take his damage. But wait, the lovely developers thought it would be a good idea to make it so the same creature can also execute anything below 40% HP. WTF????? That means your absolute tank getting murdered at 4000/10 000 hp and  your whole freaking board goes run amok like absolute morons while getting abolutely torched by the ennemies. For real, good job on completely fucking your game up, you guys suck. Love :*

An angry gamer"
2310,really fun twist to a card game.. its like a mix between tower defense and yugioh or somethn like that lol
2311,a great deck games
2312,Fun
2313,"Almost like Clash Royale, pretty decent"
2314,game is trash
2315,"This game is totally awesome! It is my first competitive online game and it really catched me! The only issue is that it should be more popular and should have more players, so that the waiting times are not so long.

So there is an update. MM 2.0 will be released soon and I have no idea if the game will be completely destroyed or if it will make the game better. Some decisions from the developers and marketing moves were not very clever and maybe lost the game some of the playerbase. The review atm should be mixed. I will update when MM 2.0 is released.

Update: MM 2.0 is dead, it won't be released. So instead they updated the graphics and added new arenas, which is fine in my eyes. Mayhem, Draft, new co-op adventures and of course the 3 standard modes are still there."
2316,it's a fun game
2317,"You should really try the game , its really fun and better than clash royale as it has no microtransactions and the cards dont have levels and there is a nice twist on clash royale core gameplay which is that there are masters which are the characters standing on the tower they have special perks and these perks are activated by collecting exp by controlling towers which makes the game more fun imo and i really recommend it"
2318,thumbs up  a must try!
2319,Love this game Did not expect it But i love it Gonna keep playing this for a long time
2320,YOYOYOYOYOY
2321,GG
2322,10/10 would play pc clash of clans again
2323,Atrociously unoptimized...play this game in the winter time if you want your PC to produce free heat.
2324,"decent game,lots of choice and units"
2325,no words for how incredible this game is
2326,I just want it to stop telling me to review it
2327,I would HIGHLY recommend this game.... very fun and simple enuff to grasp for most people.  Warning! Could be very addictive. :D
2328,"Minion Masters is a solid game. It took a buddy of mine constant prodding for about a year before I finally installed and tried this game out. What can I say about how it plays? It's a lot like Clash Royale but with a little more polish and more interesting units. Graphically, it gets the job done but doesn't blow any minds. Same for the sound. I mean, this game isnt doing anything incredibly new or interesting but it is a very fun, potentially competitive game that is a lot of fun to play teams with your friends with."
2329,Great f2p game =) fun for parents+kids!
2330,"Fun game because everyone else sucks and I'm the best

Also FUCK JAD and his bullshit mates"
2331,"I've only played a couple hours, but I can already say this is a wonderful game!  It's a blast playing with my wife or friends and crushing our opponents, haHA!  If you are into strategy games that don't require committing to one long game, give this a try.  It's like Clash Royale, but being able to play on my PC in co-op elevates the genre.  Minion Masters incorporates excellent unit design that makes unlocking new units exciting along with a good selection of characters (your base defender) that should help keep deck building from rotting like last months spinach.  All of this is based on less than 3 hours of play; don't hold me to any of this.  Just my observations so far."
2332,"This is a great game, hands down, for this year!  I like the GUI and the variety of units.  It plays very smoothly and is so fun to play with family or friends.  This is the best strategy game in 2021!!"
2333,this game makes me biscuit wet
2334,"Love the game, would love it even more if the Manifest would stop Disappearing !

One of the few games that I am able to stream on Twitch and play with more than 0.25 FPS, I suggest you give it a try, It's Like ClashRoyal BUT GOOD, And HORIZONTAL!!"
2335,"this is addictive
"
2336,"Phenomenal fun, but expensive. Great gameplay, combination of a deckbuilder and tower defense/MOBA. But cards are really hard to accrue, and the monetization model is painfully unforgiving.

There is often an advantage given to certain powerful cards, especially the higher-mana ones.

The power tokens (lootboxes) seem rigged, often choosing from the same small pool of available cards and nearly never resulting in the rarer cards.

Expect to spend a LOT of money (hundreds of dollars) if you hope to complete your collection (or even build a suitable deck) within a human lifetime or two."
2337,"A very enjoyable game to pass the time, you can also play with a friend and have even more fun playing it! :)"
2338,"A few years ago, it had potential. Now it's just a clueless shitfest. The dev's show their incompetence with every single patch and fail to fix their mistakes in time. They have no clue how to balance a game or how to develop it continously with a clear direction. All they do is throw in new cards with new mechanics that have way to MUCH impact or absolutely none. 
f.e. Impatience. This got added a few patches ago and absolutely nobody plays those cards, because it's just bad. (The card plays itself at your master if you havent played a different card for some time). This screws up a lot of strategies and these cards are mostly worthless. But the best part is, instead of listening to the community and developing it with them, they upload ""funny"" videos on Youtube and won't do anything to round this game up. I hope they sell it to a bigger producer who has more experience designing and balancing a game. This is just a soon to be dead game, and the rework or mobile game (which btw is like 3 years to late) won't change that. Sad to see a game with a lot of potential slowly going down the drain. 

But there is one thing, that they recently changed by listening to the community. Fucking Wildcards in 1v1. Thank you at least for removing them from this mode."
2339,I like Minions
2340,"It's fast paced and not difficult to pick up on. It looks similiar to other deck building games where as you win more it's harder to win. Thus far I haven't been forced to spend any money, but I've only been playing for about an hour and a half at this point."
2341,addictive
2342,"This is just a mobile game on steam... it feels pretty pay to win and I'll explain why. You don't start with very many cards and the cards that seem to do the best are ones that are locked behind rubies (Premium currency). If they could make a card type game where everyone is on equal footing (has the same cards starting out), then that would be a miracle. The heroes are also hidden behind a paywall. You can earn a very small amount of rubies through specific challenges but once you complete those challenges you'll have a tough time earning more.

The ranked is also pretty unbalanced. I am (plat 1) and my friend is (diamond 3) And we get paired with a Grandmaster and Masters ranked players multiple times. We also lose a ton of points when we lose to them which makes no sense because they are much higher in ranking. I can see why people can enjoy this game but its just not for me."
2343,it funny minions despicable me!
2344,Fun game!
2345,i mastered my minions
2346,Great tutorial and incentives to get some bonus items early.
2347,"The Devs of this game have no interest in balancing it, when scaling the ranked ladder you will see endless cheese strats that have absolutely no synergy or strategy behind them. Decks that abuse and spam over powered cards are the norm, and creativity has been completely drained from the deck building mechanics of the game due to stupid nerfs on cards that help deal with the cheese and constant buffs for the most obnoxious and broken cards in the game. Most matches revolve around a rock paper scissors game plan where players simply play broken cards to check if their opponent has the very specific and exact counter to that respective card, if they do they win, if not they loose, as simple as that. Not to mention the fact that the ranked system is completely broken, with the majority of players sitting in platinum tier with minimal effort. Don't let the devs convince you that its a strategy game, if your interested in some mindless fun with friends give it a try, but aside from that investing any real time is a waste."
2348,"Opening chests is exciting maybe for the first 30 minutes into the game, but 100 hours later or 1000 hours later, it's just a click barrier that's stopping you from playing the game. Stop making me open boxes ffs"
2349,"Cute, goofy fun. Simple and easily accessible gameplay, with a deckbuilding strategy element. I've only played for a few hours now, but I'm seeing hints at deeper strategies and a dynamic meta. Looking forward to delving deeper."
2350,"pretty complete for a free game. Pay to win in ranked, but lots of fun free things to do."
2351,"Pretty awful game to people who are just starting out My main issues are:

- AI opponents. I played Team Battles and it took 8 hours just to play with real people. During those eight hours, you play with AI with fake usernames so it's hard to tell if they are real people.  The time spent is around 8 hours, even if you win 95% of games with the AI.

- The card variety when you first start out is awful. You don't really make much in the way of tactical choices and it's more about spamming cards. You have to spend money in order to get a decent deck, which allows you to have some creativity in your play."
2352,its fun
2353,"Balance and matchmaking are terrible

Incompetent devs who keep making the game worse.


A meme game that cannot be taken seriously.

JUST sh1t on it, and play for the meme (funny decks etc., troll sweaty incel nerds)


Garbage balancing, full of nerds who abuse garbage cards and tactics, garbage in general."
2354,THIS GAME IS AWESOME i really enjoy this game. nah just playing this game is really good if you want a PC version of clash royal really recommend it.
2355,"I'm not too picky. So I can't think of anything bad about it. In general, I basically just want to party. I like this game a lot. Quick 2 to 8 minute rounds. Lots of strategy and options. Keeps you thinking. Some matches make me laugh. Others frustrate me. But it all depends on the mood I'm in at the time. This is something I'm learning about myself, as I play."
2356,Pay 2 Win game. You can buy power tokens and other stuff to get better cards and outplay free 2 play. Not fun at all.
2357,"great game ,good community and constant updates."
2358,give it a try you'll see
2359,Game is balance.  Exactly what you would expect for a game of its type.
2360,"I had a friend, he used to play games with me. We played all kinds of games on his stream, and were always having fun. Then Minion Masters happened.... Minion Masters stole my friend. He has now reached over 5500 hours played, he only streams this game, and he even does the commentary for their tournaments. I miss my friend, and wish this game would give him back to me. RIP BADASAFISH80 you are missed..... Give me back my friend......"
2361,"Minion Masters; whether you interpret that as derogatory or not is beside the point.
THIS GAME IS ADDICTING! Except, the only withdrawals come from the fact that there isn't more than 25 hours in a day.
Whaaa? There's only 24 hours in a day? I'M ALREADY BEHIND!
R.I.P.
GRIND MODE: By that I mean this game is a grind. Earning currencies at a slow rate is a touch disheartening. There's also a FtP (Free 2 Play), PtW (Pay 2 Win), aspect going on inside this cute little game. 

That aside, this game is undoubtedly worth the download. Are you Master, or are you Minion?
Soo, what are you waiting for? GO TRY IT OUT!"
2362,fun game
2363,it is cool
2364,Enjoy it.
2365,Good Shit.
2366,totally worth it to buy time
2367,I really like the game its fun amd cill. :)
2368,nice
2369,"Pay to win ceiling is pretty high. You'll often find yourself losing to opponents who have much better cards than you and way more time. The only way to get those cards is by spending an exorbitant amount of jewels to even unlock them. So while this is not one hundred percent necessarily pay to win, there is a HUGE pay barrier which is equally as frustrating. With most recent patches, the developers have nearly taken away the ability to gain rubies. This game is fun, but extremely frustrating at the same time. The only way to get good cards is to grind consistently which takes forever. If you want a card? Good luck getting it without spending some dollars to get a chance of getting it. You lose to an enemy opponent? Good luck figuring out why, the game is very basic and doesn't provide logs. I guess they have a replay system?... Could have a simpler method of finding out how you lost. Maybe add some combat logs? For a game that emphasizes on the quickness of matches, I don't want to go back and watch a replay every time I'm confused as to why I lost. Overall game can be fun, but I'd honestly steer away."
2370,Yes.

2395,Really awesome game !
2396,this is a great game for anyone new to steam since it's just a fun card game that you get to play without any p2w
2397,Unique gameplay and fast-paced for those times when you don't have a ton of time to play.
2398,This game is a lot of fun.  But i am VERY disappointed that i for whatever reason have not been able to migrate my discord progress over to steam...
2399,good
2400,i liked the game its time consuming but in a good way
2401,Card game/lazy RTS? Yes please.
2402,pretty good
2403,love this game. Just wish it would load faster
2404,lots  of funn
2405,Very nice competitive casual game.
2406,"IT CUTE, EASY TO PLAY, PRETTY, AND NOT VULGAR OR OVERLY GOREY. I ENJOY IT SO FAR. I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD PLAY THIS WITH YOUR VIDEO GAME AGE APPROPRIATE CHILDREN AND BOTH ENJOY IT."
2407,Best free to play on steam!
2408,"Great take on a deackbuilder. Different units complment each other so well, and there is always a counter-play to what your opponent might be planning. Highly reccommended"
2409,this was refreshing c:
2410,"Game is just simply put, a good bit of fun"
2411,"Pretty fun and you dont have to pay anything, if you join a guild you can use legendary and supreme cards for free temporarily wich can help you climb the ranks. Longer matches last 5 mins wich is awsome. tip: dont spend rubies, only for season pass."
2412,cool
2413,If you like clash royal you will love this
2414,came back after like 6 months and opened chests for 15 minutes
2415,It's fun because  pvp with matches last like 5-10 minutes and it's not a moba
2416,"Amazing game, can't stop playing!"
2417,Play it.
2418,game starts pretty fun
2419,"This game is great in many ways:
- The gameplay is lovely: Its about: playstyle, timing and placement
- It's like hearthstone but you dont need money to collect ALL cards (really free2play)
- It's a grind and collect game...  (1000 Hours and I have all cards)
- Good for playing duo with a friend
- It's creative, fun and fast."
2420,its a a grat stradrey game
2421,I like the game!
2422,"Absolutely fantastic game that I loved playing until I hit gold and hit the paywall. This game has been destroyed by PAY TO WIN. Being able to buy high level cards to dominate your opponents destroys the game. 

The only way to thrive as an online pc multiplayer game is to have the shop pay for cosmetics or even selling the different deck masters is fine like they sell the characters in league of legends but they don't sell advantage over other players. Pay to win is only really on phones these days, pc has evolved past it.

I played until reaching gold then you end up going against guys who spent money in the game. It's pretty fun beating them with the noob cards still, but the game lost it's magic due to pay to win :( 

"
2423,"cons: ranked matchmaking and ladder system isn't great.
pros: everything else."
2424,its like clash royale on pc
2425,its good
2426,"-Lots of units to choose from
-Active devs
-Not P2W (could get card fairly easily)
-Lots of active players

What more could I ask for?"
2427,"The game is fast and easy to learn (it's not discouragingly over-complicated like DOTA or similar games), and the matches are quick and frenetic."
2428,Good wee game. Bit of a learning curve but i think im getting there
2429,"Love it
 good stuff"
2430,"easy to play, quick matches, PC experience much smoother than Xbox. F2P with opportunity for micro transactions if desired (not necessary really)"
2431,"Lots of fun fast, well made, easy to start hard to master"
2432,amazing <3
2433,"Not bad, definitely not pay to win but still has its flaws especially in ranked"
2434,Fun game
2435,fun game so far
2436,"Yeah was fun, lol."
2437,its nice game
2438,Super fun and easy to learn. Im very impressed with all the visuals and my favorite is the game announcer its super funny sometimes!!!
2439,"Pretty fun game, no real pressure to buy stuff.  It's a nice looking cards in lanes with the added depth of precision placement."
2440,the game is dong good so far i hope they keep it up
2441,its fun and not too hard yet
2442,"Great game
"
2443,f*ck ya I recommend Minion Masters. Does the tin man have an iron c&ck? MINION MASTAS
2444,"Seems pretty solid. There's a battle pass but it doesn't look like it makes anything pay to win, just unlocks content faster. Game appears to be fair."
2445,"This is an amazing game a lot like boom beach or clash royale, but this one allows you to get all the cards without paying! there's so many cards, so many strategies."
2446,super

2449,Fun game. Easy to get into
2450,"New to this genre game, thought it was fun, the solo and duo games, i met a guy that had a bad day so we done some duos now we went from no rank to Stone Rank 1. i think we progressed pretty good! good way to make friendships! No toxicity in this game 

It just goes to show you that we are all human, and have feelings and we dont know what happens to peoples life so for those guys that decide to be toxic with others, take a second and think about this."
2451,"Had fun with it, but as with most games that are ""mobile"" in essence - I'm not interested for long. Had fun though!"
2452,its fun and there are a variety of minions to choose.you can make your deck as powerful as you want.
2453,"Why are you giving me a gold teammate to fight a platinum and diamond, when I'm a diamond, on a conquest match?

And ban some of the griefers ffs."
2454,yea its pretty good
2455,"I played like 15 matches since I started and havent lost one. I am usually terrible at games, and I think I got a dlc pack so that might have something to do with it. Scared it may be p2w but uhh im winning so 10/10 would win again"
2456,pee pee poo poo
2457,"Yeah, i used to think i love u 
now i know it aint true
now i know that i play only cs"
2458,iz fun
2459,"This game is great and is accessible for everyone. Easy to play with a high skill ceiling.


It took me over 100 hours to ""perfect"" this game in terms of achievements, in this time much has changed.
I love that the devs are constantly updating it and adding new content, there's always something to spend your hard earned in-game currency on. I've got pretty much all that I've wanted out of this game and looking at their cool and lovable coming-up story as a company I did go ahead and make sure I had all of the DLC, which only added to my enjoyment. Of course, you'll also love that most of the DLC's are free for a limited time (usually as soon as they come out for a couple of days) which is awesome at leveling the playing field.

Gameplay wise the higher level you get the less fun it is. For a while I'd been stuck at Diamond enjoying myself and refusing to buckle to the copycat low card technique that a lot of higher end players use. Playing at Diamond & beyond will take a significant amount of the enjoyment away from the game as it becomes a tedious task instead of an exciting duel with varied cards and wildly different techniques. Although there's tons of cards available and such a wide berth of gameplay styles there's really only a few different approaches that are successful for wins and you'll know what I'm talking about at only the 10-15 hour mark. It's quite sad but the big bad cards (8 mana and higher) are generally useless at the higher rounds unless you build the rest of your deck around them and find some inconceivable way to make them work, in which case props to you.

Over time the season pass has become less and less attractive although it's still worthwhile especially if you're in the mood for grinding through that particular month. The daily offerings are also weaker than they'd been before but these are both understandable, the devs are not able to earn much from recurring players due to their good free offerings, and this is their (acceptable) attempt at being able to encourage micro-transactions. I'm not complaining, it's a FTP game and it's pretty well put together, just stating facts.

I hope in the future that besides the cool new masters, maps, and cards being added that the devs take into consideration that over 75% of a recurring players deck may never be used after its initial playthrough because of how matches and abilities are set to win. Hundreds of cards don't mean much if you keep seeing the same 50 over and over again. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that it is a very unique and interesting twist on the card game genre, it's like the ultimate form of the tower defense flash games from my childhood but now with cards in it.

PRO-TIP
Buy all of your masters with in-game currency when they hit the store (they will be discounted). Then after you've bought as many as you can buy the All-Masters Upgrade and you'll be refunded the full value of the masters. You can get thousands of rubies (usually a lot more than $20 of rubies worth) this way!

TLDR
Game is great, you might get tired sooner than you think though, I'm willing to bet around the 100 hour mark or sooner. Good amount of content, micro-transactions aren't bad at all. If you're not the most interested in cosmetic items you may find yourself bored with the new cards unable to find good play-styles at high levels with them and find yourself sitting on a large amount of in-game currency, but I don't think this'll happen before the 50-hour mark."
2460,"First things first, I played Clash Royale since Beta. I have put into it about 500 hours, a phone game I know. I loved it for awhile, until they decided that the only good decks were hog rider decks and nerfed Giant skeleton to oblivion. This game is everything I wanted clash royale to be and more. If you liked CR play this game and have fun"
2461,good
2462,"I love to play 2 v 2, a lot of fun"
2463,Simple to learn. A blast to play. Complexity hidden within. Great job!
2464,"great, awesome, fun!!!!!"
2465,Stupid Brutish Betrayers!!!
2466,Good
2467,clash royale done right
2468,"I never thought in the history of me playing video games, i would bother leaving a review of any sort: This game has so many mini expansions that give you trivial ""rewards"" of shit you already have, and makes you click non-stop for 10minutes every time just to play the game. ENOUGH. Make a goddamn skip button!"
2469,"fun game
"
2470,"games filled with people who just spam units the game is filled with lots of unbalanced units ant tbh its not even that good you get stuck in ranks bcs its p2w with the units that you can buy but with a paid fake currency even with the  the new master its cancer so yh dont do what i did and pretend that this game is worth the 50 hours of your time....its not trust me
"
2471,aston the kid doxxed me
2472,The amount of RNG in this shit is unbelievable.
2473,"At first glance I was like ""This is a clash royale knock-off"" But I humored my friend and played it anyways. Its insanely fun and I can totally see myself grinding this like crazy. Definitely worth the download."
2474,i really recommend this game it's honestly enjoyable and the aspect that the games only take only five to six minutes to play is nice because you can get back in to the game as soon as you like and it's a great time killer if you're waiting for your food to get out of the microwave  or got time to spare in general i really recommend trying it out your battles await
2475,GOOD GAME
2476,Send the right little dudes or go dead.
2477,Take your time to learn everything and it's not too bad. Like all all other card games. The only difference is the realtime aspect.
2478,this game is just so addicting and the gameplay is just amazing! good game
2479,its a cool game and better than clash royale tbf sym
2480,"Nice and laid back chilling in a chair with quick and fun games.
Shortest wining matches in 30-40 seconds and the longest in 5-7 minutes.
"
2481,"Dead game. Won 99% of all my games because I kept getting matched with bots. Besides, it has a season pass and all the gacha crap."
2482,Nice game
2483,proper sick gme yeah bare good proper good
2484,cool
2485,This game is mostly pay to win and you gotta do whatever the META is because if you try to make unique decks you will only get murdered time and time again oh and never play coop with randoms because they will be the bane of your existence since they rarely ever coordinate which in the end will create a loss for you.
2486,Seamless fun
2487,Fun game for a fun guy that likes to eat fungi (mushrooms)

2490,it a good game
2491,"Its very often that game will just crash right away after loading new match. 
I had many games 2v2 where usually one person was out, which will be inevitable loss for 1v2 team ...
This bug is very frustrating and make game unplayable in long term. 
Developers instead of releasing new characters and skins for their in game $hop, should focus on fixing this basic issue."
2492,just bad
2493,"Only played this with my partner. We enjoy watching our minions murder other peoples minions together. A great couple bonding time. 

At time of review I have played 121 hours. I recieved this game for free the day it cam out by signing up too the email for it... A good couple years ago now. I go a long time not playing it at all... then playing for like 20-30 minutes everyday for a month or so. It's a game we keep coming back to"
2494,"Solid game, very little pay to win. Countless hours of good times"
2495,"+ Pros

+ Co-Op/team play
+ Decent gameplay
+ Decent art

- Cons

- Constant stutters on high end pc (1080 TI, Ryzen 5800x, SSD)
- Intense micro transaction manipulation (Lots of rewards at the start, and then NOTHING) ""Nothing creates addiction like an inconsistent reward""
- Seemingly P2W as some players seem to have insanely powerful cards, whilst getting any cards from gameplay takes forever without paying.
- Spams notifications about microtransactions & newsletters."
2496,YES PLAY IT AND ENJOY
2497,Good game
2498,nice game.
2499,fun
2500,"Ritual of servitude is not fun to play with or against. Weird balancing -  shield captain avea is a legendary that drags you down, while a common defenso chopper counters most melee units. 
Factions are unbalanced - mono empyrean decks have bad ranged units and beefy melee units that dont work together.  Outlander is fun but lacks melee units, void is amazing for face decks, elves got multiple indirect nerfs via the golems.
Zen chi is still the developer's favorite and has its legendaries in a state where nerfs do not stop the decks from being meta, while being paired with stuns that are able to easily turn the game around. I dont even remember a time period since their release, where zen chi was not one of the meta decks.
Overall good game, but those balancing issues prohibit the players from playing non meta decks, and along with them , more than half of the cards."
2501,Great game literally would rate 5 out of 5 but after every season you have to click through your rewards instead of being able to open all at once. For that reason alone i would give 2 out of 5
2502,"Game free, and is basically more user friendly clash royale. I am fully free to play and haven't really grinded this game super hard (most of my hours are from accidentally leaving it on in when I go to bed lol), and I have like 20 legendaries and most commons, uncommons, and rares. There isn't even too much card bloat (a bunch of useless/completely outclassed cards) and the wild card system is a very interesting take. You can take extra copies of cards but you are also making your deck bigger so you need to make it count. Overall, pretty good, and transactions aren't shoved down your throat, just always kept in the back as an option."
2503,"Nice game, it reminds me of BattleForge."
2504,"card game moba. matches are typically less than 5 minutes, so its a fun way to kill some time. kinda slow if you dont spend money on it"
2505,the game is fun and i enjoy playing it
2506,"Easy to pick up. I bet its hard to master, but im enjoying it so far!"
2507,Some times in 2vs2 battles you get what seems like a lvl 1 bot on your team in a battle vs 2x platinum or above players... really sucks
2508,it gud
2509,"they want your money,but it's still fun"
2510,"Fun game that's easy to get into. Lots of variety and interesting cards/minions to play around with. Games only last 2 to 5 minutes max, so it's an easy game to play when short on time or just start up when you have nothing else to do. 

DLC's have been given out very regularly. I don't really like the whole monthly ""season pass"" thing, but if that together with some increased pricing helps the devs keep this game alive, it's fine by me. I found it very easy to get enough cards to be somewhat able to play ranked, especially with a friend. 
There are games where you just feel completely powerless, where the enemy just spams ""rush to hero tower and nuke it down"" kind of minions, where you can't do anything about it. If anyone played hearthstone, it's like playing against face hunter, but being actually A-tier in this game. 
Definitely worth to try out, especially with a friend you can have a blast playing 2-3 games in a day."
2511,wish i had someone to play this with
2512,"This game is a blast - the online competition is fun and the rules and cards are fair.  There are no ""superior"" metas to worry about and balance issues are few and far in between.  All in all, this is a must play."
2513,"Game keep crashing ..... i wish play on twitch but still crashing ..... :( .... proton proton .... make master minions playable please ....

Pro

Fast game strategy 


Cons

Many combined games make you get stuck on league where you is forced play with people with uncompatible skills on that league. 
Dont put money here."
2514,"Played this game on and off for awhile. For what the game type is, it is okay. The devs have constantly added more content to try to keep it ""fresh"" but sadly due to that, the balance has tilted over time and has stayed that way. Personally I feel they need to spend a large time in finding balance instead of adding more which will keep the balance off."
2515,جميله جداً وتنفع لاصحاب القلوب الضعيفه
2516,Its a fun game I have not spent money on the game and didn't feel lacking . Give it a try however i do have a descent newer computer and for some reason this game has given me some random issues while playing that games that require much more do not.
2517,is niceeeeee
2518,"Simple, Casual, Strategic.
Very Fun. Quick Matches. Low Queue Time.
Can play to grow all for FREE. Speed up card collection by purchasing expansions.
You'd be silly to ignore this one.
======================================

UPDATED 2022
this game is turning into blizzards hearthstone.. matchmaking went to poop. you either get countered or counter the other deck. the randomness of matches has been dissapearing over the last year. If they keep on going the way they're going.. this game will be a money pit despite all the freeness. Because the top decks are ALWAYS the cards you haven't had to spend craploads of money on. Its all about the algorithm. First couple of years the dev team did good. Not so much anymore.

Because of this I almost want to hit thumbs down on the recommendation.. however.. overall, this game still is worth it. But once you get enough hours under your belt you may start to feel differently. So take caution.
Would i buy the expansions??? lol never in a million years.. 
The top decks basically use all the common free cards.. thanks to their stupid match making. 
This is THE BEST ABSOLUTELY FREE game you'll ever play.
BUUUUUUTTT...... if you actually want to get creative with deck making and strategies.. lmfao what a fackin waste of money. I spent money till I had all the cards so I could run all the ideas. it doesn't fackin matter. No amount of money matters in this game. Hence the top decks. All quick decks..  low cost, wait for mana frenzy, and win. 
I've won alot before the last year, with decks, with matches between 1 to 2 mins. Now avg time in matches is 5-8 mins. With all this ""BALANCING"" shet they got going on.. you usually will be waiting to be the 1st to frenzy to win. Its getting really old. 
=======
my friend and i played for almost a week nonstop , using the exact same deck. For that week, there was countered or be countered. We could feel what it was we would pretty much go up against, and we just stuck with the decks. 
Then, we both switch it up. Now guess what, everything we have been seeing for the last week, went away like that, POOF. *SNAP*. and now we were facing a whole new meta of counter or be countered. 
This is what hearthstone does. and that is how they get you to spend money. because you think you want to build the next best thing that will counter  what is countering you or break the cycle. but as soon as  you build that deck, and the matching learns enough about your deck or whatever to realize what you need to be matched against, you'll facking be stuck in the same god manit cycle of bull poop. So it will never matter how much money u fackin spend.

I believe most games now do this as a way to pull the most money from your pocket. So now us gamers in the 21st century who didn't grow up on nintendo 64 like myself, and medal of honor allied assault or americas army, the original good games of pc's, only get to play in a world of schemes to get money. The game industry is turning to shit.  Hackers on FPS's that can't be stopped because its a pay-to-keep system, or algorithms that make you spend money, tricking you into believing the more options you have the more you can ""outsmart"" the opponents. Which never comes. Because none of it is ever truly random. Stop giving this industry your money. The only games worth it these days are offline, private coop storytelling games and very minutely, the mmo's.  Because they're at least monitored and managed actively. 
Fuck this industry."
2519,yes
2520,"the battles, the characters, the excitement."
2521,It's a fun game Reminds me of clash Royale but it's good
2522,"Balancing just isn't good enough for me to honestly recommend. If you just like fucking around and want to enjoy a free game then definitely go for it. Otherwise, if you're trying to be competitive I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
2523,fun little card battle game.
2524,facebook mom
2525,"like crash royale but actually good
"
2526,its ight prolly
2527,"Meh, it's obvious that the game was made for profit. Not sure if i ever played against real people to be honest. Pretty sure i was against bots who had the names of previous players or something. Nothing else to say."

2530,great time burner simple play mechanics
2531,it fun
2532,Noice.
2533,its aight
2534,great fun with kave
2535,Scotts honest reviews on youtube gives this a 10/10 its a super fun game to play and it makes you want to actually plot different ways to win!
2536,"426 hours in at like 5 minutes average per game, you do the math. It's not pay to win, you can grind basically everything out for free. Good game, can get in and play quick matches. Definitely recommend!"
2537,it fun
2538,"Devs: We offer to you free DLC as a gift :)
Also Devs: AAAA WE CANT MAKE MONEY

Community: It's not pay to win!
Devs: **Paywalls the newest master that happens to be brutally overpowered**

Community: You can still earn the new master for free!
Season Pass: Tier 49! Better hope you don't have a job or a life!

Devs: Don't be toxic!
Also Devs: **Makes a game based on unfair competative mechanics, on top of terrible unity coding and many broken features**

I've really lost my patience with the hypocrisy and bullshit. You don't have to play this game, it will probably get bought out by EA or some other mega corp when the economy collapses and the devs file for bankruptcy."
2539,this game is mad the big selling point for me that i find so many games fall short is THE MINIONS PHYSICALLY CHANGE WHEN UPGRADED YEEEEESSSSS!!!!!! i love it great job everyone
2540,Its good.
2541,"its a good mobile game tho , if those ever existed"
2542,Very Fun
2543,I like this game very much
2544,Look Milloween is hot and i have way too many hours in this game. One of my favorite games to chill out and play.
2545,Seems really fun and fair price wise. I will play more and update when i come to a conclusion
2546,"Poor support. I reported a bug, e-mailed their support, followed-up on it and all I got was an automated response. I just wanted them to restore a card I purchased with shards which was somehow lost from my collection. I was a paying player and just disappointed with the lack of support. Won't be playing this anymore."

2549,Super fun.
2550,"Its what you get when you mix CCG with a tower defense. Not bad, kinda engaging... I am sad that it got priority over the Rogue Like, Forced Showdown was quite a bit of fun. But business is business I guess. Thumbs up if you like CCGs and Tower Defense."
2551,Clash royale but not wallet destroyer.
2552,quite fun game espeically for a free game
2553,"I would give this a ""maybe"" but I tend towards a ""No"".
The general gameplay is simpleand honestly, fine enough. But I am appaled at how bad the deck building is for a game based around deck building. The UI is utterly terrible.
It also takes quite a while to get stuff ""for free"" and most of the rewards is just a spam of useless stuff.

Even so, in coop with a friend, it's OK enough for a few rounds. But the overall lack of polish really makes me not to put too much time into it."
2554,fun free fast
2555,nice
2556,"Clash Royale+ Lol/Dota champions.
Nice."
2557,"Addictive. Played on Xbox but the support wasn't as good and would lag sometimes, no issue with the PC version :)"
2558,great game
2559,Game is very fun with a very fair and enjoyable player base.  You can pay for a season pass in this game but it does not feel as if it boost the player base so much that they are unbeatable.
2560,Just brilliant.
2561,good game but pay to win
2562,Fun to play
2563,Ranked Games Will Make You Quit.
2564,it is cool
2565,"Do yourself a favor and download this game right now!
This game is so cool, the graphics are good enough, as well as the sound, animations and everything else, it´s all good quality. If you remember Magic the Gathering Battlegrounds and liked it, download this game.
It has a lot of variety in everything, it´s essentialy a card game, and you can make decks each with it´s own strategy, sadly I still see so much potential and content they could still add to this game, like zombies for example, but it´s a masterpiece even now. It´s a fun game, you can play 1vs1 and 2vs2. It has trading cards, achievements, controller support... It´s free, but sadly it´s pay to win, basically you can buy gems wich give random cards with real money or buy daily store offers for legendary cards wich sadly means that richer people will have advantage over others. But even then if your good you can still kick their ass. This game is well balanced, not perfect but at least fair enough, that everyone always has a fighting chance, wich means there is never a perfect deck, wich my brother is still trying to build ahaha.
Sadly there aren´t enough deck slots, wich is just stupid, if you want more deck slots you must pay if I remember correctly 20 euros for the premium, Wich I wouldn´t mind if it was the only thing where real money would be involved AND the prices are absurd, more than 10 euros in gems for one skin? or for one map layout? 
The game doesn´t look much heavy on the system, but if you try to play for a full day straight with the graphics on max your game WILL start to freeze, It happens to me on a GTX 1080 TI.
With all that said, it´s still a masterpiece, and it´s free, if you like card games like Magic or Heartstone for example download this right now, if you don´t know download it too."
2566,"Great casual game that could use more love.

Mostly 3-5 minute games, I dip in and out for half an hour or so at a time, depending on my mood. Drop minions on the field and let them battle it out. Not too many twitch muscles required, but a nice adrenaline buzz and quick tactical decisions.

This is my go-to game for when I need a bit of quick stimulation and to wake my brain up. Won't be complex enough for many, but that suits me just fine. I'm not the kind of person who likes to think about things until my ears bleed.

The devs are very generous with giving stuff away, a bit too generous really since devs gotta eat, but like every other free to play game you're signing up for a fair grind to collect every card. That is, after all, the business model that keeps people coming back - gotta collect them all.

Luckily chase-cards tend towards the niche end of things and there are plenty of viable decks full of just commons and rares. Regardless, every single card in the game is craftable, and with only 10 cards in a deck there's no reason at all why everyone can't be playing one of the fully decked out top of leader board builds within a month or so of collecting dailies."
2567,Super fun game.
2568,Likely the best free game you will ever install. Created and maintained by wonderful humans that really care about their community. My entire family plays it. Would absolutely recommend!
2569,fun game that you can advance through the ranks without spending money on ptw stuff. so you dont need to worry about paying to win if youre good at deck building and strategy. i got to solo platinum ranking within maybe 4 or 5 hours. played a lot of co op with my friend and thats a lot of fun.
2570,is good
2571,yes
2572,"The game is pretty enjoyable and pretty intense when it comes to strategy and thinking what to play next, you need to think ahead of your opponent"
2573,"Fun, easy to pick up, doesn't seem P2W, at least yet, only lvl 10"
2574,great game
2575,"this game is absolutely fantastic. as a rpg and cartoon game lover .
this isjust perfect"
2576,"Pretty fun, fast matching, 15 sec queue and ranked games"
2577,"Good game. Sadly this game was developed by people with boxing gloves so it literally stutters like crazy on a decent PC making it unplayable.
EDIT: It ain't perfect but it's better."
2578,nice
2579,good game.
2580,"easy to get into, easy to play. Hard to master. Very fun!"
2581,nice free game ! recomended
2582,"Much more than I expected, recommended with no doubts"
2583,fun and easy to get into.

2585,Clash Royale on PC.
2586,"nah, its lagging when it shouldnt"
2587,Good approved :D
2588,"ok
"
2589,worst matchmaking out of any game i've ever played.
2590,"VERY LITTLE PAY TO WIN! 
A great game with clever strats and after a little bit of playing you can build a collection that lets you play competitively. Once you build a deck it will always be the same stats as any other deck with same cards so no one can just pay a bunch to destroy every deck out there."
2591,A smeg filled meta fest that repels ingenuity. 10/10
2592,"fun, free, fantastic.. give it a crack!"
2593,Looks fun.
2594,darko i kuskus hentai coming soon?!!?
2595,"Matches are quick, game is simple to understand, and progression is fast.

After playing for only two weeks, I've managed to get to Diamond in every league, and I can safely say that, in the upper tiers, there are definitely some meta units, but there is still a lot of deck diversity.

Very competitive! If you want single-player content, there really isn't much worth writing home about.

Note: Co-op with a friend is the best way to enjoy this, but solo battles are pretty fun too!"
2596,It is better and more enjoyable then i though. a copy from clash royale with some twistes
2597,"Don't take this game seriously, it is very much pay to win. Hell even the in game announcer has a quip that says ""spin to win"" which is is him talking about the tokens that you buy to get RNG cards. GL though, you only get one card for each spin. Just like Hearthstone, you gotta drop a ton of cash to even compete unless you were a beta player devoting your life to the game since day 1."
2598,"This game is a more complicated version of clash royals, better in every form and fun to play. It’s not pay to win, you can become great at this game without paying a single cent"
2599,game go bbrrrrrrr
2600,"What's not to like! It's a card game with a lot of minions.
There is strategy involved, and i mostly like playing team battles.
And like i read somewhere, if opponent doesn't summon any minion for a while, it doesn't mean they're afk... they're probably preparing a push.
Very fun game."
2601,good game works on linux
2602,"Good game, fun game play so far pretty ok balance"
2603,"Started playing it out of boredom. Unluckily I don't think I will keep doing it. The base idea is nice, although not particularly original. You play some cards as in a normal trading cards game, they generate some monsters or spells, they either fight with each other or go straight for the enemy's head. Unluckily the strategy is partially flawed by the ""real time"" play style and by the limited amount of cards you can carry. You won't really be able to do a lot of strategy here, and actually most opponents seem to anyway not care and throw in the arena whatever they have as well. Others likely rely on forums or a few common card combos,  you'll likely face always the same tactics and monsters over and over again.
The second, biggest issue is that this is indeed a pay-to-win game. The disparity between paying and non paying people is absolutely huge. I've won maybe 30 matches for example, and received a few (little) useless coins. If I paid for the limited ""season pass"", on top of that I'd have received granted rare cards, extra random cards, shards and rubys (to buy whatever card you want and extra heroes). You rank up very quickly, so just in a day or two you'll match with people with tons of rare cards."
2604,No.
2605,"Developers defend trolls and griefers. 
Developers censor legal messages. 
Matchmaking is trash. No requirements. I saw many new players in the middle ranks.

I like games like this!

AAA gameplay
AA-AAAA graphics
AAA optimization
A-AA matchmaking
-AAA developers"
2606,its lit
2607,"I think it's fun and it's outlandish. you use strategy to win. playing cards with interesting cards to play.

Update - after over a year of playing this game it has become one of my favorites and favorites of this type of game. really fun game and LOTS of strategy. lots of different cards. if you haven't gave this game a fair try you're missing out, highly recommended."
2608,Great gameeeeee love it
2609,just found it and wow amazing announcer amazing minion ideas I could not of hoped for a better game listen 20/10 just get it no doubt if not then suit yourself but honestly go try it for the best time ever :)
2610,I think its a game
2611,Good interesting timepass game . No skill required just put those cards on the field tbh . The game is only for time pass and dnt chase for Rank not worth it . Overall good game
2612,"The game is okay, but like most card games, a lot of it just comes down to buying lots of cards for an advantage. If you're into that, you may like the game, however."

2615,"This game is one thing and one thing only; dopamine. This game is unfairly fun, why would you even play anything else with how much this game rewards you?"
2616,Good game
2617,good
2618,"Pretty fun game with quick matches. However, it is abundantly clear there is an onslaught of cheaters using some script to make their Mana increase faster then the normal rate. And no, it is absolutely not legit for any shlub who says otherwise. Be nice if the Devs could hammer that out and we could get some fair matches again."
2619,fun game!
2620,very fun game. one of the best ive played in this genre.
2621,"Minion Masters is a free to play rts deckbuilding game. I would call it a deckbuilding auto chess. From what I played, it's an alright game, but it did remind me why I hated competitive online games with microtransactions. Like Hearthstone, you can just grid an ungodly amount of time to be able to keep up, or pay money. So it's not bad, it's kind of fun, but it's not for me. 
And I give this 5/10."
2622,Team games are super fun.
2623,"gOOD GaME
"
2624,Pretty straight forward and enjoyable
2625,I love this game even sometimes the power of the card can delete your troops lol.
2626,"If you're a casual gamer like myself, that enjoy the 30 minutes gameplay here and there. This might be for you.
There's not much lore in the game, no massive backstory, no  immense skill-tree.
only you, your cards/minions and you opponent..... oh and the commentator!

so sit down, download the game (remember to install it) and start smashing some buttons!

you can't pay to get cards, you wouldn't otherwise get from normal game play.
I have the exact same cards as the number 1 on the leaderboards, but i'm still shite for the game.

BTW, i haven't payed any money towards the game and i still got all 38 achievements!"
2627,Very fun game
2628,"Overall Very Engaging, Very Quick both in pacing and length, feels rewarding so far.
Music and Graphics are also up-there. One negative would be sometimes a random freeze when leveling up or similar.
The game is great for a quick time-spender for a fun time due to the speed of the game overall. 
You might get this ""I might go for just another one"" type of feeling at times.
The game also features 2v2 Modes besides the expected 1v1 which adds a lot to the experience if you have a friend.
Recommended!"
2629,"Worst game ever, save yourself a lot of grief and avoid it at all cost."
2630,Fantastic game and the devs keep on giving. Its completely free to play but I don't mind spending a few bucks here and there to support the devs.
2631,It's a really fun game to play alone or with some friends
2632,cool cool cool
2633,Balance and core gameplay is generally very good. Could use some work on UI. New content comes regularly enough. Not pay to win.
2634,Pretty Good
2635,"Really great game!
Beforehand I was playing on Discord and I've only recently downloaded it on steam (so I dont have a lot of hours here)
Theres just so much content to enjoy and things to do that honestly this game deserves more recognition.
It's really fun to put together new decks, or play in the adventures or even try climbing the ranks! Though I mostly play 2v2, beacuse I really enjoy the chaotic nature of it.
The only negative about it that I could say is that the game is quite buggy, and sometimes crashes for seemingly no reason. But yeah defidently a great game!"
2636,free and fun
2637,yes yes yes
2638,Very relaxing and good paced game.
2639,"love it 
"
2640,"played back in beta, had fun, this feels even better. 2v2 is a lot of fun too. good free content"
2641,its like chess just know where to move the players
2642,"Simple fun, very little commitment."
2643,Awesome game! Having a ton of fun
2644,"The last few updates took a lot of my enjoyment out of the game. Games are so snowbally that comeback is basicly impossible. In the first 1 min of a match i can already see if I am going to lose.
Nonetheless this is the best game of its kind on top of being fairly f2p friendly. Waiting for next patch to fix some issues but it s still an OK game."
2645,"Really fun game. Spending money not necessary, but helpful for quicker progression. I played countless hours of Clash Royale and clones, but Minion Masters is my favorite version of this type of game I've played. Well worth checking out, especially because it's free!"
2646,Spell Masters my dudes
2647,"My husband loves this game and introduced me to it. It's faced paced, quick to understand, a lot of features, very generous, very fun! Recommend it heavily. Will buy stuff when I'm not poor anymore :)"
2648,Very fun
2649,top game
2650,mega gierka
2651,"UPDATE: THIS GAME HAS TURNED INTO CRAP> A glitchy laggy peice of garbage. Unplayable.... Game is incredible. A 100% recommendation to everyone. Fun, simple yet deep, matches last around 3 min, which is a godsend when other games take 30-40 minutes a round. Lots of bugs that piss me off, but not enought to say this game is not finished. So thank you to the team who made this. This is a summoning card game. F2P with payed scenarios. You can participate in pvp without spending a buck. I highly recommend the expansions."
2652,"Fast , Cool , Competitive and  Creative"
2653,"i like shooting ,game is cool
"
2654,is prretttyy goot
2655,"A cheap, ugly rip-off. The elves are a straight up copy of the World of Warcraft Night Elves, the rats are Warhammer 40k Orks and you'll even spot some Space Marines in this game. Nothing about this abomination is new or interesting, creative or unique in any way shape or form, it's simply an unmotivated and uninspired money-grab made by people who have no interest in their work, only in their money.

Don't waste your time on this ""free to play"" mobile-game."
2656,"fun and fast gameplay, very fair f2p, no need to spend money"
2657,"I am just going to say simply, yes! Fantastic game with active community."
2658,The only card game that i play other than Slay The Spire
2659,Well a good game if you have to many time to spare just farm gold and unlock new monsters.
2660,Nice fun and quick gameplay
2661,so much fun
2662,"One of the most non-pay2win free games I've played. Take it from me - people who think this game is pay2win are still VERY new and just got beat by a better skilled player.

The card crafting system makes it easy to gain new cards in the common and uncommon rarity, you can save up for ""rare"" cards, and legendary rarity is quite expensive - but almost entirely unnecessary to own. Additionally, the Season Pass/Battle Pass/whatever only adds about 2 new cards per season, and they are typically *not* overpowered, just new and usually with unique mechanics of some kind. Season Pass is unnecessary to buy (with regards to winning).

Success in this game is dependent upon player skill - largely, that means learning to build a deck that has a variety of cards that are useful against common types of threats, combined with enough game sense to understand when and where to play your cards, and learning what all the cards do so you know how to counter them. There's not so many cards that it's really that difficult to learn them.

Newer players will just spam their cards right at the edge of the bridges, as soon as they have the mana to play them. The better solution is to learn what the minions do, and counter-play something to deal with it - preferably playing a ""solution"" that costs less mana than your opponent's card, so eventually you have a virtual lead in available mana, which gives you the resources to counterattack. *THAT* is the real gameplay loop, and once you learn it, it is very enjoyable!"
2663,if a game lasts more than 2 minutes you're doing it wrong
2664,"Absolutely love this game! Reminds me a lot of Clash Royale on mobile, except you can 2v2 here.

Good fun with friends!"
2665,great game!
2666,"COOL game , must play for once, little bit similar to DOTA2"
2667,This game is a lot of fun! I have not played for long but I am enjoying it so far. The 2v2 mode is cool!
2668,Great game!
2669,Fun and entertaining. Only 9 gb an free so download and give it a try.
2670,its fun
2671,Fun game.
2672,"Its a good game but the matchmaking is a joke. if you are a decent player you get matched with complete brain dead people over 70% of your matches. Wich doesn't allow you to progress in rank further in teamplay. Also, there is an matchmaking algorythm in place where 1/3 of your matches you're matched against the perfect counter to your own deck. Its like win 2, lose 1. Pretty much all the time. If you want to avoid gamerage, stay away from this."
2673,"It is with a heavy heart after 351 hours that I bid farewell to Minion Masters. 

I started playing May 5th 2017, back when the game was in Early Access, and wasn't free to play yet. Back then, there weren't hardly any expansions, no adventures, and far less overall content in general. BetaDwarf had a wonderful concept in mind; an arena-based deck builder card game. Minions were summoned from their respective Master towers, and marched towards the middle of the arena to kill each other off in droves. Back then, there was no 2v2 mode; just good old dueling at its finest. You complete quests to earn both freemium (Shards) and premium (Rubies) currency; Shards allow you to craft cards and earn Masters, and Rubies are used purely for cosmetics (Master skins and arenas). It didn't take much to earn enough shards to craft the majority of the cards in the game, and by the time I'd bought all the Masters, they came out with an upgrade pack that gave you access to all Masters and refunded you the shards you invested in buying them for $20. Along with that, they were giving out free expansion content way more than most developers usually do.

So why do I leave a negative review for the game? Minion Masters has gone through A LOT of changes since 2017, both good and bad, but the bad became so unbearable that both me and my friends grew tired with logging in for daily rewards even, more so unmotivated to play the game at all. 

1. Like most games these days, Minion Masters joined the trend of adding a Battle Pass to the game to give players incentive for continuous play; was really nice they included a freemium version for those that didn't want to shell out $10 for the premium version. For me, what made the battle pass a bummer was that when you reached max rank in it, the later rewards were so stale in comparison to the previous 100 tiers: A couple tokens and a few pieces of gold thrown at you didn't feel very rewarding, especially when they did away with the tokens entirely and made it gold only. The final straw was when they started putting new cards exclusively in the premium pass, locking players out with a paywall until the the expansion became older to let players craft the cards.

2. With new expansions came new masters; one in particular was Morellia, which brought about a lot of undead cards, including a colossal dragon that slowly charged the battlefield and ignited enemies in a wave of fire. Here's the problem, ever since the dragons introduction, players in the community that didn't feel the urge to adapt relentlessly complained that the dragon was overpowered. I personally found it to be a challenge, and with a friends help, we made a list of cards that easily countered the dragon, negating it entirely; even went as far as posting it repeatedly on the forums to spread the word (other players even quoted us on it), but to no avail: The community screamed for nerfs, and BetaDwarf happily obliged until the dragon had her health chunked, reduced to 1 per team, etc until it became a shell of its former self. Nerfing new cards to the ground just because the community refuses to adapt to meta changes kills the game entirely for everyone.

3. The final nail in the coffin after almost 4 years of enjoyment was BetaDwarf themselves making the biggest slap to the community they could deliver: the demanding of more money. Here's my issue with this: Yes, Minion Masters is a free to play game, and they no longer make money off purchases of the game itself, so their only revenue is through the Ruby currency and cosmetics. However, the game itself has sold really well since I started, and I find it hard to believe their need for as much money as they claim to be entirely accurate (Unless their budgeting skills need some work). Their solution to this problem was to all but entirely remove the ability to earn the premium Ruby currency; this is unacceptable for a free to play title because you have to entice your players to keep playing your game (Especially if some of us paid money for the game upfront, and were conveniently forgotten about). To bring about a point my friend made, you can't force players to buy the premium currency only without handing out a little bit for free every now and then. Gold isn't good enough, you HAVE to entice players to keep playing, otherwise they'll be like me and drift off to brighter horizons. Being stingy will make you money in the short run, but in the long run your reputation will suffer because your consumers are your customers, your players, and the reason you make money to begin with.

Until BetaDwarf resolves these issues, I will not be returning to Minion Masters anytime soon, and will leave the game uninstalled, warding off anyone interested in the game in the meantime. They won't listen to veteran players (or common sense in general), so they don't need a player base. If you want out of the grave, put down the shovel."
2674,"========
The Pros
========

- Games are quick. Good for casual players.
- Do not need an incredibly high-end PC to run.
- Always people on to play against.  No waits.
- Dev's actively work on it.
- No bugs, crashes.
- You can get all the cards in-game for free, with time.



========
The Cons
========

- It's a F2P, so basically, pay-to-win. Those who sink $$$ into game have better cards.
- The 'Report Leaver' button is broken.
- At higher ranks, you are still matched with some people who do not know how to play.
- Teammates tend to give up and troll if you do not play how they want you to.
- Some of the cards are imbalanced and being forced to play META sucks."
2675,"Unfortunately, and I have not played enough of this specific game to know (but have played many others), I guess this game was probably much better when you actually had to pay for it. The free-to-play brought players, it seems, and killed the game.

Felt like a pay-to-win, to be honest. And I have so far won all but one of my matches online. But the one match I lost, against someone of my same low tier, the player already had cards I could not possibly have unless I spent a ton of money on upgrading mine or on loot. 

So... sorry. Can't recommend. I'm tired of this being the new ""normal"" for free-to-play games, especially those that originally launched as paid products.

That being said, if you're looking for something hectic and colorful, with the art style (and lack of style) of a game like Paladins, this is your horse. Me, personally, I think I'll take the another wagon."
2676,"Lots of ease into learning the game. Balanced characters, awesome champions, and lot of rewards. Really quick games, but lots to them."
2677,"Great game, don't forget to subscribe for monthly rewards!!"

2684,"Just recently Started playing game. I'm enjoying it so far. May purchase the battle pass, but havent decided yet. Matches are quick and dont take long, which i love. Makes it so i can log in, play some games, and log out."

LOVE IT!!"
2687,Good game. Easy to learn fun to play.
2688,"realy good

2689,You know I really didnt come to this with incredibly high expectations but honestly found a pleasant little game I like to do when I hit that perfect point of bored. Really great detailed units that are fun and skillfull to use the only complaint I can really provide is that you will run into people that have spent hundreds of dollars to basically have every legendary card and While that doesn't guarantee a win it does however put you at a disadvantage.
2690,funny
2691,"Fast deck builder pvp, good for quick lolz"
2692,Enjoying the game so far. Really fun with friends. Will update later.
2693,"I had the game first on discord and had additional cards that didn't transfer over to the steam edition when they discontinued the discord version. The current issue with the game is once you hit Gold you start mainly running into people that have most the legendary cards in the game. The legendary cards usually have something OP about them. The legendary cards tend to either be cheaper, op ability or both. Once you hit the gold rank expect to spend money if you want to be competitive at all. This is a shame because a few seasons ago I was Master rank which is decent but not crazy. That isn't possible now, which is a shame since I liked to come back to this game from time to time."
2694,Cool game for thous who want fun without spending nervs xD
2695,Fun game

2697,"Simple gameplay, plenty of freebies at the start to get you going!"
2698,not my kind of game but it might be 4 u. do with that what u will.
2699,"Just when you think you have gotten the hang of the game they change everything and you can't win to save your life. Terrible. 46 hrs I wasted thinking I was learning only to find I was being played. Yeah, people may say, Get Gud...but no. Changing the core is a nightmare for me and I don't have the time to read guides online. Maybe it is my error...who knows."

9/10"
2703,most of reviews have 0.1-5 hours played.. Game is pay to win garbage
2704,Clash Royale + Hearthstone. Fun game on the side to play every now and then. I havent gotten into the meta decks yet but I strongly suspect it to be frustrating (having to play meta to be competitive). But that is just how it is with these deckbuilder games.
2705,Trash
2706,this game is really fun its like one of those Mobile game like clash royal and ecx but better
2707,@Leanne_Jade pls play with me you're such a cool gamer
2708,This is the easiest game I have ever played. I climbed from Wood 5 to Silver 5 with my friend in 2 hours. We won 30 matches and only lost about 3. We have the most broken champ comp and deck comp in the whole game. Tomorrow we will climb to challenger. ez clap
2709,ye its fun
2710,"Gud game, very nice community"
2711,Great game. I played Clash Royale for years. This is better
2712,i love it :D
2713,"It's like other deckbuilding games, build a deck, try, fail, maybe try to get new cards, rebuild, loop. The difference is the excitement of tactics, of the real-time tower defense. If you want some short-term fresh experience, it's definitely fun."

2717,"[strike]I've really only just started, but it's simple enough and games don't seem to drag on for too long.

This might just be the honeymoon stage though.[/strike]

Definitely the honeymoon stage.

It's a grinding slog and later games can drag on for several minutes, which might not seem like much compared to other games, but it feels much longer when you're playing.

Plus it gets frustrating at times, enough so that the entertainment you get from playing isn't worth the annoyances."
2718,"Minion Masters is actually an extremely fleshed-out game that takes mechanics from others and mixes them into a beautifully crafted ""Master"" piece. This is one of the most underrated games I've ever seen and it sickens me to find out so few people playing and watching it on Twitch. I've dunked 270+ hours into this and it's still fun/challenging. Sort of like how Hearthstone is with the monthly resets and filling out your collection.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this game! On sale, it was less than a dollar. I don't even think I waited a week to bump myself up to premium. **Buy it!** Get past the bots(they must go until at least Gold) and really enjoy what the developers have going on. They do update the game regularly as it is still in Early Access, but the devs are doing good! A recent change to a card that was somewhat broken made it extremely reasonable! Now you don't see that thing in literally every deck. It's a competitive market, premium-feeling game for almost nothing. It's not even that unrealistic to get the highest rank but know you're going to battle the same 10 people right now...Sometimes like 5 in a row!! That might be a selling point to some but I wasn't a fan. There are a few avatars that still haunt my dreams."
2719,"Hopefully it's worth the whole no dollars i spent on it.
"
2720,A mobile game for your computer.
2721,Fun to play every now and then
2722,"Would not recommend this game they are trying to get you to pay money and every turn, major turn off"
2723,"Fun game. Like Clash Royale, but better. In my opinion."
2724,"Similar to Clash Royal on the phone. Get some cards, make a deck, send them at opponent. Graphics are cool. Really fun so far."
2725,"very fun, doesnt feel overly grindy. made it to plat using mostly commons and rares. lots of strategy lots of viability. and free.
"
2726,Fun game to play with friends. Easy interface
2727,hey games good like hearthstone but tower defense
2728,"Fun strategy game that is not p2w.  Everyone starts off on a level playing field and so its just a matter of collecting the cards.  Build your deck and manage your mana in 1v1 or 2v2 game modes. The closest comparison is clash royale but its infinitely better due to added master feature and not having to pay to get ahead.  I reached grandmaster rank in about 4 months having only purchased the master dlc.  
   The things i would like to see changed is end of season rewards.  You really dont get anything for reaching the upper tiers which takes away the incentive for players to grind.  You'll see long time players that have been grand-master down in bronze just because there is no reason to grind.  The other big thing is how far back you get reset at the end of each season.  I went from g-master all the way down to plat for season reset.  This is far too extreme and once again takes away incentive for players to push to the top.  
   Overall great game, doesnt require a good cpu to play, the community is small but chill and betadwarf  keeps up with card balance."

2730,"As someone who doesn't despise card games but finds them uh... Not particularly engaging, this game does the thing the little me back in my childhood, who would stare at my Yugi-oh cards as I watched the anime on TV, wanted the most: 
Can't my cards just do cool stuff like that?!

Finally a card game that isn't just real life cards put on the screen! They move! They do things! They are cool! With a strategy game twist the game actually has interesting depth and doesn't feel like a slog! Most matches end in around 2 minutes! Even if you lose you don't feel like you wasted your lifetime! Matchmaking is incredibly fast! Voice acting is hilarious! And everyone has better decks than you, get ready to lose a lot!"
2731,I keep coming back
2732,Pretty fun! A PC version better and more balanced than Clash Royale.
2733,great game fun
2734,"It is with a heavy heart after 351 hours that I bid farewell to Minion Masters. 

I started playing May 5th 2017, back when the game was in Early Access, and wasn't free to play yet. Back then, there weren't hardly any expansions, no adventures, and far less overall content in general. BetaDwarf had a wonderful concept in mind; an arena-based deck builder card game. Minions were summoned from their respective Master towers, and marched towards the middle of the arena to kill each other off in droves. Back then, there was no 2v2 mode; just good old dueling at its finest. You complete quests to earn both freemium (Shards) and premium (Rubies) currency; Shards allow you to craft cards and earn Masters, and Rubies are used purely for cosmetics (Master skins and arenas). It didn't take much to earn enough shards to craft the majority of the cards in the game, and by the time I'd bought all the Masters, they came out with an upgrade pack that gave you access to all Masters and refunded you the shards you invested in buying them for $20. Along with that, they were giving out free expansion content way more than most developers usually do.

So why do I leave a negative review for the game? Minion Masters has gone through A LOT of changes since 2017, both good and bad, but the bad became so unbearable that both me and my friends grew tired with logging in for daily rewards even, more so unmotivated to play the game at all. 

1. Like most games these days, Minion Masters joined the trend of adding a Battle Pass to the game to give players incentive for continuous play; was really nice they included a freemium version for those that didn't want to shell out $10 for the premium version. For me, what made the battle pass a bummer was that when you reached max rank in it, the later rewards were so stale in comparison to the previous 100 tiers: A couple tokens and a few pieces of gold thrown at you didn't feel very rewarding, especially when they did away with the tokens entirely and made it gold only. The final straw was when they started putting new cards exclusively in the premium pass, locking players out with a paywall until the the expansion became older to let players craft the cards.

2. With new expansions came new masters; one in particular was Morellia, which brought about a lot of undead cards, including a colossal dragon that slowly charged the battlefield and ignited enemies in a wave of fire. Here's the problem, ever since the dragons introduction, players in the community that didn't feel the urge to adapt relentlessly complained that the dragon was overpowered. I personally found it to be a challenge, and with a friends help, we made a list of cards that easily countered the dragon, negating it entirely; even went as far as posting it repeatedly on the forums to spread the word (other players even quoted us on it), but to no avail: The community screamed for nerfs, and BetaDwarf happily obliged until the dragon had her health chunked, reduced to 1 per team, etc until it became a shell of its former self. Nerfing new cards to the ground just because the community refuses to adapt to meta changes kills the game entirely for everyone.

3. The final nail in the coffin after almost 4 years of enjoyment was BetaDwarf themselves making the biggest slap to the community they could deliver: the demanding of more money. Here's my issue with this: Yes, Minion Masters is a free to play game, and they no longer make money off purchases of the game itself, so their only revenue is through the Ruby currency and cosmetics. However, the game itself has sold really well since I started, and I find it hard to believe their need for as much money as they claim to be entirely accurate (Unless their budgeting skills need some work). Their solution to this problem was to all but entirely remove the ability to earn the premium Ruby currency; this is unacceptable for a free to play title because you have to entice your players to keep playing your game (Especially if some of us paid money for the game upfront, and were conveniently forgotten about). To bring about a point my friend made, you can't force players to buy the premium currency only without handing out a little bit for free every now and then. Gold isn't good enough, you HAVE to entice players to keep playing, otherwise they'll be like me and drift off to brighter horizons. Being stingy will make you money in the short run, but in the long run your reputation will suffer because your consumers are your customers, your players, and the reason you make money to begin with.

Until BetaDwarf resolves these issues, I will not be returning to Minion Masters anytime soon, and will leave the game uninstalled, warding off anyone interested in the game in the meantime. They won't listen to veteran players (or common sense in general), so they don't need a player base. If you want out of the grave, put down the shovel."

2736,"a good game but, please release more outlander units"
2737,yea
2738,Great Fun and Quick Games!
2739,this game tight
2740,yo this games tight
2741,"I watched this game on YouTube at the Channel ""[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcRol69lrujzDeuq0fJ7IuQ][b]The Jury Gaming[/b][/url]"" he plays it like a pro it looked like fun. so here i am trying it myself also. be sure to check his YT channel also. i leaving the YouTube Live stream video here https://youtu.be/TrcE-afnWeU?t=30552"
2742,this game is cool i like it
2743,good fun with a friend
2744,"Was so fun at first but came to see that the game is completly unbalanced. There is a card which makes a little area where your minions are immune to all damage. That's right, ALL DAMAGE. Do you see the problem with this? You can put something like a Rammer which will go straight for the enemy player and then just make him immune and win the game. Your opponent can't do anything and you just win. Dumb, unfun and unfair."
2745,a bunch of people with random numbers and letters for names. Fought a dude today his name was a fucking website. something something.com what the actual fuck
2746,"A refreshing take on the Clash Royal style game, pleasantly avoiding the issue of pay to in features. While buying shards will facilitate getting more cards to use, it's not a sure to win way and you can acquire cards easily enough by just playing.
-Game play is based of knowing how to counter cards with your own and deck building, not specific cards strength
-Constant updates with new content
-Battle pass is easy to save up for by just playing, even if you can't afford it, you'll receive good rewards regardless and there are no skins that can't be acquired later.
Overall, I have 500+ hours in this game and strongly suggest it for the people who want the perfect game to play when nothing else is doing it for you. Got bored? Play a few matches of this and get back to whatever you were doing. Then again it is also a good grind if you want the higher ranks. Strongly recommend."
2747,:D :D :D It's fun :D
2748,"reheat the oven to 425°F and line two baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the potatoes. Place on the baking sheet, rub with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with sea salt all over. Bake 45 to 60 minutes, or until the potato is fork-tender and the skin is crisp."
2749,"A good game with easy controls. While the fact that every minion has 5 stats (hp, atk, atk speed, range, movement), let alone abilities, provides strategic interactions, it also makes difficulty to figure out what is more efficient combination. 
By the way, how can i see the stats of my opponent's minion?"
2750,!!!!!
2751,Trash balancing
2752,"Amazing game! I played it on xbox one and then upgraded to a nice PC.
At first i thought I wouldn't be able to start over and unlock all the characters/masters again.
But it's been a blast, I enjoy the pace of the game and the mystery behind every chest.
I even got a friend (Sullydocks) into it but didn't know you could get some sort of reward for referring players, so I hope this helps people.
Am yet to find thinks I dislike about this game
















"
2753,"nice battles, somewhat luck, quiet some skill."
2754,Fun to play!!!!
2755,"It's one of those 1v1 or 2v2 clash games like you find on your phone, except everyone plays on even footing.  Your cards are the same cards as everyone else's, so you aren't going to get your butt handed to you by someone who's ""Pay to Win"" or because you're just too smart that you get matched with overpowered players.  Kind of awesome actually... except for the fact that the game has seen an influx of people using an infinite mana hack.  There isn't even an option to report an enemy when they do this."
2756,"This game is rubbish, you will get ban without any sense, i will ask my friend to leave the game as well, waste my time only, uninstall and play other game."
2757,it's a chill game you can play with friends while drinking coffee or chatting
2758,Best game in this genre | Physics to its finest | Quick matches | Cards easy to obtain
2759,game gets stale after a few days....
2760,"Reminds me of Magic card game, but more fun"
2761,GAME IS SWEET
2762,Its simply an amazingly addictive game! Imagine hearthstone but with less RNG combined with tower defence. and that's just scratching the surface! you have things like unlocking multiples of the same cards helps you grind etc. If you like TCGs you will love this game
2763,"Amazing game, great FTUE and very easy to understand. If you love tower defense that mixes TCGs then this game brings it to the next level"
2764,Playing it for months and totally fun !!!

2777,"This game is stupid addicting. I started playing on Beta on Discord and then got butthurt when they took it off of Discord and stopped playing. Well, it was just a matter of time before I'd want to start playing again, so here I am. I hate most lane games but this game is kind of like crack...don't try it unless you want to keep doing it."
2778,clash royal but better
2779,"In two and a half years of playing this game i can tell you its trash.. Balance is same as player base , they dont exist. Skill cap is = as silver in LOL with all toxicity of it. Game is full of bugs , every 10 matches expect to crush. After few more months all i can see its even worse. Devs could not balance sea salt even if they try to.. Now days we measure game by B.P.C. index ""bugs pre card"" witch is around 10 in a good exp. Mobile beta is kekw , even if you manage to log in expect to lag/freez/crush , and it will consume your battery like fat kid ice cream on a summer day...

They cancel mobile , add elo match making , que times are crazy long.. game is dead , dont waste your time with it."
2780,good game allu neeed to know
2781,"This game is similar to Clash Royale on mobile phones with their own unique characters.
There are characters that can benefit from being played or decked with certain other characters.
You can choose the 'King', each has different skills.

You will get new DLCs at 100% discount (you still need to 'buy' it, or you'll miss it. So keep looking for the game's news update from time to time).

I wish this is on Linux."
2782,Great game to play with a buddy bit of a pay wall unless your willing to grid but totally worth the time if you like RTS arean battle games Puts Clash Royal to shame.
2783,"it is a great game but I wish that they could tweak a few things
I would like if they made it so you played against players who were at your skill level
I would also like if they could make more maps
nevertheless this is a fantastic game and if you like defence games, you should check it out
plus, it's free so you're not losing anything if you don't like it"
2784,I lika da way the minions run across the grasses. Itz nize!
2785,Great game especially with your BFF! :)
2786,killll
2787,"This game is HORRIFICALLY pay to win.

If you're into those sort of games and happy throwing $20 into the game every month to stay relevant in the meta, then go nuts.
However, if you don't want to pay every month to have any chance on competing, then feel free to jump in and play this game for two days.  But after all the initial progression wheres off after the first 6 hours of gameplay, the lustre drops off reeeeeaaaaaaalllllllll quick."
2788,"Eyyy, its pretty good for a free game.... Really recommend!"
2789,i LOVE the play stile one bad thing is newbes can buy op masters other then that its a good game good game
2790,"The monetization of this game is not great, but it's still fun enough, if you plan your strategy well."
2791,u can do lots of fun things like piece control and sniper chisel or cleaver batty. 10/10 great game!
2792,its good and so fun and its free!
2793,I'm being forced to play this game help
2794,Addictive
2795,certain masters are unbalanced
2796,"I don't usually leave reviews but I felt this one was necessary now.
I have over 2400 hours in this game and I think the game itself can be very fun at times but there is one huge problem...

The in-game chat has a ton of extremely racist people in it who somewhat regularly spam a lot of inappropriate content and there are almost never any moderators to put them into place. Furthermore, when people like me attempt to argue with them or report them, a moderator just happens to pop up out of nowhere and... ban the people arguing against racism. I even got banned from their discord for.... literally just reporting that a moderator was needed in their game chat due to racism.

The developers obviously don't care at all about their players (and apparently approve of racism!) and this was made much clearer by their aggressive moves towards trying to push microtransactions by removing most sources of free ""rubies"" (the in-game P2W currency) as well as most of the other sources of free cards (like monthly codes, Amazon Prime codes, etc). 
This if furthered worsened by the fact that every move and change they make since the very beginning is usually against the grain of the fanbase's desires. And they clearly never play-test any of it. Only occasionally will they decide to allow a few of the changes the community wants to happen, and these are almost always just ploys in order to get players back into the game so they can go back to doing what they always do.

Long story short, the devs are super racist assholes. Don't bother with this game. And ESPECIALLY don't bother paying for anything. Even if you did you'll just get stomped by players who have been playing since the beta and already have all the cards."
2797,"Been playing since it came out, great game to play casual or competitive"
2798,this game is the deffinition of pay to win.
2799,"Very fun game. If you looking for a quick and relaxing time-killer just play this game. A match regularly go from 2' to 5', with occasionally longer (or faster) defend on your or your opponent's luck and skill.

It can be fvcking annoying sometime with all the random god-like cards your opponent have but overall this game is pretty fair imo cause you can grind for the card.

A lot more fun with a friend. 2v2 mode while testing different strategy and yelling at your buddy for missing a spell etc is the jam!"
2800,Fun! Deeper version clash royal without the insane grinding
2801,Fun 100%
2802,"Recent patch changes have absolutely destroyed whatever fun there was in this game. Mass nerfs as far as the eye can see with virtually nothing being buffed in exchange, so the end result is most of the stuff that felt good now feels bad, and the stuff that already felt bad still feels bad but slightly less so. On top of that the recent, totally needless, increase in the pace of play has left most games ending in nothing but a card spam festival that comes down to draw order luck.

It's absolutely awful stuff right now, I have no idea what on earth they are thinking. Saddens me to have to change my long time positive review to a negative but this game has thrown itself into the abyss."
2803,very fun and chill game
2804,omkey
2805,"This game is mainly pvp. Although there is some pve stuff, it doesn't reward you for playing it again. I really like this duo aspect of this game. It opens up quite a few strategy if you premade. As for solo, it is alright, but I prefer duo mode.

The problem I have with this game is that, it doesn't feel very rewarding when you win or get something. Winning I get like no gold at all and points towards the season pass and/or guild. The rewards from the pass isn't even that great in my opinion. When I open a power token, it like oh wow I got a copy of a common card again! It just feels like I'm playing the game and getting nothing in return."
2806,Must try
2807,pretty fun and basically free to play
2808,Nice
2809,love it
2810,
2811,"I really enjoy playing this game even after 500 hours. The graphics are nice, it feels awesome when I win and equally horrible when I lose a match. I purchased the premium upgrade to support you guys! 

"
2812,Fun and laid back easy to play and fun with a friend
2813,nice game
2814,"Great Game, I've been playing for a couple of years since it got released on discord. Would recommend 110% trust me"
2815,"I think I've always liked these types of games way more than I ever knew.  Easy to pick up game play, the main menu seems a bit crazy but just find the deck and battle buttons and you're good to go.. I'm not far enough to see what good PVP players are like yet the firs couple ranks have had few challenges yet."
2816,Very nice
2817,Simple yet strategic fun
2818,very fun and epic game superbly recommend it
2819,Amazing. Love it. Simple yet complex. Free and with various rotations on guild cards and master i never felt at a disadvantage to people who want to pay 2 play. Quick rounds as well to fit in round a busy life.
2820,"good game very good i love this game please play 

I am legally obliged to tell you that while i am not being paid for this review, my brother treated to cut off my life support if i didn't upload this"

2823,AWESOME!
2824,Simple and Fun!
2825,NEED XBOX AND PC CROSSPLAY LIKE YOU CAN INVITE THEM TO YOUR GUILD OR GAME TYPE CROSSPLAY NOW. THANKS!!!!
2826,"This game is fun and I enjoy playing it.  It is simple to learn and play but not easy.  I appreciate that that the mechanics semi-force players to try different cards/decks/combo and that there is no such thing as a ""killer deck.""  This game can be played hard core and from my casual gamer standpoint, I believe that the best players truly float to the top in this game.  I also know that a casual gamer like me can have a great time without spending money, grinding, or min-maxing. 

If this looks like something you typically like, chances are you are right.

Con: community is kinda blech."
2827,"The last patch, Jan 28, 2021, made this a Pay To Win game.  I've played this game for a long time and have a lot of fun but the developers have even said it was ""to free"" so they started to cut the bonuses for new cards.  New players will be severely limited on getting cards unless you pay to get the monthly passes or just buying cards.  I won't be playing much longer....sad that they went for the money over a competitive game."
2828,good game to play
2829,"rigged matchmaking
rigged rng
constant popups to spend more money on the game
china bots china bots china bots
bring any of this up on the discord and you will be banned"
2830,Love the team battle aspect. Brings another element to the game. Pretty fun FTP game.
2831,Fun little game :)
2832,"I love this game, so much, its a good pass time and just outright really fun."
2833,is the goods
2834,So far so good. Pretty much as advertised. Fun little time-passer.
2835,Love this game! Has a real Clash Royale feel but the unique masters make it much more entertaining
2836,Batter dhan clash royale
2837,"This game is dank as fuck, fun to play with the kid.  Fun to play solo. Just fun to play in general!"
2838,"wow such nice. like my fav mobile game clash royale but more betterer
"
2839,"I usually don't write reviews but I thought I'd make an effort for this game considering how many hours I've spent playing this game. I don't think there's much point in going into mega detail about it as most people don't bother reading so I thought I'd bullet-point pros and cons. Hopefully, by the time you've read them all you should conclude that this ultimately is a really great game that is sadly overlooked.

Pros:
+ The developers are super generous. I've never spent any money on this game, which honestly I feel quite guilty about so at some point I will probably end up buying something just to support the devs a little bit.
+ Quite a lot of cards to collect
+ The gameplay is like Othello, easy to learn but hard to master
+ There's a team modes, which allows you to play with your friends, which puts it above other card games
+ It's not a huge size so you can easily install to see if you like the game

Cons
- Small dev team means that the updates are usually quite small, especially since the dev team is also working on their next game
- I'm not a huge fan of the art-style, if I'm honest. It's okay but a little bit uninspired.

Well, that's everything that comes to mind. Thanks for reading my review. Hopefully it helps in making up your mind about whether or not it's worth an install."
2840,Game fun
2841,"The pace is satisfactory, the graphics are enjoyable as are the various cards available for use in duels. For the genre this game is easily one of the more enjoyable."
2842,This game is fast paced and eazy to pick up loving the cards

2847,Game is fun. Seen it grow from the beginning and it really has some fun and cool things! For sure check it out.
2848,Game is enjoyable and fun to play!
2849,An excellent game where your teammates are either afk or shit. Great fun with a premade or solo though.
2850,its cool
2851,Fantastic game! Easy to get into and it looks like it's got plenty of depth for tactics. Nice hybrid implementation. Great work guys!
2852,"I wouldn't buy anything, but this is a fun free game. Lots of stuff going on, varied strategy. 
"
2853,"hella fucking simple to lerarn and Forever to MASTER! my type of rts card game!
"
2854,fun game tho
2855,Insane we just wreck ppl amazing
2856,"NOT RECOMENDING.
It all came down to TAKING money from players.
I am very disappointed ...."
2857,The Meta is is just bad and the other game modes are lackluster to say the least. do not waste your time on this game.
2858,Fck this game. It's way too addicting. Can't... stop... playing...
2859,Awesome game. Not pay to win and gives you rubies and shards at a steady pace. I am also totally in love with the announcers voice! Makes the game feel alive.
2860,"Cool real-time deck building game. Rather than being turn-based, its got a dota-style map with a north and south bridge, using mana that charges over time to play your cards with. Fast matchmaking & load speeds, little to no lag, challenges for rewards. Not-so-micro transactions are present. All in all, seems like a good game so far!"
2861,"as u can see i am a consistent player of this game for ever i guess
its also one of the few games i am writing a report on and will not reccomend the game
i have almost 700 hours in the game and i promise u , u ll have some good laughs in it
u dont need to ever put any money on game even though from the latest patches they made , its getting more and more difficult not to
still this is not my issue
as many before me said this game is cancer and i was supresing the negative feelings more than i should
the dev team cares to make money on a free to play game but dont do anything about the 1000s of requests to clear up the field
bots are unbanned no matter how many reports u do
u curse and call names on all the gods u may believe in and still nothing changes
besides bots there are lots of trollers who dont get banned either
i understand the population of the game dropped significantly but its exactly for these issues
when u make your first priority to make some cash, and not clean up the game the community leaves
and i type that after 700 hours of gameplay
if u dont want to get stuck in matches with bots, trolls that are doing so unpunished cause none of the developers care then go on just be warned
the biggest joke is after each match they give u an option to report your team mate for griefing AHAHAHHAHAHHA
griefing for them is leaving the match that game itself makes many people disconect during matches cause of what ever reason
for better or for worse i am unistaling this cancer 
enjoy your game of bots , troll s and unpunished behaviours

p.s, i did have some good times and moments in the game with friends but omg from 700 hours almost 400 are cursing and playing with bots and trolls
plz make yourself a favor and play some other cancer like riots lol or dota 2  or something like it , at least there the bots and trolls are punished somewhat"
2862,"maybee adding a few differnet maps to hange things up, but for a free game  itws been fun
"
2863,HI
2864,"Good,Good. maybe pay to win as one might consider."
2865,so fun to play!!
2866,"If you like Clash Royale, you will like this game. It's slightly more mature and is horizontal rather than vertical. The only thing I don't like is the announcer who sounds like an overzealous gameshow host."
2867,Like Clash Royale just without pay2win. BRUTISH BETRAYER RULEZ
2868,so good
2869,This game was introduced to me by HouseVachula. This game fuses the gameplay of a MOBA with a card game. It is so much fun! Highly recommend if you enjoy card games and MOBAs!
2870,"Reached grand master a few times, hanged quite a few streamers in my time and played quite a lot. Endgame is absolute cancer due to balance reasons. Can only suggest this game if you are drunk and want to get angry."
2871,It's fooken cancer mate. The puffy clouds and monkey business will rape your soul like you've never felt possible before. If you're in to that then get the game now!
2872,Fun and chill game
2873,Awesome game! :)
2874,"awesome game, a lot of fun!"
2875," Super fun great time killer

Really having a lot of fun with this game so far, I definitely recommend it."
2880,Fun and challenging for a newbie!
2881,fun game
2882,Easy to pick up with a great set of tutorials that gets you playing quickly. You can tell there is a lot to it but it does not seem overwhelming.
2883,"really fun, great graphics, well made, great strategy. really dig the ranking system and the option to play with friends is the cherry on the cake
"
2884,"fun game, addictive
"
2885,its fun.
2886,Not a bad game. The strategy boils down to quick thinking and baiting your opponent. Its a pretty straight-forward game. I recommend it
2887,is pretty fun to play. reminds me of an rts take on hearthstone but with probably less strategy. can be taken seriously or just play duels/2v2 against friends and mess around
2888,i like game it fun to play and i like the dragon :D
2889,Mingen Master
2890,"Great game over all. The one huge issue with the game is the favor 1 master over any other. The Archer. At LV 1 he has full map range. With out that BS the game would be a enjoyable.

Updated Review:

I have been working around The Archer, he can be countered by a tank (high health) minion. The new updates have been keeping the cards reasonably balanced. The newest Master has been a lot of joy to play. I am looking forward to seeing who the next might be...

Updated Review 2:

The game has gone down hill. The updates are making the cards unbalanced to the point of a uninstall. The graphic issues have NEVER been fixed. Dead minions will ragdoll/strech the model. Masters now have true damage so it makes shield useless to them. I was looking forward to the new remaster. Now I'm looking forward to the game creators to fix the game they had before starting on a new one."
2891,great game !!
2892,"pretty fun, I've made a lot of steam friends in this game. 

most the players are kind of really bad strategists so I tend to hit silver and gold tier within a few days."
2893,"I love this game, but once you rank to plat, it turns into nothing but pay to wins, which the game embraces and allows them to be as OP as possible."
2894,Very fun
2895,"This game makes you really feel like you're a master. I was hooked two seconds in when I knew I could just never lose in this game. I was a previous owner from discord store, and me and my associate never lost. We are able to produce the same result even when the game had transferred itself to a steam environment. If you read my name that should say it all, if you see my name in your game you might as well surrender. Fucking fantastic game, literally a master piece."
2896,"Good quick fun.  Easy to play, harder to master.  Balance is still an issue imho but they do try to balance.  Perhaps becoming a bit too ptw as the game has evolved but still good fun."
2897,"it has good stragety
"
2898,is nice game and isnt afraid of anything
2899,fast paced and easy to pick up
2900,.
2901,pretty sick game so far
2902,Worked fine at first but crashes every single time a i try to play it anymore
2903,"Really fun, with a lot of depth (way better than Clash Royale). The FTP experience is quite good (though I did buy the $5 starter pack as well). 

Adventure mode is also quite fun and challenging!"
2904,Not a bad game tbh
2905,it's a good game amusing simple but fun too.
2906,"I enjoy playing this game, because I have more or less played games that are exactly like this"
2907,"Great game, small decks but big combos, fast matches. Can't go wrong here."
2908,٩(˘◡˘)۶
2909,"Very well done Castle Fight game. Many game modes from team battles to solo Adventures.
Purchases are only for cosmetics or stuff you can later unlock for free. And they finally added an Open all chests button!"
2910,its a nice game but I still new so ima go keep playing funny ragdolls to
2911,"My first RTS game and so far I'm hooked man. It was very simple for me to get into it. Thanks to a friend who recommended it to me. He goes by the name HipsterHeadcrab. Wish me luck as I will be battling him soon and he is a tough fella, I tell you that much."
2912,when your too high to play a real game but still want coop
2913,Not a mobile game highly recommend.
2914,Nice game
2915,unskippable tutorial
2916,Once you get the hang of it and get a good deck your praty much good and it's fun so overall i'd recommend it [sorry for bad spelling ;-; ]
2917,"Cute game, tbh"
2918,Faz tempo que nao encontro um joguinho bom assim.
2919,IT'S FUN!  PLAY IT NOW!
2920,"Games fun, detailed review to come."
2921,Games sick
2922,Its  fun little game
2923,This game is fun. It has heaps of updates and you can play to whatever suits you. It's great that you can change your master and pick your deck to what you like. I enjoy playing this daily to complete the challenges and testing out new decks to see how they go.
2924,"For me personally, 2v2 is the true attraction of this title. 1v1 is a bit too 'serious competitive', but if you have a friend who can enjoy how we lose or die in the match together, this title will be a much more fun party game.

The game itself is a bit difficult. There are many many things we should memory if we want to win. Like, the status of each units like Attack, Life, Range, Speed. And how each spells works, how much the damage of spells are. Or which units are lethal, how to prepare effective countermeasures for each units, especially legendaries. And each master's strength and weak points. And how to make synergy between several cards in our deck. Also how to take control of 2 bridges to grow the master faster in each match. Many many things to memory.
So, this game requires many skills and knowledge, if we want to be strong. Even how many 'expensive' cards we contain in our deck, but it doesn't mean we always can win. Even legendaries have each weak points. If we don't have enough player skills, those expensive cards will only waste your mana and we lose the tempo advantage. And many effective countermeasures are in the pretty common rarity card pool. So I think I can say this game has great game balance.

If you want to make your deck to the 'tournament level', I personally recommend you to buy some DLCs to obtain some specific legendaries or masters. It will provide some choices to build some specific strategy decks. Also, there are many chances to get the paid DLCs free. So I suggest you check the store page when the big expansions get released.

Each match is pretty short. In the case of the 'aggro' type deck, we might deal the decisive blow in 1.5 or 2 min in the shortest, and end the match. Even in the longest case, the match will end in 8-9 mins. So it won't consume much time... as long as we won't continue many many matches.
Well, but this game is enough addictive so... beware XD"
2925,"Looking at the game time, we can see that the game viscosity is very high, the official maintenance game is constantly updated, and the configuration is not high, and the free good game is required!"
2926,i like game

2933,the amount of trolls and bots make this unplayable for 2v2!
2934,i'm a donkey but even i will not play such sh*t for nerds

2954,"Annoyingly addictive, just like clash royale :("
2955,Awesome game!
2956,:]
2957,"Pay To Win and increased rate of AI players

to be honest, it was pretty good game to play untill the devs decided that it should be impossible to get somethings without paying money, before you could play long and long times and provide fun and player to their game but.. they seem to decided it is better to throw playerbase away and just fill the gap with silly AI and overpowered ""well paid"" players"
2958,Nice
2959,About 2 hours into the game it is really fun!
2960,"Minion Masters


🎮 Gameplay

Der Deckbau

Bei Minion Masters handelt es sich in erster Linie um ein Kartenspiel. Einer der elementarsten Aspekte ist somit natürlich der Deckbau. Dieser läuft aber schon grundsätzlich anders ab, als man es sonst gewohnt ist. Das Deck darf nämlich nur aus 10 Karten bestehen. Zudem hat man 2 Joker Karten, welche genutzt werden wenn man eine Karte doppelt oder sogar 3 mal in das Deck packt. Bei der Fülle aus mehr als 150 Karten (Stand Oktober 2019) gar nicht so einfach.

Insbesondere da noch der namensgebende Minion Master hinzu kommt. Diesen muss man aus 11 verschiedenen Meistern auswählen und jeder bringt seine eigenen Fähigkeiten und teilweise sogar Karten mit.

Karten erhält man teilweise als Belohnung, man kann sie sich für Geld im Shop kaufen, man bekommt neue im Machtturm bei einer Art Roulette oder man stellt sie sich selber her.

Der Kampf

Die Kämpfe laufen immer nach dem selben Schema ab. Links und Rechts der Arena befinden sich die Türme der beiden Meister mit je 3000 Leben. Sinkt dieses auf 0 hat man verloren. In der Mitte der Arena trennt ein Fluss die beiden Seiten welcher nur von fliegenden Einheiten überwunden werden kann. Alle anderen Diener müssen eine der beiden Brücken nutzen, welche die Seiten verbinden.

Um die Diener auf das Spielfeld zu rufen nutzt man die 10 Karten seines Decks. Es gibt fliegende und Bodeneinheiten sowie Fernkämpfer und Nahkämpfer. Zudem steht auf jeder Karte wie viele Diener sie beschwört und welche Werte diese haben, also Leben, Angriff und Geschwindigkeit sowie weitere Fähigkeiten. Neben den Dienern, welche sich nach der Beschwörung auf der eigenen Seite in Bewegung Richtung gegnerischer Meister begeben, gibt es noch Gebäude, welche ebenfalls auf der eigenen Seite beschworen werden und dort dann natürlich stehen bleiben. Zudem gibt es noch Zauber, welche in der gesammten Arena genutzt werden können.

Auch wenn es recht simpel klingt, so ist das Spiel doch sehr komplex und wenn man gewinnen will muss man seine Karten gut aufeinander abstimmen und auch Wissen, wann man welche Karte am besten ausspielt.

Um Karten überhaupt spielen zu können benötigt man Mana, welches sich mit der Zeit generiert. 10 ist das Maximum, danach wird erst neues generiert wenn man einen Teil ausgegeben hat. Begonnen wird mit 4 Mana.

Worauf man auch noch achten sollte, ist die Erfahrung. Diese sammelt sich für alle Meister mit der Zeit an. Kontrolliert man aber auch noch die Brücken (Kontrolle erlangt man, indem eigene Einheiten sie überqueren) gibt es Extraerfahrung. Mit dieser werden über die Zeit weitere Fähigkeiten freigeschaltet, welche den Spielverlauf teils stark beeinflussen.

Spielmodi und Belohnungen

Neben den einfachen 1 vs 1 Kämpfen kann man auch im 2 vs 2 antreten. Entweder mit zufälligem Partner oder mit einem Freund den man zuvor eingeladen hat.

Dann gibt es noch die Expedition, welche einem für jeden Kampf mehrere Bedingungen stellt, die Chaoskämpfe mit ganz eigenen Spielmechaniken und die Gildenkämpfe welche „Bonuskarten“ vorrübergehend gewähren.

Zudem gibt es noch den Draft. Bei diesem stellt man aus Karten, die einem zufällig vorgeschalgen werden ein Deck zusammen und darf dann damit sein Können unter Beweis stelllen.

Neben den Bereits erwähnten Belohnungen in Form von Karten gibt es auch noch Gold, Scherben, Rubine, Erfahrung und Kampfpass-Punkte. Mit den einzelnen Währungen kann man sich dann neue Meister freikaufen, Skins erwerben, neue Karten kaufen oder herstellen und vieles mehr.

Da es recht oft und eigentlich für alles ein wenig Belohnung gibt kommt man auch gut vorran und es kommt eigentlich nie ein Pay to Win Gefühl auf, zumal man auch mit den Anfangskarten schon sehr weit kommen kann, wenn man aufmerksam spielt und ein wenig strategisch vorgeht.

🎥 Grafik

Jeder Meister kommt mit mehreren Skins daher was nicht nur mehr Individualisierung ermöglicht sondern auch das Auge erfreut. Gleiches gilt für die Arena die ebenfalls mehrere Designs besitzt, welche verwendet werden können, sofern man diese gekauft oder freigespielt hat. Hinzu kommen die vielen Monster, Zauber und Gebäude die nicht nur ein eigenes Kartendesign sondern natürlich auch ein Erscheinungsbild im Kampf samt Animation haben. Da alles sehr stimmig zusammen passt ergibt sich ein sehr gutes Gesamtbild.

🎶 Sound

Der Ansager vor den Kämpfen und die Sprüche der Avatare machen Lust auf das „Gemetzel“. Die Geräusche welche die einzelnen Minions von sich geben wirken stimmig und auch auch alle anderen Soundeffekte sind passend gewählt. Dazu kommt eine Hintergrundmusik, welche die Kämpfe angenehm begleitet und auch nach mehreren dutzend Stunden nicht störend wird.

❤︎ Fazit

Ein Titel den sich Strategie und/oder Kartenspiel Fans nicht entgehen lassen sollten. BetaDwarf liefert hier ein verdammt gutes Free to Play Spiel ab bei welchem man definitiv nicht in die Tasche greifen muss. Mit ein wenig Übung und Beharrlichkeit kann man sich alles problemlos erspielen."
2961,"Hey there, and welcome! I will get right to it- I do give this game a thumbs up!

Recently the developer had hinted that they are shifting gears toward their new game in development, and given the active player base I can understand the sentiment, but at the same time I believe a mobile version of MINION MASTERS is in the works? Regardless, this is a sweet little casual game. If you expect it to be much more, though, or developed to the degree of similar games such as HEARTHSTONE, you will be upset. Check it out for free! I purchased the first two DLCs after enjoying the game for a while, but other than that I haven't personally felt the desire to engage in additional in-game purchases, and that may have been a large contributing part to the game's current state. 

This game is available on Steam for free, and was released in May of 2019. The user tags include: Free to Play, Strategy, Deckbuilding, RTS, PvP, and overall reviews are 91% (Very Positive) of 52,251 total reviews. At the time of my review I have 185 hours played. Thank you again for checking in! twitter.com/GRDN1014

2965,"fun to play, simple to understand and microtransaction are not that bad"
2966,"One of the most disgustingly unbalanced games out. It's not P2W, just woefully mismanaged. I play at the top 50 in both 1v1 and 2v2 and every deck is almost exactly the same, card for card. 

Firstly, the developers don't seem to use any sort of mathematical basis for coming up with card stats. They take a guess--frequently releasing new cards in either unusably bad or wildly overpowered states--and if they guessed wrong, you have to wait 30 days for the next set of balance changes for them to [i]maybe[/i] fix the problem. They typically get it wrong on the second attempt as well, often completely ignoring feedback from the PTR that would've addressed the problem.

What this means is that a year of playing this game is divided into 6-8 long stretches of seeing one extremely dominant deck being played with little ability to counter it because of just how crazy powerful it is. This also means that if you want to stay competitive, you have to run that same deck and just be better or luckier than your opponent.

This is exacerbated by the fact that BetaDwarf desperately wants to hold onto every player they can, so balance changes frequently disproportionately take into account whining from casual players who don't understand how to utilize or properly counter certain cards. BD's argument is that they want the game to be fun at all levels of play, but what they don't seem to grasp is that players can always improve at the game and understand how to play with these cards, but it's impossible for skilled players to go backwards. This leads to a situation where this game bleeds skilled players as they grow weary of long cycles of stale gameplay whereas casual players are happy to play against bots and barely know the difference.

On a combined note of bad balance and pleasing casual players, there is also a highly controversial system known as ""wildcarding"" in which you can include multiple copies of the same card in your deck. This leads to situations where you literally can't do anything against certain decks that churn out the same hard-to-counter unit over and over because you've used up all your answers to them. BD did a very misleading poll a while back where they asked whether people would prefer to remove the system, keep it, or keep it with changes. Many--including myself--voted to keep it with changes, thinking there would be some sort of followup or experimentation with a new system to spice up the game. Not the case. They simply moved wildcards to be exclusively usable in 2v2 which they counted as changing the system, and now insist that most people wanted to keep the system but refuse to re-poll.

In summary, unless the developers do something to reduce the length of time between feedback and implementation--or something to mitigate one card being dominant for weeks or months on end--this game is not worth investing time in because it has no future and less and less entertainment value the better you get at it."
2967,nah dont play avoid it might aswell dog dog dog water
2968,nice game
2969,"my friend told me to get this game and i did and its actually cool, its like clash royal 
"
2970,i like that it is easy and quick to pick up but yet its still a challenge as you progress through the arena levels i like that you can build a unique deck and there is many different cards and characters to play
2971,"Minion good
Losing bad
Unga Bunga"
2972,"It's a good game, no doubt about it. Easy to pick up and fun.
Fair warning it is pretty addictive when you start out and you will need to spend money to have any chance. There is no way around it, unless you are content to grind for hundreds of hours to get the cards you want/need to be competitive. It is almost structured like some gambling platforms, everything feeds back into spending money.
Once you have played enough games though it gets tiring and you will lose at least some of the initial interest that you have, for a number of reasons.

You will have to spend money to get the new cards and this gets annoying after a while, especially when new cards/ rewards are released.
While skill and deckcrafting are important you will run into decks where you almost auto lose, similar to a build order win in RTS games
It almost seems coin flippy as to your chances of winning at gm, you might run into a deck that simply wins over yours, you might get a poor run of the cards and get screwed over. e.g. Your opponent has been hiding Rammers/Brutish Betrayers and summons them on the opposite lane to your summons and you get bum rushed. 1 Mistake is often enough to lose you the game. It may seem a weak excuse for a loss but it is infuriating as the ladder is just one game, if you had a B03 you would not make the same mistake and the opp could not rely on this one trick pony.
The best decks are all low mana decks with maybe 1 massive minion which their late game strat is centred around. There is a lack of variation at the top and you will run into the same cards again and again forcing you to adjust your deck.

Good game, but you will lose interest. Treat it as a one-night stand that you never see again :D"
2973,My friend said that game is very good and he was right
2974,"I feel as if I should have been charged for this game - it's that good.
"
2975,Game is surprisingly very well balanced and I don't feel like its a pay to win game. I think this is a proper balance of fun and new content
2976,"If you read my review below you'll see I was not happy with the game.
It's worse.
They have Royally screwed this game up.
I see no reason to play. Next month they're removing Wildcards...instead of adding they're removing.
I can think of nothing dumber.
There have been days I had enjoyed this game to no end, but in the last month and next month are deal breakers. I refuse to get upset over a game, So, I am walking away.
I will be removing this game from my list once I post this.

Good luck to you if you play.


The game is worse than ever.
People, in team play, lose on purpose. Ruining your efforts to compete.
I have supported this game every month, I can no longer have fun playing. I only enjoy team play and that is ruined.
The creators of the game appear to Refuse to correct this.
So, I can not change the world, So, I must change my self.
I'll try again next month.
To be more clear I have played maybe 20 matches and at least 10 of those have been with non-players who lost on purpose.
I hope you have fun playing, just be aware. It is not fair.

It's much worse now."
2977,fun game always liked this game can play for 3 min but usually ends up being like 3 hrs
2978,I just saw this game on youtube and tried it. It's a wonderful game. been looking for something like that for a long time since they have removed OMDU
2979,a real fun game and for being free def worth it
2980,"Basically Clash Royale for PC. One was bound to be released eventually, and this one isn't half bad. They release free DLC every so often, and I would hesitate to call it pay to win (for now). The game does, in my opinion, offer a better experience than Clash Royale so give it a try if you recieved the DLC for free."
2981,"It's kind of fun if you're really into deck building, I guess.  I just got bored and it couldn't hold my interest.  I just wanted to give it a shot because it does have lovely graphics and the announcer is pretty fun.  So I will recommend this for people who are really into this kind of game but if you're not into cards like this it won't really hold your attention too long."
2982,awesome game my friend showed me this and it so awesome i just love it ! please keep this game running and update it! but the prices is insane lower the prices
2983,"funny,good job"

2985,Noob wer das liest
2986,I like this game cuz you can play it with one hand and snack while you play. It's also addicting so I always come back to this somehow.
2987,"I stopped playing this game after they changed economy into arsewater in november.  i just wanted to see the following posts to see if they take it back so it might make the game worthwhile to play again -  but no, they tried to pull a tiny little bit of it back but it weren't nearly enough to save their playerbase from leaving.  Now i can even see, that if you click on the game and scroll down to see news, the post from november 12 2019 about the shitty economy changes is hidden cause it has 100% downvotes and 99% bad comments xD!!!! What a lousy and nasty way the developers is going down, and its getting worse every update, while they aint thinking at all about the actual playerbase. Screw this selfish and greedy AF dev team, this game is driving dead fast towards the grave and i couldnt care less anymore. Thanks for the good times, i aint never coming back as long as those dude's run the show. DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THIS GAME! its only a shell of what a great game it used to be."
2988,Lovely
2989,Fun and neat game if you like tower defense MOBA type games.
2990,I enjoy this thanks devs
2991,+1
2992,addicting
2993,"The strategy is fun, the deck building is intuitive and all around, it's like a multiplayer vs btd"
2994,Good auto-chess game. Well balanced for having so many options.
2995,Very addictive game.
2996,Too addictive. Don't even start.
2997,amazing game
2998,"Has a low commitment casual vibe that draws you in and hooks you, but the hint of progression and customisation (not cosmetic related), along with the strategic elements, enticed me to want to get better at the game."
2999,Excellent deck building game.
3000,pretty fun game
3001,"pretty good, easy to understand"
3002,This Game is Asome i love it ^_^
3003,"they have passed their prime.
they used to champion the ""free to play"" model. claiming they would never allow the game to become pay to win.
recently they made an announcment where they took away most free rewards of value and replaced them with crap, at the same time they also started putting new cards behind a battlepass so it is required to pay money in order to have meta cards.

""tldr"":
in an effort to ""keep from going bankrupt"" legitimate ideas were thrown out and pay to win ideas were adapted. the community was told to just deal with it, and most of us left."
3004,Best quick game I ever played just waiting on new cards and I want more smaller mana value cards cause they lit
3005,"Way too hard to get rare cards. The whole game is explicitly pushing you to spend money, and ever opening tons of ""card packs"" you will only get common cards which don't add to nothing. The draft system, which is the Arena of Hearthstone, doesn't reward you proportionally to your achievements. It is fun to play it for 10-12 hours, but then you really stop going anywhere."
3006,"fun game
"
3007,awesome shit
3008,"Great for wasting your time!
Fun!"
3009,like
3010,this game is the best get cards play match everything please add more and more cards
3011,"TLDR: My new favorite game! Lots of different game modes, singles, draft, challenges, ect. Doubles is amazing and speeds up the pace of the game. Only downside is you do have to commit either in game time or money for the ""good"" cards. Buff Milloween's Golem!

The best way I can describe this game is a fast paced, real time, card based tower defense game. It's vibrant, fun and has a surprising amount of depth to it! There is singles, challenges, draft and my  personal favorite, team (or doubles). The inclusion of teams not only adds to the fun by speeding up the game and bringing team combos, but lets you share the madness with a friend. Love this game, and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys tower defense or card games! Only bad thing about this game is that the rare/legendary cards are very strong and you either have to spin and hope you find them in the roulette, or buy them. But there is a fair share of in game currency, so either is completely possible. 

PS: Please give ALL the champions (yes including Ratbo) a chance; we have enough Morrelia mains."
3012,Nice fun game to just chill and catch up with friends super easy to pick up and fun interactions.
3013,free dlc  when it comes out and fun to play with friends
3014,its fun and easy
3015,LULW
3016,high quality game
3017,"If a card deck battler had a baby with a tug-of-war, this would be the offspring. Great game. Lots of options, well balanced, and short-action packed rounds."
3018,"Terrible Game, if you like being harassed by mods and watching every well done tactical facet be systematically removed update by update as they increase the P2W aspects and remove the ability to generate high tier currency for free, this game is for you."
3019,im so into this game tho nice
3020,"Clash Royale, but better."
3021,Game is good.
3022,time game.not bad.is good
3023,Good fun. 2x2 teaming works well. lots of combos make for interesting decks.
3024,"its fun and interesting the gameplay needs lots of strats, recommended for those who like card summoning games ( i know i didnt say that right dont get offended ) but all and all its fun and would recommend those that like fantasy games"
3025,"amazing game, very fun and grindy. best free game c:"
3026,good game
3027,"Honestly, for a f2p app it's not bad.  Super quick games of super simplified Magic The Gathering."
3028,"This game is very addicting. I love the graphics an the game play. The global chat could use some work, like have a moderator in there to watch it. Easy to grasp an level. It is a must have in anyone's collection of games for sure. The best an easiest card game i have ever played an enjoyed the most."
3029,"Minion card game where you battle an opponent and summon minion monsters based on how much mana you have.
Placing the monsters on the board to counter the ones the opponent summons, easy simple game.
Feels like a mobile game and graphics are similar to other games like this.
"
3030,"Nice game, especially the duration of the matches are very short. What makes it  easier to play between work, kids, real life kinda stuff :)"
3031,To many error issues
3032,"DRAGONS MORE LIKE OPENESS
"
3033,I'm hoooked on this for good!
3034,"Lowkey fun game. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Simple, quick matches."
3035,"Advertised a ""free dlc pass"" early december. Activated it, but wasn't given anything at all. Lots of scammy advertisements to drive sales."
3036,"It was fun, but then I logged in and had cards missing from my collection. The cards are played in the replays I sent to support. No response.

Apparently it's a known issue... not investing time if progress can randomly be deleted."
3037,:)
3038,"Fun, fast paced, strategic minion combat executed amazingly."
3039,"I kicked some butt. in 1v1 of course. right in the first time I team battled, my partner afk'ed I lost"
3040,"Mmm very well made game, having alot of fun for being free to play, im not a try hard gamer so take this opinion as casual player
"
3041,YES
3042,Its p cool
3043,"Easy to get into and really engaging, art is fun-ish but the monetization is crazy bad."
3044,"Simple yet sweet, epic and lovable, Minion Masters is an ideal chessmaster's strategy game -- yet at the same time, manages to keep a generous bar for entry. Don't let the apparent ""pay to win"" aspects fool you. No one can give themselves such a crushing advantage with a little money that can't be outdone by any other player with good tactics. Everyone can unlock any other card in the game, Minion or Spell, just by using in-game currency earned through battling. Everyone is on even terms with 10-card hands. Take the Cleaver, for instance, a heavy hitter with great damage and survivability, but can be brought down by a simple swarm of Scrats or Skeleton Warriors. The Annihilator with his range and splash damage dies in a couple hits. Towers can't move out of the way of your Fireball or Beam of Doom. Minion Masters is all about playing the right card at the right moment, rewarding good play and smart combos."
3045,make fun!
3046,"This is a simple review.... after having played Magic The Gathering Online 2 headed giant from 2011 to 2018 and on....Minion Masters has to be considered in my eyes as better .... because MTGO dropped the co-op mode and this game actually makes you play against players at your level or vs the level of the team you're against.   It's free, very easy to understand, hard to master, lots to learn even if there is less than 300 cards... who said you need to put out new cards like in Magic every three months.... This game if you get hooked won't break your budget.... and since December 1st....   this game has been a hit for me.    There is no bad comments if you don't play well... although a lot of advice from players and during the game the most that can happen is an exclamation mark to show the importance of a location on the map.      It's addictive.... so please give it a try.   This company is from a small box that is at their third game.... and who have finally hit big ... although you may expect still some bugs which are tolerable... sometimes a bit frustrating but understandable.... Don't complain it's free and it's fun :)    Happy new year 2021

Not yet available on Android, they're presently working on an Xbox and maybe another console."
3047,Great game so far. Easy tutorial.
3048,really emersive
3049,"Very easy to pick up and play, with one of the most relaxing co-op experiences in a while."
3050,what i liked about this product goes here.
3051,"this is one of my most favorite games to play i also have this game on XBOX one and i am absolutely in love with the game.
"
3052,The game is very interesting!!!Tightened immediateiy!!!
3053,enjoying the game but less real player i think
3054,"Minion Masters is a well-polished competitive game, and its short, escalating matches are both highly tactical and thrilling. This is a great game for when you want a 10-minute break to play a couple of matches.

That said, it exhibits the same sickness as most games that rely in an in-game monetisation system for revenue. A needlessly complicated system of currencies and card acquisition structure, that is (again, as most ""predatory"" games) designed around getting you hooked before needing to pay anything. People that are impulsive buyers or know they can't resist the urge of lootboxes should avoid this game like the plague.

For everyone else that can resist all the manipulative tactics (daily deals, time-limited ""discounts"", frustration, etc.) and will just spend a few euros to support the company, its a very good game under all this bullshit, and you don't really need to spend money to make a nice deck that is at least somewhat competitive. Although it places itself on the boundaries of what is acceptable monetisation-wise, I think it makes it, barely - hence my recommendation."
3055,:)
3056,GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3057,"Bad game and aweful developers never fixing issues and bugs, matchmaking doesnt work because you can play with a new account and match against people 3leagues bellow you, every grand champ in the game does this and minion masters refuses to address the issue. Never spending another dime on this junk of a game, because the developers never put any effort into fixing the competetive issues the game has."
3058,yes
3059,fun to play with friends
3060,nice minion
3061,"easy to learn, interesting enough to play on casual terms"
3062,Had tons of fun then for some reason cheaters just flooded the game and now its impossible to play. No way to report them as well makes it impossible to get them out of the game
3063,"FUCKING AMAZING, what? a review? oh.....its amazing :P"
3064,"It is almost nostalgic for me because a similar game was made for Magic The Gathering, I like it a lot and it was basically the same style of gameplay. It can get really tricky and frustrating but the key is remembering that even the best deck you can put together will still only get you AT BEST 8/10 wins. Don't be too hard on yourself. Just remember to switch it up if you're not having a good time and remember that you have to lose some to win some."
3065,"This is a novel take on a card game. It combines cards with real time strategy. Build a strong deck around a common idea so that your cards work in combination with each other. Then combat other plays with your cards, determining which cards to play, and importantly, where on the battlefield to place them. There's no single deck that can dominate everything, so figure out what sort of playing style you like the most. I would recommend having a few different types of decks and experiment with different cards. You can also see what sort of decks beat you and get ideas from those. 

I've played hundreds of hours on the Xbox and a few hours on the PC. Both are great versions, although the PC version seems to be a bit more smooth."
3066,its ok
3067,"The game was an amazing experience starting off, but unfortunately it doesn't appear to have a strong future ahead of it.  

Pros:
• Easy to learn.  Decent amount of strategy to master.

• The game play is fun.  Something I would love to see replicated in a single player rougelike game someday.
     - There is a rougelike game mode that requires rubies (premium currency) to play.  This was a brilliant idea, and hope the studio gives this more focus.  With that being said these feel extremely short, and in the background as a side activity.

• All cards can be crafted (so far) so nothing is officially locked behind a ""paywall"" although with recent announcements/updates it can be questioned on how much longer this luxury will last down the road.

• Occasional free DLC (100% off) on steam store which is just card packs, but it is a great way of advertisement as it is what got me into the game to begin with.

• Fun if you can find a CO-OP partner IRL to play with.

• Skill, and timing of playing cards is still relevant towards victory.

• Not P2W (yet).  Unlocking new champions will require a lot of grind, or spending money although this isn't a big deal with the free rotation system.

Cons:
• Imbalanced.  While I understand a game of this style will have some cards more useful than others, and some champions better than others - there is an issue with a majority of the cards being extremely situational that are only useful with a deck build around them.  The issue with this is that even if you make a specialized deck around these cards it will still eventually not be viable against most of the other strategies.  The developers do rebalance stuff constantly, but sometimes not always for the better.  When you get to the higher rankings you are likely to see pretty much the same card combinations against all opponents in which many of them just copied the deck from the top 10 rankings themselves.  

• A lot of bots in the lower rankings.  With a small, and slowly decaying user base the game is forced to utilize bots to speed up the matchmaking times in the lower ranks.  While I understand their reason for doing this the issue that it presents is that there isn't really an official way to verify if your opponent was a bot, or actual player (unless they use chat emojis).  This robs you of the satisfaction of any kind of victory because you will always contemplate if the opponent you just defeated was a bot, or legit player.  While bots are less frequent the higher you go on the ladder there is also a concern with this being a common predatory practice used to manipulate newer players into believing they are doing better than they really are to keep them playing.  There needs to be more transparency with the bot system, or a revision to how rankings are altogether.  A small player base spread even thinner by many tiers of ranks is just going to require the usage of more bots.

• Guild system doesn't offer much.  It is boring, and uninspired as if it were taken directly from a mobile game.

• Change in resource system.  This one is about a 50/50 for me.  I understand that they need to make money, and completely on board with them changing how often they give out premium currency.  Although the concern is that this will fast track a decline of the F2P player base.

• Half of the champions are good while the other half are too gimmicky/inconsistent.  You are likely to see the same 3-4 ones in higher tier because they just offer more.  Occasionally you will see the few that aren't used as much here, and there but ultimately you will know which ones are more likely to win.

• Only fun for short periods of time.  It is easy to get burned out before needing to go to something else.  This is probably just a ""me"" thing, but there isn't much more that is exciting after you've seen almost all the cards or watched the same little goblin dude kick the bucket for the thousands time.

• Daily quests feel like a chore.  The higher rank you get the HARDER, and more time consuming it becomes to complete your dailies.  Most of them require ""winning"" with different heroes, winning within a certain time limit, dragging out a match for a long period of time before winning, or just winning multiple tag team battles (good luck if your in the higher ranks, and your team mate is a dodo bird).  While these aren't necessarily ""hard"" it just becomes tiring to pursue especially considering there is an achievement locked behind daily quests, and daily shop rewards.

• A few poorly designed achievements designed to get you to ""play more"" rather than pull off an incredible task.  Achievement hunting in this game isn't bad, but when the final ones you will get involve needing to wait the next day to log in for the next 50-100 days it needlessly stretches things out to the point of being a chore.  (This only applies if your achievement hunting.  Most players don't care about this so don't stress too much).

In conclusion, I don't think the ideas in this game are bad.  There are things that are well executed, but there are also many things that are poorly executed.  This is a game that relies on the longevity of its player base, and at this exact point in time it is starting to look like a sinking ship that makes it difficult to want to stay on board.  I think if the developers can use ideas from this to create a single player (or CO-OP) title with a modest price tag instead of the massive focus on PVP then that would be incredible.  Although as a F2P ""service"" game it feels like it is doomed to fail, and I cannot recommend it due to how unenjoyable the game becomes when played in long intervals - which is dangerous when trying to establish a active player base."
3068,A simple enough title to hop in and out of occasionally. Free to play and the publisher has given out every single DLC pack for free during the first few days of their release.
3069,pretty enjoyed game and looks pretty good
3070,I love the fun strategic combat. I love how all of the mechanics work. This is overall a great game.
3071,Only been playing for an hour or so but it's a pretty cool game and fun.
3072,Just spawn
3073,"A chess board for gamers, pretty good for people who like to practice strategy games. Have played it for months and still loving it. Highly recommended ¡¡¡"
3074,The game has gotten steady worse over the seasons as the desperately needs more cards but the devs now only release two cards a season. The player base is shrinking and I deeply regret spending money on this game.
3075,"Free, easy, grindable. Not a bad time sink game at all."
3076,"Its good for casual play, some rng but you can keep changing up your deck and trying different things. Dont spend shards on upgrades spend all gold on power tokens."
3077,"A strong mix of card game and tower defence, with lots of different card and Masters to make interesting and powerful combos"
3078,Not a bad game to be free its a nice casual experience and fun way to kill a few hours matches are short so not a big time investment if you just want to get in and get out.
3079,it fun but i didn't get the turtle thing from the dlc i got for free but it was free for me so :/
3080,"Minon Masters is an Amazing Game & Its Free so Might as well try it?
Pros: Game is Free, Decent Graphics, Multiple Characters/Minons to Purchase with Game Currency.
Cons: Honestly Don't know but Its alot more fun with Friends."
3081,"alright so think of clash royale
now think of constant updates
think of queue times that are within a minute

if you haven't already creamed your pants then i've got more 

think of several different heroes
now think of free season passes and free rewards
finally, think of every possible card being free
nothing is p2p unless you want it to be

WELCOME TO F**KING MINION MASTERS BAYBEEEE"
3082,cool game.
3083,"Very fun combination between RTS & TCG,
Although shop promos are quiet enoying ."
3084,Pretty laidback kind of active tower defense game
3085,Simple but complex fun game to waste some time on
3086,o
3087,Vibin
3088,a
3089,Mobile (PAY TO WIN) game for PC...
3090,nice game
3091,"This game took the clash royale model and made it the hardcore version with all those RTS/Moba/CCG nuances I love.

Very easy to jump into and match making seemed pretty decent.

I recommend to anyone who liked the quickness of clash royale strategy type games with a LOT more depth."
3092,"It's fun and F2P, give it a darn shot."
3093,Fun deck builder game and you can earn all things for free at a reasonable rate.
3094,"Fast and Fun, better and more dinamic than heartstone...
lookng up to new updates...."
3095,bad
3096,I hate the matchups seems like everyone is pay to win.
3097,"great animation and graphics good card game with monsters love it
"
3098,"it is a good game i like it a lot!
"
3099,"Its a fun game, reminds me of a more fast paced Yu gi oh without the waiting for turns. Depends on how fast you gain your mana and how well you spend it to conquer your foes. can even offer strategies and what not to the mix to get a better handle on each match. And the heroes you can use add a unique flare to the game.
"
3100,cool small fun
3101,"Fast paced and approachable. The game guides you through a quick tutorial and provides both quick entertainment as well as  progression. Have no idea about the ""to pay for"" features, but up to now, I have also not had any interest in them. Rounds are quick and good for even short breaks :)"
3102,nice
3103,"An easy to learn, hard to (minion)master style deck building game with microtransactions, but none of which are necessary to play. You could completely play for free and earn your cards, but it's worth supporting the devs with either the gold&exp booster or champion unlocks. Well worth a download and try."
3104,Addictively simple and yet not simple.
3105,pretty decent
3106,Its good
3107,cuz i keep winning man i destroy all hammer smashed face in pussy and i cum blood on my enemyes
3108,friggin love this game.
3109,"Free to play player of about a year. It is a very simple game with some surprising depth. It is not so much a card game as a real time strategy game with cards. Initially, it can be quite daunting. However, if you stick with it, the free to play model is quite generous and the balance patches help to keep the game interesting. Best of all, games are short, and so you will quickly know if the game is for you. A long match is only 6 or 7 minutes long. The game is free to play, so if you think you might be interested there is no barrier to entry."
3110,The name of the game is know which wild cards are trending and make sure you bring 3 of your own counter wild cards to a match. Making the other 9 cards you choose pointless. Wild cards rule the game.
3111,"It's really pretty, has good graphics.
The gameplay is fast and strategy-based, Which I Love <3
There's some pay to play aspects but the cards (minions) are mostly free I think.
I don't know, Haven't played much, only level 10. Going to play a little more and see.
I like it, they did a good job."
3112,The game is full of modders or hackers and the devs are covering it up but not fighting against it because that's their player-base. record your sketchy games and then watch the games playback they are different.
3113,"Its the perfect ""I have 2 minutes to spare before I leave for work"" game.
Be warned, pay to win policies are present to a degree."
3114,"Very good game so far, FTP, not sure if $ model will become abusive eventually ala clash royale"
3115,"very good game, luck plays a very small part in it, mostly your luck against your opponent's cards, that's the main luck thing.

You also need to play a lot early on and try to get all season rewards even if you don't have the season pass, those boost your cards a lot.

All in all, if you like playing card games with a tactical strategy theme, this game is yours.

It's also FREE."
3116,"Fun but theres an obvious pay to win. you get so much advantage paying for cards, free players have no chance unless they grind an insane amount

EDIT: ok they sent an email out claiming they arent p2w and that actually irritated me. lets get one thing straight, EVERY collectible card game is p2w. unless its an lcg, where everyone get everything for the same price, the better cards are always more expensive, end of discussion. 
when they release a new expansion, there are new, UNBALANCED cards behind a paywall. the new meta has an edge and if you shell out enough to make your deck entirely meta, you will win with little competition. 
my friend and i win the majority of our games, yes against players, but when we face clanmates who drop $50+ on their decks and we are f2p, we get crushed, even if we hold out for 6 minutes, because they have cards that have far more power. very few f2p players beat us, but people who have paid for the new meta/expansion almost always win. 
this game is a card game in the style of a ccg, it IS p2w, period. you can play it yourself and find out. get to gold rank and youll begin to run into this and it only gets worse the higher you get. there is little skill involved for the people who pay. ive faced people who whiff their spells or waste a 7-cost card on my puny 2-cost scrats and they still win because their cards are more powerful."
3117,AWESOME!!!!!
3118,"It's not the most unique game in the world, but it's a fun way to relax and just click the mouse. There are tons of varied units and special abilities, which are neat."
3119,very fun!
3120,cool
3121,Like a fish to water - rose the ranks right away. So easy to pick up. Settled in the upper middle class and come back almost every day. Big fan.
3122,"good game
"
3123,"Pretty cool game, it's a ton of fun!"
3124,Very fun so far. Ill give a more updated review as time goes on.
3125,play now - is good ;-)
3126,good game
3127,Very fun alone or with a buddy in 2v2
3128,"Great game, pretty fair free to play system.  Easy to understand, but a lot of strategy as you climb the ranks."
3129,Great game to kill and pass the time
3130,Gud
3131,"Good Idea, cute graphics. Poor execution, Deck building /card viewing capabilities could be vastly improved. I also  feel like the game ends up being focused a bit to much on P2W once you hit a certain point/ranking. Guilds seem to be mostly dead/useless and the game attempts to coerce you to friend everybody in order to do 'premade battles' ."
3132,"Very cool, trust me."
3133,i like this game becaue i can do drugs while play
3134,ive played for a while its meh
3135,"+ Variety of Characters to choose with unique abilities and cards earned over time throughout the course of a match.
+ Variety of Units and Spells to play that automatically attack enemy units and base. Reduce enemy base to 0 to win.
+ 1v1 or 2v2 (Teams) capable. Ranked and Casual options. Ranked earns more rewards after a season (the higher rank).
+ Generous card and character availability and random roll rewards. You do not have to pay anything to get value.
+ Paying to get value in this game is worth it to get the characters for sure, you may also purchase skins.
+ Cool aesthetic that does not take itself too seriously with quirky narration."
3136,"So far so good. The battle system feels fairly decent to this point. Early to tell how far it will go, but the mechanics are well built up to this point, I just hope the ""buy this"" factor doesn't kill it for me."
3137,"This game is fucking shit.
the fucking wankers who made this are shit the character mordar is the mad summoner but he is not. I had been grinding for so long to get him but it was such a wast.
and what happend free token, shards are so fucking hard to get now.
this shit used to be good till it was just to fucking grindy and pay to win
so I recomend that you go do something better with your life than play shit."
3138,"So good game
"
3139,fun game and worth the download
3140,"Pretty neat for a free game.  Flexible deck building and its fairly easy to get a grasp on, although once you get into silver rank you'll notice a dramatic increase in the other players' skills"
3141,"is good
"
3142,A quite good Clash Royale kinda!
3143,"This is exactly what I wanted; short, sweet, with great art and a fun premise."
3144,"this game is the best And even better, its free! THIS WEEKEND download it while you still can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3145,fun little game to play
3146,i love this game
3147,"Hi everybody!
I played the game since it was on early access, so I experienced a lot of changes in this game.

In the beginning the developers tried to balance a lot of cards. Made some nerfs or even buffs for some cards. This wasn´t always great, but the result was a (mostly) balanced game. 

Nowadays, these blance is completly gone. 
The devs introduced something like a ""fraction bonus"" ( The bonus is individual for each fraction.), some time ago. Since then the game lacks an enormous amout of balance problems. Which results in encountering the same decks again and again and ..... and again.

But to be honest, this is not even the worst. What bothers me the most is that the dev´s are aware of this situation and decided to do nothing. They change cards, which haven´t even had a significant role in the meta. 

UPDATE: The game got even worse, since they introduced some new mechanics and DID NOT change the strongest cards in the game AT ALL. I started to wonder if they are doing this crap on purpose.

Also, they are going for a mobile version of the game. There won´t be any F2P aspect anymore, it´s ""pay2 progress"" now. ( That´s a fact, you can research it in their update log.)


Aside from that, the game is fun to play. You can create some weird decks and have some good time."
3148,Fast paced little strategy game.
3149,"Financially the best game on steam.

if there is one game that is the exact opposite of Pay-to-win its Minion Masters. 
You pretty much start out with a small amount of meh minions but as you really begin to play you realize the game is actually so addicting and fun. I have been playing it for over a year and each time I come back to it its 10x better than I remember it. First off it is pretty easy to get minions and even if you are having trouble getting them they supply you with $15 worth of minions and items to get going so pretty much they supply you with all that you need to succeed if you are patient and stick to the game for a little while. the gameplay itself is really fun and satisfying, you strategically select minions that you think will work  best together to beat whoever it is your playing against in a short, fast paced environment. Minion Masters has an active and surprisingly mature community you can bond with and always ask for help from. 
I have unlocked almost all Minions and achievements without spending a dime, to top it off they give you free rotation masters every week which are the very same you have to spend in-game currency for.
so pretty much you can immediately jump into this game and have a complete blast.

3153,"good game

3154,Seems like a fun game to get into
3155,Nice game yes yes i like this yes yes plezz give me loot yes yes jaaaas yes yes
3156,"This game used to be incredible. In terms of the core gameplay it's by far the most fun I've had with any game ever. Sadly the developers have over a long period of time changed the game into something that is less and less skill based, to the point where there is little reason to actually play something that requires you to be good at the game. So if you just wanna have some casual fun for free go ahead, there is enjoyment to be had. But for someone like me who takes the game seriously it's a big fat thumbs down from me. I also have tried to approach developers for explanations as to the state of the game but was completely ignored, what little response I've gotten borders on hostility."
3157,relaxing game and fun!
3158,Fun and fast paced. Like dota meets eternal
3159,its a chill yet challenging game with a fair amount of depth lots of fun for anyone who enjoys tower defense or trading card style gameplay
3160,"It's just fun. Simple, quick bouts. Win or loose, it's enjoyable madness."
3161,This is pretty fun and the confetti after you win is so so satisfying it's enough to make me play alone.

3167,When I first seen this game in the store a thought it was something stupid and I was bored so I downloaded the game and its great I have been having fun all day.
3168,"I Like how fast paced it is, it gives the impression that the round will be over soon, I especially like it when I am given an actual challenge, the minions have simple stats, and the spells can be a real game changer depending on when and how you use them, and luck of course. Its not difficult to understand, but it helps greatly if you put some thought into what you want for your deck."
3169,good

3180,Kind of addicting.
3181,"Great game, pretty easy and straight forward. Like clash royal. but graphics seem to be a bit better. Looking forward to see what this game has in store in the future."
3182,"Pros -

-Great game, good fun. It's as if Autochess and Hearthstone had a baby.
-Lots of fun, nuanced strategy
-Visually colorful
-There is a pay aspect, but it does not feel outright P2W
-Different masters do feel like they play differently
-A good variety in deck builds
-Mostly balanced game

Cons-

-Mostly balanced
-Matches can occasionally be rampantly one-sided
-Game has some sort of gargantuan memory leak. RTX 2070, Ryzen 7 2700x, 32gb memory, I need to close and reopen the game after a few matches due to visual and audio chugging/lag/memory spiking.
"
3183,"Extremely addictive. Anyone that likes Clash Royale or tower defense type of games would absolutely love this one. Only con, I feel like they should improve the character design, but that just my own opinion. All in all, really cool game."

Really liked it looks like it was made with pasion for the project which is kinda all that matters."
3191,"Pros:
Good Graphics
Fun gameplay
The Battle Pass actually has rewards
Easy to pick up

Cons:
Sorta pay to win
Can get complicated if taken seriously

Conclusion:
There's a free DLC to a really nice and free game. RECOMMENDED"

3198,noice
3199,"Look at my play-time. I loved this game. It's still good, don't get me wrong (probably the best of it's type), BUT... I hate what they did with the gamepass rewards. It used to be 3 months and I could take my time to earn the top level rewards, but now it's every single month and I just don't want to play it enough to get to the top unlocks.

They also effectively doubled the pass's cost, being cheaper than it used to, but ending 3x faster. It's not not particularly costly and I daresay the devs deserve some funds, but they've gone from being too generous, to too stingy in my opinion.

I'd like to give this a meh, but all I can do to register my displeasure is a ""no"" recommendation, until they slow the pass down a bit, or lower its cost a little. Something."

3216,"Good game reminds me of Clash Royale and Castle Fight

Visually amazing in 4k 60fps

Make more content please this game is pretty fun to play and get into

Team Battles is an amazing concept and feature

Sad to hear this game will be cancelled or did I get my facts incorrect"
3217,"Fun game with friends thanks to thier 2v2 mode. I spent a lot of time on the game, its quite balanced, however they completly changed the economy, reduced content and over-priced everything, making the game nearly P2W and near impossible for newer players."
3218,Fun!!!
3219,Excellent
3220,"Clash Royal with better graphics and allot more content. ( if you liked clash = you like minion masters )
The game is fun with a friend, and relies on excellent teamwork.
The deck building is really fun and matchmaking is very quick.
Just a fun game if you're bored.

I wouldn't buy it or recommend spending cash on this game. You can unlock cards easy by just playing the game."
3221,fun nuff said
3222,"Actually a lot of fun. Beautiful art and effects, and you get a lot of free stuff."
3223,Extremely addicting very quickly for the strategy minded. It presents so many opportunities for variety that it makes you want to keep playing even when you can't earn any more quests.

3237,It is so strategic and amazing overall

3239,"i liked clash royale as a kid, and this is just clash royale, but better."
3240,"I'm not going to cry about the new changes, I'm just disappointed. I understand that you've made these changes because you need money to keep the game afloat. However, you didn't address the problem. The problem being there is nothing worth spending money on. 1250 rubies ($9) for a single RANDOM legendary of which there are 44 in the game is worthless. The ""Value packs"" where you get 5 copies of the same legendary card are scams. 5 copies of 2 legendary cards with some added fluff for 4000 rubies marked as 70% off is something only impulse spenders buy. Hell, the most recent battle pass has a legendary skin in it that's a recolor of a skin already in the game. It's just lazy and sad. Nothing is worth spending money on. The ""problem"" of too many rubies available to players isn't the problem. 

Also, your justification of this ""issue"" is also unfair and one sided. 

From the first rework article:
""A player that reached Grand Master in every mode would earn 975 Rubies - If they earned 10 Profile Levels, they would be getting an extra 550. This meant the typical monthly Ruby income for this player was 1525""

- GM in every mode is literally your top 0.5% of players, why punish your most dedicated following?
- 10 levels is 100,000,000 xp or about 1k games (we can round down to 90m given some free xp can be earned)

So at maybe 100k xp (rounded way up) per 5 minutes (2-4 minute games plus intermission) you're saying ""the average player"" plays 900 games or spends 75 hours per month playing your game (over 2 hours of MM per day). This isn't your average player, you're literally punishing your most dedicated players for loving the f out of your game. Your reasoning is so unfair it's just sad how far you're willing to go. 

Personally, I do not support you. The 3 month battle pass becoming 1 month battle passes for almost the same cost is laughable. I remember when Hi-Rez (SMITE devs) did the same exact thing and I stopped playing that game shortly after. The roulette wheel gambling power tokens is also not something I would ever support. The laughable prices in the stores are made only for impulse buyers. You've done nothing to actually help your game. I imagine, many players like me, are also not going to get the battle pass and will not be too active this season.

Again, I'm not going to cry over these changes and I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong. I have well over 200 hours in this game and hope these new changes actually work for you. I just don't see how any good can come from punishing your most dedicated players and doing nothing to fix your problems. Anyways, I do wish you the best and hope I'll be able to enjoy MM in the coming years."
3241,fun fun
3242,"--Updated 2/18/2022--
After well over a year they still havent answered my email that I sent asking to rectify this issue. So they are still scamming me from a decent amount of $.

------
I spent money on both Steam and Discord versions, when I came back to check out the state of the game I was forced to ""migrate"" from discord to steam, I HAD 2100 rubies on steam and 1914 on discord, I migrated and only had 1914. what a SCAM of a game, they stole from me and I was told that I shouldnt have migrated then, but I had no choice since I couldnt play from the discord version and was told to migrate. I havent played in awhile but reading the ingame chat it seems like the game hasnt gotten any better and the high level people are still super pretentious about the game..."

3253,after the economy changes I wont spend any more money on minion masters. Hope you like your game with lots of bugs
3254,"It's basically just Clash Royale, but less fun."
3255,"Do you know those games that tells you how much your choices matter, but in the end the result is always the same? This game is the same, only replace choices with feedback.

The game has a built in feedback system, and the devs actively encourage you to give feedback. But it doesnt matter if you use the ingame feedback system, directly mail them or use the forums. The result will always be the same: The devs does whatever they feel like.

Many matches are decided by factors you can not control. For example, the game is full of griefers and people with bad internet connections. As a European i'm frequently matched with or against chinese players. These players tend to disconnect a lot, and if a player disconnects from a match there is no AI to take control of that players actions, nor are you able to personally control that players actions during the time they are disconnected (if its your teammate). But you will still gain or lose the same amount of rating as if its a normal match.

There doesnt seem to be any punishment system whatsoever in the game, for bad behaviour (or anything else). So if you are matched with a player who is gonna sit the whole game emoting rather than playing a single card there is not much you can do. There is a report system ingame but once again, it doesnt seem to do anything. At one point i decided to directly mail the developer with a video of the match in which some heavy griefing took place, but i didnt even get an automated answer.

Its an innovative and enjoyable game at its core, but sadly the developers are completely tone deaf."

3259,yea
3260,"Seems like a fun lil game - bit overwhelming with all the unlocks, but I think I can sink some good quality time into it!"
3261,Fun!
3262,"Minion Masters is a game I have a serious love / hate relationship that has developed over 700+ hours of game play.  I am one of the early adopters to the game and played within days of launch.  Each match can be anywhere between under a minute to the longest I've had just under 9 minutes.  On average though a match is between 3 or 4 minutes.  Due to the quick matches, game play has evolved into a more causal style.  Minion Masters has become my Minesweeper or Solitaire to kill time and keep my brain active.  I turn to it when I want something more engaging than a TV show but not so heavily invested of commitment such as an RPG or MMO.  Frequently if I have about 10 minutes before dinner is served I'll hop online and try for 2 matches.  I will come away from it fulfilled and felt like I got something accomplished and was challenging.

The only complaint I have is the interface is very outdated and needs to be brought up to modern standards.  They are actively revamping art and models of the units so there is work progress in that regard.  The interface though needs a refresh and it hasn't been really mentioned or brought to players attention much.  

There is an active community you can visibly see in the global chat whenever you're in game.  The wait time for a match is always within acceptable standards.  Rarely do I ever wait more than 10-20 seconds to begin a match.  Like any real time pvp games there are some network hiccups but I can only ever remember not being able to get online or back into a match if I disconnect is when something is wrong on my end.  Overall its a solid game that can be taken to that competitive level if you so desire.  However I find the most enjoyable experience has been to take it casually but still get the engaging action you desire thanks to the short matches."
3263,"Great game.  MAtches normally no more than 5 minutes

This is THE best free-to-play game on Steam in my opinion.
Download it, it is super fun and if you have a friend to start out with you can build your decks together.
Screw Ravager and Milloween though, they're annoying."

3271,"Fun game, hidden gem in my opinion especially with friends"
3272,Real fun with friends
3273,"Fun game, not too P2W, good time waster and has 2v2s"
3274,"By far, my favorite game I've played on Steam. It has surpassed all my other games in time played, and I enjoy every game mode they put out. Some mayhems are less entertaining than others, but the solo and 2v2 experiences are overall solid and provide the engagement necessary. Easy enough on hardware, and takes a long time to master each card. There's mana management, timing of spells and placement of units, and generalized playstyles that allow most players to enjoy this game. I definitely recommend it, the skill floor is low and the ceiling high, and there's enough variety to encourage replayability.

Pros:
-fairly low performance requirement
-live-action deck building game
-faction variation is steadily growing
-pleasing visuals
-easy to pick up
-leagues with 5 tiers within each enables appropriate placement based on skill level
 
Cons:
-occasionally unbalanced, but devs fix within weeks
-will sometimes crash
-a few toxic members in global chat (as with all games, though)
-SOME strats are nearly impossible to counter, but that could very well be a lack of skill on my part
-although the matchmaking system works very well, there are occasional match-ups of random team battles vs. premades, giving the competitive advantage to the premade team"
3275,Easily the best free to play game I have ever played.
3276,.
3277,Best Pc game for people who love Clash Royal. Also the support team is amazing. if you subscribe this game's newsletter you get free codes every month.
3278,Nice!
3279,"You have taken a star and turned into a turd.  This was a go to game that has become a unplayable * Congrats on sucking the like of what was my favorite ccg,"

3281,Very fun strat game
3282,Underrated game.
3283,Easy gameplay. not p2w
3284,"Fun, quick battles, with a lot of variety from the cards. Game balance is good and the devs adjust it a little bit each month so I can adjust a little bit too."
3285,Absolutely addictive even as I was not even into the genre to begin with. But got me spending well over 200 hours on beating random strangers with my decks. Absolutely love this game

3298,MMMMMMMInion Masterrssssssssssss
3299,"I actually have a lot more hours than 56, and have been playing for over two years. This game is absolutely fantastic, and is especially good for playing with friends :)

First off, this game is free. FREE! I would have paid $10 for this happily!
And of course, free means pay-to-win, right? WRONG! There is little to no pay-to-win if you play long enough :D

Second, the devs actually care. They really do listen to feedback. Granted, they almost exclusively look at high ranks for feedback, but they do look at some of the player base!

Edit: Several months later, game still going strong!"
3300,"This game involves deck building and strategic summoning of minions in an arena. The goal of each fight is to destroy the power tower of the enemy. The power tower is guarded by a master that can be selected beforehand. The fights are relatively short, with an average of 5 minutes each.

For me the most striking pros are:
- no pay to win
- skill and combo based strategy
- ideal for short game sessions
- no need for consistent grinding and online time
- achievements are rewarded in game
- playable in coop
- regular content and balance patches"
3301,i love this game and i still playing this game
3302,A game this is not that complex and fun
3303,"Fun game! You have a good selection of masters to choose from and some nice cosmetics/arenas/avatars that you can buy. You get in to matches quickly and they are fast paced. You can 1v1 or 2vs2, the latter being my favourite. If you haven't played the game already then it's worth a try!"
3304,Nice game
3305,Great for quick matches of 1vs1 or 2vs2. The playing cards coming to life is a nice feature.
3306,its coo
3307,"Typical russian roulette game. Solos : ur deck either beats the other deck or it doesnt.
Duos : you either get a braindead/griefing/unskilled teammate or you dont. The only thing that dictates the outcome of a game past Master rank.
Devs do not care about anything anymore just pump useless content noone asked for while the game is unplayable because of extremely imbalanced matchmaking (5-7 ranks difference between teams) and an unbelievable amount of griefers (at highest ranks as well)."
3308,Smooth gameplay.
3309,hehe Minions go BOING!
3310,"Betadwarf has decided to make it more profitable for themselves and removed all sources for free in game currency known as rubies.

The BattlePass system used to last three months. Now they last only one month. It used to be an optional thing to earn some extra copies of cards, some extra gold, some extra rubies. Now, it has turned into something necessary if you want the latest OP card to win at matches.

The Devs have gotten greedy and it is now becoming a p2w game sadly."
3311,I was master on discord :')
3312,(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ
3313,Great Game to kill time easy to learn as well
3314,really nice game

3318,I enjoy minion masters. It is fun if I only have a couple minutes to spare. The rounds are quick.
3319,"This is a game that every time you see an update you pray for it not to go wrong, and compared to last year this was a better game not greedy even with the worst store a game can ever have, and i hate how i love this game unfortunately."
3320,gooδ
3321,"✅ Minions are free
❌ Not a good master

This software has been Hooligan-certified🎖"
3322,I'm Probably 4-5 Games in now & I've won every match. its fun but I'm sure once i get higher rank all the try hards who bought Heros & Chests will wreck my day lol
3323,"Jogo divertido, um estilo diferente de cardgame, mais dinâmico e estratégico (já que além dos summons vc tem o mapa para usar na estratégia tb)"
3324,IDK WTF I'm doing LOL!
3325,"Fun, simple, fast paced, and with just enough tactics to wet the tongue."
3326,"Minion Masters blends strategy, action & card collecting in a way that enables quick matches if you're good enough (sometimes under 3 minutes), or long battles should you find a well matched opponent! My favourite feature is probably the tiers for the various types of gameplay. Unlike some other games where you find yourself quickly facing opponents who dominate you, Minion Masters lets you climb the ranks so you're always facing someone of a similar skill level.

I used to play Red Tides but the matchmaking times got far too high – I get into a Minion Masters game in under 20 seconds on average, sometimes under 5."
3327,"Minion Masters is a kind of game I don't play very often. A deck building card game. I've never been one for card games, whether they be Hearthstone or Yugi-oh. So it says a lot that Minion Masters has become one of my favourite games of all time since I first gave it a shot.

The game is rather simple.  You have cards, each of which does something different. There are main three types of these cards. A Minion, which is a unit that is placed onto the field and will automatically begin heading toward the enemy master's tower, attacking anything along the way, a spell card, which have a variety of effects from damaging enemies, to healing teammates, to moving units around on the field, and finally, buildings. Which can do a number of things, from producing units over time, to simply being turrets.

You play these cards, and whoever gets the enemy tower down to 0 health first wins. Games are often short. They can be as short as a single minute. I've never seen a game go for more than 13, and seeing one go past even 8 is uncommon.

For such a simple premise, and indeed, rather simple and relaxing gameplay, there is a lot of depth to Minion Masters. Everything from the deckbuilding, wherein you have to weigh the pros and cons of every card (often the con is that by adding one card, you cannot add another due to the limited deck slots, meaning some weakness will be left uncovered) as well as the Masters (Which provide unique spells, protect your tower and supply other boons to units) to the actual act of playing the cards, in the right places, at the right time, in order to defeat the enemy.

The balance of the game is very impressive. There are rarely cards that are considered 'too powerful', and almost never ones that are included in every deck. Even two cards which look remarkably similar, say, the Chain Lightning Vs the Fireball,  both of which are 4 mana spells primarily intended to kill groups of enemies, have just enough changes that the things they can counter can be very different.

As an example,

The fireball, dealing 170 damage in a circular area, is able to destroy units such as a Priestess, which are often set behind big units to heal them. and have 150 healthpoints. By carrying a fireball, you can ensure that the priestess is rarely able to be on the field and provide value for whatever big unit it is supporting.

Chain lightning, meanwhile, only deals 100 damage, and is thus unable to kill a priestess on it's own. But it's ability to chain over units can allow it to deal it's damage over a significantly larger area. For instance, if there are two units placed on either side of the enemy master's towers (such as two snipers), the chainlightning can hit a sniper, hit the tower, then bounce to the second sniper, providing massive value. The fireball, in that same scenario, wouldonly be able to hit a single sniper, and the tower, which could be an unfavourable trade, depending on the type of sniper unit.

Of course, you could carry both of these cards. But the cost of that would be having to sacrifice another unit in order to do so, or risk having two cards in your 4 card hand that are not suitable for playing at any point, depending on the enemy's strategy.

The game's balance is not perfect, of course. There have been units that are too strong, strategies that are too unstoppable. A recent one that was nerfed back into line was the card Ting, Teng, Tung. A ranged unit that could deal incredible damage to a single target, and would have it's attacks bounce to a second target, allowing them to annihilate both powerful and grouped units with ease, as well as handle units (such as a priestess) hiding behind a bigger, tankier unit. At the same time, the card was also tanky, not very expensive, and had synergy with other cards that would allow it to become even stronger. This card would often take the place of other, similarly priced ranged units, such as the Succubus. But even in that unbalanced state, the variety of decks was high, with the other 9 cards in one's deck often being different strategies. And of course, TTT was nerfed into a reasonable level, and now it is once again a give and take decision, deciding between a Succubus and TTT.

The community of minion masters is also extremely friendly and welcoming. I have spent no doubt more time immersed in the streams of community members than I have even in the game, and while not everyone is a shining beacon of positivity, most community members, even at the highest levels of play, are happy to help out new players.

Now, one of the major concerns one has about a free to play game like Minion Masters is the cost. And I can reliably say that, if you don't want to... you don't have to spend a penny in the game. Cards and Masters are very easy to get your hands on, and often there will be giveaways in streams or from Betadwarf themselves giving away extra boons. Unlike other, similar games, there is no in game benefit to spending excess currency on things. Once you have a card, it is as strong as it is for anyone else. You can rank it up, but this only provides additional progress towards the battle pass. The battle pass is perhaps the only sort-of exception to this rule. There are seasons in the game wherein new cards are added. By spending rubies (the premium currency) you get access to a premium version of it, where you can access these new cards (and other goodies, like in game currency and copies of old cards) faster. One card per season is only accessible to premium battle pass purchasers until the end of that season. This is rarely a problem, however. as the balance of the game virtually assures that even the strongest cards can be countered.

BetaDwarf is a very generous indie company who communicates often with their fans about things like this as well. While I said earlier that not giving them a penny was very possible and easy.. I would recommend supporting them wholeheartedly.

Of course, you can make your own decisions. The game is free! There's no reason not to give it a try."
3328,"Good with the potential to be great, but everybody uses the same 2 or 3 builds"
3329,kinda fun.
3330,just downloaded and have enjoyed it so far.
3331,good game
3332,fun
3333,"Feels like Hearthstone but with a moba feel, pretty fun hopefully as the game goes on the unit variety and heroes stand out."
3334,"Minion Masters is a relaxing game because each round has a short duration. I never spend money on it because there isn't a paywall to things that matter. So far I don't see it as pay2win game but if that changes, probably I will find something else to spend time."
3335,me likey
3336,hot
3337,Nice Co-op . Its pretty addictive game !
3338,"I used to be a regular peasant, now I'm a [spoiler]minion master[/spoiler]!"
3339,"fun, fast paced matches with alot of fun :D"
3340,fun
3341,"I miss wood tier, it was my favorite place"
3342,"It's like Clash Royale, but better. Hopefully when it gets to 2.0 it will give the user base a shot in the arm and have better balance of users."
3343,Great game.
3344,"Used to be great, now developers/CMs are abandoning ship and the game has become entirely monetized with huge imbalances. Stay far away."
3345,Its pretty cool
3346,bessgameva
3347,"Great to play alone or with a friend. Easy to put down, easy to come back too. Plenty of variety for your own customized experience."
3348,"Very fun game to play with friends, highly recommend it for people that wants to play co op games"
3349,fun and no p2w
3350,"A great game, fun to play and pretty addicting"
3351,"Great game somewhat similar to Clash Royale.

🔷️ 1v1, 2v2 & premade 2v2 leaderboards. 
🔷️ Premade 2v2 where you don't have to lock to a partner
🔷️ Plenty of units & factions which you can mix up in your deck
🔷️ Various modes & challenges
🔷️ Frequent updates"
3352,Cool beans!
3353,cool
3354,"Like Clash Royale, but actually good and with user-friendly monetisation."
3355, .
3356,"Fun game to play as a deck builder strategy implementation game.  You need to first pick your deck, then implement your deck using either a defensive, offensive, or balanced strategy.  Upgrading cards is not as relevant as to speed of cards and power. Though if you play team,,, your deck may not work as well against opposition if your partners deck doesn't mesh with yours well. Overall a cute fun quick match game."
3357,p2w
3358,"Pretty fun core gameplay loop, the 2v2 matches are really fun"
3359,i unlocked every skrat card in the game. I felt like a god
3360,GAPING MOOOOOUTH
3361,"The game is fun until you get to a point where the game has been out long enough that everyone has too high of cards or you have to P2W and get cars. The hero is not really important if you buy the cards, very similar to any P2W game."
3362,Fast games and loads of fun
3363,"I have put over a thousand hours into this. By far the most of any game (maybe Overwatch is close...). But my point is... 1000 hours..........on a FREE game. The game is perfection in my book :) I have also bought the odd gem bundle (which is not required) just to support the devs. Also, it's the perfect game to have a.....smoke....whilst playing lol"
3364,"The game is unplayable, devs never fixed the issues for years, new bugs showed up, now I can't even log-in anymore and the devs won't answer, they're too busy removing the rubies to force us to pay to play the game. It took them two years to figure out they couldn't double the grind to remove us rubies, now that they noticed it, they stop answering and dealing with problem to prevent us farming them at all, they learned nothing, fixed nothing, and burn people's graphic cards.

What's the worst, is that I really enjoyed this game, but they did nothing to make it playable or fix it, and now that they have the ""promised patch"", they're deaf to everything else, stay away, they're too sure of themselves to realise what they,re actually doing, and don't hesitate to harm the playability of the game. I used to love this game, now I can't even play at all and devs look around doing nothing.

Edit : Looks like their approach is worsenning, they try to integrate realism to the game and tweak the overall meta, don't consider the chat as part of the lobby anymore and try on enforcing overall positivity under ban treats, the game feel empty because it mostly is, everyone is bored and play the most cheasy decks possible all day long, the combination of those last two factor make trying to build new decks an obnoxious and repetitive task to ""make new leaderboard decks"", and the worse part yet... it makes me feel like I'm loosing my time, wich defeat the purpose of any video game, they're slowly but surely dying, and even without that they're losing their identity, maybe trying to qualify as an Esport competitive game who know?"
3365,Cool game and fun i am mucho skillo in it
3366,"downloaded the game, never played similar before, played the shit out of it for a weekend +1 or 2 days, actually got grand champion on the other hand everything below play probably is bots so go get your winstreak dopamine."
3367,i like it really big
3368,"Easy to learn, good graphics and mechanics, fast-paced but not too stressful strategy."
3369,the game is sadly pay to win its fine from wood - gold then you will meet people who have a pay for legendary cards. i think in higher rank you will need to have a bank in your wallet to win the game
3370,"Kekkedi kekkat get it.
Good game"
3371,"very fun
love the game"
3372,Fun game for people that like card collecting and teamwork with a friend.  Lots of options to the game and a very generous reward system will have you hooked fairly quickly.
3373,REALLY ADDICTIVE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
3374,best game so far
3375,"A very enjoyable experience for deck building fans, reminiscent of phone apps for the familiar game type. Quite enjoyable with versatility in the cards."
3376,"this is the most fun and killing time game keep it up Minon Masters team
"
3377,Playing with friends in any game is always fun. This one was no exception :)
3378,Fast paced card game/ tower defense. I like the variety of cards and masters. Makes every match different.
3379,"This game made me a racist. I win most of my games against europeans, but lose all of them against chinese. cant help but think that every chinese player is a cheater. uninstalled."
3380,"Summon minions and they go pew pew, good fun"
3381,best game ever!
3382,really chill and funny game to play when i wanna relax from being crushed in valorant
3383,"Been years, they still haven't fixed how their report button move as they load the option to load a replay...  Bad UI design allows toxic players to get off scott free... this is unacceptable.

It is infuriating that they have watch reply popup where the report teammate button is. It is asinine and until it is fixed I will no longer recommend this game as the games design is griefing you so you can't report a griefer.

Brief review update relative to the latest patch: WildCards are back in 2v2's and they decided to go the most labor intensive, dangerous if not done in consideration with the community, and welcome route of limiting banning certain wildcards. Will be interesting to see if they ban certain wildcard combinations. It simply goes to show despite the unacceptable route of not adding keybindings, they are willing to listen to the community and propose meaningful changes.

Fun for short bursts... normally not a fan of card games... they made the game less free awhile ago but it is still pretty free, especially if you win 9 games every 3 days on average in any non-Mayhem PvP mode. I do not know any other game as free to play as this game for the genre and even in general for F2P games, which is what I respect them for and got me to throw money at at before it was even out of Early Access and I'd still throw money at it as it is easily worth 10-20 bucks considering the time I have in it... They seem to have a wise business acumen by not overdoing making it less free, as it was arguably overly free before. The changes made it so that one feels less pressured to login daily, which is a plus... they want you to have fun, not to treat the game like a chore. I am surprised at how cheap the heroes/champions are gold-wise (at least when they are on sale gold-wise). I think if anything should be paid or grindy to buy with gold it should be those...

The only thing that people might try to argue makes it play to win is legendary cards... but look at top players decks (it is easy to do in game), most if not all of their cards are not legendary... just play in short bursts and as time goes on you'll discover that you have a kickass array of cards, that let you play how you want, at your disposal. 

To reiterate, if you are a new player your deck will likely suck and you should just play a little bit, level in all the game modes that you can to maximize swag... and repeat until you can acquire the cards you want or rng the cards you wan (via spending gold on power tokens)t. Play once every 3 days to maxmize gold and do the missions."
3384,They keep changing the game to suit the developer's needs to squeeze out what little they can from the ~1500 players that actually still play this game.
3385,"I like that this game has good points of strategy with the cards it offers but is also fast paced enough to not get stagnant.
I feel that you should have the option to use gold you gain to buy new masters but we'll see how things go."
3386,It's good.
3387,"Simple, quick, streamlined. The main UI screen is too cluttered, but that's legit my only real criticism."
3388,nice game
3389,Fun and funny!
3390,"the game is fun if u play solo but once u play team battles you will remember why are you playing games in the first place 
ESCAPING THIS SHITTY HUMANITY - but unfortunately they follow you here and in all multiplayer games so that's understandable what's not understandable is the game devs leaving this behaviour and system run free :) 
you see this what happens ( a shitty human deliberately disconnect or summon 0 cards when they play with you ) why you ask ? because humans lol 
and the game have the shittiest system i've ever seen - they don't call it ( hey it's impossible to win this alone so let's end this match ) nooooo you must go through the torture and watch while you lose points :) awesome !"
3391,hmm
3392,ok
3393,Awesome waste of time! Hidden gem I literally accidently started playin because dad downloaded it instead of Mythgard so we figured we would boot it it. Now its 3 in the morning and me and dad are very tired but still playin... lmao. Quickly got 5 bux outta me.
3394,I really love this game. It's so good! I suck at smite so i play this. Sometimes I get really mad at this too but I love it so much.
3395,"Has been really good playing this game. Played from approx summer 2019 into early winter 2020 with the updates always keeping the gameplay fresh. Masters different enough to make startegies diverse enough accordingly. And fun as hell to troll bossy teammates who demand you put units in one specific place (hover over specific area as if gonna place and after they play their unit put yours the opposite end). Game is headed to P2W though however so think game has passed its best days, dunno why they even have rubies now might as well just call it debit card 'credits'. Fun while it lasted and hope the team use what they learned to make an even better game in future. No sour grapes at all its just time to call it a day from me, I have actually paid for content on this free to play game as it is very fun at its core its just getting too much like something I dont feel comfortable with now."
3396,this game is cool when you have friends. unlike me.
3397,"Relaxing Game
"
3398,"Pretty fun so far, it's card building with tower defense. The effects look great and the game play is fun. I hope it progresses past the simple lay down a tank with a ranged behind it at some point. Still early in the game though."
3399,"Played over 15 hours so far, too often has this game disconnected in the mid of a pvp battle. This is a game where 90% of the content is pvp and it's absolutely unplayable."
3400,I dont actually dont play it
3401,Fantastic game. So much fun. Super easy to learn.
3402,The game started out great then they decided to do this thing called an economy rebalance and the game has now became pay to win. stay away from this game the devs have became toxic.
3403,"Fun, casual game with decent strategy concepts."
3404,"I have 112 hours in minion masters alongside many great and fun memories generated with this game, but unfortunately they changed the current structure of the free economy and generating what little bit of premium currency you can while playing. I'm 100% against this as this makes the game heavily P2W without the free players being to have more ways of generating different currency to purchase cards and be able to keep up with big spenders. Unfortunately this game will now become heavily P2W, free players have little ways of being able to now purchase cards and or champions in game without spending  real money. hindering population and not making the game enjoyable any longer for any new players

I believe they need to make money like everyone else. but one frustrating part of minion masters over my time of playing was champion skins was never available during shop or I would've bought quite a few to support my favorite game. they never had emotes or many things during shop to purchase, which really didn't incentivize me to spend any money towards the game. they could've simply redesigned the shop and offered rotations of champion skins and or cool new ones just kinda like fortnite and many other games, they could of had more arena options to purchase ones that are super crazy and out of this world looking. they could've added more interactive emotes and more ways to troll your enemys. they could've even taken it a step further by doing customer skins and weapons to your favorite minion masters card. different colors.. instead they decided to be lazy and destroy F2P player appeal/ progression and cater to big spenders. 

I pray you guys make better choices in the future as this choice is definitely not it."
3405,It's pretty fun if you like lane control games.
3406,"This is a fun game.  Very akin to speed chess.  While this does detract from the cerebral nature of the strategies involved, it is still fun.  The game is VERY card dependent and does not offer a chance to out think your opponent, but there is plenty of opportunity to make strategic mistakes.  Essentially your strategy involves troop placement and spell casting, all combat is done by automaton. My main dislike is that you level up very fast, so inevitably end up fighting people with decks that far outweigh yours until you lose enough to get back to your level of cards.  This is an obvious ploy to make you purchase more cards as the higher ones can't really be won.  It is definitely geared more towards making money for the developer than giving good game play.  All that being said, it's good for a few quick matches (and they are QUICK).  Definitely doesn't hold a candle to pinnacles of the genre like KARDS, but I'd give it a 6.9 out of 10 (whereas KARDS I would give a solid 9.0)

3407,very nice

I can’t really talk about the game current state since I stopped playing way back (I played until I had my fill) but I still would recommend Minion Masters if someone asked. It’s surprisingly easy to pick but challenging enough to keep you busy and it’s f2p so all you are losing in case you don’t like it’s a couple hours of your time.

[h1] Español: [/h1] 
No podría hablarte del estado actual del juego en cuanto balance / jugadores ya que hace buen rato que no lo toco, pero definitivamente lo recomendaría si alguien me pregunta. En un principio lo descargue por aburrimiento y termine dedicándole cerca de 100 horas.

Sin dudas es un juego entretenido, fácil de entender y con la suficiente dificultad para mantenerte enganchado durante un buen rato. Si quieres probarlo, adelante, a lo sumo estas perdiendo unas cuantas horas de tu tiempo, después de todo es un juego F2P.
"
3411,typos galore lol
3412,Fast paced game with lots of action. Love it!
3413,"Great game, but like 2020, everything dies.

Trash devs; childish chat moderators."
3414,"[h1] this was one of my favorite games [/h1]
Untill developers decide to make it more profitable for them selves and removed all sources for free in game currency known as rubies, in new update all the ways to earn rubies by playing is removed and now you have to spend money to have them.
[b] why it is a big deal? [/b] because they release season pass and in every season pass there is exclusive cards so if you don't own them you don't get the access to new released cards so your opponents have advantage ([u] however after the season has ended you can purchase them but there is an infinitive loop of cards that you can never have unless you pay money [/u]) well... i call it an step toward making the game pay to win.
and i have to mention that earning all cards in this game requires lot's of time playing and grinding. (however you could have them by paying instantly).

over all... can't really blame Devs because they need to make money (totally understandable) but their approach for making money is not the best, i hope they rethink it at some point and always remember having people playing your game is much better than earning some bucks and the game eventually dies..."
3415,"Awesome quick to learn, Beast of a game!"
3416,"I have played this game a lot...almost every day since it came out. It is a fun game, but I cannot recommend it any longer. The battlepass system used to last three months...now they last only one month. It used to be an optional thing to earn some extra copies of cards, some extra gold, some extra rubies. Now, it has turned into something necessary if you want the latest OP card to win at matches. Yes you can win without the OP flavor of the month, but it really does make the game unfair.

Now, Betadwarf has decided to stop handing out rubies...a savvy player could play a little every day and earn enough to buy the battlepass each month...now they are taking away the rubies and basically saying that if you want the OP card of the month, you need to pay $10 a month for it. 

Sorry, this is a good game, but it does not offer enough content to be worth $10 a month. Essentially, you must pay that to remain competitive to earn that special OP card each month. And especially since I have already spent $60 in this game buying the all masters pack, a newbie pack, and some rubies for skins.

3417,quick easy to understand game and the fact that you can play with friends makes it SO awesome
3418,"Fast paced, well balanced game and matchmaking."
3419,Entertaining
3420,I like this game because it's free and I am a poor boi
3421,Addictive and fun with friends
3422,"Quite a good game, but the Devs have gotten greedy and it is now becoming a p2w game sadly.
If it wasn't for the recent economy changes I would recommend it, not anymore though."
3423,"been playing with sister, it's pretty fun!"
3424,Great free to play game
3425,Rubbish mobile game.
3426,"After many hours of playing this game it is still my favourite. With a growing competitive scene and the announced release of Minion Masters 2, I am optimistic about its future. Sure there are a lot of problems, including some things being unbalanced (*cough* wild cards *cough*) but overall I think its the best free to play card game around"
3427,Game is a big meh.
3428,THIS GAME GUD
3429,"so addictive, need some improvement in customization heroes xD"
3430,Only thing I would change would be the ability to share or trade cards with friends
3431,Game is perfect if you like Mobile games of the kind (Clash Royale or WWII Road to Valor).
3432,"I've been playing this game on and off for quite a while. While I'm not a top player I'm not a total casual and I think I have a decent grasp of the game. For quite a while it's been my comfort game - something quick and fairly simple I used to play when I needed a short distraction.

Genre-wise this is a deck-building/strategy hybrid (aka Clash Royale clone). You create deck of cards representing units and spells and use it to battle other players. During battle spells are cast and creatures of various kinds are summoned. There's no way to give orders to your units - they just follow simple rules like this: attack nearby enemies til they die or move towards enemy tower if there are no targets nearby. Generally it uses rock-paper-scissors system: strong but slow-hitting units will be eaten alive by the swarms of small cheap creatures, swarms die to an area of effect attack and AoE attackers have little hope against hard-hitting guys.

It's not as simple as 'one thing counters this other thing' - in a match there's rarely only one threat on the board - ranged units are often hiding behind tanks, good unit combo may get destroyed by a well-placed spell, etc. There's lots of variation, special cases and gimmicks plus on top of it there are several characters that are present during whole match and have different abilities - one may shoot across the screen, another - resurrect his fallen, etc.

Overall there's a significant amount of cards and loads of viable strategies - it's possible to play balanced deck with basic cards or invent some weird combos just to have fun, both may work to great success. New stuff (like new cards and skins, emotes, etc) is added from time to time as the game is updated regularly.

The game has bunch of different modes like 2v2, pre-made 2v2, draft but nothing too ground-breaking. Some wacky singleplayer stuff akin to Hearthstone Adventures is hidden behind a paywall.

The game looks fine - it's far from being technically impressive but graphics serve its purpose - different units are easily distinguishable and it's easy to see what's going on. Some old models look dated but camera rarely shows them up close. And devs do make facelift updates for those from time to time.

Audio is ok but nothing too spectacular.

The game seem to have some technical issues - after playing for a while noticeable slowdowns start happening. It was not a big problem for me as it's possible to fix it by restarting the game but it's pretty annoying when it happens.

Now onto more controversial stuff.

For the longest time I've been hearing people calling this game pay2win. And I believe it was not really the case (I'm not sure if it still stands but more on this later). This was actually one of the most generous f2p games I've seen - new cards were easy to get, rubies (=that's the currency bought with real world money) were fairly easy to come by. It was possible to get significant amounts by getting to the high ranks every season and it's not _that_ hard - I never really went tryhard on this game but the Master (3rd highest) rank was within my reach. The game did require some time investment (like playing several games every day) to optimize daily quest completion and reward gain but getting ranks was not that big of a deal. The game does use a lot of f2p tricks like random unlocks, fear-of-missing-out pressure, season pass, etc. They did remove some of the randomness but there's still a lot of it present.

But devs feel like the game does not push players towards microtransactions and are trying to change it. For several updates they were experimenting with different incentives - for example, one of the new cards is going to be locked behind temporary paywall - free players have no access to it until the month had passed. And the last update... Oh boy, do they really try to reduce the ruby gain ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/489520/view/2933494053288575236]News link[/url]).
[b]Edit[/b]: They actually made it less awful  ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/489520/view/2917732088728846554]Another news link[/url])

And while I understand their motivation it does not sit well with me. I'm not sure if it's actually _that_ bad but I don't think it's a game for me anymore. People that are not interested in having all competitive options will probably be fine. It may even be slightly better for casual players now but for me personally it's a huge turn off. I'm a bit sad to see this game to go from 'most generous f2p i know"" to 'just like the rest of the market' but it's not like I can do anything about it, so it's time to move on.

Bottom line: not a bad choice if you're interested in a Clash Royale style game. Not sure if it's pay to win but for me personally it's a bit too much f2p pressure now.
Score: 4.5/10."
3433,"I would not recommend this ""pay to play"" game, it was already a grind fest with almost no gain, and they are rolling update that will remove even that little speck of trash that you could actually farm through playing. Game lacks absolutely everything and is just a bare bone of what it could be. You are better off playing Tetris, you would enjoy it more and the score gain there actually works :)"
3434,cant recommend a game when the devs do not listen and they come from the trump school of public relations. stay away from this hot mess
3435,"A mobilegame on pc that will eventually be developed for mobile devices as well. What a time to be alive.

Jokes aside, this game is actually quite a lot of fun.
It combines deckbuilding elements together with some strategical placement and turns it into a pretty addictive and fun game.

Its free to play, although there are dlc and cards that you can basically buy for the game.
However, you can also just use the starter deck that you get and reach all the way to the highest of ranks. The cards and decks are very well balanced and its not really pay to win.
Sometimes there are free giveaways of cards and dlc, make sure to snatch those when you can.
Also do you like being showered in rewards for not actively playing?
Every time I come back to this game I get showered in what feels like 5 min of pure pop up rewards
(I believe at the end of each season you get payed your rewards for reaching certain competetive levels and a season lasts about a month? Thus that might explain the constant rewards)


The only thing that I cant talk about so far is the UPCOMING reward changes, which aim to make the game MORE PAY TO PLAY. So that is something that might plumet the current games rating into mostly negative...
"
3436,is fun
3437,"It's a fun time waster. Not the most tactical of card based games, but there are tactics, and matches are lively and quick. Also, unlike most ""Free to play"", you can beat players with legendary cards filling their decks, if the cards don't work well together, or with the hero they have leading their army. So RNG and money may give 1 the extra opportunity to fine tune a deck with the cards they need, but not a guaranteed win.

The game is worth a try, but many people may not stick with it for long. Whether you enjoy it for a short while or years to come, you should enjoy the experience regardless."
3438,"A fun mix of real time strategy and card game. Nice, quick matches. Fair free to play model. Generally more about how you play the cards than having the best cards."
3439,"Why bother making a poll when you're going to do what you want anyways
Thank you for the fun times though, it was good while it lasted"
3440,Clash Royale but good.
3441,"Devs have started down a slippery slope.

Started charging for features that were once able to be obtained for free despite barely any new content being added worth the extra cost of admission.

Also believe the recent card changes have made the game more unbalanced, not less.

Hope the devs release a bunch of new content soon or reverse this monetization decision as I've ran out of reasons to keep spending my hard earned cash on this game now and can't really recommend it to anyone when so many other games are far superior and don't come with a monthly fee to unlock what you want."
3442,.
3443,Funnnnn!
3444,"Quick, easy to play game, very rewarding in terms of new cards!"
3445,"wish there was an option where i could just say ""meh, it's alright""

great game to play in short bursts, with long breaks in between, because it starts getting old a bit fast.
or at least for me. 
partly because it just doesn't feel like there's enough cards for wildly different play styles at this point, which was probably why I stopped playing it awhile back and found it enjoyable when I came back to it after like a year or more (more slither/zen-chi cards pls)

to people who say that this game is p2w, i've reached plat 4 without spending a single cent, it's just a lot of deck tweaking to create a viable deck. my plat 4 deck doesn't even have a single legendary card and it probably could have gone higher if I didn't get tired of trying to climb

but on the other hand, god, devs, please do improve the reporting system, it's a joke with all the many afk players messing up a duo game

LASTLY, PLEASE STOP USING TURNCOAT CARDS IN DUO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING"
3446,Fun game so far. Enjoy the pacing of the battles.
3447,Broken game with no skill needed. all you need is to drop thousands on legendary cards and you auto win.
3448,Good enjoyable game. Worth trying
3449,"Tried it again after a long break ... spent a little money and had a lot of fun ... still a play to win game.  You can have fun but you will need to spend some money if you want to progress into the higher rankings.  I give it a positive review because they are good about adding new content. Enjoyed game much better after joining a good guild.  If you play solo and do not join a guild or want to pay to get better then you will prob get frustrated. 

- - old review - -
Use to be great but will not play any more. Company got greedy. This is now a pay-to-win game. Very very sad."
3450,Best tower defense/attack game. It will test strategy through the battlefield and use a minion in your deck to prevent and push through opponents arena.
3451,good game is good
3452,it rocks
3453,"Fun deck-building / tower-defense multiplayer game. I played fanatically every day for a while until a moment when I got tired of it and haven't played for weeks or months. But for me this is one of those games that you always pick up again at some point.

Sometimes after an update / DLC release, sometimes to reap the battle-pass rewards and collect all the cards, skins and free goodies. But in most cases just because it's so damn much fun to quick and easily play a few games.

Many players have a love-hate relationship with BetaDwarf because of their decisions and changes over time, but given the game time I've accumulated since I first played this title, and since it became one of the most played games in my library, there must be something they doing right."
3454,"It's pretty good, in general. It's free, it's entertaining, it has quite high skill ceiling. I'd say give it a shot."
3455,Pretty fun and addicting! Just one more game!
3456,seems good
3457,feichang haowan
3458,fun with a friend
3459,Great game to play if you have a friend and just want to shoot s***. Very fun game!!!

3465,good
3466,"I originally had this game via Discord and was super happy when they made it easy to migrate over to Steam at no cost or hassle. Great game, I easily waste hours at a time playing"
3467,"I like mtgo as well as lol.  Team fight tactic has some elements where based on number of units different unit or terrain effects could be a thing.

Keep up the good work."
3468,"fun with friends!
"
3469,If you like games where you spawn minions in effort to out counter your opponent and take them over by strategy and sometimes OP force. Its good :D much recommend very fun. Plat currently on my way to diamond.
3470,"Eh... was a game I played faithfully most days at least for my daily achievements, sometimes for much longer.   Unfortunately the new changes make every game less about strategy based on many factors and 4 to 8 minutes to these little mini base rushes of 1 to 2 min long.     Glowing positive until now.   It's just... eh...  bad.   I'll finish out my season pass for the month."
3471,"Always loved MInion Masters. I played on Xbox for a while but then moved to PC. Shame I couldn't transfer my progress/decks etc but it was fun starting again. Nice to be able to jump in have a game then leave, however, that often doesn't happen as I can't help myself and have to have one more game....again and again"
3472,
3473,Minion masters is a fun and addictive game. The matches are quite short so if you don't have much time this would be great for you. I like how often the devs update the game and they are very generous and give you free DLC's from time to time. 👍
3474,gg
3475,"fun concept, i smell potential!"
3476,It's very enjoyable!
3477,"You play with bots a lot! Its a fun game, but it gets repetitive, in a 4,5 hours of game i did play only with bots."
3478,"If you've never played, this is the sauce with a friend."
3479,clash royale but for pc
3480,"I have only played about 8 games so far, but it plays just like clash royale, but there is more to do!  Very fun game I see myself playing for a long time."
3481,the game is very fun and its free. appricate the developer. thanks for sharing the game.
3482,addicting af
3483,Nice game!
3484,"This game is like Clash Royale, but better in some ways."
3485,hella fun.
3486,"I think that the game is super fun because you are able to unlock new minions, and the you can use strats with them on the battlefield."
3487,"So, I'm loving this game for one specific reason. It's a game that I can actually play online, even with my ping being constant dogshit. (On a good day, 200. On a average day, 400. One guess what I get on a bad day.)

Not exactly the most well-thought out reason to like something, but these days I'll take whatever I can just to break the monotony of SP game after SP game.

Also, fuck Centurylink."

3493,MM is fun if you take it lightly
3494,"Pretty simplistic game, fun and great for passing time!"
3495,its amazing
3496,"quit interresting, for the first few fights ive played. kinda like ""heartstone/shadowverse and a little bit of league of legends/heroes of storm""mix of feelings but definitly completly different in my opinion and worth playing (or at least trying) if you like one of those."
3497,Fun and relaxing game. 8/10
3498,"I find the game play and themes enjoyable. Rewarding progression and easy to navigate. Fun deck building themes. I personally love dragons and would love to see more ""tribes"" and expanded tribes even further,"
3499,:0
3500,Yes
3501,great format
3502,nice play
3503,"fix colossus. right now he has a 360 degree cleave. that's BS. also, why are prize fights only worth 50g? that's pathetic. don't bother. give us something useful or something better than 1/3 what we get for daily log in. the idea makes it feel special and then you give us literally nothing. also more quests would be nice. right now they are way too far inbetween for trying to create a user base that would play more than 5 games in a day."
3504,Best way ever to kill 5 minutes on a moments notice!
3505,great play style and really fun strats
3506,"Fun game, time killer. Simple yet delicious."
3507,ITS FUN AND CHILL

3529,"Really intuitive, seems solid F2P"
3530,kos om al developer
3531,Fun :)
3532,WAS fun
3533,The game is honestly a lot of fun. If you've played Clash Royale on mobile then you understand how to play this game.
3534,Fun card game with fast pace that was easy to get into and fun to play
3535,"Great fun so far, seems balanced at the start will write a review after I have played more."
3536,Love
3537,"It says I have only played 17 minutes. That's because I just migrated my account to Steam from Discord.
Oh God have I played MANY hours of this game.

swarm spam bad

game addictive

help"
3538,Is silly and good.
3539,;
3540,fun and simple with depth
3541,Very nice and free Heartstone like game.
3542,Clash Royale on a bigger screen. Nuff said. Unless you hate Clash Royale then I guess don't play it lol.
3543,"it has basically skaven, gg"
3544,THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME AND LOVE HOW THEY KEEP UP ON IT ADDING HEROES AND CARDS
3545,casual fun
3546,funny game
3547,"Won't lie to you it starts simple. You get your basic deck then slowly work your way up. During a match once your third perk kicking in cards start to go flying making each move count for overall victory. Note a lot of services like twitch prime tend to give out free content for the game to bolster your deck,"
3548,i like the variety of all the minions u get to use. but i would like if they kinda added more champs since there is only like 10 to choose from. or maybe add some secret minions to use. like maybe some kind of voodoo witch or maybe a huge dinosaur. other then that its pretty good for what u get. some real intense matches can happen with it.
3549,gud - free
3550,great game easy to play
3551,Can I get a hellllllllllll yeahhhhhh brotherrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
3552,i love this game so much
3553,"LOVE THIS GAME!
"
3554,yes
3555,it's game is AWSOME just AWSOME!!!!!!!! :3 :0 :)
3556,"what may seem like a simple clash royale knock-off is actually pretty fun
"
3557,This game is so addictive and fun! The matches are normally fast paced which makes you think I will have just one more game and before you know it hours have passed! I am enjoying it very much and I recommend anyone to try it. I mean it's free so what do you have to lose? :)
3558,its fun so fare
3559,"In beginning is too easy but once u start to climb in rank it becomes interesting, not addictive, I don't see myself playing it for years, just from time to time, it is fun. The chat and how the game force you to add ppl ""as friend"" through Steam is so bad, to response a whisper there is no shortcut as /r like most games"
3560,000
3561,"Simple, easy to learn. Hard to master. Much to learn. It's great if you want a fairly short game time as well."
3562,"Enjoyable RTS defense game, matches last anywhere from a minute to 8 on the high end. Can enjoy the game without paying, but there is payment to unlock content. The content behind the pay wall is not needed to enjoy the game, nor does it give you any kind of major edge, a well built deck between two players who play their cards well is far more important."
3563,"i dont often like pvp arena style games, but this is great. i like playing a brute deck, and it really is evenly balanced against the mage decks for once."
3564,"I don't know what it is about this game but, once you start playing it's hard to stop?! 

GG"
3565,Amazing games! its really fun once you get past the first fights and i am enjoying it
3566,fun
3567,"THIS GAME IS TOO GOOD, I STARTED PLAYING TODAY CAUSE TWITCH GAVE ME A CODE RIGHT? EVEN THOUGH THE CODE DOESN'T WORK IDK WHY, THIS GAME MAKES UP FOR IT, FRIENDLY PEERS ON THE CHAT, JUST JOINED A GUILD, THE MATCHES ARE SUPER FUN AND STRATEGIC. I RECOMMEND THIS TOO EVERYONE

3577,"A fun TD deck builder.  Gold is a little slow to earn, but other than that, pretty solid and fun."
3578,This game is addictive! Love it! Frequent updates keep the game fresh!
3579,Fun game so far. Fast rounds
3580,fun so far.
3581,"The announcer alone makes this worth a play.

Find a friend, duos can be hilarious as well."
3582,Fun and easy to learn.
3583,.
3584,"Great game when you just need a few minutes to unwind. Easy progression without having to pay anything, but reasonable prices if you want to spend money. Slightly pay to win if you drop a bunch of money and get good cards, but same could be said about games like Hearthstone and Magic Arena."
3585,"not bad fun game , ez and simple !"
3586,It's fun.
3587,"I enjoyed this game, for a free to play its well made."

3591,fun game
3592,"top 500 players in duo que playing with smurfs (silver / gold) accounts with maxed cards allmost all gold frames. destroys the game since you start playing them at platinum, dont bother with this game until developers fixes some sort of max rank differnece in matchmaking. also the report bugg feature is not working in the game and I cant report that since it broken. just like the matchmaking system but not as bad."
3593,"i ve played much with clash royale it is very same, i like that you have many kind of king."
3594,"Muito bom, simples, porém muito bom vale a pena conferir."
3595,Games Garbage. Sorry
3596,imagine making every DLC free for a limited time when they get released
3597,"Game is not entry level friendly unless you plan on dropping a couple hundred dollars. I have been playing since it was first released (back since milloween was released) trust me when I tell you the only reason I still play is because I had tenure saved up. First of all they ""redid"" the entire game causing me to lose legendary cards, cards I had no lifed to unlock.

Then the ""power tower"" is the biggest load of garbage I have ever seen. I'm talking EA loot box levels of utter BS. The only way to get good cards is to spend hundreds of thousands of coins to get cards that are the same so you can get a miserable 20 crystals. A legendary costs 2000.

Then... They also made that a challenge by making cards have ""tiers"" so now you don't get crystals right away if they are doubled, oh no no no... you get crystals added to your TIERS! but then... then after you get to TIER 3 and MAX IT OUT because you don't just get there no no you need to fill the bar. After all that, then you get the 20 piss poor crystals.

Ah the Store... It offers one guaranteed Legendary. Oh... does it give you a Legendary that is a Meta? No no no, it gives you a Legendary that has been outdated for over year.

Don't get me started on the ""new"" Season Pass... You see where this trend is going? 

At this point the management behind the game should just make a mobile game since the same psychology involved in creating mobile game addicts is involved in this game.

Just recently they ""updated"" again... The trend continues. PLAY AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. SALT MINE MASTERS."
3598,fun game
3599,fun
3600,"Just played through, the first bit and yes, its fun and card combo packed!"
3601,"After playing this game for 10 Hours I feel like I know enough about the game to make a positive review. So I played with a Friend of mine and then we jumped straight into the Duo Ranked system, We climbed straight to Platinum so I speak with Semi-Experience. The game is interesting and very refreshing at first, But then quickly becomes repetitive and everything just seems almost the same, only difference is slight card changes and opponents. There's a lack of deck building depth as well as rushing tactics seem to work better than the turtle tactics, Not sure what can actually balance this though unfortunately. But I would totally recommend to anyone to try this game out! Perhaps it's what they're searching for :)"

3616,simple fun game

3618,Solid game you can play for free. It's definitely fun with a premade friend.
3619,FUN TO PLAY
3620,Fucking addicting as hell
3621,"So - They MAKE you believe you play aganist real persons ( you are NOT) Until Gold 1 you get presented victory way to easy. Then you hit the point where they will throw some unkillable enemies in the ring ( yes, they are not real as well) SO you buy some items and packs to win aganist them."
3622,cool!
3623,"clash royale but a little bit better
"
3624,very good
3625,"fun fun fun. add me
"
3626,"PROS: The definition of free to play. Currently I have unlocked [b] A LOT [/b] Of the content in the game, with [b] A LOT [/b] of in game currency banked. This game does not require any amount of money to be good, as you can view the top rated players in the world and the cards in their deck are either starter, or [u] extremely [/u] easy to obtain. The reward system is more than fair.

it feels rewarding to make good plays, the units, ragdolls, masters, announcer (a little annoying), are great. frequent updates, nerfs and buffs, that at least make logical sense even if you don't agree with them.

you will be frequently showered with rewards that even to a point get annoying because you get so many of them (you'll see what i mean)

CONS: the guild system is a little flawed, you will find that if you are inactive in a guild you will be kicked from almost any of them, because there is a system in place that rewards weekly activity. (conquest) and obviously if you are inactive you can't participate.

at a lower level you will be fighting bots. i believe the developers have said that there are no bots in multiplayer in the game, but that feels like a lie, it feels that there are bots in the lower levels because of lack of players at the lower levels, because  its so easy to rank up and get out of the lower ranks. (maybe they can clear this up) 

TLDR: i would recommend this game. it is free to download, so why not give it a shot?

EDIT: i would recommend reading top negative reviews as well"
3627,Really fun tug of war game
3628,"Older review: Very fun and updated game, even if it was $5 I would recommend, but it's free!  No reason not to besides hard drive space.  The matchmaking/ranking system seems pretty good most of the time.  The game play is fun and stays fresh with all the regular updates.  There is some ability to pay for more stuff, but you can still build it all for free, just slower.
UPDATED: Last patch in December of 2020 removed the daily free spin that gave free players at least a chance at keeping up with the ruby economy to get the season pass and be ranked fairly in conquest battle's glory contribution to guilds.  Once this mechanic was removed it became pay to win, so I will no longer recommend this game.  Used to be a good free game, sad."
3629,seem interesting
3630,it hits the spot
3631,Honestly one of the most underrated games very unique and fun gameplay i feel anyone could enjoy.
3632,Very fun game to just sit down and relax to. Free to play as well
3633,"Extremely buggy, and nearly unplayable quite a lot of the time. Between the random disconnects and just full on broken client, this game has aggravated me to no end. I had to leave this review after I turn on the game and find that all my decks and cards were gone. 2/10, only play this game once or twice if you can get it to work, and ONLY if you are incredibly drunk."
3634,"Easy To get into, easy to play. Fun mechanics that does not require money to enjoy."
3635,Awesome! keep up with the good work it s one hell of a game!
3636,"They somehow sent me a pop-up notification through the Steam UI, reminding me of one of their events, and the game wasn't even installed... I checked to see if there were left-over files from when I uninstalled the game, I checked my app data folders, nothing. No idea how they managed to advertise to me like that, but I've never had it happen before.

I wonder if Steam allows that sort of use of its platform."
3637,"Very awesome game, in love with it. I've been playing clash royale mobile game for years and this is better!"
3638,+
3639,"this game patch is in the rare lull where there are MANY viable and satisfying meta decks for both nubs and contenders.

review update 06/2022

The raging comments speak in absolutes. The exceptions are abundant to the point their opinion is invalid, driven by poor luck when playing the most luck-driven parts of the game (2v2s with a specialised deck)."
3640,"A cool take on real-time card games.  Reinforcing and countering units is intuitive, so it gives you a tennis-like back-and-forth without being overwhelming or obtuse."
3641,yes
3642,A+++
3643,Tons of fun!
3644,fun but repetitive
3645,aa
3646,"the first 20 games are fun, but once you hit gold rank, the matchmake is complete garbage. literly unplayable at that point"
3647,"Enjoyable. 
It does well to reward builds while still being casual. Plus, it can be a great short game to play with friends."
3648,"Clash Royale Rip off, but its actually good lol"
3649,"Fast matches, low barrier of entry."
3650,"Has good balance between the cards, DO NOT NEED THE PAY TO WIN, so that's really nice."
3651,excellent deck building strategy game and lots of fun
3652,it's a fast paced card battler of minions vs other minions to wear  down opposing player. think magic the gathering but more action intense.
3653, great
3654,"sweet game love it

"
3655,good
3656,simple and fun
3657,Clear and easy HUD. Deck combos get exciting.
3658,Only played for a little bit so far. Enjoying the ease of entry. Definitely seems like there is going to be some depth as you learn the game. Good quick game play. Amusing commentary in game.
3659,Fun game for what it is. Lots of different cards/decks to play
3660,I've always wanted to play a simple and fun strategy game and this is the perfect combo. I've enjoyed every second!
3661,This is fun so far.  It's free so you can't lose to try it. Clash royal and hearthstone mix.
3662,"Tried a few games but it seemed too easy. I asked the community if I am playing against bots, and they confirmed.
Put a separate ""Play against AI"" option if you will, but don't waste my time with attempts to make me believe as if I am playing real people! ""searching for an opponent"" yea right..."
3663,"The recent patch fucked the games timing, mobs now turn off the tower randomly. This game is completely shit and nothing more then a waist of time. Do not play this!!!!!"
3664,RELAXING.
3665,"good
"
3666,"Good fun game, Easy to learn however watch out for the trolls trying to ruin multiplayer games!"
3667,great game with variety of strategy and increasingly new additional characters that brings and ever changing nature to the game
3668,simple and relatively easy. good to chill and watch tv with
3669,"Impressively fun, multi-player is the same, and I really enjoy grinding this game out. I highly recommend this game, it is pretty much exactly what you expect, keeping in mind it uses a card system, however the ""minions,"" and the combat are all completely animated."
3670,"As light, fluffy mobile-game-alikes go, it's good!  It's the go-to drunken game - very little thought required, and we just don't care if we lose.  

Send waves of minions based on cards at the opposition, and try to smash their leaders before that happens to you.

There's some strategy in there, but honestly, you really don't need much beyond a few cards that play the way you like"
3671,Enjoying it so far! Seems to be a neat pass time!
3672,"Addicting game play, good graphics, and it feels rewarding so far."
3673,Amazing!
3674,s'good
3675,"Fun, simple, and runs well on slower computers"
3676,this is a very chill game to play with your friends
3677,Nice game
3678,Better than Crash Royale
3679,fast paced action
3680,Very good. Very fun. Very addictive.
3681,yes
3682,...
3683,Great game. Quick games and it seems like lots of players.
3684,Simple to understand.  Interesting gameplay so far!
3685,"It's an extremely fun game with competitive aspects. The game used to be in the perfect sweet spot with the streamer connectivity, for some reason unknown to me this was removed and severely hurt the game as a whole. 

Season passes used to last for 3 months at a time which incentivized minor spending and long term play, this was also recently downgraded to 30 days at a time but remained the same price... I assume this is to try and generate revenue with a smaller player base after losing a large portion of streamers. 

Also as a result of the smaller player base the higher elo matchmaking is getting worse, once you hit master you are regularly qued up against some of the top 20 players in the whole game which makes it feel a bit unfair.

Still fun and I regularly play with friends but most people I've talked to have been mentioning it feels like it's going downhill."
3686,"Let me start by saying that this game is so rigged, manipulative and can be dangerous to people with gambling problems or really bad O. C. D. so, people with less self-control should not be playing this game in my honest opinion.
You can play solo in 1v1, with random people in 2v2 Team Battle, with a friend in a Premade Team Battle, in Guild Premade Battle or create custom matches. You can also purchase Adventures to play against AIs that try too hard to make you feel like the game has a story. You can always Challenge same bots to try out different decks and your new experiments before playing against real players. I must say that this game is not Pay-to-Win in any way as of now, which is great but I did spend a lot of money on it, mostly for cosmetics.

[h1]The Matchmaking[/h1]

There are 10 ranks in total, Wood, Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grand Master and Contender. You mostly play with bots until you reach Bronze rank, even in Team Battle. But the matchmaking is so rigged and carefully designed to make the player feel accomplished or spend money on the game. Let me give some examples. You can get a long win streak if you're a decent player but in Draft or Mayhem, the game will put you against players that are way higher than you when it comes to ranks and are probably much better and competitive players too - after you get at least 4 wins, just to make you lose or want to think that you were so close to get 12 wins, maybe another try would be worth the money. The Tri-Team Tourney is rigged so much as well. Your key drop rate will start to get really low if you're winning too much but if you lose a lot of matches on purpose, the game will most likely put you against a dumb bot or a poor player and make that a Prize Fight to make you feel good.
Also, the matchmaking is sometimes so unfair, if you win a Prize Fight or rank up, chances are that you'll most likely have to fight someone who is 2-3 ranks higher than you. I have had so many matches where the game had put me against Grand Masters or Contenders while my solo rank was only Platinum. This is a good strategy to make the player lose unfairly, if they are winning too many matches.
Worse thing about the matchmaking is that the developers never admit that their game has bots. We know that you play against bots in the very early levels, in a few fights as a tutorial but I'm not talking about that. From Bronze to Platinum, you can find so many obvious bots, especially in Bronze where your opponent has a Legendary Arena, Skin and Card(s) but plays like poop just to make you win and feel better, keep playing etc. I'm fine with bots, what bothers me is that the developers refuse to tell people that they use bots, people are not that dumb, just one .dll file can expose everything and did actually expose everything at one point.
All that being said, the game is good and really fun to play when the matchmaking is fair. I'm not the one to care about winning or losing if the matchmaking is fair and when a Platinum player is not getting matched against a Contender.

[h1]Rigged Power Tower / Tokens[/h1]

There are 4 kinds of cards you can get, Common, Rare, Supreme and Legendary. The game has more than 200 cards, so you'll most likely get access to a lot of different cards early enough. But once you progress enough in the game, your drop rate will get rigged. You'll keep getting Common or Rare cards only and copies of the cards you already have. If you stop playing the game for a week or so, you'll start getting so many Supreme and Legendary cards all of a sudden, when you come back. This is just another trick to hold on to the player. Since I have all of the available cards at the moment, I don't see much problem with it and can't tell how it affects new players.

[h1]Moderation Team[/h1]

Some of the moderators are fair, some don't even do anything, some just join the trolls and some like to abuse their power. One time, I was fighting spam with spam which was wrong and I did get a fair warning for that but just after a few minutes, I got another warning from that same moderator for being toxic in the chat. I don't know what his definition of toxicity is but I know that I was not toxic. He said that he can issue a time-out for me, I thought it would be risky to respond to him. That was my first warning at level 138, if I remember correctly. I think I quit the game just to be safe because I did not want to receive a ban.

[h1]Developers[/h1]

As I said before, the developers keep saying that the game doesn't have any bots while it clearly does have a lot of bots and almost everything is carefully rigged. I'm fine with bots but I don't like it when the development team refuse to tell players the truth. They also like to blame Valve a lot when they fail to release a bug-fix, patch or an update. I do like the fact that almost all of the developers that I have encountered in the chat are friendly and know how to take a joke, unlike the moderation team.
I have spent so much money on this game, you can buy several AAA games with the money that I have spent on this game. But, when I needed help, I did not get any help from the developers. I did send them several emails but did not get any responses. I once asked a developer in the chat about it and gave him my email address, he said that they did get all my emails and at least he was honest enough to admit that they did not respond to any of my emails for whatever reason. People can get help quickly if they use Steam Discussions or their official Discord but ignoring emails of players is a poop move.
They are slow learners when it comes to listening to what the player-base want in the game. This is a complex game to develop, I know that but there's also no ignoring the fact that in every single update, they had screwed up the game real nice for everyone. They do try to fix it but it takes time and several patches and tweaks to balance stuff out. Their English version of the game had so many errors and typos for such a long period of time. Whenever they release a new content, people always seem to find an easy way to exploit the game and win, everyone does that and I don't blame the players, I blame the developers for not testing stuff before releasing an update and not listening to the player-base. From the last update, I can tell that things have improved and let's just hope that they keep improving. It is definitely worth mentioning that if you subscribe to their newsletter, you can get redeemable codes for the game every month and most of the time when they release a DLC on Steam, it is usually free for a few days which is awesome and it increases the player-base.

[h1]The Season Pass[/h1]

Every Season Pass lasts for about 1 month. This game used to feel like Pay-to-Win but now, literally nothing is Pay-to-Win in this game. Although, they are clearly running out of new card ideas and the price of the paid Season Pass is not worth it at all in my opinion unless you're looking to get a Legendary Skin or an emote or avatar that you really like. You can get all the new cards from the free pass that you get if you just play enough. Once you reach the last tier of the Season Pass, there is no point in playing in my opinion, if you did not pay. If you did pay for the Season Pass, the rewards are so poop after you reach the last tier of the Season Pass which is usually 50. You can get up to tier 150+ if you play daily for just a few hours but the rewards for each tier is just awful. At least the game is not Pay-to-Win at all as of writing this review.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I used to like this game a lot but now I'm slowly losing interest in it because of the matchmaking system. I did spend a ton of money on this game but have never heard back from the support team when I needed help even though it was confirmed that they are receiving my emails.This is a really fun and addicting game in spite of all of the negative things I said about it."
3687,so far good for free to play game
3688,Game Guuud Nun much to talk about
3689,"Started playing today. Got dozens of chests from previous sessions and got a bunch of legendary and supreme cards. It felt nice that the devs jump start new players like this.

I proceeded by assembling a deck using the cards I got, aiming for the highest possible glory and rarity. Put it all together in a few minutes and won 14 games in a row, reached level 17 and the Bronze II league.

Despite the success, I decided the game is not for me. I was hoping for something closer to a CCG. While there is deckbuilding this is clearly a battle royale game at the core (like Clash Royale on Mobile), and that could have been fine but in general the whole package did not appeal to me.

The ""casino feeling"" of this game, the loot boxes, the slots sounds, the monetization, I found all that all over the place. I know this is sometimes the norm for ""free"" to play games like this, but I think it was too much. I can see how that can increase the playtime of many gamers and help with getting some money into their game, but for me this had the opposite effect.

The gameplay was pretty average, nothing that was not seen before. In general I do not recommend the game."
3690,easy and fun
3691,I love this game! Building decks and protecting the tower.... So many options and fun artwork.
3692,"rly fun game, simple to learn"
3693,Simple yet great to play.
3694,AWESOME GAME! I'M A GOOD MASTER! <3
3695,"After having played MM for over 2 years, I usually reach Grand Master in Random 2v2 and it's time for me to quit. And I can't recommend it to new players any longer.

A year ago it used to be a relaxing game, leveling up was easy. The community still is very nice and welcoming. It's the new turn, MM developers have taken, that annoys me.

Season pass used to last three months. Now seasons last roughly one month, sometimes siginificantly less. With each new season new cards are introduced that are available only through the season pass and overpowered. So be prepared to get kicked in the teeth by new strategies and overpowered cards at the beginning of each season. Other cards are nerfed which changes the balance completely, so you can kiss some of your old decks bye bye. You have to always stay very close and be careful to recent developments. 

It would be nice to fix the frequent crashes, framedrops and disconnects of the game, instead of adding new content. The game looks old but frame rate is low and it still causes a lot of CPU load.

I like change and I understand the need for this game to stay alive. But there are just too many cards now which allow to many combos and it takes forever to understand all the mechanics properly. 

Personally I don't think spells should be able to deal damage to masters and I don't agree with wildcards, which is frequently debated. 

For new players: you start in a very low league, where you will fight bots disguised as humans. If you arrive in gold or silver, most players will be human. But you will not have many cards, while experienced players with much play time have many cards. You could theoretically outplay them with their legendary cards by your skills, but you are new to this game. So double the disadvantage for you! Then there is the premium upgrade, you gave to spend rubies on masters and the battle pass, chards for new cards. You get 3 battle chests each day and one challenge which gives you gold to buy power tokens and, if you are lucky, get good cards for your decks. At GM level you won't have trouble earning your Battle pass in-game without paying money, but it's insane how much time GM players spend playing this game. It's just getting boring, frustrating if you have a lose-streak  and too competitive to even bother."
3696,more action packed and faster version of Hearthstone
3697,"Fun game, love the co-op system.
We have much fun ;)"
3698,SC Minigame meet hearthstone. love it
3699,Finally some real game with fun and dynamic duel system. GJ
3700,good
3701,"Nice looking, fun gameplay"
3702,its fun and it doesn't require dexterity
3703,Nice
3704,"If it wasn't for Amazon Prime, I would of never given this game a shot. Game is easy to get into, fast paced and entertaining.

"
3705,it's ok
3706,"PROS:

NOT P2Win.

That was my primary concern when I was wondering whether or not to play. 
Spending money will give you fun toys, but will not give you an edge in combat.

The game is strategic and tactical. I have yet to get into the top tiers and consider myself a decent strategy player.

Decks are quite varied and have many counters.

Game Modes: Single combat, 2v2, Drafting, and every two weeks there is another mode to play.


CON:
I can't filter out global chat, which overwhelms my guild chat."
3707,fun little deck builder/tower defence
3708,"It's fun.  Matches are quick (think my longest is 11 minutes, most are 4 or less) and you're matched up quickly.  Cards are reasonably easy to come by, they don't seem gated behind pay to win (although the option is there to speed up your progress but isn't necessary).  I'd recommend this highly, there is an active twitch community too.  Give it a shot, it's free."
3709,"very good game reminds me of dugeon and dragons the card game in a way
"
3710,its fun
3711,Nice game to play and chill with your friend
3712,not ptw ... no clue why this game doesn't have more Players. Matchmaking is fast anyways (1 second to 20 seconds)
3713,"It's pretty fun and engaging so far ! I am curious to see how much time will it keep me curious to continue playing it !
"
3714,"Minion Masters is a super fun tower defence card game that anyone get into. The premise is simple and the controls are easy, but as you climb up in rank your foes will become more difficult. The gameplay is fantastic along with the graphics and animations, and I can't wait to unlock more cards and make my deck my own. Being free there is no reason you shouldn't give it a try, you won't regret it."
3715,i like scart
3716,I didnt think it would be fun but it was i actually liked it. Nice free game to kill some time :)
3717,"Super fun an d intuitive! many rewards and cool cards. Easy to play multiplayer wioth frioend!
"
3718,good free
3719,Fun game with solid balance so far.
3720,more masters are needed chi master for sure
3721,Great game
3722,Chill game.
3723,fun and addicting
3724,"Dogshit, crashes almost everytime I start it, such a meme"
3725,yea fun quick game
3726,"A very fun, strategy based game that has quick low stakes."
3727,"Fun, fast-paced, easy to play a few rounds in a short time."
3728,"The game is quick, funny, simple and smart!
Very nice and pleasing experience, at least now that I have just begun, a nice surprise.
I must say that mixing together warrior with swords and soldiers that resembles space marines give a feeling of lack in structure and atmosphere, but clearly the developers focus was not that of giving a solid atmosphere, but that of offering a good mix of strategy and light hearted fun, and they accomplished this very well!

I am Italian and the translation has some grammar defects, but it is understandable anyway."
3729,ver good
3730,So far very fun and addicting game but also loot boxy
3731,good fun
3732,"holy shit this game is addicting, i love it"
3733,fun
3734,The devs are so busy trying to get new players that they treat the current players so badly that they quit.  They leave game-breaking bugs in the game for months.  They purposefully introduce new cards that are over-powered and then leave them in place for months so that new or weaker players can win against more experienced players.  All the top players want wildcards removed because they reduce the level of skill required to win so what do the devs do? Nothing. Don't invest your time and effort into this game.  These people do not deserve it.
3735,[e muito boa a jogabilidade e as combinações de cartas que vc pode ter e não é muito pay to win
3736,nice little game
3737,'Tis OK
3738,NICE
3739,yes
3740,"Puff expansion when?



Edit: Today I lost more than you could ever know..."
3741,This game will sometimes match you against bots without telling you which is incredibly shady.
3742,Log from Blammo!
3743,Does EA own this game like there is a skill cap and a wallet cap at platinum so many p2p like GOD DAMN!!
3744,Really fun mix of TCG and Tower defense. Lots of diversity in decks and game modes.
3745,"Amazing so far, so much fun, so many deck combos."
3746,"Love the pacing of the game. Simple to get into, but I can see a deeper level of strategy that could be enjoyed."
3747,Very Fun
3748,"It's good, but better with friends"
3749,GG
3750,"EASY FUN GAME ,WINNING IS EVERYTHING!"
3751,good
3752,"Super low player count anymore, and with such an inactive community, you're typically fighting bots to get back up to a rank where you'd actually fight players.

And once you even do, you're then just fighting whatever flavor of cheese deck of the month is. So even then it's not nearly as interesting as you'd hope. Balance updates to fix those flavors come out a month, maybe 2 later, so if you don't own the cheese cards then you're really just stuck up a creek.

It was fun with a more active playerbase, and more of my friends into it, but nowadays, just wouldn't worry about it. Find a different game to sink actual time into.

Edit: I forgot to add, they have released paid adventures that are broken, and they haven't fixed them in MONTHS of adding them in. Meaning you could very well spend $10 on these adventures, and they literally will reset your progress every time you launch the game. So actually, devs are scummy, beyond just inactive.

Edit Edit: Still garbo. Adventures still busted. Everything stands as accurate."
3753,"After several hours, I have come to the conclusion that this game is the worst possible combination of many better games from similar genres.

It really is bad.

First of all, stylistically its all over the place. Weird cute characters for the 2D art dont match the theme of the games 3D art.

The characters are literally the most generic boring possible. Skeleton dudes, a dragon, a massive muscle dude with an axe. One of the cards is literally called 'Crossbow dudes' and they are the most generic characters ever. 

Then there are different cards that are hard to tell apart. Like generic mage woman 1 and 2.. one does AoE and one does single target.. and you will muddle them up everytime.

There are so little skillshots the game comes down to who can mash their keys fastest at the end when you get a 'mana surge' and at that point you might as well toss a coin to decide which of the almost identical builds is best.

The UI is the ugliest and slowest UI ive ever seen. Text everywhere. A thousand pinging icons screaming to be clicked. When you are welcomed into the game you have to open about 20 chests before you even get to start the game, which is slow, and meaningless as you have no idea what the items inside mean yet.

Music - is just shit.

Sound - is arguably worse. I muted this game after 2 hours. At the end of the game is just a mess of clashing noises.

There is also for some reason a Global Chat on every screen, and yet communicating in game it absolutely useless. You have to hold down a button then move your mouse and click for a quick ping.. Why not just set one button to ping where your mouse is?

You only have access to one perm character at the start of the game, so literally all the low ranks have identical characters and builds...

i could go on an on about the little annoying things that I don't llike about this game, which is remarkable considering I only have 11 hours in it.. which was probably 9 or 10 hours too long.

"
3754,"Well balanced game play that you can win from behind if the opposition makes an error and have had battles as long as 12 minutes although the matches are generally a lot shorter. You can obtain the season pass every month with your own earned rubies if you play enough. Also usually an active community and not difficult to find an online match. Over 300 hours on PC and similar on Xbox. Fun game with mouse, keyboard and Xbox controller support."
3755,Great fun!
3756,nice
3757,"i fucking love this game wtf its so cool and fun and beginner friendly and everything is just so cool and nice and flashy i also fucking like the voice actor, like the announcer guy idk what its called, but its just too awesome and funny, love yall keep it up"

3778,Interesting Game
3779,fun easy relaxing
3780,this game is retarded. you've gotta be 6 years old or mentally challenged to like this game.
3781,The game is very enjoyable and fast paced for a passive card combat game. I appreciate the polish put into it and you can tell there is a lot of love behind the design. I would much rather play this any time over clash royale or the type.
3782,a very fun game i recommened more of the team battle than the single but loved the gameplay and the awards
3783,Fun
3784,"Alright, well, here we are. I had to change from a good, happy review of this game being my best addiction, to... Unfortunately having to say some negative things here. I'm pissed I spent so much money on this game knowing the direction it's headed now.

I can't recommend this game anymore. Why? Dev greed. They've completely removed any incentive to play, rarely ever give any kind of QOL update to the game, and have absolutely decided this game is P2W now. If you don't want to drop hundreds on over priced DLC, cosmetics, and in game currency. Don't bother with this one.

The rewards were nerfed so much that the game isn't worth playing now, the rewards were already not worth earning as it was, but to remove the premium currency almost entirely to be earned? It's disgusting. They try to offset it by a battle pass drop in price. You wanna know how much it dropped in price? 100 rubies. It's still 1250 rubies. Even with the old system this would be difficult to grind out without spending money. 

The removal of ruby drops, (Which are usually around ten, rubies, if you're lucky. Put this into consideration for the cost of the battle pass.) from the daily wheel only adds insult to injury when it comes to trying to afford the battle pass through your hard earned grinds. Taking ruby rewards out of tiers as well... (Which were about 200 once in a while. And you can only earn it once per season.) 

The single player campaign missions are... SEVEN HUNDRED rubies EACH. each, that is PER MISSION. the rewards are never worth it. There is nothing about this game worth playing. 

Save your time and money on this one. The devs have decided that only our money matters, and not the players ourselves.

TL;DR, major nerfs to the game in general, no good updates, and unbalanced meta that the devs won't work on, but an economy nerf so that your efforts are basically fruitless, and the game is as soul crushing as it is pointless to play. It's pay to win garbage now."
3785,Glad to see getting spammed by Undying Skeleton's. This game is just a waste of potential i am just disappointed.
3786,enjoyable little game
3787,Fun
3788,This is the Clash Royale i'd like to play
3789,Play for 30 min and is great
3790,its very competative
3791,like clash royale but not as pay to win
3792,very fun to play off and on. good content updates
3793,"Fun, time consuming, good mechanics."
3794,Much like Clash Royale and such but its somewhat better.
3795,"An Anfang echt super, jetzt leider nur noch Pay To Win..."
3796,"was great game at first. then it started sucking with a pointless and really shit single update, and now it's a great game again. decent and playable for f2p players"
3797,The graphics enhance the game play. I enjoy the vast amount of  possibilities of cards and masters combinations.
3798,"Nice game, offer the possibility to play shortly when not having much time."
3799,Its fun and relaxing game. luv it
3800,Fun quick games.
3801,"Damn this is actually pretty fun, can't believe I slept on this for so long."
3802,"Fast paced, rather light, community not toxic, has a lot of potential to grow in depth."
3803,"Fun, quick, well balanced. Rounds last about 3-7 min so the turn around time for modifying your deck is quick. Pretty generous with card and currency give away. Updated pretty frequently - but not overflowing with way too much content like Hearthstone."
3804,i love this game
3805,"I love this game mode, this is 10/10 fun, want more of this !"
3806,Great Game! :D
3807,"Devs know rats ass about making a game. Game was way more fun before the Wildcard bs. So many unbalanced decks in the game and so many bots in ranked matches. The goal of the game is to spam as much as you can and cancer your opponents. Either the original devs were fired because they knew how to make a game or they just had their iq drop to 3 in a few weeks.

Update: Fuck you devs"
3808,fun strategy game
3809,iddqd
3810,eh is ok and fun
3811,"Game is basically ""Clash Royale"""
3812,"Like a combination of DOTA and Hearthstone - lots of fun and the two player Co-Op aspect is great to play when introducing others to the game, or just hanging out and playing.

The game appears to be getting rolling updates and fixes to cards, over the past week of play I have noticed a few cards getting marked as 'changed'.

There are several modes of progression which give you objectives to work towards:
1. There is your player level that gives rewards based on xp gained, 
2. There is the the seasons progression that produces extra rewards which is nice
3. NPC challenge modes 
4. Draft pick rank progression, three wins and you are out
5. Mayhem modes which come around apparently weekly, three wins and you are out, but rack up the wins for prizes.
6. Adventure mode where you play through a scenario with a selection of cards and abilities that you gain as you progress through the rounds, however one loss and you are back at the start - rewards are granted fro the difficulty level and how many wins you rack up - I found this to be quite enjoyable."
3813,"it is awesome. the core concepts are sound; it is learned quickly and reasonably deep; endless possiblities of how to play. lots of stuff to try out and experiement with. 

the main game, mechanics, handling, presentation are all very solid and well done.

i did only mind a bit the first 10 startups, that the main menu is totally overloaded; just gotta stay calm, and try each thing out, one after another; the tooltips are quite good at helping with that. it's only a tiny disturbance."
3814,Best game and community.
3815,GG
3816,it's like league of legends minus the annoying parts
3817,hey that's pretty good
3818,Good stuff
3819,"I got banned in chat for writing about Politics. What a shitty way to censur players, when the devs do not support your political views or ideology."

3821,"Minion Masters is a free to play competitive card game.

Card decks are built with 10 different cards with up to 2 wild cards (wild card is another copy of the same card) and choosing a master. There's different styles of decks that counter each other like rock paper scissors, but there always will be some cards that are seen more often than others. Some masters fit for any deck, but others are designed for specific strategies. For example Ravager is an early game rusher, Morellia waits for the late game, King Puff focuses only on 4 and 5 mana units, Milloween benefits from spell cards, etc.

The game is played with the player holding 4 cards that can be used quickly with hotkeys. A maximum of 10 mana is stored and controlling the bridges grants bonus XP to reach the next master perk and mana frenzy. It's easy to understand and get into and it has enough depth where you strategically position or delay the timing of played cards.

The main game mode is ranked: 1v1, 2v2 or premade 2v2 with monthly rewards per reached rank. I found the 2v2 battles the most fun because of the increased strategy potential. There's a time limited mayhem mode that adds a crazy modifier that shifts the card balance. Single player campaigns exist as adventures, but even if you get the first chapter for free from the DLC, you will have to pay for the other chapters.

As a free to play game there is grind to be expected, but it's very generous compared to other competitors. I could make a solid deck and reach the highest rank after 3 months of playing. Launching the game after 2 years, I saw some of the cards nerfed, but my decks were still solid with little adjustments. DLCs are free to claim on launch for a limited time and there's in game events and newsletter codes to get card progress. The only p2w element currently is the Battle Pass where paid players get access to the newly added cards, while the rest of the players can craft them after a month.

For achievement hunters:
There's a grind for using 250 power tokens, 100 resource (free daily) tokens, completing 100 daily quests, winning 500 ranked battles and some challenges that might be easier with friendly challenges. If you have the achievements completed in game but not on Steam, type ""/syncachievements"" in the in game chat to fix them."
3822,awesome
3823,"Before I didn't recommend this game because it's kind pay to win. 

But it's FREE, so I will recommend it if you like this sort of game. Just know they have pop up offers regurly trying to bait you in to spending your money. I've spent $40."
3824,"Что, выглядит как мобильная дрочильня? Так многие говорят. Не знаю, не играл в такие.
Пусть хоть как она выглядит, но это уж точно не дрочильня. Попросту дрочить нечего. Карты высокой рарности лишь отличаются каким-то особыми эффектами. В таблице лидеров полным полно колод разных стилей и как почти полностью состоящих из зелёных и синних карт (низкой редкости), так и с дорогих карт. Более того, редко встретишь хорошую колоду с более чем одной легендарной картой.
Прекрасная не напряжная игра, чтобы выиграть нужно думать. Имея низко-энергичное состояние это именно тот вариант, на который стоит обратить внимание.

А ещё разработчики регулярно обновляют игру и меняют баланс. Мне нравится такая обстановка."
3825,ok ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
3826,"i like all deh tings an the stuff . i do deh tings and git the stuff . then the fun , i have it ."
3827,i like this game
3828,trying the game again after sometime and its still enjoyable but needs a little more players
3829,Awesome game
3830,just unbalanced random game
3831,"Braindead opponents till you reach Platinum, at which point the game becomes Pay to Win.
Would have been a better game if it wasn't Free to Play."
3832,"I love this game you can get so much for FREE without paying a dime but do consider supporting the developers as they created an amazing game that makes me keep coming back to it.
"
3833,This game is fun
3834,GIMME THE LOOT!
3835,fdjgkghkhgkf
3836,"Fun and simple plus you don't need to pay money to be good at the game
"
3837,"I always thought a ""real-time"" version of TFT would be fun. Well, here it is... and I was right!"
3838,"great lil card game
"
3839,Fun to play.
3840,its good
3841,good
3842,"This is a very nice game with HUGE potential, totally different from another cards game. The community it's also friendly! If you are looking for a relaxing game with a relatively short game duration this game is for you!"
3843,"The implementation of the game itself is buggy, laggy, frezzy. The more you play without game restart, the more lags, freezes, and stupid stutter you experience. Memory leaks, garbage collection, I don't know... Graphics and effects and pretty simple, but FPS is too low, GPU is fully 100% loaded even in the game menu. Been playing team battles a lot, and I can conclude that even network code has issues with being out of sync. For example, I see one animation, but my teammate see another one. Which one is wrong? Who knows. There are no 3-player teams to proof.
So you have to restart it every 15-20 game matches.

But the game mechanics are awesome! I suppose it is the only game I play now and then without a boring feeling since the release.
Matchmaking is pretty fair. The more you play, the stronger players you have to defeat.
Season system is also makes top player list floating. You can't be ever-winner of all the time if your profile hasn't been played since your previous life.
Cards balance is always changing from Good to Not Bad. The ideal does not exist.

Developers are nice guys, as well. You are getting all the DLC for free if you are a true fan of the game. That's awesome!

Don't treat the game more than just a couple of battles in evening, and you'll be returning again and again without got bored.

My first and the only game I've been playing for 1.5 years from time to time!
Definitely recommended!"
3844,Fun GAMe!
3845,"I like all the different combinations of decks and how you get to choose the spawn points, makes it really interesting to play each time."
3846,my foot hurts
3847,good and fast battles

3850,"Love it!
Its like moba and card game merged and its EPIC!"
3851,awesome!!!!
3852,Ok
3853,Pretty fun
3854,"The game itself is a bitcoinminer if you watch how much ressources it consumes.
And even if it isn't there's no real competition to be had unless you're willing to also compromise your steam acc by installing cheats like most ""players"" do."
3855,Good fun
3856,"absolutely not p2w, it doesn't take a long time to unlock every cards if you focus on doing so. Upgrading them can take a long time, but it doesn't increase their strenght, only their ""battlepass bonus score"" increase, and if you play a few games every day, you won't have any trouble finishing the battlepass before the time limits without those upgraded cards. in fact if you have all upgraded cards you finish the battlepass really fast"
3857,Sweet game
3858,amazing
3859,so far so good
3860,Decent
3861,Pretty fun chill game.
3862,best game ever.
3863,Had a great time so far. Games are quick and cards are easy to unlock. No p2w.
3864,Reminds me of star craft custom games. doesn't take itself to seriously. lots of free loot boxes. the game doesn't push paid loot boxes to heavily. addicting
3865,"fix the brutish betrayer imbalance

retards"
3866,Beautifully made card/action game.
3867,its fun!
3868,Interesting RPG game
3869,"good game so far, 2 hours in"
3870,Pretty fu
3871,fun
3872,Game is very fun so far. I have noticed you can buy the power tokens which give you cards but its so random I wouldn't count it as pay to win. The team fights are really enjoyable especially if you can get someone you know and work off their plays. Downloaded this game looking for something to kill time and ended up liking it way more than expected.
3873,pretty fun
3874,"Clean, fun, good!"
3875,It is really fun and easy to pick up. Quick rounds too!
3876,Its great
3877,"I've been pleasantly surprised with how fun this game has been so far. It reminds me a lot of Hearthstone in the sense that there is ranked modes, adventure modes, and the deck building aspect. With the addition of the tower defense like playstyle, it has a very unique gaming experience that I have yet to have had in another other game so far."
3878,Good game
3879,"This game is a win.  Fun.  Free.  I find myself wanting to purchase cosmetic stuff to support the devs for making such a thing possible.  At first it can appear to be one of those loathsome mobile games that is pay to win.  However, I'm forty or so hours in and have been able to be competitive with just what I've won.  The game does a good job of constantly rewarding your effort.  The fun to frustration ratio is really quite good.  They could do a little better job of letting you contact random players you had a good experience with.  Perhaps just an in game friend system that didn't require a steam commitment.  Some sort of button to do so after a match would be welcome.  All in all Minion Masters feels like a really solid game that is super fun to play.  Well worth your time and probably a little bit of your money."
3880,"So far its like a very fleshed out clash of clans for PC. Absolutely loving it so far. Way more depth like I said. Its free and I would recommend it to everyone that even remotely liked Clash. To those new to the genre, its free and I would say at least try out the tutorial. Very fun!

3881,Great game!
3882,Very easy to play. It starts with a very clear intro so you know all the stuff you need to know. Then you take what you know to have awsome duels with opponents
3883,I recommend this game to anyone who likes to just shut off their brain for a second and chill
3884,Fun and challenging card game with added features
3885,"DON'T LET THEM LIE TO YOU THIS IS LOOT BOX TRASH. Bait and switch trash.. soon as you hit ranked the power of the enemies cards is stupidly over whelming as is their mana generation(seemingly) sure there is a buy around... I got no time for that. Very little skill involved.. just really who has the better stuff.EDIT: Even adventure mode is trash.. you get 4/8 battles pretty easy then the npc starts off with triple your mana generation and you have 2 cards forced into your hand every battle which wouldnt be bad if you could alter your deck in any way.. just swells with rando trash... sure there is a buy aroundEdit: Sore loser can DC in team battles leaving you with no rewards and alot of wasted time.\Edit: Trash can quest just stop progressing for no reasons 8/10 with 14 consecutive wins in team battle.Edit again.. trash randos for team battles that cant stay connected and cost you the match.Edit.. again, again: The RNG is broken... you have 8 or 9 cards in a deck and the same card will keep coming up nine or ten times in a fucking row...EDIT++++ Negative reviews will cost you in game."
3886,"a kind of game where everyone is experimenting their ""unbeatable"" deck. most of the time you become their deck testing opponents because you don't know how to respond their decks. they might say ""it is not pay2win"" well it is not true. if you pay up and promote a card, you literally get the chance to play that card 2/3x times more. YOU DRAW THAT CARD MORE OFTEN! I mean I don't see which point of this is not a ""pay2win."" It sucks that i can't go up on leaderboard because i play good or skillfully. that's all."
3887,Its alot of fun so far.
3888, good
3889,"Surprisingly fun and addicting. Gameplay seems very simple at first glance, but after a while you realize there's much depth to it. The only real downside is announcer's voice - really annoying, I had to mute all voices to stop hearing it."
3890,It's a fun game with lots of opportunity to grow.
3891,Kinda fun and chill to play in
3892,EZ play and use somethink to play lol
3893,"It's a very good game, although the developers don't always listen to their community"
3894,Great free game. Between the monthly free dlc from the developer to the full packs with Twitch Gaming you can quickly amass tons of cards. There are some huge metas that this game goes through though which can lead to things becoming stale until a mid-season patch or a new update. I do find it tons of fun. There is no need to have a friend with you as the match making tends to do well balancing the duos vs random duos.
3895,good game but u play vs bots not real ppl hate lying companies.
3896,good game
3897,Not great but good enough.
3898,Pretty fair free to play model and a lot of fun to play.
3899,very good time frenzy
3900,"The best turn based game ever! I have enjoyed this game so much, no matter how much I thank the Dev team, its not enough. The amount of creativity and polished features they have added and plus the free keys they give every day that was something. I am truly enjoying this game. If you like to have a game to have some good time this is it."
3901,"100% would recommend this game.
Free game that has no intention to cash grab your money which is really rare those days.
The gameplay is pretty straight forward it's a mix between tower defense and deck builder.
You start the game with simple cards and the more you play the more rewards you get, including cards.
As you progress through the game, you can build your own strategies with cards that you acquired.

Also a big plus you can play as a duo team, it's really fun to play with a friend and find strategies using both characters and decks.
"
3902,i lie it
3903,"this game allows strategy and quick thinking. i take up the challenge
"
3904,"This game is awesome and I have played some really good minions since they are OP in team battles.
"
3905,"I initially tried out this game maybe a year or so ago, when the activate player was around 3-3,5k daily. Quit due to getting frustrated of having to deal with more and more cheese builds the higher you climb in solo play. 

Came back a month or so back and it's pretty much the same, but just with a smaller player base. Game population is not a problem though. Queues are quick, community - dedicated. Community players range from try hard cheese masters to fair players I don’t mind losing to. Game pop will most likely hover around 1k+ for the foreseeable future, a cult following for this flawed gem.

Cheesy builds is my main gripe with the game, but you wouldn’t have them without improper balancing, which I will cover below. Imagine having a tough battle, where both sides only have a few hundred HP left. Will a decisive epic battle determine the victor? Nah fam, just plop down some spells on the tower and you’re done. Several melee enemies coming towards your tower? Just plop down a single powerful air unit and those enemies will never reach their goal. Suddenly you go from being the aggressor to just trying to kill one single enemy desperately. And while you’re doing that, the enemy can simply deny your counters or stack the deck with more units in his favor. It is so easy to snowball after an unsuccessful attempt to counter whatever nonsense the players can throw at you.

Besides cheesy builds, the other issue I have is with the balancing. They’re interlinked, you wouldn't have one without the offer. Also, just because the game is free, does not give it some special new standard for what is fair and not. Too many cards, which you can’t even damage normally initially, being forced to either sacrifice less valuable cards or to have perfect timing to negate cheap gimmicks like stealth. There are too many cards, which give too much value and shift the whole direction of the game towards dealing with just that one enemy, which you can only effectively do, with prior knowledge and proper cards. Sure, you can try to counter, but it will be even easier for the enemy to deny your counters. If you can snowball in the first two minutes, that’s pretty much a win and that’s not fun to experience or inflict others to. 

There are also some P2W elements, but they’re pretty tame compared to other F2P games. You can buy legendary cards with premium currency from the get go, but I don’t think you get much choice in which they offer you. The cards still tend to be more on the best you can get side, otherwise no one would buy em’. However, you can also craft the same legendary card after many, many hours of grinding or simply buy them with the premium currency, which is also another slow grind. It becomes less P2W the more you play. 

TLDR; poor balancing, which enables a part of the community to cheese to the top
"
3906,"It  is clash royal but for pc
"
3907,Best game ever <3
3908,"Pretty simple premise, well executed.  About 10 minutes per match, well worth a try."
3909,
3910,relaxing and addicting. played for 4 hours the first time playing.
3911,"its very fun! much better than tinder
"
3912,ok...
3913,"The game is pretty fun, its literally a clash royale and I always enjoyed those type of games, it might be unbalanced at some point but its pretty fun after all they only thing I dislike is the bridge level system..."
3914,Goooooooollll---------------------d
3915,"I played only couple of hours, but so far i like. The gameplay is easy to understand and graphics, sound effects are quite nice."
3916,fucking sick game
3917,"pretty good game, and its easy to get enough rubies over time for battle passes"
3918,A fun game and a good time killer
3919,fun game
3920,fun game! Nice strategy aspects.
3921,fun free rts
3922,"The game isn't bad, it's done well, the challenges are competitive, so I don't think it's right to give a negative opinion, in fact I won't. But on my nerves it's a tough challenge, so after a few hours of gameplay I gave up and preferred less competitive games. You see, now I'm also my age, I have to select the anger to take or I don't get to the end of the day."
3923,its simple to understand yet difficult at the same time. Well done
3924,Purple Elvis!?!?
3925,Reminds me of tug of war games from the old stacraft 2 days.
3926,"A friend recommended this game to me as a casual game similar to auto-chess. I must say, it's pretty neat. It's a lot like mobile games that have micro-transactions, but you don't need them to play and enjoy the game. This is a great free-to-play game"
3927,New format of real time strategy
3928,Quick pace game makes it very convienent and fun. Enjoy the mixture of masters and how there is free rotations so you can try them before you buy.
3929,It's a lot of fun
3930,fun game
3931,"I'm personally not a fan of pvp, but honestly this was so instantly engaging I'm not even bothered. It's pretty easy to pick up and decide how you like to play, and if you pay just a bit of attention, you can pick up cards you like easily. I like the structure of the f2p, and the matchmaking has so far been quick and snappy."
3932,Been a fan of CGG for quite some time - this one is interactive and amusing so far.
3933,"Game would be fun if the entire 2v2 matchmaking wasn't broken, the Q's never pop so you can't get out of wood 5 if you haven't played in a patch or 2. Spent at least  5 minutes opening a bunch of dumb chests. 

-Previous Grand Master

Update

Guess that was just for one night, or we both had to level in singles or something. We got it working on night 2. Game is fun."

3936,"Pretty new to the game! Only a few matches in. This plays pretty smoothly, and the general style and aesthetic of the game is pretty appealing. And there's a major faction all about rat like creatures!"
3937,"     This is a very nice Free-to-play game that you can pick up and play a couple of matches anytime you want. (They lasted anywhere from 2-7minutes for me usually) It is also fun to play 2v2 with a friend or just using the matchmaking system to find partners. There are so many fun playstyles and different deck combinations you can build, and in 2v2 you and a friend can build decks that synergize well together...
     But if you prefer solo play, this game is also perfect for that. I had a lot of success by myself with an Empyrean themed deck and I got to platinum rating on my first day playing the game in ranked 1v1s, and I didn't spend any real money and don't plan to. It just shows that the starting cards they give you are very good once you figure out the strategy. I recommend this game if you like cardgames mixed with RTS gameplay! :)"
3938,"Unexpected gem of a game. Easy to dive right into, fast match-making and matches are quick and fulfilling. 2v2 is a lot of fun! If you get frustrated by games like League of Legends and Fortnite where you never seem to win .... this is the game for you."
3939,bery good
3940,Don't get this game. It's pay to win. Everything cost over $19 to buy with real money. Only way to get good cards to win is to pay.
3941,I love this game... It is a lot of fun and a grate time killer with lots of challenges and tings to collect!!!
3942,"its start slow ,, but its become sooo addicted and fun :D
especially 2v2  <3"
3943,"Great combo of card game and tower defense. Queue times are fast and matches are fast and fun. The game is pretty generous with its rewards and it's not hard to get the cards you want. 

The game seems to be pretty well balanced. I haven't encountered anything too cheesy that can't be countered. The best part is that unlike other card games, luck isn't much of a factor because decks are small and cards get recycled in the order you played them, which makes this a game purely about skill and strategy."
3944,great
3945,Definitely fun to play! Having the team play even makes it better if you want to play with friends! The game is very generous with daily rewards! Highly recommended for players who likes strategy games!
3946,really Fun to play
3947,it's fun
3948,So far so good
3949,I've only played this a little bit but so far so good.
3950,"fun, easy to understand"
3951,i am truly enjoying it. it is a fun nice paced game
3952,"Enjoying this game so far, I've gotten a ton of chests/cards for free and leveling up at the beginning was easy. This game reminds me of a combination of Hearthstone and Teamfight Tactics/Autochess."
3953,great
3954,Enjoyable
3955,"I expected this to be a cheap mobile game hungry for microtransactions, but what I found was an amazing mix of TCG mana budgeting and moba wave fighting. It in under a week has taken my spot for online multiplayer fix over League, Teamfight Tactics, and Dota Underlords. 

It's like the old xbox MTG game, but actually good."
3956,This games worth the time to get good at it
3957,The game is really fun!
3958,"Nice bit of escapism, easy to play but hard to advance at higher levels keeping it challenging."
3959,amazing
3960,Fun
3961,"Super fun action card game, it's free, they give out the DLC for free (for a limited time) it's 100% worth playing."
3962,"Game's pretty fun! A friend reccomended it and I'm having a great time win or loss! Cleaver OP, pls dont ever nerf"
3963,Really fun game also stress relieving a fun time to kill time in waiting for something etc this is a must have game.
3964,Un juego muy entretenido
3965,not a BAD game ...
3966,THIS IS GREAT
3967,"Another F2P grind-or-pay PvP in the spirit of League of Legends, Hearthstone, etc. Most of the ""skill"" in this ultra-simple game, however, is knowing which things you're seeing on the battlefield so you can properly counter them (and having legendary cards). I leave having never lost a match against a human opponent, and with absolutely no fond memories of the game."
3968, 
3969,Fun and addicting game
3970,Seem like a fun little mix of a classic moba and tower defense kind of game
3971,"Very addictive, deck builder and strategy / tower defence all mashed together! awesome game, would recommend.  =)"
3972,Really good game!
3973,prime game brings me here
3974,"Its a fun game to play its simple and enjoyable I like the 2 vs 2 mode and its rather unique to any game i have played before. You can earn in game currency to buy pretty much everything, but its one of them games that throws deals and spend real money in your face every time you log in or do something. So whilst it can be F2P with a grind they are always trying to get you to spend money to reduce that grind so watch out if you are counting your penny's."
3975,Its fun. Just trying to take it casually and not competitively.
3976,sucks
3977,cooler than it looks
3978,it's fun
3979,"Its fun, can't say much this early on how balanced it is but its fun"
3980,"Decent game, better if have a friend to play 2v2 with"
3981,Wowee zowee
3982,This game is free and legit a ton of fun. Little bit pay to win but not near as much as hearthstone or other CCG. Also the live RTS style battles lead to a ton of strategy not just with deck but with placement of pieces. It's like a RTS/AutoBattler/CCG hybrid
3983,"Actually fun little deck builder.  Simple, but good."
3984,gud
3985,e
3986,"good game, high octane game play"
3987,is okay
3988,As a free game I really wasn't expecting much from this but I've been blown away by just how good it is. You certainly don't need to spend money to be competitive and it's a very in depth tactical game. I've really got pulled into it and am loving it.
3989,"game hay vai loz
"
3990,"The Games Is So Fun In Hes Own Mode I Like This I Enjoy The Game 
Not Pay2Win No Bots Good Graphics Realy Nice Games"
3991,"It is easy to pick up and play. It has a diverse number of cards and match styles to play
It is a bit grindy at times but makes up for that in the multiple ways to get cards/currency.
If you're looking for a strategy card game with tower defense this pick this up."
3992,Fun to do duos with a friend
3993,love all of it !!!!!!
3994,"Its a fun time sink, free to play and not really pay to win, rough at first but once you get the hang of it, making up different combos can feel really rewarding
"
3995,Fun little game. Just make sure your APM is in top condition.
3996,good
3997,"If you ever played and loved Clash Royale on your phone back in the day, you'll love this even more, less Toxic too.

Definitely fun game and i'll be sticking around and play this for a good amount of time.

I often also play this game together with my Girlfriend and it's a fun game for in between the bigger games we spend our time on."
3998,Fast paced fun that is easy to learn and hard to stop playing.
3999,"Just one more positive review for the pile.

Game is fun, well balanced, offers plenty to do and best of all, it is completely free to play. Their business model is absolutely fantastic for their players.

The legendary cards for instance are not OP, infact they tend to be very niche cards that support a build or unlock new play styles (such as a dragon nest building that summons little dragons every time you cast a spell).
And the game throws cards at you continually, and gives you the crafting materials to make legendary cards, if you want them quite often.

DLC is free when it first releases and the seasons still give out lots of groovy rewards to totally f2p players who haven't bought the pass with money or premium currency earnt in game.

There is a lot to say about this game but I'll keep it short and sweet.

Game is good, free and the dev team are worth supporting."
4000,Fun with friends
4001,Fun game easy to get in to. you don't have to spend any money at all in the game to be competitive.
4002,"Fun, fast paced gameplay that is very co-op friendly. It sucks that Adventure mode is broken and pretty much impossible to play."
4003,Actually really fun
4004,"I cannot stress this enough, fuck everything about this game. Pay to win. don't waste your time. Nothing you do will matter. none of your cards will matter. the special decks you craft will NOT matter. Do NOT spend a dime on this useless ""game""."
4005,"Good strategy card game, fun and dynamic."
4006,Simple Yet Addicting
4007,"This game is fun and easy to pick up. I am enjoying it so far, the decks just need to be built right by myself of course as a bad deck can hurt you."
4008,"this GAME is FUN
reminds me of clash royale
-------------=_=-------------


"
4009,love this game
4010,its fun game and i join that fun
4011,"Best card game you can get for free imo
"
4012,I didn’t expect to like it. Great competitive game with many possibilities and strategies.
4013,So fun to play
4014,"It's cute, it's fun and it's free. Just get it."
4015,Just like Clash Royale but even better because there's no card levels and waiting for chests to open.
4016,"Great game , good fun for free , i might even spend a little cash on this"
4017,Under-rated tower defense game. Developers give free content all the time. Game is updated constantly and has a good community
4018,to be honest i have been playing this game for two days now and find it to be one of the best games ever and i play a lot of different games
4019,One of the best free games i have played just needs new content more often. 4 out of 5 stars
4020,"Tends to be pretty good overall, not sure about some of the upcoming economy changes. Overall the gameplay is pretty fun and fast-paced, sound effects and master voiceovers get a bit old after hearing the same lines 50 times, graphics are cartoonish but not bad, and the ragdoll effects are a nice touch to make the game more amusing at times."
4021,"Was recommended to me by a friend.
Great game! Fast-paced. Easy to understand. 
Would recommend 4/5"
4022,Pretty good game
4023,"You are playing against AI players silently injected into the ladder to matchmake against you.
Most of the time grinding through a quickly resetting ladder system that rewards grinding patience over skill.
The game offers high repetition of a small set of cards, with strategies of little variation. Developers lacking creative ambition, spending the limited resources on improving already okay models of units instead of expanding variety.
The pay to unlock things faster model is well balanced, but that doesn't help enough."
4024,Works well as a casual game.
4025,yess
4026,It is a very good game in terms of card game meets tower defense.  There is a pay method in the game but it is absolutely not required to be competitive.  The starting hero that you get is very powerful and just playing gives you the currency Rubies/Shards needed to buy things in the game such as cards and other heroes.  I definitely would suggest playing this game!
4027,"Really nice free game! You don't need to spend any money on it at all. It's easy and realaxing. I've lost like 1-2 games ever (can I check that stats anywhere? Pls comment!). It's even mor fun to play with a buddy, and go 2v2 matches.

Here you can find a whole bunch of codes to redeem in the shot (think you need to be lvl 6 or something to be able to go into the shop where you redeem them). I hope the codes help: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1976644824

There you go, some codes may be old, but many worked not long ago for me. :) Thumbs up for this game! Like this review if the codes helped you out! ;-)

I like it after 100s of hours played!"
4028,"its really enterntaiment, on 1 vs 1 battle, but i like most 2vs2 battles thats intense!!!!"
4029,"Fun to play no doubt about it. Just wish they released minions faster to give more options. As you progress in ranks every team ends up using the same 12 or so minions. This eventually makes the game kinda boring to play. Earlier ranks are lots of fun though. Luckily your ranks reset every 30 days, so I just play casually and try not run my rank up too high."
4030,"I've played Clash Royale for over 4 years so I love these types of games. This game is easy in the beginning until you climb the ranks -- But I can honestly say this is a fantastic game with way more deck building opportunities, more complexity with bridge control, and  different masters. The cards are all unique with really interesting interactions / combos. Its free to play and unlike CR its not pay to win! You can pay for more cards that you don't have but no way to make them stronger (Like CR). If you like deck builders like hearthstone, or tower defense style games, get this its free!"
4031,"Average fight game Format, with enough little twists to make it fun."
4032,"This game was randomly suggested to me by Steam. There's actually nothing exactly like it out there at the moment, it reminded me of those old-school flash games where you spawned units that slowly pushed your side while the enemy did the same.

Minion masters takes that rather limited idea and turns it into a fully-fledged strategy/card game. You slowly accumulate mana over time, which you then use to play your cards based on their cost. Those cards are chosen before the game from your collection and randomly added to your hand. When you play them you see the units materializing in the arena and automatically moving and fighting using their skills and stats.

There's very little passive watching going on though. 
Apart from a multitude of units to spawn, you choose where they spawn and by doing that, you influence who they're going to attack and how (ranged, melee, flying etc).  There's also a vast assortment of spells and heroes with different skills to choose from.
To make a few examples, swarms of units are countered by units with AoE or high attack speed. Slow, powerful units are countered by long-range units, high single damage is countered by shields and so on. If you play reactively you can try to counter the enemy units, but they will have the pressure and xp advantage by holding the bridges on the side of the arena.

I understand that not being able to directly control the minions could be a turn off for some, but personally I found it interesting to not need a ridiculous APM to be able to compete with higher level players. The AI usually does what it should, it can be wonky at times but generally I don't have too many complaints about it. 

The arena itself is rather small, which makes the games last 5-8 minutes on average. This is actually a great thing, it never feels like a match is dragging on forever. If there's a stall, eventually the player with the most xp gets a huge buff to their mana production, allowing them to spam units like there's no tomorrow. This usually ends the game in their favor pretty quickly.

Before I go on, I have to mention the technical side of things. The graphics are cartoony and pleasant, with a fantasy-anime hybrid art style that's not incredibly innovative, but does its job without being disruptive. It looks good and can run pretty well even with everything maxed, but after a few hours of playing a memory leak or something similar starts happening and you get a lot of mini-freezes and have to restart. It's not a huge deal, but I'm mentioning it. The music and effects are quite repetitive unfortunately, not bad but I wish there was more variety involved. Also I personally found some of the voice acting to be a bit...irritating.

There's balance issues like you see in every competitive game, but so far I haven't seen anything that's uncounterable (although a single huge unit with a healer behind it is extremely difficult to deal with).
I got used to the game pretty quickly, and by playing with a friend reached Diamond in a matter of days -and I'm still climbing.
Yeah, speaking of which, there's a team 2v2 mode and you can play with one friend, which is great fun. The 2v2 mode has a totally different balance but it's a nice addition to the game.
Apart from the 1v1 and 2v2, there's a draft mode, adventure mode (single player), a few non competitive fun modes and a ridiculous amount of quests and sub-quests to complete as well as guilds, crafting, season passes, skins and so on.

There's no ""normal mode"" where you can try out a new deck in 1v1 or 2v2 settings, only ranked. This makes it hard to change your deck too radically without risking to lose your hard-earned rank. I assume this is because of the relatively low player count. I would also like to see the rewards be less scattered, I don't like having to check 50 different screens like you do on crappy mobile games.

Make no mistake though, this game is anything but P2W. It's extremely fair and gives you enough to build a deck that can theoretically become rank 1 in a matter of days, maybe weeks if you want the more expensive legendary units. In my 30-35 hours of real game time I accumulated enough resources to buy the premium season pass, I have 3 competitively viable decks and enough saved up to buy literally any card in the game, plus more. All of this without spending a penny.

There's also something else that needs to be mentioned, in the first two divisions of ranked mode (Wood and Stone) the game is almost exclusively bots. I won tens and tens of games in a row without any difficulty even as I first started the game, there's no way that NOBODY was able to beat my terrible lv1 deck, right?
I understand wanting to fill up the ranks a bit, but why have Wood and Stone divisions at all if you're just going to have players grind through tens of bot games? It's boring and unsatisfying.
From Plat and above you can finally play against people who are halfway decent and don't mindlessly spam units, I'd say anything Diamond and above is where you really want to be though.

Anyway, as you can see the game has its flaws but the idea and execution are actually really solid, I am having a lot of fun playing it with minimal frustration, even when I get my ass kicked.
A few player experience and UI improvements would do wonders, I hope the game gets noticed more and grows in the future, maybe even see a mobile port at some point."
4033,boring as hell
4034,"great game awesome card/mechanic designs.. 

deck building is super fun like old times of yu-gi-oh you need a good combination of cards but some cards are not usable/ not  recommended. pre made duels are awesome unless you re against min-max/ritual of servitude deck(which spawns high cost minions -i call the god cards :D-) and they kinda counter most of things  but even losing is fun in this game 
for cons as i said some cards are is not good as others some class/archetypes needs rework or more cards and littke tweaks."
4035,"Good Game, fun to play alone and with friends"
4036,"play people, and rekt people, or get rekt.   big fun.  big annoy."
4037,thumbs up

4044,its not bad
4045,"fico, facile da imparare un po' meno da masterarae"
4046,"Card + defend tower! 
Fun and easy"
4047,quite fun and simple game :)
4048,Fun and addictive. Recommended!
4049,"It's like Clash Royal but with a more generic art style, and a lot of extra junk tacked on that just slows the game play down.  Not for me."
4050," I play mostly 2vs2. The game becomes more and more toxic. Ppl will abandon games often. If you make a play they dont like they will sit there doing nothing just spamming emotes til you lose. (in my today 5h gamesession 50% of games were abandoned in masters and grandmasters). Oh and you cannot report them... ""Coz they did not leave"" - the game tells me. And even if they leaved game the button to report them dont work anyway - YAY!  And if you try to report it as a bug - it will fail with ""something went wrong"" error AHA! (And Devs silently reduced droprate for premium curr for daily login SIGNIFICANTLY - like 10 times less than before - 50rubies last patch vs 500-600 2 months ago)"
4051,"Great Head to Head game!
"
4052,"Its fun and free, some pay to play concepts

4059,Great fun game 10/10
4060,"fun game , well designed , v generous , good mp 

try it out !"
4061,clash royale but fun
4062,"Fun game BEFORE Rank GOLD, after that basically is P2W ."
4063,yo this game slaps.
4064,"Great Game, so challenging"
4065,"Interesting...
 Clash Royale But Not Clash Royale"
4066,"The game play is very addicting. The announcer is perfect imo, just over the top enough. Easy to understand and there isn't one op playstyle that I've seen."
4067,Loving it so far...
4068,Simply quick and fun - great when you have kids hassling you all day long!
4069,"I really wish I could give this a more positive review. The game itself is great. It's real-time-strategy in a simple yet engaging format. Where you're deploying minions along two pathways in order to destroy the opposing master, and to make things more interesting, each pathway has a bridge that will steadily fill your masters XP gauge so long as they're under your control, get enough XP, and a special ability unlocks.

The masters and minions are neatly varied, allowing a whole variety of strategies with different combinations. It's a neatly balanced multiplayer game.

So why is my review negative? That's easy enough to explain. F*$!ING PAY-TO-WIN MECHANICS!... Phew, sorry that came out louder than intended.

The game deals out rewards as you continue to play. Usually coins, which are used to buy new masters, cards and cosmetics in the in-game store. But if your profile level goes up, you'll get a special reward. It might be a new card, it might be more gold than usual, or it might be shards or rubies which are also used to buy things in the in game store. Yes there are a total of three different in game currencies!

A random amount of Shards are earned through power tokens although I say random, it'll usually be a small amount... At least they come with a random card you might or might not already have... ...? Yay...?

Power tokens are bought in the in game store. You can use a thousand coins to get one, but since you only earn around 40-50 coins in a match you could always buy more with Rubies.

You can be rewarded Rubies, but you usually get around 20-45 (rough estimate) of them. But how you normally get them is the problem as this is the currency you can get by paying real world money.

And this is where the pay to win bull&$%! comes in. Masters, cards and power tokens can all be purchased with Rubies, the power tokens get special mention because since their contents are always random. I might as say what they really are. Loot boxes! The fact that you can pay real world money for them means you're literally gambling.

Yes I know you can get everything without having to pay, but you'll be grinding for weeks, maybe months and a few years just to pull it off. You can buy things with gold and shards, but to save up shards, you need to save up 1000 gold to buy a power token and to get that gold, you have to play through roughly 25 matches and that's if you're lucky enough to win them all.

But don't worry, this game has you covered, for the price of £14,99 you can speed up the grinding earning you more gold in battles and more profile XP so you earn those Ruby and Shard rewards quicker.

For £14.95 you can unlock ALL of the masters giving you an edge over those players who didn't fork over the cash.

And how about all that DLC which does little more than give you cards you can earn for free playing the game and a bunch of ""exclusive"" cosmetic items. How much do they cost? £11.39 each!

But they can be gained for free on the first week of launch, so that TOTALLY makes it okay.

Did I already mention the power tokens are literally Loot boxes?

This is just a mobile game made for PC!

I'm sorry but this is inexcusable, this game may be Free to play, but it seems these days, Free to play is just an excuse to justify gouging as much money out of players as possible.

Yes, all these micro-transactions would be even worse if they were in a game you paid money for, but through that logic you might as well say getting robbed is better than getting mugged, it's still the same thing at its very core."
4070,"I like it I like it so much
i play everyday
This kind of game that it does not take long time to enjoy ... just a few minutes to finish the battle 
If you are busy and just have a short free time, this game is for you"
4071,"A pretty fun little pvp game. I got it on a temporary free to keep weekend, but it seems to be fully free to play now. There are a lot of microtransactions available, but they don't feel compulsory and it's fairly easy to get enough stuff to have a decent build without spending money. For that price it's at the very least worth checking out."
4072,Really fun to play with a friend and laugh at some absurd shit low level combo that we made
4073,"Quick matches, a variety of decks can be built, loving this game."
4074,A uery good game
4075,fun

4083,Great game!
4084,"Fun quick games! Fantastic game play, and an unobtrusive store that doesn't push micropurchases. Also really love the stream interaction with viewers as audience members!"
4085,good game
4086,"Really good game, easy to understand and replay value is there. have fun."
4087,OK
4088,Only played about an hour so far but it's been a fun blend of card and strategy game.  Rewards are coming at a nice pace but I expect that to slow down soon.
4089,one of the best steam online game.
4090,Fun game. No pay-to-win IMO. DENGUSBOIZ 4 life.
4091,I enjoy PvE and like to beat goals. I spend 70% of my playtime trying to beat Adventure mode. I wasted hours on 25+ runs trying to beat all 8 bosses and they make Mordar so difficult. If you don't beat him you get no reward and no experience. You are left with time that you can't get back and no feeling of achievement for wasting all that time. I gave it a shot but to me its a waste of time. Just stick with PvP.
4092,I love this game just wish it had content transfer.
4093,Makes you calm if you are any MOBA game or CS:GO player.
4094,nice
4095,one of the better NOT pay to win card games
4096,This game is fun tower defense game. I have only put probably an hour and I can play this game while doing homework. Just play it and enjoy!

4116,"I'm a week into this game and LOVING IT! Colorful, challenging, exciting, and yet, easy to pick up, while taking time and strategy to master. Tip for the novice: Don't rush getting cards out. Take your time and make your best moves. I had to learn that myself and now am playing really well, if I do say so myself. I'm thinking about live streaming this so others can get into it, too. Careful! It can be addictive!"
4117,"멋진 게임, 카드 빌드, 덱 및 플레이를 선택할 수 있습니다. 게임은 타워 디펜스와 오토 체스가 합쳐진 것과 같습니다."

Step 2 : Congratulations you won!

I'd play it for probably hundreds of hours if it had more depth."

4129,cool
4130,good game and very good design i'm like the game atm
4131,good game
4132,Its fun if you just play for free for daily quests. Not really much of a game. Has great replay value each time but just same grind to unlock. Everything is patched so fast theres no point of crafting as every thing that is meta is immediately reworked aka as in just nerfed to the ground unusable. 100% of DLC isnt expansion. It is buy a season pass and you can unlock the dlc at a slow slow pace maybe after 15hrs grindings. maybe more like 25-30hrs. Ive foolishly spent probably $70 dollars overall.
4133,"Short Answer:  IF you're looking for a new game to try out, Give this one a try, its a decent choice.

I've been playing for about 3 days now, and its a lot of fun.  It does a decent job of introducing the game to new players, and there are plenty of rewards in the beginning to keep you engaged and interested.  The game maker actually gives away the expansion packs for FREE when they are first released, which I of course missed the latest one by mere hours :(    From what I can tell, you dont have to spend money to play the game, but of course, it doesn't hurt.  I never go into a game thinking I'll be spending zero, but $5 to play the game for awhile, see IF you like it, its a lot better than $50 for some other games you'd just buy outright.  Like other games of this type, some small purchases early on can really help you out.  I picked up the season pass for $5, which more than doubles the rewards you get for playing, and increases the speed at which you level during the season.  IMO, easily worth it.

I do recommend you try this game, even with the drawbacks I'm about to mention.
Monitor Support:  I have an awesome super wide LG Monitor.   2560x1080.  There are more than a few issues seeing certain things on screen.  I cant even play some of the options because the start button appears off screen, and there is no scrolling.  I tried to change the resolution and almost got caught making the game unplayable.  The buttons became unreachable to change the resolution a second time.  In any event, I was able to get it back to where it was, and lots of buttons will appear in strange places or not observable at all.  Doing the challenges section, I waited a few minutes thinking the thing was still loading, because I couldn't see a message that said click to continue.

DLCs:  Like I said, its pretty awesome that they give it away FREE the first few days its been released.  But what IF you haven't been playing the game since Day 1.  Purchasing all the DLCs now would cost almost $150.  A very steep price for new players to catch up.  There's one particular upgrade I'm on the fense about, the Premium upgrade.  It gives you some decent startup Resources, Rubies to buy things in the shop, shards to craft or upgrade cards, and Power Tokens, which you spend to obtain additional cards for your deck.  But its lasting effect is 2 things, a 50% Gold Boost, and a 20% Experience Boost.  The experience boost will help you level faster, and there is a reward of some kind every time you level up.  But the Gold Boost is basically worthless.  Heres Why:

Every Time you win a battle, you get some gold.  How much, for me, its about 40 Gold.  So a 50% Boost would make it 60.    As far as I know, this is the only gold increase this boost provides.  IF there were items that cost 100 or 200 gold, this would definitely be worth it.  But the cheapest thing I've seen so far is the Power Token for 1000 gold.  So... IF you're relying on your wins to get you gold, you'll need 17 wins instead of 25.  You get daily quests, level rewards, game achievements, that are usually at least 1000 gold.  The End Result is this:  IF you see yourself -Winning- (Not Playing) 50 Battles per day, you'll see an extra 1000 gold from those battles.  But in the time you do those 50 wins, you'll probably get triple that in rewards of some kind.  Mathematically, its still better than zero, but for good items in the shop that are 15 Thousand Gold, you'll have to do some serious grinding to get there, with or without the boost.  Bottom Line, its a drop in the bucket.

The Player Community:  The good news is, so far, really haven't had to interact with anyone.  When you first login, you'll see whats being said in whatever chat you're put in.  5 of the 6 times I looked at it, people were arguing, insulting each other, talking about how bad their team mates were, along with some very derogatory and racist things that were said in one instance, that had several people say they were going to report them, etc.  I didn't stay to see how it ended.  You can hide the chat real easy.  Early on I tried to get some advice.  No one helped.  Later on I posed a really easy question, what can I spend my gold on.  No one answered.  There are Guilds, but I cant tell you about that function.  I've applied to several, but none have accepted my application.

This last item is just my opinion and personal dislike.
Rewards:  There are some easy to achieve daily rewards, but they are very limited.  For instance, I got a daily quest to win 5 team battles, get 1000 gold.  Done.  Season Pass, win 3 games, get a Supreme Chest.  Done.  Well now what?  Wait another day to get refresh the season pass reward, and get a new daily quest.  You can have up to 3 quests in your que at a time.  I feel like I should log in, once every 3 days so I'm not wasting my time grinding for less rewards.  When I first started playing, I got a Supreme Box every 3 wins, and it was awesome.  But after 3 Boxes, I have to wait 12 hours before I could get another box.  Thats when I learned you could only get 1 every 24 hours.  It feels very much like its encouraging me to be a casual player, and just play for 30 minutes a day.  Maybe a second box at 9 wins, and a third box at 27?

Lastly, some advice.  IF you've looked at the videos and you're thinking of giving it a try, definitely do it.  Its not to hard to pick up, and my first few days have been a lot of fun.  Save your resources and check the shop often.  The shop has different offers that can be bought with the Free in-game currency gold, and the bought currency rubies.  The offers change I think every 24 hours, so take a look, wait for something good.  Good Luck."

4135,the game
4136,"Good
"
4137,Fun game with lots of different possibilites.
4138,"Fun Game, similar to Clash Royale. Definately worth checking out at least"
4139,"It is a fun, balanced strategy card game with great character designs! Highly recommend."
4140,"[b]6/10[/b]

This game is fun. You can play it for some time without it getting boring. You can try out many fun or tryhard builds and play with friends. The big problem is, that it gets repetitive really fast. The top tier builds are all the same and it gets pretty boring after a few hours. Always playing with your friends/alone and trying out fun-builds also gets somewhat boring.

So overall I do recommend this game, but only because it´s free."
4141,It's like Clash Royal on PC! Super recommended!
4142,"Well... what can I say... I have played this game for 24 hours already but I barely used my brains. I won everything with the first deck created (with minor adjustments) until I got to Platinum (very recently) because I was placed against bots this whole time. A tremendous waste of time? Probably... But it definetly can be addictive.

At least I am very confident that they were bots. They are not labeled at all but the community thinks that they are bots. 

Plese, label bots as such and if you don't have enouth players then reduce the number of leagues."
4143,such a fun and enjoyable game
4144,its mostly bots
4145,"Game is marketed as Single player.
Game is not a Single player game. No Single player game mode available at all.

Multi player mode is a cash grab / pay to win.

Deck builder is lacking basic functions (like sort or filter for rarity).

[u]I'd refund if I'd have paid something. Such a waste of time. [/u]"
4146,"This is a game that knows what it's doing. Built on the foundation of similar games of the genre, Minion Masters encompasses all those great qualities and takes it to a place that is new enough to be refreshing and interesting, and familiar enough to easily pick up and play."

4157,"El juego tiene buenas graficas y movilidad, buena combinacion entre un juego de cartas y conquista de castillo. permite conseguir las cartas que uno desea con el crafting y al mismo tiempo te permite conseguirlas de forma random como los juegos de coleccion de carta regulares. la variedad de cartas es entretenida sin volverse tediosa  y funciones de cada carta  son lo suficientemente simples como para disenar estrategias propias pero al mismo tiempo tienen un meta-juego  que permite explotar las avilidades de los lideres."
4158,"Not as bad as I thought, more fun than most auto chess derivatives."
4159,Easy and fun. Don't really have to pay for anything. Plus for me.

4164,pretty fun and rewarding
4165,Game is really fun when playing with a friend not bad solo if you build a decent deck being able to freely build your deck is fun and there is 2 free masters in rotation so you can try a master and if you like them you can buy them game is pretty easy to pick up on only 9 hours and been enjoying the game im sure as i level up it gets harder but they challenge will be fun
4166,fun casual game
4167,"p2w, no skill required."
4168,"played for a while bought apep with the free currency i was given and minion spammed my way the way to gold rank before i got bored because the game doesnt give you enough cards to really experiment. unfortunate because the game is fun from a mechanical perspective. 

its also incredibly easy to rank up, i dont know if i somehow hit upon some god tier pub stomp comp or people really dont know how to build team comps, but once i got over the inital learning curve of just learning how to play, i dont think lost twice in a row, id always go at least 1-1, 2-1, etc. maybe that speaks to some balance issues im not privy to because i dont have the cards to to experiment with.

also fuck the lootboxes. if you are going to give me the illusion of choice then at least let me fucking choose. making a roullete wheel i can stop at any time only for the result to be truly random and not what i stopped the wheel on is bullshit. you may as well just remove that button press entirely and save people the extra click."

4190,Fun little game for free.
4191,Fun so far.
4192,I like the real-time combat.
4193,"It's ok...

The reward system isnt even trying to hide the fact it wants you to keep playing. 

After the initial tutorial tournament it has you battle random opponents, but the thing is i dont know if these are human opponents or just bots. 

Won my first 10 regular battles and realized i'm probably playing the AI, so it seemed like it was trying to trick me into thinking i was halfway decent at this game. 

Lootboxes and chests are just not my thing, i'm so over them and the game is fun but the motivation seems to be centered around loot rather than the actual challenge of the game.

4194,fun times were had
4195,fun for a free game play with the buds

4207,Quick to pick up and fun game.
4208,great game
4209,very fair monetisation and very easy to aquire cards for your deck and best of all most legendary cards which are the obviously the hardest to get arent even that good. most top decks play two at most so its very easy for new players to feel some form of achievement when playing
4210,pay to win exept ur are so bad u stay under gold rank . u can grind moste things exept that ppl with money have 4 times as much cards than u
4211,easy to learn.  Fun to play
4212,"Good F2P model, the game gives away a lot you don't need to spend much or nothing at all."
4213,Good Game !
4214,"Game is very easy to pick up, matches are very fast, good variety of unit types. definitely reccommend!"
4215,pretty neat little deck builder. and it doesn't try to stuff your face with microtransactions.
4216,It's very interesting
4217,"Fun game, didn't think I'd get so hooked so early on. I recommend trying it out."
4218,Good game!
4219,good game to waste time or have fun
4220,"Game is fun, hearthstone but better. Enjoy it while its free expansion is there!"
4221,this is a super simple and fun game to play. it also has layers... like onions onions have layers.... you get the point lol.
4222,Its pretty.  It has nice gameplay but goes from fun to defeat very quickly.  I suspect that this game is going to end up a pay to win.  I cannot seem to defeat opponents since I hit level 8 and am getting destroyed with ease.  Not fun. Its not for me.  Others will enjoy it and be better at it than I am without a doubt.
4223,it pretty good
4224,Its pretty fun game
4225,All this game needs is tons more masters for extreme diversity~

4260,"For free you can't go wrong.  This is quite fun and addicting.  You unlock enough things that you don't need to buy anything in-game (and it is quite expensive).  But progression does slow down once you start levelling up.  Balance seems okay, though I am only in silver rank so I can't fairly assess it at the higher level meta which I am sure exists and has not a lot of variety in builds.  At first I was intimidated that it was PVP only, but it turns out the match-making does a pretty good job to make most games fairly even and not stressful.

All in all I would recommend giving it a shot, if you don't like it, at least it's free!"
4261,"Pros
- Alot of cards and builds to experiment with.
- Currency are easily obtainable and isn't as grindy as other games since there are alot of free giveaways.
- Free
- 2 player co-op

Cons
- Constant micro stuttering ever since the release of this game causing you to lose at crucial moment. (Biggest con for me since you can't even enjoy the game.)
- Lack of top tier builds and deck meaning you will have to play meta builds in order to reach the top ranks.
- Zero communication from the devs.
- Buggy UI

You can play clash royale instead even though it's more pay to win than this but at least it's enjoyable and playable."
4262,10/10 game
4263,"i don't like this weird american cartoony art style, and it seems like a game that gets boring very fast"

You can't get the cards you want without spending way too much time or buying packages to make the grind a little better."

4325,"This game is actually fun! I was a bit surprised. Most F2P games that pin  you against other players I have found, lacking. 
The Graphics are really well done
The game play is simple, it is the other player that makes it tough! (which it should be)
Easy mechanics and controls to play
The announcer in the game isnt actually annoying but fun to hear.
Yes there are real money purchases that you can do, so far doesn't seem to give much edge to a player. A lot of cosmetics yes and like any well built that needs to stay afloat, premium packages. Which kills a long grind but the grind isnt too bad so far.
I have to give this game a 4/5 stars! Nothing is ever perfect but as this game grows, I can see it will near that sort of state."

4338,"This is a super fun game. It's easy to just drop in each day and play a few matches. Here are the Pros and Cons that I've found while playing this game so you can decide for yourself!

Pros:
1. Easy to learn. If you've already played games such as Magic or Hearthstone or Ascension, then you'll be able to pick up the basics of this game super quickly. 
2. Lots of choices without being too much. There are lots of masters to choose from, but there aren't too many so that you get choice paralysis. 
3. It isn't pay to win. You can get enough rubies to buy a season pass quite easily by playing around a dozen or so matches per day, completing all the quests, and taking advantage of the email codes the devs sometimes send. 
4. It has Twitch integration.

Cons:
1. Connection to the servers isn't the best. I regularly get disconnected when I try to join a match or even in the middle of a game.
2. The chat can be quite toxic. Some of the chatters are rude and use homophobic slurs. Thankfully there's a report feature."

This game is easy to learn and hard to master. The graphics are pretty nice and fluid and I really love the combat mechanics. It is not overcomplicated but not too simple either. I would definitely recommend it for people who like strategy/card games."
4355,"The game and controls are easy to understand so you can jump right into it.
"
4356,sweet
4357,"I put a lot of hours into this game in a short amount of time, mainly because it reminds me of the StarCraft 2 mod THE Card Game. The main difference between the two games is this game is busted. Matchmaking used to be the worst feature about the game other than the random unplayable lag that occasionally plagues the game. I am not certain which is worse, playing a grand master when I am plat-3, or facing the same game-breaking combos over and over again. The biggest recent offender is this new Mar Dred which is completely broken with two medics and it can only be obtained by purchasing a season pass. The game has potential, but right now it is unplayable."

4367,"Fun and easily digestible while still retaining strategic depth. Plays very much like a better, more in depth clash royale. Easy to sink a bunch of time into it due to quick and compelling matches!"
4368,very good...
4369,"With PC which you can play Withcer 3: WH  on ultra setting, this game lags and freezes with lowest and ugliest graphics.
FPS drops  from 90 to 0 for 2-5 secs every  30-60 secs. Impossible to play. It feels like a sad man with a wooden calculator.
1/5 games is lost because of freezes. Imagine fight lasts 3-5 minutes and you are frozen 20-30 secs of 3 minutes, it is ~10%-30% of game you AFK. 
Also you can not report player, because when you click report that afk dude you watch game defeat replay...
This game is like in alpha stage, not even beta. 
If you play it, think of it like EARLY ACCESS!!
But I got to silver 3 even with all this game issues shi* for  5  hours, ~2 PVE. 
Add here random chance and dudes with donated units. To get higher rank you need remove game and forget about it. Or wait when fixed or donate, but it will not help you.
Game become boring after reaching gold. Feels like machine, robot play, korean play. 
If you played LoLegends then imagine gold 1 here is like silver 1 there.
A lot of server issues and connection interruptions. I bought random box, called power token here, but received buying error RELOG or EXIT? Pressed relog, no money no token....
Got to platinum in 10 hours and then kicked from the game, match timeout, error random 1-1. Funny thing, I can not login back now, because servers are full, wtf kicked me for then?  Am I too good for them? So if server are full be ready to be kicked from the match and game itself. Btw, freezes are coz of  this, servers are overloaded.
Funny, that after 30 min I logged in and... all my card lost! EVERYTHING! I have 0 cards! How the fuck I could get to platinum without cards?"
4370,"Very well made, fun to play.. the announcer its awesome, if you like the Clash Royale gamemode you gonna love it"
4371,"Un jeux très divertissant. Stratégiquement parlement ces amusants. J,ai acun B molle a dire . Good Job"
4372,Great game. Very addicting.  Good grahics
4373,nice game ;) like the old days
4374,awesome
4375,ea\rsf\vfbh etys\rfgfrrdgf
4376,Playable.
4377,the game is super entertaining I love it
4378,"This game is like a real-time version of HS with super quick matches and allot of strategy, super easy to learn and hard to master.

Some says this game is ""Pay to win"" but i dissagree, you can win games with just common card at Master Rank. Even tho, you get ALLOT for free, almost have all the cards in the game all for free..
This is the least P2W game that is free that i ever plaid and i have plaid both HS and MtG...
"
4379,Easy to play and funny try it is good game! ;D
4380,"Game is a lot of fun, but honestly, the devs fucked up. They put a mechanic in the game called ""mana frenzy"" It gives the other team a SEVERE advantage. Whomever get it first WINS. 100 percent of the time.
Dont play this game and do NOT support these developers until they figure out their broken mechanics.
Its a shame too, cuz this game has potential."
4381,Fun game I do recommend the game.
4382,"This game is fun and make u loos some stress even when u loose :) super for adults and kids alike (I think)
Good luck people and try it"
4383,"Honestly at one point I quite enjoyed the game and I loved the idea of playing with people. Streaming was a plus as well being able to have my viewers in the stands cheering me on throwing the beer etc but, over the time that this game has came out this game became extremely toxic. You cant even try to explain it to the others that poking and prodding other players is just adding to the problem. The report function seems completely useless as I have seen the same person flame posting every 30 minutes and nothing stopping him from doing such. Using horrible slurs and all sorts of just negativity torwards a player who was probably trying to just learn the game. Once the chat gets better moderation or when the reporting is actually tooken seriously I might pick it back up. Until then I would heavily suggest you dont pick this game up as the community is toxic as all hell and the staff doesn't seem to care. Thank you all for taking the time to read this."
4384,Its an ok game to spend some time on you can have some fun without being super hardcore but it does not have the most content compared to the other games i have played.
4385,Fun game and its really good way to waste some time when im bored .
4386,honestly  the game good the graphic and the rewards make the enjoyable
4387,Awsome and highly addictive I tell U! In a good way :P
4388,Amazing game! Loving it from the moment  I started.
4389,good game.
4390,very gooood
4391,"Free game, and balance battle"
4392,Good gameplay. Easy and fun!
4393,"This game is a 
mobile game
with mobile graphics
mobile gotcha traps
with a steam game price tag
and everything cost real money
theres no way you can make it playable if you attempt it as free to play
DID I MENTION IT COST MONEY TO GIVE IT MONEY TO MAKE IT PLAYABLE?"
4394,If you wanted Clash Royale on PC this is the game for you. Thats all that needs to be said.
4395,Fun game. Lots of strategy. good animations
4396,"I thought it would suck, but when I played the game, I'm hooked

8/10 would farm xp for faster mana again"
4397,Fun relaxing game.
4398,"Didn't come into this thinking that it was going to be much, but as soon as I got out of the loading screen I was took by the excellent art and voice acting. Ingame is very fun as well, and you basically act like the god of a MOBA, with simple but very satisfying combat and interactions. It's free so the least you can do is check it out!"
4399,"Like Clash Royale, very fun."
4400,fun game
4401,give this game a try worth it
4402,Fun and easy to play and yet challenging
4403,good
4404,pretty good shit
4405,Is this game a chest opening simulator? I was opening chests for no apparent reason for more than 10 minutes. What a joke
4406,gg
4407,Nice game !
4408,nice
4409,Really fun game and with a very well made starting experience!
4410,it gud
4411,"What can i say? its a really good clash royale clone. and its also free to play, the pay to win aspect is almost non existant, thats great!
"
4412,Fun and fast card like game. The co-op play is really fun!
4413,Very casual but a little bit pay to win. Good thing I got money hehehehe!
4414,easy to pick up fun to play. smooth gameplay. playing it just to pass the time and so for think i might stick with it
4415,"Overall I'm a fan of this game, however the wildcard (duplicates of same cards in a deck) makes the game feel broken balance wise. There is no escape from this mechanic, even one of the best game modes, draft, allows wild cards. In this mode especially it just becomes so one sided the matches are not fun. I prefer 1v1 matches but wild cards make this so tedious and suck all the fun out of it, i can't really recommend the game in this state."
4416,V fun!
4417,I love the play style.
4418,Freaking awesome game. Found it today and i love it so far! i hope more of it comes about! Can't wait to keep playing and leveling!
4419,Very addicting game!
4420,good i like it ..... :D
4421,Its ok...
4422,"Game's alright. Looks very monetized, but if you are into the ""cards spawn units that run down lanes"" type of thing this seems like a competent one with some strategy to it. If you are into these sort of F2P games this is definitely worth a go."
4423,"i think this game is fun because it is realy fun so much to it:)
"
4424,"Such a fun game. Wanted something like this from 2003, when Magic The Gathering: Battlegrounds come it."
4425,"Really fun, havnt seen a cheater yet"
4426,Very good very nice :D
4427,played a cell phone game called siege but this game is AWESOME
4428,"MM is one hell of a game. Is it repetitive? Sure.. but thats the point. Is it p2w? I dont.. think so. Everyone can get every card. You cant pay for cards (atleast not specific ones) and while you can buy Masters, No one master is overpowered. You do, however, have to buy in to the season passes if you want every reward. But the Free season pass is more than generous enough. If you find you cant win matches, its not that the other player/players have amazing op cards. Its just they have a better deck than yours. This game is all about deck building. While a deck may have BETTER cards than yours, they are in no way op and can be taken down easily with the right strategies. Git gud, as they say. While that may seem like a joke, in a game like this you either Git Gud or continue to lose."
4429,Awesome game to pass time.
4430,yes
4431,"Turns out, those games can be hella fun after all!"
4432,"A game that's a bit underground.
It's like a mobile game, but on PC.
They're very generous with their free items.

Very fun to play in 2v2."
4433,"Fun to just pick up and play. Easy to learn. Hard to master.
"
4434,Pay to win
4435,gam gud
4436,"is kinda fun when u don t have what to play :D
"
4437,ss
4438,It's a super cute and fun game! Especially when you play with friends. :)
4439,"Played for just under 4 hours, first 30 minutes is the tutorial so 3.5 hours supposedly playing ranked. In that time I lost one match (each match is about 5 minutes). So either all the lower ranks are full of bots or lots and lots of people who don't have a clue what to do, looking at the steam stats for player count I'm pretty sure it is bots. I'm not interested in playing for another 10 hours against bots just to get to play against other players."
4440,I enjoy it so far
4441,addictive fun fun fun
4442,"If you're looking for a halfway decent game you can play for free to kill a few minutes here and there, that's all this game is good for.  If you want a balanced game worth spending money on and sinking some time in to, this is not the game.  Every season pass includes overpowered cards you have to buy, which of course they nerf later after everyone bought them.  The dev team doesn't seem to have any native english speakers or else they failed miserably at reading and comprehension.  You will be confused about the text descriptions of some of the cards because it's worded so poorly that it leaves you guessing.  Of course you can buy the card and play it to find out what it does.  They claim to want to keep this a free to play, but it's clearly pay to win."
4443,its good
4444,"Honestly, this game is a ton of fun. It's very easy to get decent cards, and I haven't gotten super high in ranking, but things seem pretty balanced. You get enough currency for free to buy cards you want, to a certain extent. Games are like 2min-6min, which is amazing after getting tired of the 40-60min competitive games I'm used to.

Not sure about how good it is if you're serious about being good after playing a lot, but 20 hours in it's very fun just playing casually."
4445,Very easy to play game! If you wanna play and let time pass by ... this is the best game for that!
4446,"it's great.. unfortunate you cannot account transfer from console to steam
"
4447,it is simple and entertaining without too much efort
4448,its epic
4449,"Fast paced. Easy to pick up and understand. Lots of cards. Graphics and audio are good. 
I haven't had a problem finding matches. No more than a few seconds wait time. The cash shop isn't pushed in your face at every turn. 
all in all 10/10  I may start playing more often."
4450,"Fun game solo or as team! good to c they change things up every now and then. Collecting all the cards was
my biggest goal of the game! 7/10"
4451,"One of the worst, unbalanced, pay to win games ever created. I can't even believe it's legal to make such an unbalanced pay to win cash grab. If you don't want to shell out cash constantly, then don't even bother playing."
4452,fun & easy to pick up.
4453,"So quick and easy to play, great fun with a friend for team battles
"
4454,"THe game is simple, but fun. At least at first. We shall see as I get furhter in. So far a good initial impression"
4455,"Fast pace and simi good card system
"
4456,"If you enjoy deck building, while not having to worry about losing your gaming groove during long breaks, this game is ideal for you. I went away for a couple of months, hopped back into the action, and still feel the deck groove I had going on before. It's easy to pick up and put down, and it offers plenty of content; from climbing the PVP ranks to the rather challenging single player Adventure Campaigns."
4457,"Barely ever review games but this one is great and relaxing for me :) never spend money and feel like I can get legendary items very easily and get rubies, shards and money just fine by playing can get to diamond and happy with that!"
4458,"The graphics are great and the game play easy to learn.  This game is a lot of fun
"
4459,"quick to get into and enjoy, only played for about an hour so far though."
4460,"for players who are done with the bs of clash royale and want some different bs from a new game thats quite the same

tbh kinda like this game though"
4461,Fun game easy to play
4462,"very fun. i like dying
"
4463,"A great learning curve, and fun flavor!"
4464,"so far so good, just got it today tho so we will see."
4465,"Minion Masters is a free to play PvP game hybrid of Deckbuilding & Tower-Defense.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Play 1v1 - or bring a friend for 2v2.  Collect 200+ cards.  Has global chat.  There is only 5 solo games at the tutorial, after that you are matched against other players.  I guess there are players playing, i saw some chatting on the chat.  Of course this game's devs is out to make money so there is plenty of monetization: battle passes, DLC, and such.  Looks like you can play all low mana cost cards as an effective deck.

Try it, if you like PvP CCGs, delete it if you are itching to spend real money."
4466,"Fantastically made and under-marketted game. fast paced, fun, easy to grasp and understand for beginners, but competetive hen played right. truly brilliant game"
4467,seems good
4468,I stabbed some guy in the heart with a trident.
4469,good yes
4470,"Not pay to win, can unlock everything with some time without abusive grind"
4471,"Slightly thumbs down. The core gameplay is fun at first. But most matches play out the same and get boring before long. Also the game is FAR too heavily influenced by mobile cashgrab games. There are so many popups, sale notifications, ""free"" loot constantly popping up in between matches, it's really just too much... 

Also 90% of your multiplayer matches will be against bots disguised as players.  Not good man."
4472,solid voice acting fast matches
4473,Amazing fun
4474,The concept is certainly simple but the variety can make for some complex strategies!
4475,The game can be fun to play.  Reduce draft mode fee or give daily free draft mode entries would be nice.
4476,Minions
4477,"Fun, easy to learn, hard to master. Definetly is awesome consdierng that it is free
"
4478,"Game is getting too greedy. Legendary cards are extremely powerful and you can't get them in season without paying cash. The only way is to wait until next season and use shards, which can take months to assemble enough of, effectively locking non-paying players out. The old model was that you could earn the season legendary way way way deep down the season line, or earlier if you paid for the pass, but now they can't be earned at all."
4479,"for a free game 5/5.  matches are short and fun, deck building is fun, cool cards, cool mechanics.  the game is competitive yet relaxing"
4480,it's pretty fun and free so give it a try
4481,fun game
4482,"good game
"
4483,"Minion Masters suffers from a lack of creativity. It becomes incredibly repetitive and stale super fast. All of the top tier decks have ""staple"" 2 or 3 mana minion cards to quickly shuffle through their decks, which is essentially the premise of the game. Spam low cost mana spells and minions to obtain bridge control (which is how you generate exp and level your Master for upgrades/power ups) and overwhelm your opponent's base (their Master).

Don't waste time, currency, or money gambling for chests to obtain legendary cards...the top tier decks don't use monster cards that cost more than 5 mana, and very few if any have a single legendary card in their decks. Every card has a cheap counter and the devs have gone way overboard with the release of the newest cards, such as a 3 mana spell (Unholy Ground) that can be casted anywhere on the map (yes even on your opponent's side right next to their Master), spawn skeletons every 0.5 seconds, AND it roots all enemy flying monsters. Any type of creativity in making a ""theme based"" deck is thrown out the window by the simple fact that many of the cards are highly situational, even in the best circumstances. Theme based decks are gimmicks and suffer from impracticality. For example, Lord Sentinel Thelec, a 10 mana cost card (the highest mana you can have at one time is 10), only spawns additional units to his side IF you have 4 spell cards in your deck. You also need to build up to 6 mana to activate his passive, which increases his attack speed, meaning you can't use any other cards otherwise you'll go below the 6 mana threshold. Then (as I mentioned before that every card has a cheap counter) you need to hope that your opponent doesn't have a cheap 3 or 4 aoe mana spell card that can obliterate all of his elf archer spawns putting you at a major mana deficit. He belongs to a class called ""Crystal Elves"", which requires the player to keep your mana at 6 or above at all times to activate their passive effects. In a game where minion numbers triumph over all, this is counterintuitive since you would be putting yourself at a major disadvantage by not playing cards just to keep your mana high. 

Gargantuan minions, albeit cool to spawn, are again countered by the simplest of things. 9 mana cost Colossus has the slowest movement speed in the game and takes a whopping 4 seconds just to attack. Guess what? There's a 4 mana card called Lightning Bolt that can delete any random enemy minion on the field. Too risky? Don't worry, BetaDwarf Entertainment has you covered. Just use a 3 mana spell called Stun Blast to stun all enemy minions in the area for 5 seconds. Or, cheese with low-cost flying minions that Colossus can't hit and watch as they peck away its health in seconds. Or even more rage inducing, send a 4 mana cost Ghost to steal your high cost minion Colossus (just make sure to send it with a bunch of low cost minions so it doesn't get killed while it's possessing the Colossus). 

Want another example? Stormy, a legendary 5 mana flying minion card, needs to have a constant source of healing (atleast another 3 mana or 4 mana depending if you use a Healing Shrine, a Priest, or a Healing Fireball), needs to fly over a random growth shroom to gain a measly 100 health (only generated by playing a theme class of cards called Zen-Chi), can't be hit by any flying minions or cheap spells or else it will die practically instantly - all because of the fact that this minion damages itself every time it attacks. Again, you will be left at a major mana disadvantage once all is said and done just to pull off this card. 

In other words, why bother? Just check the Leaderboards and copy whatever the Grandmaster players are using. You will see practically the same cards being used, with slight variances or preferences. There's nothing wrong with meta, but when the majority of cards are impractical or highly situational, it leaves much to be desired in designing your deck. You could obtain the staple green, blue, and purple cards in about 2 to 3 days tops of common play and have a deck that could take you to Grandmasters in no time. 

Take this game for what it's worth - a F2P card game that will probably burn a boring weekend's worth of your time at best. I have 107 hours clocked in, mostly from trying out different decks and themes only to go back to the drawing board because they simply don't work against cheaper, easier to summon cards."
4484,fart
4485,good grind
4486,GET THIS GAME
4487,"Excellent game, very addictive, been playing for 2 weeks and haven't spent a dime yet, but have most of the cards (thinking about buying premium just to support developers).
Would highly recommend."
4488,"its good
"
4489,Great chill game. Would recommend!
4490,"jesus destroyed me in a 1v1, sad."
4491,It's a nice game to play from time to time.
4492,Très plaisant!
4493,lol
4494,good stuff
4495,"Game is fun, sniipers good"
4496,"Fun game, highly recommended!"
4497,Having a blast trying different combos.
4498,This game packs so much strategy into every 5 minute match. Unbelievable value.
4499,"greatest game ever
"
4500,Enjoyable !
4501,"i love it the co-op is sick
"
4502,"Clash Royale, but better."
4503,"fun game, get it on sale though!"
4504,"It's free,

Thats a great price!"
4505,"Fun game, doesn't take itself too seriously, but the gameplay is wonderful."
4506,lots of fun
4507,it's fun
4508,"Pretty fun I guess

EDIT: Nah, if you get disconnected from the PvE -SOLO- adventures, it's counted as a loss and you must restart. That's just obnoxious and unnecessary. If this is fixed, I'll pop this back to a positive review"
4509,nice game to play when u need to chill haha
4510,It's tight.
4511,"i had this game in my account back when it was not free , i got it through a free code , i jokingly said look at this shit game and installed it for the memes , and i was expecting the worst game ever , and its way to fun for what it is , very chill defo play"
4512,fun game
4513,good
4514,gud game
4515,its lit
4516,"Great real time strategy. Easy pace but fun and fast. Simple but nuanced. Multiplayer friendly (need split screen). Fun and interesting ""minions"". Would love to see new cards, or a new faction all together. MORE MASTERS. Over all, awsome game. I highly recomend. Just be ready to put on your strategic thinking cap if you wanna progress in PvP."
4517,"This  game is so addictive, i had to write a review for it. If you try it and it clicks for you like it did me, and many others then say goodbye to the time you spend playing a lot of other games, haha.

I would say the game is a cross between a tower defence game and a deck building game.
 It is mainly  either 1v1, 2v2 (randoms) and  2v2 (pre mades) but it did have an adventure / story mode added.

 There are different masters  with different perks, so you can  get quite different results depending on the master you choose.  (you CAN buy the masters, but you can also buy them with shards you earn in the game, so you don't actually need to spend money to buy the masters) What i initially like about the game is that the games are generally quite short, but they can last up to 10 minutes in some cases... 
it is FREE to play, but certainly  NOT pay to win, its more like ""play to win"" as you will get better as you play more, and learn tactics from when you get beat. Also, the DLCs they release which are extra card decks they add to the game have been free their first week of release, but often you can get stuff on twitch prime too

It has a fantastic community on twitch of people who stream, and you can also earn free gold, and house keys towards special unlocks if you watch them and they get a ""watch and win"" game, and they often do giveaways for  ""dwarf packs"" and ""big dwarf packs"" which give you  gold, rubies and power tokens for the game. it's also a good way to learn how to play  the game better as many of them are explaining what they are doing and why

my words of advice for it are.. 
1. spend your blue shards on the masters first, don't waste them upgrading cards
2. save the rubies for the season passes,  you get loads of extra stuff in those
3. always remember to log in the shop each day for your free token and check out the offers which change daily
4. join a guild, try and do the guild conquests to help your guild earn ""glory"" which helps earn special card unlocks for all in your guild.
5. link your twitch account for minion masters drops, to earn free loot and gold  for ""watch and wins"""
4518,Poorly balanced. New players get wiped out by over matched experienced players. Cannot quit a match. It is better to allow quitting matches because what if real life matters require it? We can ctrl+alt+del and end the game from there anyway. Might as well allow quitting a match.
4519,"Love the game, only have an hour or two you can have a lot fun. I have almost 400 hours in. My only concern now is the season pass at the cost they are asking. If its going to reset every 3 to 4 weeks and the pass is 15 dollars every time, new players will be turned off and only the real hardcore people will stay. That's 200 dollars or more a year. Even having the money I can not justify that cost. Beta Dwarf please find a reasonable solution I have never minded supporting developers they need to be paid to but not even Blizzard is that greedy."
4520,I'm in the top ladder
4521,it is a very exciting game.
4522,Legit fun
4523,"pretty darn fun game, similar to clash royale but a lot more enjoyable bc it doesnt feel so serious, it feels as if more focused on having fun"
4524,A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4525,fun game to pass the time!
4526,"I play this on again off again, this most recent on again I like it better. The new art, re-balance, and new cards keep the game interesting each time I return for 10 hours or so."
4527,More tower defense than strategy. But could be fun. Building deck is slow. On slow connection many timeout errors.
4528,This game is very interesting!
4529,Wonderful artwork and Limitless Possibilities to the combinations this game has to offer.
4530,It's good. bit of a grindfest. But good.
4531,very good game
4532,Amazing game so far!
4533,"Fun game, very interesting minions. and it's free. probebly will spend money on it tho"
4534,i am being forced to play this  please help
4535,"i like the strategy, the action, and the interactive part like your avatar and stuff!"
4536,.
4537,"consistent fun, quick to get, up to 10 minute games. I like to randomly try different decks out and make my own style. I'm sure there are cookie cutter decks, where you get cheesed, by a similar build with someone who has bought DLC. but i occasionally still beat those decks, without paying anything. I mainly lose because my deck is meant for different cards. ALso you get a bit of RNG for what cards start when. so sometimes if they are out of order against an opponent, you will lose no matter what, so you have to adjust your deck to help stall a bad orientation to their deck."
4538,Very good game
4539,"amazing game, just love it"
4540,Good fun for everyone
4541,Great game all around
4542,Really fun way to kill some time :)
4543,"Quick, fun, with strategy depth"
4544,"Bof, animations d'ouvertures de coffres très répétitive"
4545,"Game is very fun to play, not really a pay to win market but it can help u get better cards faster. Overall this is the best f2p game for fans of deck builders."
4546,"Seems worth trying, but I'm not sure about long-term support and the competitive scene. It's fun though."
4547,"this game is super addictive, and in my experience very fun. i enjoy the strategies you can create, and the modes they have to teach you new things. With updates that really enhance game play and add more game modes id def give this game an 8/10. If you like to spend money to support the devs and the games you like i believe you wont see any problem with the things they offer, and as someone who doesnt spend alot on IGP i think you wont feel like there is a huge paywall in order to get longevity and enjoyment out of this game"

4549,fun game
4550,awesome
4551,Shame we can't port our accounts over from Discord
4552,"Honestly suprisingly decent game given its premise and that its free, also really fast ques. grinding to get new cards isnt actually a grind."
4553,bestest geane
4554,"Fun game, not super competitive easy to learn, non greedy developers."
4555,yes
4556,do try it out
4557,"Well worth a 5* review after 40+ hours in the game and power ranking to gold in 4 hours I can say many positive things about the game :
Not time extensive you get in and queue , queue time aproximates at 10 sec 
Game has a weird vibe to it 
Animation is fluent 
Game idea is a awesome frankenstein monster but it works fine
People on the lader dont stick to a speciffic meta.
Most things can be purchased with in game currency (faster at least than other games)"
4558,Liking it so far ! Fun gameplay !
4559,Easy !
4560,Fast pace and easy to learn
4561,Its very fun if u have friends
4562,This is a simple and extremely addicting game!
4563,"its jsut got great charecters and enjoyable
"
4564,is a very nice game
4565,"This game is AMAZING! I highly recommend you play this game, the rounds are nice and quick meaning there isn't a huge time commitment and is super handy if you are waiting for something to cook in the oven or be microwaved! The progression is also really wonderful with you not needing to sink a huge amount of time into the game to get something that works! 

There are also many champions and factions to pick from giving you a huge combinations of decks you can play around with!

I invited many of my friends to play 2 v 2 team games and they all loved this game! 

Friend or not grab this game and get battling!"
4566,"fun, addiction!"
4567,Play this game with a friend.  Two player co-op is amazing.  Loving it.
4568,Awesome casual game that still requires skill and isn't pay to win. Very addictive
4569,"Love this game, been playing it since bones and bravery <3"
4570,"Basically, this is a mobile game. Not sorry. Actually good tbh."
4571,"This game is really addicting when you play it. I can't express how much i love this game there is always something to do. For example the events in every season feel refreshing.
Long story short play this game and it's free which is insane."
4572,"Its Really Fun If You Play With a Friend,I recoment it!"
4573,Fun game :)
4574,im a noob at this game but i like it
4575,"I... Can't... Stop... this is worse than League, in the good ""One more match"" kind of way."
4576,"Excellent, casual, underrated game."
4577,smbol very fun
4578,"fun gamef i dont know who tho
"
4579,great game
4580,Cool game. Free. Addictive. Many different types of units and customizable decks.  :)
4581,"Really good and all but p2w so no use ..
"
4582,fun game
4583,"Imagine if Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering allowed you to drop cards on a table and watch them fight it out in real time. The composition of your deck, timing and placement in the arena are your keys to success. Highly addictive and not pay to win at all."
4584,Enjoyable!
4585,fun
4586,"Nice combination of tower defense and card game style. 

The pay to win part is pretty minimal. Don't need legendary cards, if you play good combinations."
4587,"● Fast matches
● Fun gameplay
● Very quick to pick up
● Simple concept, yet still requires thinking
● Broad selection of cards
● Fairly balanced
● Definitely not P2W
● Always active, easiest game to find a match in a few seconds
● Constant updates (i.e. balance patches and new content)

-Matches may get laggy for no reason

[h1]8/10[/h1]"
4588,yes
4589,"Hard pass on this.  

To start off, the game is free to play to a T. There are three currencies, of which two are premium, and a number of different types of loot boxes. You have your ordinary loot boxes, which you seem to get from random quests (I guess?) and power tokens. Power tokens need to be bought. They go through the obviously over the top dramatic opening (in this case spinning possible rewards) and then you get something, usually a card. Great. So, you can't even buy the cards you want to make a specific deck- it's all a gamble. On top of that you have your ""Master"" who gains special abilities. Great, but you also have to pay for them. There's a free rotation, but the majority of which will be behind a paywall. Just like every other freemium game they have thrown every possible wrench in the system to ""encourage"" you to pay. That alone is enough to make me not recommend this game... BUT!

The match making is terrible. In two of the five team battles I played, my teammate was AFK. They don't even get replaced with a bot that will auto-use things- no, you just have to suffer through it. And if you leave, you are the one that gets penalized. If there was a report function, I couldn't find it. There's a chat box, but you can only choose an emote. Great. In the few 1v1 matches I played, I was mostly matched up against newer players (I think), but the moment I played against a veteran I was squashed. I didn't have a chance at winning. The game doesn't feel balanced- and it doesn't feel like there are different strategies. Everything is just a flavor of putting units on the battlefield and watching them march. I don't enjoy that. It's like when playing MtG, turning things sideways is most certainly a valid strategy, but I prefer to fog you until I mill you out of cards. Without a diverse number of strategies, this game falls severely flat for me.

Graphically, the game looks like a mobile game. And that's fine, but combines with the poor gameplay, the terrible matchmaking, and the unscrupulous freemium nonsense- no, don't play this game. Don't support freemium games. Tell them to shove it and move on."
4590,Most fun card game I have played so far.
4591,"overall a fun game much better than auto chess games out there. 
-its more tactical and interactive
-requires a little pre-game thinking
-its free and i didn't mind dropping $20 on it for ""ALL"" the heroes you can play as 
-the heroes have there own unique play style to further customize the game 
- and the 2v2s are super fun ans add another level of strategy so bring a friend its FREE
-and if your solo finding a nice guild or making your own can be a fun way to make friends(have not tried yet)"
4592,good game fun to play.
4593,Delightful deckbuilder / tower-defense hybrid. Not too complicated. Long matches are 9 minutes.
4594,is good
4595,"Active time ""mana"" based card game. Cards range from 0 to 10 mana per card. Melee ranged and area attack type units with strengths and weaknesses unique to each. Its a fun way to survive the pandemic."
4596,awesome game
4597,AYAYA
4598,Dope af
4599,Its Fun!
4600,fun tower base worth having a crack
4601,"Easy to pick up and play for hours! Quick games, and a great community!"
4602,"It's like a less clear version of Clash Royale.
And less fun.
I was busy, and I accidentally started it, and I couldn't quit, even after beating the first stupid match for it.
0/10
Bad game"
4603,Is game. Is free. Is mtx heavy. Is still fun. Is recommended.
4604,Super spiel für alle fans dieser art
4605,seems fun
4606,"A very cute game and a fun little way to relax. I absolutely adore the magic critters I get to summon into the field. Kind of like a massage for the brain, relax and it eases the aches. I approve.

Also, I got to play one of the Devs, I enjoyed that. I think the name was ""Cracker"" or some such, I vaguely recall a number, had a Box-with-legs as the portrait. If you read this Dev Cracker: Good Game."
4607,great quick co-op game
4608,Nice Game!
4609,too addictive
4610,"Coreupted made gangsta rap do it to me

-love ya girl, ted"
4611,"I Have pretty much tapped the game's free to play pool.
It gave me an incredible amount of hours of fun for free.
The dev's are very generous,and I can't really complain about anything serious.
If you looking for a free game that can last you a long time without an unfair grind,go 4 it.
Worth the download."
4612,"Wow, a game that isn't an absolute piece of shit.  How refreshing.
Minion Masters doesn't cheat you like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone.  You aren't playing bots and you aren't getting your money stolen.

The only real issue I have with Minion Masters is their monetization model is garbage.  There really isn't any extra content unless you pay for it and that's too bad, but it redeems itself with the simple fact that it isn't a garbage bag like other games with better monetization models... so what can you do... wish in one hand.. shit in the other.. which one fills up first? (::hint:: it's not the wish one)."
4613,"Slightly more engaging than auto chess type games, but not as overwhelming as standard collecting card games"
4614,It's free and easy to catch up with everyone else.
4615,Great game to play with a friend.  Quick battles that you can fit into to short periods of time.
4616,the monkeys are too good. and the hard bingo
4617,"The game is a solid 2-lane tug-of-war, and especially fun in 2v2s with a friend.
The pricing model is fair.
BUT - God forgive whoever art-directs this game because I will not. The theming and visual design are atrocious."
4618,vvery nice game
4619,its bare good ya know
4620,"Reminds of me a yugioh style type of summoner battle thingy lol if that makes sense, either way super fun!!"
4621,:D
4622,"I'm enjoying this much more than I thought i would.

If you like Clash of Clans try this."
4623,"fun, great customization of deckl, realtime card game, but pay to win, but that is to me expected in free games like this. they gotta make money somehow"
4624,Actually very fun! Gave it a shot and was well worth it!
4625,"Fun, Short, throughtful."
4626,"Really fun game, highly recommend it!

Not at all p2w, they are very generous with power tokens and rubies (which you use to unlock cards and masters).
Early on when you first start you may not make your perfect deck, but its play to win - if you play you get more cards and masters!

The cards, Minions & Masters are fun and easy to learn too.

Check it out!"
4627,gg
4628,"decent fun so far
"
4629,nice free game
4630,cool game
4631,Best game ever.....i`ve been looking for something like this for a really long time !! Keep up the GOOD work !!!
4632,fun & addictive
4633,2v2s is definitely where its at
4634,"FUN TO PLAY, EASY TO LEARN!"
4635,shit remind me of clash royale instantly left
4636,Its pretty good
4637,The game could be described as Clash Royale for the PC ... I don't like it ... but there are probably a lot of people who like this game :D
4638,"This is a fun and addicting game once you get into the competitive feel. The game is about using decks of cards strategically and summoning 'minions' to defeat the other player. Both the deck and the Master Summoner you choose make a big difference. The battles are setup like a sports arena match, with a energetic announcer beginning and ending your matches.

The game does separate players in ranked teirs, so as you win more matches, you are slowly matched up to more people close to your skill level.

The rewards keep you pushing to play more, and eventually, this game will try to get you to buy rubies and packs with real money. So far, I have not needed to.

Pros:
Progressively challengeing fights

Adventure mode gives you a challenge without human players

Vast array of different tactics that can be used with different cards/deck/master setups

Battles for the most part, feel very balanced. After a loss, you can often tell where you went wrong.

Cons: 
Not for co-op, as making a team with someone you know, will make you a 'pre-made' duo. You will NOT find matches.

Rubies take time to accure without spending real currency. Blue crystal currency which is in-game currency, is based mainly off the power tokens (card packs and such) that you open.
"
4639,rf
4640,amazing gameplay and graphics.. love the character and spell cards and abilities of the master characters... hope to see more in the future plus some possible tournaments and or competitive games
4641,i love this game
4642,very
4643,.
4644,"Great deck building game with a fair bit of strategy. Best bit for me is playing duos, even if its not your friends. 

Matches are very quick, often under 5 minutes including match search. Great for when you only have 10-15 minutes and go through a few rounds. Even if you get a bad matchup it will be quickly over and on to the next. 

Devs have been pretty generous with limited time free expansions and bonuses for newsletters."
4645,this game is pretty damn fun
4646,"Addicting, very addicting."
4647,good game :)
4648,"Fun, easy to learn, low demand on your system, looks good, no masters or cards withheld for people not willing to pay."
4649,THE GAME IS SHITE
4650,"So far at least, I enjoy the gameplay. The card unlocking doesn't really seem to scratch the itch, however. At first you get thrown these pack after packs, then they dwindle down to mostly common chests that don't really give you much. It's the much rarer cards that are game changers, as expected."
4651,this game is funand quite simple to play
4652,"game is excited but the problem always crash and error sometimes disconnected suddenly from the game mow this game always disconnect , relog from server. this game is got worst"
4653,"Minion Masters has a relatively straightforward premise for its core mechanic, but it involves a much deeper execution of strategy, timing, and deck building that ultimately make it fun to play.  When you’re actually in a battle, whether it’s against a single opponent or in a 2v2, your main task is playing cards mostly on your side of the battlefield.

Many cards will summon a unit that will march its way toward your opponent’s tower on the opposite side of the playing field via one of the two narrow bridges.  Their goal is to do the same with their cards and the units will usually fight one another in the process.   It’s very simple to do, which makes the game immediately appealing, but there are ultimately a lot more strategic layers to keep it engaging.

Minion Masters is easy to pick up, but the simplicity hides a game with a lot of strategic depth. It has the potential to be something big if they can work out some balance issues and maintain a solid playerbase."
4654,"its a very, very fun game at first, but after a while it got boring. Same thing over and over, the gameplay is strictly a 3D card game, but its not as fun as it sounds. There literally ONE thing you do in this game, and the updates don't change the gameplay AT ALL."
4655,"Saw my buddy Pandarama on twitch playing it, didint think much of it, but its actually pretty fun. I really like it! Great Game"
4656,great game
4657,"Kripp is saying this is the best CCG, Tower Defense Game, and CCG Tower Defense game. And I have to agree so far. I see untapped potential in this game."
4658,"Liked it.
I had no internet in my dorm so I kinda stopped playing and afraid to play it again."
4659,best game ever. this is probably the most played game I ever played in all time :D.
4660,game is simple.. good variety and easy to learn
4661,Yes
4662,Fun so far
4663,"A simple tug of war card game executed to perfection. Everything I see and experience with this game makes me like it more, very free to play, the first things you get remain viable, or at least as far up the ladder I've gotten ;P. With that said I did lay down some cash to get Sargent Settsu, with her desert camo. I regret nothing. Immensely replayable short matches matched with a simple to understand hyper tuned balance across the whole game make this a pleasure to recommend to people."
4664,"Interesting premise, and 2-9 minute matches make it easy to play casually."
4665,Love This Game And its Multiplayer too Sweet
4666,Fun game to play with friends
4667,It's so chill :) good game to play if you want to relax
4668,"BUYER BEWARE!!!
I want to add a personal experience with in-game items. I liked this game, so I found it reasonable to support the devs by buying stuff. So I started small and bought the starter pack.
The pack was advertised as containing 15 power packs, but I only got 4.

So I contacted the dev and it has been over 2 weeks, and no response. I even sent another mail following up my case, but it is complete radio-silence.

I googled purchase errors on this game, and went down a rabbit hole of people getting the same treatment.

So for people interesting to expand upon the game: BEWARE! If you get something else than promised, you are stuck with that, and will get no help on the matter.

This is a shame, really, as I was contemplating buying the premium upgrade to lessen the grind. But as the saying goes ""A burnt child dreads the fire"".

So, on to the actual review:
Game is great!
Play the game... just don't buy the stuff!"
4669,Its a fun and mindless game. If you want a time sink and just want to chill out while still gaming? This is a fun one to have.
4670,funny
4671,Awesome game
4672,dxxxx
4673,yuhhh
4674,Wow...its just fun...fast and awesome in its glorious battleness....yup thats a word.  I enjoy the quirkiness and creative classes and dont mind throwing a few dollars into the game.
4675,very fun good music
4676,fun so far!
4677,dope..what else can i say! good fun game
4678,Developers are amazing
4679,Awesome game! Free to play not so much paid to play MUST PLAY!
4680,"my friend told me about this game and it is the best game i have had in quite a while  
"
4681,some clash royal vibes but its allright 8/10
4682,K
4683,"good design
good innovation
good card balance
bad elo"
4684,best game en its free give it e ntry
4685,"very easy to get into, still early days.....but very fun so far."
4686,its cool
4687,"Its really fun. Plus if you have someone to play with y0u can do some wicked strats, and who doesnt love them?"
4688,Fun to play with friends
4689,"A fast paced-game that is easy to learn  and difficult to master.

The best part is it is very free to play.  Some in app $$$ offers but I never felt I've needed any.

Enjoy the addiction!  I command you!  =)"
4690,Very addicting and fun!
4691,it's a strategy game but with more tactical positioning
4692,"Awesome game, super fun in Duos."
4693,"I wouldn't recommend this game. It's an unbalanced mess, and while the devs occasionally try to nerf stuff, they simultaneously buff other stuff, ensuring that it never reaches some sort of equilibrium or state of balance. The playerbase is also dwindling with every month, and that small playerbase is further watered out by the multiple game modes.

Excessive amounts of RNG and cheese combos keep it from ever  having any sense of fair competition. It's more likely you'll lose to either a meta that 80% of the playerbase will play because it's easy to win with, or you'll run into a deck you don't have the right cards to deal with. There is no semblance of balance here, and I would not recommend any long term stay, as the funfactor only lasts maybe 10-15 hours, and then you get to see the ugly seep through the cracks.

If you want something free, there are better games out there. There is nothing this game offers that another game doesn't offer, but better.  They also keep cramming season passes down your throat with a new lineup of cards that are either busted or extremely underwhelming with no in between. This has been a repeating pattern with every patch"
4694,"Played for like 3 minutes, loved it so much I bought the whole masters pack, now I've played 8 hours only on King Puff alone... still so much to try. 

Amazing game, really fun"
4695,"It's great, but full of chinese bots."
4696,"Very fun, and a decent amount of variety of minions to customize how it's played."
4697,easy to get addicted to. really fun game
4698,Meh
4699,"Actually having a lot of fun with this game. Still early, but so far so good."
4700,"great game , entertaining"
4701,"it's good
"
4702,Enjoying to play those kind of game and its free i love it
4703,"Overview of the supplement ""Charging Into Darkness"". The developers decided it was time to make money. They reduced the battle pass to 50 levels, while not reducing its price (1,500 rubies). Now, collecting rubies for the next battle pass is not possible  for active gamers - just donating. For the cost of 2k rubies for 1 month battle pass, an extremely greedy offer.

Developers do nothing anything with game chat. Writing long messages (> 20 characters) still truncates the message. Guild descriptions are only in English (other languages ​​are not displayed). “Do you want a chat? Entertain yourself” try to put together a guild in discord.

The guild system does not move anywhere. And it would be possible to create in-game tournaments between guilds, with a grid of winers and other features.

Adventure ... It's hard to say something here. I got the first adventure right away. This is a big mistake. There is nothing to do there, and adventure rewards are not worth the rubies spent. It would be better to make a new game interface or something else. There are many other problems in the game.

In the game with a beta version. The game froze in development from that moment. Cards are constantly updated, for which I also go into the game. Although they often break the balance, as if they did not test the changes in the cards before releasing them

I strongly supported the game and the interest of other people in it, but I’m already tired of doing this for the sake of a project that does not develop qualitatively

[b]UPD 15.10.20: [/b]  Hellowing update. Game lugs in main menu... In match dozens of frames just disappear. Minions teleporting... No comments"
4704,Good times!
4705,fun with great graphics
4706,"Seems like a pretty simple fun game so far. Enjoyed it enough to know the premium upgrade is a good idea!

4707,it's fun loosing

4709,Great :D
4710,look at my hrs. Playing for 2 years

4720,"its a pay to win game.  if you dont spend money, don't expect to get very far.

if you spend LOTS of money you can be good at the game"

4731,the gun go boom splatttt
4732,LOTS OF FUN
4733,"the game is fun for what it is but it runs like shit during battles despite being no more complex than your typical flash browser game and the loot box ""power tokens"" make zero f_ckin sense, the arrow might be on a preferred rarer type card but it'll still sh_t you out the same common card that was probably on the complete other side of the randomly selected cards"
4734,Addictive AF
4735,Bery epic yes.
4736,"Fun Fun Fun and addictive card-based action game with a kind of tactical gameplay. Love the 2 vs 2 mode.

What i like is the ""quick a short round"" game between one and maybe eight or nine minutes. Good for inbetween but be careful, sometimes you play much longer because it is motivating ... only one more round!
As you can start with no cost, have a look. Worth your time!

Unique Gameplay alone and together.

After having over 100 Cards i still dont get the Achievement.
Reported the Bug ingame and on the Discord. 
There are plenty more Bugs, which are older and still not solved.
For me it seems, that they are not caring anymore...

4742,"It´s the best f2p game on steam, period.
I managed to get into global Top20 without spending a dime.
Midway I bought some 14.99$ supporters pack to support the devs with this awesome game."
4743,Great Game! Very Addictive
4744,good game
4745,Great card game that they keep up with and balance as new ideas and cards are added. I love it!
4746,This Game is Very Fun When Playing With Friends and They Support Streamers Very WELL Thank You DEVS For THE GREAT CONTENT
4747,"The games animations are cool and creative. I'm addicted for now, nice work!"
4748,"Mana frenzy is the shittiest thing ever created. The purpose of the game isn't to destroy the enemy master, no, it's to control the bridges so you get mana frenzy, granting you a guaranteed win. You shouldn't care about your master being at 300 hp, the only thing that matters is that you have more xp than your enemy, and in the end, you will win by spamming every card you have. Why it can't be like in Clash Royale, the one with the lowest hp loses? You just have to make cancer. Good job to the retard who thought of this."
4749,"Amazing free to play game. This is really a free to play game constant cards, skins, tokens given away every month. A unique way to play a battle it with decks of live action cards."

4751,"Great game love it
"
4752,Yes
4753,"Seems like a good game, the mechanics are cool, the tutorial could explain certain aspects of the game better though"
4754,"Minion Masters is a fantastic game for both competitive and casual players! As a fan of competitive card games, I am very impressed with the wide variety of cards, heroes, and viable but entertaining strategies. Every battle feels unique because unlike other similar mana-based PvP games, there is no well-established meta. Instead, gameplay emphasizes adaptability to the opponents' base deck and tactical battlefield control. Furthermore, each hero has unique perks that can be earned by controlling bridges to gain experience. Therefore, even small decisions can have large strategic impacts, keeping gameplay fresh.

Minion Masters is the best free game I've ever played, and it's honestly much better than most games I have paid for.  Developers keep improving the game as well, continuously improving balance while adding new content and cards.  This is also a great game to play with friends!! This game has my highest recommendation! :P

Pros:
-Lots of re-playability, including many strategies to experiment with
-High quality graphics and detailed character models
-Whimsical sense of humor
-Frequent updates, with good responsiveness to the community
-High sense of impact for spells and units in combat

Cons: 
-Occasional bugs during battle
-Requires good, continuous internet connection
-Minimal guidance after the initial tutorial

Collect different kind of Scrats, create a balanced team and command your Scrat army. You can battle alone or in 2vs2 matches. Scrats. They carry the whole experience. I love them all."
4756,a lot of fun especially with a friend but i feel like some cards need balancing and crafting is a little difficult
4757,"A game pay to win with huge breach between player who pays for upgrades and full power in low levels versus players who wait months for pay for a card

Administrators and other staff, invisibles for the f2p players, never listen nothing

The multiplayer match play is really unfair, when the main objetive is win X for advance and not can win for the matchmaking


Only a 50/50 for all


PS: 50% if this message is readed for a owner of this game"
4758,"Love the graphics so far, the animated interactions are great too."
4759,Its a very good game! You can easily grind for premium currency for free
4760,Really fun. Game's not p2w as long as you know how to play your deck.
4761,This game's fun. I actually wish I could play it more. Check it out.
4762,"While it's free to play, it can be also pay to win and rank up. Don't bother"
4763,"It's kinda fun, but has no real depth. Also I'm not sure if the matchmaker doesn't put you vs bots because I've lost maybe 4 games and played like 50 with the basic first master and cards you get for playing the tutorial. Worth a try tho, it's free anyway."
4764,Niceah
4765,"Easy to pick up and play, even after a long break"
4766,Fun quick games. Like the team battles a lot.
4767,Too addictive you have been warned :)
4768,It's fun for a bit. I've played it enough to recommend it. Especially based on the $$ I've put into it (which is 0). I was tempted to start putting some cash in but eventually decided to just put the game on the back burner. I have many games I've already bought and haven't finished. This is a good side piece for sure whether you're looking to kill time or relax. I'll probably keep checking in from time to time.
4769,.
4770,"Fantastic game. The meta supports multiple viable heroes and a solid mixture of units. Game is fun, easy to learn, complex to master. Matches are easy to find. Graphics and sounds are well done. I tend to be a bit cynical when it comes to games, and find few that I like, but this is the best game I've tried in a long time."
4771,"Rly fun game to play. Good graphics, and no bugs so far for me."
4772,"Minion Masters is a fun game to play alone or with friends. It has a nice ranking system and good really good pvp and strategy elements. The game makes its money from selling card packs but don't expect to win just because you bought a bunch of cards. Strategy over takes spending power in this game as I have reached the Grand Master rank without spending any money. This game is definitely fun, free, and easy to start."
4773,Enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Team battles are fun and there are a good amount of cards to use in your decks.
4774,so far so fun
4775,Game is fun and very chill and very fast! Getting hooked on it !
4776,"I have been playing this game for 2.5 years on the discord version. Whatever you do. Stay the fuck away from this game. One of the worst experiences you will ever have in a clash Royale clone. You are guaranteed to tilt and get frustrated at this game, because it is not balanced at all. Refusal to nerf or remove wildcards (which let you play the same card 3 times with no drawbacks what so ever) have made ladder the worse experience you'll ever have. Not only that, but this is the only card game I have seen that shows your deck on leaderboard. All this does is promote copying and stealing the top decks, which just makes ladder the same 5 decks. Not to mention the rank system is entirely flawed, letting people with 50% winrate or less be able to reach the highest rank in the game. 

Let's now talk about performance. This game has NO optimization at all. Constant crashes, freezing, and huge in-game delay even if you have the slightest ping spike. Plus, this game used as much RAM as GTA V! Absolutely fucking ridiculous that a game that is only about 4gb uses more resources than an 81 GB city roaming game. Be prepared when using a graphics card' cause this game will happily eat up all your GPU even at lowest settings. 

My final complaint is the balance team. First off, not a single person on the balance team plays the game, so many cards will be nerfed or buffed to make them useless or overpowered. Plus they are CONSTANTLY adding more and more cards into the game even though they have not balanced every single one, and on top of that the existence of wildcards just makes it worse. The developers are catering to bad or new players, while veterans like myself have to suffer. They recently nerfed control cards and most of the 1 drops all because they thought their wildcard rework would fix the game. But to their surprise, it buffed wildcard decks. 

In conclusion, the devs are incompetent of fixing their game or listening to community, and would rather make this game a quick cashgrab with loads of bugs and crashes. Stay away from the game. If you want to play a game like clash Royale, then play hearthstone, myrhguard, or many of other clones that exist in the market. This one is just not worth your time, anger, and money."
4777,"hi play it it is a good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
4778,"I only tried this game cos of twitch prime rewards, honestly enjoying it way more than i expected to haha 

Good little game :)"
4779,Amazing
4780,"Fun & addictive game !
Fast paced strategy - games can be as short as 1mn.
Not really pay to win since you can achieve decent rankings with a cheap deck.
although you'll probably want to get all the masters."
4781,Great game!
4782,"pretty fun. fast gameplay, easy to understnad controls, the only thing i think is annoying is the lack of (im going to regret saying this) challenge.... i  mean, just swarm to win lol"
4783,yea
4784,Very fun so far. Easy to pick up and play. Fast paced for easy login and play when you have five children that is a huge plus.
4785,Its okay
4786,It's a pretty solid game.
4787,no words :)
4788,Great game loving the animations
4789,broken marriage out of 10
4790,good game.
4791,"Very bad interface especially the summarize after each match.
it always accidentally close and can't go back to such summary information."
4792,"It's similar gameplay to Clash Royale, but better; more dynamic cards, left to right layout, and a 2V2mode that I absolutely love."
4793,cool game but quickly annoying
4794,this is a nice game
4795,"Fun game, reminds me of clash series of games, but this is far more refined and playable."
4796,good
4797,"Minion Masters! Oh boy. Definitely my surprise of 2020.

I was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did and still am. I've never been too big a fan of cards games, but to my surprise, I really had fun with this game. It has a very original spin on your usual generic uninspired card game. If you're not too keen on this genre, pick this up and give it a shot. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised, as I was. 

It's a very easy game to get into and pick up, tons of replayability thanks to the myriad of different cards and decks you can build. Interesting masters that spice up deck variety. I have almost every card in the game now without having spent a single penny in the game, so you can definitely have fun in this game without having to spend any money. No cash grab or P2W here, fortunately. 

Most importantly, I can play with my partner. We're long distance Europe-Oceania, so it's always hard finding games that we can play together despite our ping difference. This little gem has provided countless of hours of fun that we were able to experience together. 

Download this game!"
4798,MINION
4799,Very fun game! Fast paced and exciting.
4800,"The game is fun
Playing with friends is the best"
4801,ok
4802,I have played this game now on both PC and Xbox and LOVE IT! I enjoy all the fun little minions I can send to pound the other side's minions. It's just a fun game!
4803,To be honest just thought it's be a battle royale which it kind of is but it does it better with the added in game xp and 2 lane capturing idea. GREAT GAAAAAME!!!!!
4804,"Minion Masters is a fun and addictive game. I love how short the matches are so you don't have to worry about it taking ages which leads to you playing for longer. I am enjoying the new content, would recommend this game to anyone!."
4805,"A highly addictive game that is fun to play, i am over 100 hours into playing Minion Masters as of writing this review and i'm yet to spend a single penny on the game. It is entirely possible to play this game without putting any money down and you do not feel like you're at much of a disadvantage to players who are more inclined to open their wallet. Not to say that you do not have an advantage by buying your way into a vast minion collection, it just means that you have more combination possibilities.

Overall i recommend this game as a fun casual game, its made even better if you have a friend to play with and try and come up with an interesting combination (or in my case a combination designed entirely to be confusing and stupid enough to work)"
4806,It good.
4807,"A rewarding game that's easy to pick up with quick games. Every bit of money you put in the game is respected in a way. Getting multiple copies of cards is something to do at end-game and is actually mostly unneeded to progress. The crafting system is rewarding, and unlike other games that make you get rid of cards to craft new ones, you will obtain your crafting material with your cards, never being forced to shrink your collection to create something new."
4808,Not good gameplay is ok
4809,Great game! Surprisingly fun! Legendary cards not necessary to win and very free to play friendly. It doesn't have a very robust competitive scene but it's good for casual play. More fun if you play with a friend.
4810,super fun
4811,"great game
"
4812,"The gameplay is fun,the game gifts you ton of free items and the DLC is free the weekend it releases,great game!"
4813,Kinda cool little area control game.
4814,Once you Get good rank it is fun to play 😜
4815,"It's free and it's fun. There are some little tricks and strategies you can learn rather quickly which makes it incredibly easy to win most of the games. However, at a certain level that stops and you are actually challenged. Also this is not pay to win. You can acquire all cards without putting money into the game and it doesn't take too long to get to the point where you can mix and match enough of your own cards to make decent (or goofy) decks. I recommend."
4816,"Good game,beautiful design of models looking foward for updates and expansions"
4817,Um jogo divertido para quem gosta do estilo springs frongs forever plus.
4818,"great game, always fun"
4819,Fun so far!
4820,"really fun actually, and nice graphics"
4821,it good
4822,free drip
4823,Fantastic game!
4824,Turn off your brain - dumb fun
4825,Its pretty good !
4826,Game is pretty good for essentially a CCG
4827,Its ok for free
4828,fun game
4829,awesome game!
4830,"Not bad, needs more balancing changes. Not pay to win. 

8.5/10

EDIT: Betadwarf ruined the game"
4831,Good fun and not pay to win.  Tons of combinations and playstyles.
4832,"Clash Royale but sideways. Received the DLC for free, not gonna complain. Gameplay is 8/10."
4833,perfect game to show ability
4834,"arkadaşlarla sarıyor
"
4835,"Fun and relaxing game to play, even better against friends"
4836,Superfun chill game. You only need mouse and are worth some fairly cheep ingame purchases.
4837,"Minion Masters is a well-executed and well-maintained free-to-play card game. You build a deck of ten cards, which you then pilot on a real-time 2D arena. The core of the game is summoning minions, which march on their own toward the enemy and fight other minions. Deck-building, minion placement and timing, and using spells effectively comprise the skill of the game.

Minion Masters supports 1v1 and 2v2 multi-player, including a pre-made team mode to play alongside a friend. The game's freemium mechanics are generous; you can purchase cards and cosmetics with real currency, but building a complete collection without spending any money is reasonably attainable, and getting any particular card you want doesn't involve much grinding.

One of the biggest appeals of the game is its quick pace. It fits a satisfying tactical experience, with counter-play and adaptation, into games that last between 2 and 7 minutes."
4838,"I enjoy this game a lot, it's certainly one of my favorites. There at a lot of different game modes you can play (solo, team, adventure, mayhem, etc.) with a massive amounts of strategy. This isn't one of those games where you have to pay to win, it's fairly easy to obtain new cards, coins, and rubies. There are different ranks you can play in ranging from easiest to rage. The battle tiers are always fun to try to complete. You will always get the occasional troll who has a ""funny"" deck and might cost you the game (in teams) but doesn't every game have those? There is a nice variety of cards to play with as well none of which you have to pay for with (real) money, all cards are obtainable by playing. Overall, I think this is a very fun game and a good time waster (if you're into that). It's not to hard to get a good deck going and it's very easy to form a strategy."
4839,"Fun deck-building but also pretty strategic. I have paid zero money and can still buy packs and masters, so it's not p2w which I love.

Overall i am enjoying it :)"
4840,"Overall it's a fun game, and plus they give away expansions for free all the time. I'd argue it's worth a try."
4841,"Fun game, lots of strategy but pretty comedic as well.
"
4842,"I like this game a lot, more than ""Hearthstone"". Very dynamic and fun, especially ""Team Battle"" mode. It's really fun for me to put as many snipers as possible and watch them shooting everything. At least for now, this game is great and rather addictive."
4843,"it fun, i can watch samurai jack while playing it. 10/10"
4844,"I downloaded this for the kids and now I'm the one who can't stop playing! I don't even like cards games but this is more reminiscent of a game I really liked a few years ago "" Magic the gathering: Battlegrounds""."
4845,So savage dope I love BLOOD GANG GANG 4 LIFE BABY WE SHOOTAS IN THIS BIH
4846,Amazing
4847,"It's so simple and yet so much fun! It's very fluid, easy to understand, and the queue for matches is very short."
4848,Really funny game! Short matches.
4849,I jUST slam DUNKUMMED@yoMAMAhouse.gIZZMAIL.coM
4850,Quick and easy games. Fun but could use more UI and QoL improvements. Hard to learn this game because the information it gives you doesn't make sense until you play a couple games and the card organization is not there. Still fun and better than Team Fight Tactics.
4851,"It's a fun free game that can be played by anyone.
"
4852,"very nice, cool, and fun game!"
4853,"I've owned this game for quite a while and it's been sitting in my back log. I've finally come around to try this and the game itself is pretty good, though you do quickly hit a pay wall. I don't mind supporting developers of free to pay games when the content is worthwhile, it's not pay to win, and they don't use obtrusive advertising.

I've done about 20 battles and enjoyed all of them. They're much quicker to play than you may think, many battles are over in 3 or 4 minutes, though these presumably get longer as you face more skilled opponents in the higher rankings. 

If my overall impression is positive, why then do I not recommend this game? I've only been playing for a few days and I feel like this developer is doing anything they can to scam you or trick you into purchasing their paid content at every turn.

Every time I click on one of the special offer pop ups like the starter pack, the rewards multiply by two to try to trick me into buying it. I gave in and bought one yesterday because it said I'd get 1500 rubies rather than the 500 it initially offered. Once purchased it reverts back to what the original offer was. 

I keep getting a pop up asking if I want to allow notifications on Steam. When I press NO, the Steam prompt pops up as though I clicked yes. I think have to reject it again, close the steam browser, then close the overlay. Usually I get this pop up when I'm idle in the menu or browsing the store for more than a minute or two.

Sometimes I go into the shop to see what the offers are and if they'd be worth buying. About half the time 'Account upgrades' pops up and blocks my view. It won't allow me to close this window by clicking the back button. My only option is to click in to one of the premium upgrades and then go back out through the shop.

They also offer you weekly free content when you sign up for their newsletter, which seems like a great trade-off if you're planning on playing the game long-term. What they don't tell you until you try to redeem the second code you're sent, is that you can only ever use a single code of each type so there is really no point in getting these."
4854,pretty cool game totally recommended
4855,GReat
4856,similar to hearthstone but different
4857,"This game rocks! Very easy to download and learn, endless amounts of fun!"
4858,"After about 3 hours played, i can say that this game is very welcoming and innovative. Much of the chemistry here is already in use in other games, but not in this genre that i'm aware of... Good graphics, cool game-play and a fresh breath of minions. Have fun!"
4859,"Simple yet fun to play game. Much of a tower defense sort of thing. Short matches, great fun!"
4860,"This is what happens when tower defense meets deckbuilding.


Great concept, it's fun to play with an amazing Co-Op experience.

If you're looking for something competitive with the ability to be creative when it comes to deck construction, this is your game.


also it's free, stop reading reviews and install the game and try it already it's great.

I'd give it 6.8 / 10"
4861,"Simple game, easy mechanics.  A pretty chill game, I've enjoyed what little I've played of it."
4862,Fun game but the average player is a scrub i beat them while playing with my feet
4863,"Good enough to kill some time if you have nothing to spend it on. 
It does not require a lot of time per-day.
But that's about all it's good for.
Has issues of course, and while they seem to be still working on balance issues a little, they never ever seem to care about performance issues. 
The game has memory leaks all over it but those are never fixed.
No matter how many times i reminded, i was ignored flat.
Whether it's Unity to blame or they're just too busy or too lazy... the issues remain. 
And they're annoying as hell.
The fans on your video card will probably tell you all you need to know about that when you launch this game."
4864,can play while drinking a beer
4865,"With the last update, grinding is much worse and season is much more costly. Not worth the price tag or investing money in the game, really."
4866,"yo this game kinda dope
"
4867,So much fun and great graphics! Thanks to sennyk4 for telling me about it!
4868,"easy to pick up, polished, enjoyable, quick, and relxaing game 5 star"
4869,"This is a so-so game. If you like Clash Royale, then I recommend this a try. I am playing this to get the achievements."
4870,steam's clash royale?
4871,very fun free game. love it. hope to see more very soon!
4872,"This game became unbalanced. 
Too many cards that are hard to counter, too many easy to use decks that grants a win, too many pay-to-win players and streamers who likes to win easy with impossibile building cards, or zen-chi cards, or spam hordes, or crystals. Guild conquest is impossibile to do against these cards, to advance through the game with non-cheesy cards is very hard. Generally, playing with non-cheesy cards is really impossible. 
This game became very ungrateful for normal players who likes to play with their friends that doesn't necessarily want to win all the times.

But the gameplay itself is not the only problem: the steam client is very buggy and unstable after the recent update. Crashes, slow loading times, framerate drops. Is really a mess.

If you want to play this game for the first time, remember this: be carefull.."
4873,Pretty fun to play.  Only level 10 but pretty cool so far.
4874,"Haven't played long, but so far so good. Only one AFK-er, and nobody trash talked. But the day is still young."
4875,"you need good timing to do well and its fast pase and fun 
"
4876,Fun Relaxing. drinking coffee... :)
4877,"Weak gameplay, gets boring quickly, pay 2 win, terrible aesthetics, bots online (I guess not many players still playing, eh?). Overall I rate it garbage/10."
4878,"pretty enjoyable game, great time killer for sure. some skill at higher levels, but very easy at low levels."
4879,Good one
4880,"I was really enjoying the game after a long break. I made a deck idea, grinded for the materials for the cards, and even spent some cash to support it for the Hero that I wanted. I made a really fun Accursed deck that revolved around having your units killed to eventually get some nice bonuses, however it was apparently really strong at later ranks. Instead of nerfing cards here and there, or adding some counter play, they instead reworked the entire system. Before you needed 15 Souls that came from select cards, after gaining those souls you'd have unique abilities on other select cards. The good thing about Accursed cards, and the deck that I made is that it was a low mana cost Zerg-type deck that allowed me to stall until I could get to the point that I wanted while buffing my smaller units. 

They ended up changing the mechanic from playing cards and getting souls to playing cards until the amount of Mana you've spent has reached 40; which sucks for people, especially me, that had low mana cost decks that revolved around this mechanic. The update ruined the fun that I had with the game in one fell swoop and making it so the way I enjoy deck games (zerging and rushing enemies) boring, because now I had to have more focus on having some bigger cards.

I would suggest that if you've this far to look at other reviews about changes they've made that the community don't like, for I honestly didn't care about anything else but this. I was having so much enjoyment with my deck, no matter if I won or lost, because of how well it fit my playstyle."
4881,A pretty fun tower defense/battle arena/RTS card game. Doesn't feel very pay-to-win which I consider a good quality in a free to play game. Seems like there are multiple deck-building strategies and options and they regularly tweak the stats of cards for balance reasons.
4882,"Logged in 100 hours. I do recommend this game for people who like card games... Now I am bad at card games but this just my speed.

It doesn't have a steep learning curve like other card games, but it does offer a nice easy to understand battlefield and the cards are not overly convoluted.

I say give Team Battle a try and even someone who is inexperienced to card games might find themselves sticking around. When I started I had no idea what to do, and now I am 100 hours in with no signs of slowing down or stopping.

Give it a try =D"
4883,great game
4884,outhouse
4885,"WHALECUM TO MINIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN MASSSSSSSSTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERS
The voice acting man, MAKE IT STOP, or hire professionals PLEASE. 

Also, when I get new stuff, I want to skip it rather than clicking it one by one. 

Lastly, this game is infested with bots. You can tell a BOT when they summon two things at once in DUOS."
4886,good game. fun time.
4887,very good for the type of game
4888,"I open the game after two years of not playing but grabbing the DLCs when they were free, get thousands of stuff with no way to skip. Spent a hour getting everything with a autoclicker.

It was fun before, missing some balance but otherwise fun. Nowadays it isn't fun anymore, there's no balance with way too many bad and OP cards. It's just trying to suck out your money. This isn't new with F2P games, but there's a limit."
4889,Yes
4890,"Have been playing this game for 1 hour!!! pretty easy concept, however there is alot of possiblities with different master & deck to play to experience different gameplay, highly reccomended if you wanna grind !!!!"
4891,Know it all
4892,not well balanced
4893,"Good mechanics, easy to get in to and seemingly well thought through"
4894,Easy to play. A lot of fun. Quick Games
4895,I THINK ITS GOOD CUZ ITS GOOD
4896,i would enjoy the game mroe if i could get my level 30+ account from xbox good game though
4897,gaaaa
4898,I like how giving they are with content.
4899,"cool game really fun.
"
4900,enjoyable
4901,good
4902,Its fun. wish I had more time to play
4903,It be a game that I like to play when i'm bored.
4904,"""Hearthstone 2"""
4905,I have enjoyed every single moment from tutorial to the grind. LOVE IT! :) 5/5
4906,battle is a good way of comunication without words
4907,fun
4908,It's similar to league of legends in the way it matches 2 teams together. It mostly reminds me of the LoL Team Tactics mode they introduced.
4909,good game
4910,super fun and addicting
4911,Simple game that can get you hooked easily. I definitely recommend this game to people :)
4912,"Free to play (for the most part). Definitely don't need to pay to have fun. I paid a total of 5eur and I'm in diamondleague now. If you really really want to climb the ladder you'd have to either farm for an eternity or spend some more real currency. Definitely not a pay2win game in my opinion, as stated by so many comments."
4913,Freaking amazing! Great to play with teamup and community! Absolutely love the game!
4914,Mindless fun
4915,With changing session pass and compressing the meta they lost me as a player. I don't like being pressured into playing to keep up with the meta with no alternatives and means to catch up. Also bots now even have guild tags and use emotes so the illusion of a playerbase is consistent. This hits the uncanny valley of deception for me. Together with the price increases throughout the board the picture is not nice.
4916,"Once a great game that gone the path of many F2P games: Getting too greedy.

+ Gameplay is okay. Very casual, not that deep. But mediocre balance is making the frustrating too often.

- Season pass price has been massively increased. It's now 1500 each month which was 1850 for 3 months before. And the rewards have even been reduced by a large amount. Now you are expected to pay more, for less content and even play more to get it.

- Casual appeal has been killed for me with the season changes. Before I could play a few weeks/days in 3 months and ""participate"" in the meta. Now I'm in a constant rush to keep up each month and would essentially need to pay 3 times as much.

- The devs have a strange perspective of balance. They often change cards for no apparent reason, devaluing youtr investments. Often they nerf cards that aren't remotely oppressive, ignoring the real problematic cards (that make up a large part of the top 100 decks).

- Community is dying. The game is only kept afloat with bots to fill the matches. Bots now even have guilds and use emotes to be less obvious to be bots.

I hope they will reveart the changes when the player numbers inevitably will go down."
4917,Is good
4918,be prepared to become addicted!!!!
4919,Yes.
4920,"Didnt think id like these kind of games, but this one has proven me wrong so far. Limited playtime so far though."
4921,"The streamer i watch (Shanksy) recommended this game, at first i thought ""deck building tower defense? huh?""..and then i started playing and ..yeah..this is damn fun.
"
4922,"It's a good game but...

Edit: This game has the worst matchmaking i've ever experienced in a video game before, i get it that there are not that many players but when you're master which is like the third best rank in the game, you should not queue up against the 5th best guy in the world. (contender 5).

Old review: Very fun game, it's like clash royale with a mana system instead of elixir. The twist with this game is Bridges and Heroes with different perks and. If you are agressive and own the bridges you get more xp and therefore you level up your hero quicker unlocking game changing perks. The graphics are really cool, every character is different and unique. This game also has a shit ton more of different cards compared to clash royale. Minion masters features 2v2, 1v1 (both competetive) and a campaign.
Some people might say that this game is pay2win and well, I mean you can pay to unlock cards quicker but that's not necessary since you can unlock them very easily by just playing the game. 
This is one of the most generous developer that legit has released every dlc with a 100% discount. I've gotten every content dlc for free excluding premium upgrade and all masters upgrade. 
Anyway this game is just awesome and addictive, no reason to not try it out since it's free."
4923,"Wasn't sure about the game at first. But actually having a really good time. Lots of fun, and very simple! 8/10 would recommend!
"
4924,reeeeeeeeee
4925,kinda fun
4926,fun card go woosh
4927,"the flow of the game is fantasic love the different creatures, only problem i have is if i have enough gold to buy a token spin not going to store to buy one is annoying , not a game flaw just me being lazy keep up great work"
4928,DA GAME GUUD KAZ ME DA BESTZ ME DA BIGGESTZ EN DE HARDESTZ. ME EZ SO GUUD NO ONE CAN BEAT ME MEAT. ME SO STRONG. BIG BETTA DEN DE RESTZ
4929,The devs have no idea how to create a campaign.  Every single campaign even on a normal setting is a guaranteed loss by the time you get to the boss.  They've had multiple tries to get it right.  They're getting it wrong every single time.
4930,"It's pretty fun if you like games similar to clash royale

You can also just buy a permanent xp and gold boost and/or all current and future masters for 20 bucks each
"
4931,All
4932,addicting. im garbage
4933,"Easy to get into, fun to play. Lots of interesting characters and plenty to unlock. 10/10
"
4934,Clash royale 2
4935,Some of the most fun I've had in years. So much fun to play with friends. The 2v2 mode is absolutely amazing.
4936,After several seasons and one bad review. I've decided this game has finally become fun and more adaptable. The Devs are  good at listening to the community on most occasions aside from the delayed 3 cost rammers fix. Over-all a fantastic game with a great community. Streamer friendly. And great friends.
4937,"It's fun but I remember playing Magic the Gathering Battlegrounds on the original Xbox which was vastly superior in every way compared to Minion Masters. Minion Masters is fun but it's a cheap rip off of a 15+ year old game. Also,  you only get one mana bar, which severely limits your ability to tactically combat your foe."
4938,This game is fing sick and i recomdadada
4939,The game eases you into the game and it's really fun trying to defend your side. The narrator is silly but you get use to him being around.
4940,its a really enjoyable Game and relaxing and fun game and really interresting game i strongly Reccomend it! go play it now ! :)
4941,good game but kinda boring but still fun to play
4942,I think that the game is quite fun and entertaining. I enjoy the aspect of all the silly things that the minions say! Also its just a great game in general.
4943,this game has no hentai but its kinda fun 10/10
4944,"What an absolutely fun game! Great graphics, very entertaining, no bugs at all so far."
4945,very well made
4946,"Cool game if you are one of the so-called Minion Masters
"
4947,what better than super chess? minion masters.
4948,Pretty good
4949,Only like an hour into the game but I really like the mix between ccg and tower defense. It gives a bit of a dynamic play to it.
4950,Pretty good team battler.
4951,good
4952,FUny with friends
4953,"Minion Masters
fast game with modern day graphics with easy controls that moves from location A to B to C and so on,
good amount of action and special effects,

good game.
Personal Suggested Purchase Price: NA (Free To Play)
"
4954,"This game is fun.
But i would put a negative review on any game that lie.
When you look at the battlepass it is mentioned that you can buy a lv for 250 ruby (premium currency).
My issue with it is that it is also wrote all level need the same amount of exp , which is false.
You can see after a while that the amount of xp needed for a level is rising.
Other than that the game is fun and all but i do not support lie like that , it give community trust issue regarding all the other statement the game will make hence the negative review , i cannot put a positive review on a game i can't trust no matter how much fun it is.
"
4955,A surprisingly addicting game. Simple to learn and so much fun to play
4956,"A fun PvP strategy. Basically Clash Royale for PC. It's got a great range of cards, a plethora of events and gamemodes, including my personal favourite 2v2. It also gives rewards all the time (I've gotten like 10 rlly decent card packs from the newsletter). They often give out their DLC for free too so look out for that if you wanna get the most out of the game for free."
4957,Game is... surprisingly good. I was expecting another dota or league of legends knock off but it's different.. it's actually quite fun.
4958,Its better then sex with an 10/10 east european woman age 18-24.
4959,nice
4960,i love this game so much.
4961,"Fun, quick games that are great to destress in."
4962,Pretty interesting
4963,great game
4964,Really fun
4965,Nice game
4966,"Awesome game. They really do a lot to make the players feel good.
A lot of Streamers for the game and drops for players watching them. The game is not pay to win, like many other games like it. The Master and Card interaction is cool and the xp System in the Matches is a realy awesome strategic element."
4967,It's very quick and fun rounds and it's easy to understand
4968,fun free to play. really addictive and if you decide to spend money - things are cheap
4969,"Its nice, pretty and fun too, if you like this kind of game (clash royale)"
4970,"Fun simple game play

"
4971,This game is fun to play. It is my first time
4972,cv
4973,its cool
4974,"don't let the look of this game fool you, this is a super underrated gem hybrid of RTS, CCG and fun."
4975,This is way to fire it will somehow take your mooney
4976,"Not pay to win. It does help though with unlocking more options. YOU CAN GET ALL CARDS JUST BY PLAYING. 

Fun and easy. I wish it explained a little more with the menus and a little more in the beginning, a friend explained it all. The UI could use some work.

I'm having fun playing and will continue to play it,"
4977,great game very addicting
4978,"It was fun for a time, but the game play become monotonous for me.
And then you get the same ""Free to play"" money grub that gets old."
4979,"As a person who has trouble understanding games ,this one i got sucked into ."
4980,"Fun RTS / CCG hybrid. Hard to go wrong with the price of ""free""!"
4981,"played as a joke, stayed forever"
4982,"it's like one of those multiplayer card games. But it has diffrent kinds of heros, special abilities, and cool looking charecters."
4983,Nice !
4984,fun
4985,"Minion Masters is a fun game that is easy to learn hard to master and allows for a lot of varaiety in deckbuilding, tactics and gameplan. Best part of it, it's free to play and free to win. I only invested once into the all Masters package and from there on never needed to put real monye to the ingame currency and am able to compete at Master Levels. I can recommend give it a try."
4986,It's getting more balanced in every update.
4987,not bad
4988,"I love this game, but with each update I wonder why I still keep playing. Why introduce new cards just for them to be instantly nerfed? I find most people in higher ranks using the same couple decks because there's not enough variety of good cards to use anymore. Great concept & a fun game but i'm burnt out."
4989,"FUN GOOD
"
4990,"it is similar to Clash royale

i bought it before and now they put it for free :DD 

also fps drop every time unstable idk why ? Anyway , fun game especially when i play 2v2"
4991,Best Chill Game Ever
4992,Lots of fun so far!
4993,Great game having fun!
4994,taco
4995,Free to pick up and fairly easy to play. A cute little time advancer
4996,gg
4997,Stop advertising that the DLC is free.
4998,its fun
4999,"I used to really enjoy the game but the balance has rapidly deteriorated and the Devs are getting more and more greedy. 

In terms of Balance, there are 10 mana cards that can easily be nearly entirely countered by 3 and 4 mana cards. It makes no sense and has nearly entirely ruined the game for me.

In terms of greed, Season Passes used to be 60ish days meaning you could play at your own pace and still finish all ranks reasonably. Now they have nerfed each season down to 30 days meaning you have to grind non-stop or shovel out cash to complete your seasonal ranks. 

I am very disappointed in the direction this game is going and am not hopeful for the future."
5000,"Great game, but there are some mistakes in Chinese translation. I can help proofread Chinese content. If you need help, please contact me"
5001,Addictive :)
5002,"Loving this game! Super colourful, very initiative, and really easy for new players to get invto!"
5003,"the game itself is fun, however, don't expect any help from the customer support.
I have been sending emails over weeks. The only replies I got were from the bots. None of them were properly addressed and replied by their staff.
Don't expect any sincere help/support from this game.
Their staff would just want to take your money from buying shards, but refuse to giving support  when you have queries."
5004,absolute cash  cow.
5005,interesting timepass
5006,great game love it.
5007,great game
5008,"Three reasons:
1. Pay to win game. OK, no matter what others say about tactics, strategy, etc, the core mechanism itself already decide that if you pay more for the game currencies, you will have better things. 
2. Bugs, bugs everywhere. The game desync twice in an hour even with very good internet connection.
3. I always try to avoid ""free to play"", the game was offered to me with -100% price. I thought, well, yeah, this is not this kind of ""pay to win"" game. How disappointing after wasting my time, I realized that the core mechanism itself is ""pay to win"". Bad business decision for a game with original/unknown character and no story whatsoever. Pay to win can work wonders if you have the anchor for the game. For example: Naruto or Dragon Ball. People will be willing to pay even just for character appearance or skin.
But then again, everyone is different. I am not saying that others who spend money for this game are losers or bad. I am saying that this game is definitely not for me."
5009,Chill game
5010,Hell Yea
5011,put a second mortgage on my house to buy rubys. 18/10
5012,Fantastic game. I always find myself going back to it.
5013,"I haven't played for very long, but I can say that I'm very much enjoying the game, so here are my first impressions. It's not a hard game to pick up, but I can tell it will be a hard game to master. One of my favorite features is the unique perks that are on every master. The perk and exp system are very cool, I've never seen this is any other game before. I also really like the visuals, the game looks really nice! To end my review, the gameplay is super smooth. I haven't had any lag, fps drops, or literally anything that would make a game considered not smooth or enjoyable. Hope anyone who reads this considers downloading and has a great time playing!"
5014,clash royale on pc.  decent game as long as theres ppl to play.
5015,yes
5016,Very enjoyable! Honestly it was the option for a 2v2 mode that really drew me in.
5017,"With constant new content and various ways to play, Minion Masters is a one hell of a game. What sets this apart from other games of the same genre is the ability to play 2vs2. BetaDwarf have made some major improvements since it's first iteration. The only complaint that I have is the guilds could see some improvement. It is frustrating not being able to view ranks."
5018,"I started playing  cuze i found it on twitch  via a friends link and this game surpised me , it's really enjoyable! It's  perfect mix of a card and moba game combined in an arena and super customisable ! visualy  the game cute and very pleasing to watch  and the commentator voice isn't annoying ( reminds me of an evil deathknight and Wizard in a certain powermetal band ** cough gloryhammer cough ** ) !!  the game has a really nice build up phase and the longer the matches last the faster the round goes in an all card spamming fiesta !  
This game also has the option to play with or against your friends , this give the opportunity to test out decks! 
what also is a plus is that there is barely time to talk ingame , making it almost non toxic and very kid friendly! 
if you are a fan of games like hearthstone , league of legends and the likes but you enjoy fast phased short matched this game is defenatly for you !! 
Only downside , the AZERTY input  doesn't seem to work , for qwerty players there is no problem"
5019,"Doesnt take itself too seriously, while providing quick and easy entertainment"
5020,It's good
5021,"This game is very super awesome! you should play it right now, its really a addicting game."
5022,"Wonderfully solid game, with great graphics and addictive gameplay. Fans of card based RTS games will love this title."
5023,Feels alot like a more polished and version of clash royale because of the game design but has a nice unique feel to it and really enjoyable so far. Scaling of units also seems to be pretty good but spam strategies seem a little overtuned. All in all a solid game would recommend to anyone looking for something light and fun to keep yourself busy.
5024,"Great game, great devs, lots of content."
5025,"It is additive, fast and fun."
5026,excellent have been playing for 2yrs would highly recommend if u love strategy games like myself.
5027,Awesome Game!!!!!!!!
5028,"Honestly not a bad game. The only issue I have is that the ""competitive"" doesn't feel very competitive. Overall it is a decent game though. Plenty of different styles of decks you can use and strategy needs to be used often if you want to secure a win. Would recommend."
5029,great game but the players are pretty bad its to east but maybe i just need to put more time in
5030,great game to kill time
5031,"An innovative ftp game that includes the tower defense genre with the card game.

A nice pastime both alone and with friends.

If you like the genre and are looking for something different, this is the one for you.

Recommended."
5032,hehe ragdolls goes ..................................
5033,Awesome game. Fairly priced with good balance. Lots of regular update. Really cool to play for both casual and competative players. Lots of diverse choices in decks and builds. Good game
5034,"A really great little game that combines a card game with a simple chess-type game, with none of the negatives, IMO. Pretty simple to pick up and start playing and quite a lot of strategies to employ. Plenty of fun."
5035,"Just another Pay-to-win game designed so that if you give them a bunch of money you too can netdeck your way to the top.  Almost no skill at the highest level every game plays out the same.

Play 2v2 with a friend for FUN and there is a good game here until you progress too far at least."
5036,Super fun game
5037,"great strategy, easy to play and amusingly fun"
5038,good
5039,LOve it!
5040,the fame is fun:)
5041,GOOD GAME. Worth to play.
5042,very fun
5043,Great game!
5044,"fun way to pass the time, free to play, cant complain"
5045,"nice little rts with a card mechanic
"
5046,"good chill game
"
5047,good
5048,unbalanced mess
5049,"as with any games of this genre, it becomes an unbalanced mess the further you delve into it. Some stuff will always be better, and its nothing you can blame the devs on, its just how games like these are made. I'd say its fun to try out if you haven't played games like these, but in the end it's not enjoyable. But go ahead and try it yourself."
5050,at first i thought this was going to be another crappy League of Legends game... but its actually really fun and cute! I love the Magic feel!!!
5051,I love yes minions yes minion memes yes minion good yes elf good yes good game yes
5052,great
5053,"It has a great interface, is user friendly and is overall very fun to play"
5054,coooool with friends
5055,decent game with lots of room for improvements. quite fun as well.
5056,"Truly a great game, well balanced does not seem pay to win so far.

Thanks and keep making great games"
5057,Fun spending some time. Nice graphics. It freezes sometimes.
5058,really good game very addictev love it reccomend you should ply
5059,great game love it
5060,"Would be an amazing game, but it's pay to win, and team battles are ruined by AFK or griefing teammates, and there are clearly no punishments for them."
5061,awesome!
5062,Good!
5063,A blast from the start. Easy flow with a genius flow of strategy. A favorite for sure.
5064,The game is crack and I love it!
5065,2 hrs in a ok
5066,fun fun
5067,"Good game, try it . go coop"
5068,best game ever
5069,Great game for hours of fun. Played for about 5 hours now and enjoyed every second of it. It can get a bit grindy but unlocking things is so easy and satisfying it makes up for it.
5070,"Nice graphic and cool game style ! never regret downloaded it
"
5071,Actually a much better Clash Royale! I really enjoy the hero aspect and the amount of generosity the game has.
5072,"It's mostly because I love animals and chewy things. I dont have teeth, and I cannot smell my eyes."
5073,this game is amazing
5074,great game well balanced
5075,"""Tactics on crack"" is the best way I can explain it. I am enjoying the game and love the fact that instead of buying the items, you can easily level up and unlock the items that you would normally pay to get. The team play is one of the best mechanics that I've seen in quite sometime.

It's like an actual live action HearthStone"
5076,"What can i say? It's a very fun game, with great variety and players.. Each match you play feels unique and it doesn't get boring.. It's large number of cards you can use, allows you to utilize more than one playstyles, and you can adapt to any situation, either solo, or with friends..

If tower defense games is your thing, i highly recommend this game.."
5077,fun awesome game nice selection of monsters speels and heros
5078,i love it so nice <3
5079,amazing. nuff said
5080,"It's similar to games like clash royale, but with some added functions. You can choose between different masters who each have their own unique abilities and create your own custom deck of minions, spells and buildings. For these abilities to become available you need to hold control of the the two arena bridges which gradually give exp for said abilities. Games are fast and every game is different and enjoyable. What i really like about this game is that you only need one copy of a card and that's it, it's as strong as it will get. So it's not pay2win, all that matters is your skill. And whenever the creators make something new it's free to get for a limited time which is also quite nice as it shows these guys are not only in it for the money."
5081,Me like
5082,Fun game that you can just sit and play
5083,"Excellent blend of Deckbuilding and tower defense. The only complaint is that the tutorial/onboarding could be a lot better for explaining mechanics outside the game, like tokens and such. They also often make DLC free. Totally worth my time."
5084,"Хорошая, игра, быстрые бои, бывают даже напряженные.
Первое впечатление хорошее, всё хорошо и жизнь хороша.
Главное не жгите 5G вышки, ну серьёзно."
5085,"so far it seems to be a very nice game.
i like it :)"
5086,Really surprised by how fun this game actually is.
5087,"Switched recommendation to positive, on the merits of the PVP aspect. The PVE content is sadly just a ""restart until you get decent RNG on perks & opponents"", without any story or lore. The PVP is fast and decently fun, especially in the 2v2 mode.

Old review:
Tried it out for the PVE content (I have little interest in PVP), but sadly it was just a RNG-fest, with very little controllability. Being forced to restart the entire scenario, with no progression between attempt (besides the all-too-slow ""affinity"" card) made the whole effort just tedious.
"
5088,Its a great game i really recommend it reminds me of clash royal
5089,nice game
5090,This game is so good. Play it and you'll see!
5091,I originally got the game from a partner program but am totally hooked on it I enjoy streaming it and am really starting to get the hang of it looking forward to all the new content to come A++ :D
5092,Plenty of action and just enough time to think.
5093,"Just played a few games but it's a real fun, laid back game."
5094,i win so its fun
5095,This game freezes my PC all the time...it's a shame because I like it.
5096,"super fun! a great game to play when you are angry with your main games.

"
5097,Its a fun time killer
5098,SO FUN!
5099,I was shocked that i have played and enjoyed this game as much as i thought i would. I am not into these types of games but damn this game is very well made. I probably only like it because i have been winning 96% of the time but definitely give this game a shot even if you don't intend on playing it much
5100,"Game is fun and not pay to win, but should allow for more variety in quests, or different arenas and events."
5101,its fun to pass the time
5102,awesome game im stuck
5103,good
5104,its fun
5105,love it
5106,"Looks like some cheap mobile ripoff game, however it's actually pretty game fun and an innovative fusion of tower defense and deckbuilding"
5107,"kind of like clash royale, but with actual depth"
5108,"A nice timekiller, fast and easy to enjoy. Only played the game for like 30min so far tho!"
5109,better than I expected
5110,Colourful moba-like game. Quick game matching. Seems balanced. Vivid gameplay.
5111,Good Game. You summon minions to attack other minions and blow up enemy base.
5112,Fun
5113,good game
5114,"fun


edit: still pretty fun


edit:id rather be dead than play this but i still play"
5115,"really fun game, love it."
5116,good
5117,"With mobile market being new target audience for the devs, gameplay is being mutilated consistently."
5118,"Minion masters be like
clash royale 2: electric boogaloo

overall better ngl"
5119,Addictive gameplay to make you lose your whole day to. I consider this a good thing during the 2020 quarantine lmao
5120,honestly i dont like any card based games but i got yo tell u im liking this one so far u all did a great job
5121,Fun game! Something I wish Magic did a long time ago :)
5122,Been craving a CCG with CooP.  This game fills that niche perfectly.  Thank you!
5123,Fun deck building game and it's free to try. Give it a shot
5124,"Hey, I mean it's free and for me. Good time waster"
5125,"Great game! I If you loved art of war, youll love minion masmters."
5126,Just get it
5127,gg
5128,"it was ok i guess
"
5129,is a fun
5130,Game is like a mix between tower defense and magic the gathering. Pretty fun with a friend 2
5131,"Easy to pick up, learn, and dive into battle; great price, too. Charming aesthetics and plenty of humor thrown in. Great way to slay time and your enemies, both!"
5132,"Fast paced, fun and addictive game.
Give it a try, really."
5133,meh...
5134,"It's pretty good so far, will update more later."
5135,great fun!
5136,good
5137,Its a really good game to pass your time and even stream is way better than clash royale thing!! i Recommend this game 100%!!!
5138,Huge fan of the creep deploying / td genre. This will quench the appetite.
5139,fun
5140,good game fun and chill
5141,funnmy mionin
5142,"Um ótimo jogo, muito divertido! Realmente vale muito a pena jogar. :)
- Editando a minha análise: Eu parei de gastar no jogo e senti um pouco de dificuldade para me manter no top. -,-"
5143,Lit
5144,INTERESTING GAME;
5145,Awesome
5146,fun game!
5147,The classic example of if you dont pay you dont win. Played with a friend they bought some dragon legendary and the things literally unkillable. Maybe it gets better once you are super high level but we got to plat in team ranked just off that one single card.
5148,"Free to play,easy to win."
5149,"Quick pace of game with matches over in mere minutes, this game allows you to get your victory on in less time than it takes to update your profile while in the loo. Graphics are enjoyable and makes plotting your play even more eventful in those pushes for domination."
5150,Its simple fun with minimal pay to win.
5151,Fun little game with some progression.
5152,YEP
5153,Great little game. I am not the biggest fan of online multiplayer or card based games but this one hooked me. Not sure why I downloaded it but a few games and I was addicted. Easy to understand but difficult to master with all its different cards and masters with unique skills that can turn the game. Great art style and graphics and should run on pretty much any system. The developers constantly update the game which is great and are always listning to fans and tweaking things to improve the experience. Its freee so give it a go.
5154,Fun and unique gameplay.  Definitely worth trying out.
5155,Nice
5156,Clash Royale
5157,simple and yet enough strategy to keep me coming back
5158,unbalanced af
5159,its good yeh
5160,its fun when it dont crash and stuff ya know
5161,great game love it
5162,FUN!
5163,"A less P2W version of Clash Royal.
Pretty good so far."
5164,nice
5165,Pretty enjoyable not going to lie.
5166,"The game is pretty fun, but the constant crashes really kill the enjoyment. If the developers optimize this game better, then I expect this to become a very popular title."
5167,Kinda fun to play
5168,Is a fun game. I have more hours on this free game than I do some/most of the 200+ games I've paid for.
5169,kinda like age of war in an arena setting
5170,"I like the game but it is SO badly optimized. Crashes happen all the time. I got 2700X 32gb AMD RX480 and there's no way this game should push my system so hard the game crashes.  I can run lots of game with no problem GTAV, Elder Scrolls Online, Borderlands 3 just to name a few. I gave it another chance with this latest update but I'm done."
5171,"Good: Cool game. Easy to play. 

Neutral:  There doesn't seem to be any difference between whether or not your enemies are AI or human.  

Ugly: Game is super laggy (missing spells and timings). I also hate that there's a pay to win feature."
5172,"game so laggy,i only enjoyed matching againts bots"
5173,"It's one of the good free to play games :)
cool for co-op too
can recommend"
5174,"fun game to get into
easy to grasp"
5175,fun coop game
5176,Excellent game.  There are many deck-builds that are viable (limited only by your vision in combining the cards).  There is no unbeatable deck.  Dynamic game!
5177,noiceeeee
5178,its good game
5179,it's PLAY to Win.
5180,"very noic
"
5181,great game free to play and it never seems to get boring i give this 10/10 for playing online 0/10 mates to play with
5182,Unfortunately this game contains many flashing lights which have become bothersome. I can't recommend this until they give a setting that reduces light flashes. Otherwise the game itself is good.
5183,Im tired of people saying its pay to win. Its not and its a great game.
5184,"very cool game, and pretty fun :>"
5185,"Fun, simple to play, deck-builder / RTS type game that is not pay to win. Lots of stuff to do and very fair if you want to play for free."
5186,Too addictive. Would not recommend.
5187,Its so interesting.
5188,meh meh meh ...
5189,Quick and fun games.
5190,VERY NICE.
5191,awesome new player friendly comunity
5192,$10 A MONTH LOLOLOL GOODLUCK
5193,Such a good game
5194,fun game
5195,YAHOOOOOOO!!!!
5196,"It's free, It's good. Get it."
5197,Strategy is balanced. Pay to play vs grind is fair. Game play is intense as the masters tower health gets low. Hours of fun.

5199,"Pretty straightforward fun, though the main menu feels cluttered."
5200,Really good game
5201,"When you get to higher ranks, no matter how you build your deck, you will get smashed on by teams that have NO coordination with their builds, except for the fact they paid for all the card in it.  There is no reason to play this game unless you plan to play strictly for the adventure mode."
5202,It's a pretty unique deck building game where you have to learn the AI for each card. There are a lot of emergent strategies that arise just from small details in how units walk around.
5203,:)
5204,like the ease of like much like clash
5205,loving the diverse minions cards
5206,For the Horde!!!
5207,"Highly recommend. Can play how you want. If you just want a casual experience like me it's there, but the game is actually really deep and can be very competitive! Nice aesthetics as well. A feel good game in the best kind of way."
5208,"First off, no this game is not about the banana people from the critically acclaimed movie [i]Despicable Me[/i]. This game is about outwitting and outplaying your opponent in a game of strategy much more advanced than chess. The grand masters of chess wish they could suckle the teet of grand masters in this game. This game is so strategically in-depth, that it makes chess look like tic-tac-toe. To become a grand master in minion masters is to dedicate ones entire life to the craft, to understanding variables that us humans usually have a hard time comprehending, and to understand compassion for your fellow player. As this game is strategical and logical, it is also emotional, and understanding your opponents emotion and feelings can turn the tide of the entire game. I can say after my many hours in this game, that I myself have become a master, but not a grand master. This game is free to play, and putting money into the game does not give you any advantage you could not get from logging on daily and playing the game. Since I've achieved the rank of master, I've been invited to join Mensa with only a yearly fee of $500. No, Mensa is not a scam, and the reason all of us together have not produced or invented anything is because we are too busy mastering the craft of Minion Masters. Do you really think that my society full of the highest IQ individuals would stoop so low as to help you brainlets advanced technology? No, we play Minion Masters & watch Rick and Morty."
5209,great game!
5210,Doesnt open. Pointless
5211,Very addictive !
5212,Nice Game
5213,I tried it because I had it in my library for a while and it was pretty nice after I got a grip.
5214,Super fun
5215,Great time killer and quite addictive
5216,Playing with my son as my coach and this game is really fun!  WyvernJem is teaching me all I need to know!
5217,its good
5218,Entirely Free to Play Card game. Rare af bois
5219,Honestly at first I didn't think I would like or enjoy the game. Then I got to playing it and it has a lot more to it than it seems. Very much like any kind of deck building but with more of a visual than just cards being laid down. Totally worth your time for a casual CCG!!
5220,very funny
5221,Fun and easy game concept. Relatively fast free card aquisition and rarity doesn't dictate strength at all. An ever evolving meta and devs that care about their product. What more do you want? Love this game and have loved it since the beta.
5222,can't even play the game cause half the time it doesnt even connect to the servers.
5223,"Fun game, lots of game play options."
5224,Thought it was mobile trash. Ended up being a PC Gem.
5225,i like this game
5226,partidas rapidas e sem filas....minions indo e vindo e muita destruição
5227,"This is a pretty good game. 1v1 or 2v2 with surprisingly deep tactics and strategy. Updates are frequent and balance changes make sense for the most part. You can get every card and hero without paying a cent so long as you invest enough time into it, as all cards are craftable via shards and occasionally purchaseable with gold, both of which are in-game currencies you can acquire just by playing. With enough time you can even stockpile rubies, which are the ""paid"" in-game currency. Nothing is locked behind a paywall unless you are impatient and want the rarest cards from the most recent expansion, and they are not necessary to win. Occasionally the devs will offer previous expansions or random cards for free (though paying for them is just a time-saver.)

Legendary cards are expensive to craft but you are provided with more than enough shards to craft most of them eventually, and with experience you will be able to tell which ones are worth it. I've put enough time into it and can attain a consistently high enough rank each season to say with confidence that this is not a P2W game.

Overall a very enjoyable game I keep coming back to, whether it's for quick 1v1s or to play with a friend."
5228,good game when bored
5229,"Free to play and lots of fun. If you like games like Hearthstone, Underlords or Tactics, then you will like this as well! Really like the co-op (2vs2) mode as well!"
5230,"My go to chill game, very good. Would love a mobile version though."
5231,"
Played for Spring Cleaning Event for a couple minutes.

You and an opponent control an avatar.  Summon monsters and spells using cards.
Deal damage to win.  Open chests and unlock rewards.
Seems okay.
"
5232,"game was fun at first but uuh... now it keeps crashing :( ( i didnt bother reporting or fixing the problem because im too lazy to do it, all i did was validating the integrity of files through steam and it didnt work )"
5233,"You know a game is addictive when ""Just one more game"" leads to ""What? It's already morning?!"""
5234,"I will be uninstall when the new pay to win Battle Pass comes into the game, this game is going down the cell phone pay game root.  That way I'm not recommend the game anymore."
5235,"It dont same other game i play, and i like this game style art"
5236,pretty good
5237,Really good combat balancing!
5238,AN AMAZING GAME! fun with friends and yourself
5239,fuckin sick
5240,"I downloaded this just for the Spring Badge, but it's actually fun. xD"
5241,"Simple and entertaining... ENOUGH SAID
"
5242,Very simple and very fun. Solid graphics and minion designs. 10/10
5243,"A pretty fun take on tower defense: light in depth, matches are short and intense, great for a quick break.  On the other hand, they throw at you all the CCG and casino tricks, and then some.  The grind to get the most powerful cards is obnoxious.  Even if you pay, you are still forced to play roulette begging for scraps (and now they'll charge for a montlhy battle pass almost what they charged before for three months...)
Worst of all, they match you against bots most of the time, until you reach the higher ranks.  To make up for the dwindling player base and avoid long queue times, you might think, except it's not been 10 seconds and they already matched you with a bot.  They deceitfuly never let you know you're actually playing single player, and use bots effectively to fool you into thinking you're getting better.  After one or two loses, you will get thrown into a couple easy bot matches to make you feel better...
TL;DR: If you want addictive gameplay, don't mind long repetitive grind, mostly in single player battles, and want to feel better than you are, this game is for you."
5244,Nice game
5245,"like a better version of a mobile game i played but for pc..and better.

"
5246,Nice game
5247,"Simple, fun, addictive."
5248,"No button to quit, so can't be taken serious as a desktop game."
5249,just dont make it like clash royal
5250,
5251,"Great game, would definitely recommend."
5252,Great game :)
5253,Little Strategy! Fun Game.
5254,AMAZING GAME. SOOO MUCH FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
5255,"Spent a few hours in the game :) so it's probably time to give a review.  I come back to this game every day/week for the challenge and the fact that each game is typically less than 5 minutes.  I have accepted the fact that I am a upper-middle tier player rank and will most likely always be, but I am still learning after 500+ hours.  I mostly play team games (2 player) and the pickup teammates online have usually spread no toxicity - even when they do, it is in the form of in game icons and has never spilled into comments in a post game chat session.

I believe there are some that hit a wall early in this game and may jump to the conclusion that you must pay to compete in this game - I find that to not be the case at all.  I have spent VERY LITTLE money on this game (less than most games on Steam cost) so far and it was within my first 50 hours of play.  I needed my first big hitting card and it was a quick way to get the card.  I have since waited on cards via sheer numbers of hours played and the fact that over time you are rewarded with game currency that will allow you to save up to buy that card free.

With everything being said, the fact that I have spent so much time in the last months playing and the fact that I still log in almost every day should speak for itself.  If you are patient and can live with the fact that you will most likely never be a top 100 or 200 player, I suggest giving this game a free try for sure."
5256,Just really cool how you have something to watch with little effort in play.
5257,Amazing!
5258,vbncvbn
5259,infectious game
5260,"a Clash Royal like game but more balance i think. there are some card that support each other, the deck building and playable combos are more colorful than Clash Royal. you need build a deck that can support each other and not just that, but the timing when you play that card is count too. Some card have some good effect but you need to set the field first. not only the card are different but the king or ""Master"" in this game can be change too. some  master can fully support a card combo."
5261,"Fun solo or with friends, lots of pvp and pve options. Does not feel pay to win at all"
5262,fghjklhvgf
5263,Fun Game! Just play it =)
5264,good
5265,gg easy fun quick
5266,its phun
5267,"Simple to play, fun, and fast (5 min or less matches) that doesn't SEEM to be pay to win from what I've seen and read. Seems like a lot of different ways to play and types of matches, including solo play games. Overall, having a very fun time with this and by policy, I loathe freemium AND MOBA-type games but this one is a real treat. Surprising. Well worth a try if you have the HDD space."
5268,"Enjoyable in short bursts, this game has just kept getting better over the past couple years. I always look forward to new content!"
5269,"Not nearly as unfair as other games of its' kind, when it comes to both gameplay and monetisation. Combines card games with real life strategy in a final product that I've since come to love."
5270,"Great simple game, good gameplay as well!"
5271,Good
5272,A well polished game with great mechanics! Too good to be free to play!
5273,good game its kind of like clash royale with less required in game purchases as you get higher in tiers
5274,enjoyin it..
5275,AWESOME
5276,BEST CARD GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED
5277,Es muy adictivo y fácil de jugar
5278,"Highly recommend it. From all the games I have played in the past years, Hearthstone, Magic Arena, Spellweaver, Stormbound, War of the Omens, this is truly a Free to Play game, no Pay to Win at all. You can see it clearly in the top decks, they don’t have that many Top Tier cards. Even when you manage to make a top tier deck, is more about knowing how to play than having powerful cards.

Pros:
-Intense game play, sometimes fast as 2 minutes some other times 5 minutes, rarely more than that.
-Low RNG
-Is more about knowing how to play than having powerful cards.
-Very generous with giving cards and gold. It’s easy to create fun decks and play the ladder.
-Amazing 2vs2 player games.
-Great challenges in Brawls that they call Mayhem.
-I have invested £20 after I decided it was worth it, now I don’t need to put any more money as I have most of cards I need to have different decks and my collection keeps growing.
-When you lose a game only 10% of the times is because of RNG, I love that.

Cons:
-The interface is a bit too bright and childish. I would like the option to change colours or make it a bit darker theme, or with a different themes.
-Annoying prices with 50 gold with an annoying voice that is just too much after 100h.
-Sometimes minions act in unexpected ways. It could be better.
-Draft sometimes is a bit unfair, but still amazing."
5279,So far this games been an amazing time killer and it's pretty addicting.
5280,"Fun and relaxing
"
5281,Best game on Steam and the best in it's category by a long stretch.
5282,"this a game about timing and deck building 
 pretty balanced i think"
5283,better than clash royal
5284,I love this!
5285,"great game
(easy)"
5286,Is awesome because is fun
5287,"It's simple but fun. I really enjoy being able to play with my friend.
"
5288,"Few users play, most enter just to insult others while moderators eat popcorn."
5289,good game play
5290,good game and fun
5291,recommended game
5292,"Fun, strategic and not pay to win (you have to play a bit to get some cards though)"
5293,"It's free which is fantastic! Battles are intense and every move matters, be sure to learn what deck best suits your play style.
And never underestimate King Puff... EVER!"
5294,"Nice mix of MOBA and deck building, with few of the pitfalls either genre often has."
5295,"Pros:
1) Games don't take that long
2) Easy to learn at the very beginning
3) Cool graphics

"
5296,Like
5297,nice game !
5298,"It's a fun free to play game that combines deckbuilding with tower defense.  So far it does seem pretty free to play friendly, at least at the lower levels."
5299,"my new favorit game
"
5300,"Good strategy game. Nice people,  Lots of choices of cards once play for a while."
5301,"Fun, fast paced card and rts game. i love it, was hooked right away."
5302,Interesting spin on card game moba
5303,"Its a great game to chill with and doesent go overboard with the transactions, overall a great game"
5304,good time killer
5305,I like it~ fun to play from time to time
5306,"Fun but challenging. The more you play the more you want to learn about the different cards and refine your deck. Only takes a few minutes per game, but can end up playing it for hours."
5307,Itsa goods show!
5308,"Free-to-play and play-to-win enjoyable CCG? Yes, yes it is. 

This game feels miles above Hearthstone and Faeria--both of which I've put extensive hours in to. Minion Masters delivers a more enjoyable PvP without the nauseous sensation of loss you get from many other CCGs. You lost a fight? Learn from it, create cards that fit your new deck, try again. 

The developers are extremely involved, sends you free items as welcome presents for weeks on end with ample tips & tricks, listens to their community for balance issues and continue to grow at a crazy pace. 

Give this game a try, keep at it in to later levels as other, challenging modes become available for you: Team vs Team aspect is hectic fun, Adventure mode rewards in new ways, Mayhem and Draft modes give you variety. The game also offers a *cute* as heck spectator mode!

[b]Verdict[/b]
TLDR: It's free. It's play to win. Devs are extremely involved. Multiple modes. More balanced PvP."
5309,Just a lotta fun
5310,good game
5311,"Description: A competitive multiplayer title which follows the ""Clash Royale"" formula. ""Free 2 Play"" with a suprising fair monetization system which does not rely on ""pay 2 win"" elements. Short, intensive matches in a 1v1 and 2v2 format.

Pros (+)

+ The gameplay gives enough room for the individual player skill during the matches, paired with broad meta-game decisions made in the deck-building section

+ Appealing visual design of creatures & cards

+ Fair monetization system which does not rely on ""pay 2 win"" elements

+ A lot of social features including ""clans"" and ""2v2"" modes

Neutral (>)

> Battlepass

> Regular content updates & new features

Negative (-)

- The cards which tends to get ""meta"" could be nerfed faster


Overall: I can really recommend the game for what it tries to be. A non-p2w multiplayer title following the ""clash royale"" formula in a fair way. Pick it up you can't go wrong for free :)"
5312,Great game very enjoyable
5313,"I have to change my review from a recommended to not recommended due to the fact that while the game is fun and addictive, the performance has gone down hill the longer it is played. In a game where timing is one of the most important factors fps and lag spikes ruin many games, added to that a new memory leak that will cause the game to use 6gigs of ram and fun turns to frustration very quickly.

The dev's also are not very active in replying to bug report in the forums and the ingame bug reporter is... yup you guessed it bugged, returning an error after you try submit a report.

The game is fun until you learn how to play and then find alot of your best strategies wasted as lag has you miss placing minions and late on countering other players moves.

I'd say skip this for now and see in the steam forums if the game gets fixed."
5314,It's fun. For a CS 1.6 obsessed guy who never played anything else except Smite and CS 1.6/GO this is the third game i play.
5315,fun
5316,"This game is great, super addictive to play and has a similar tone to Forced so if you dug that this should be right up your alley. Just started playing but can already tell it won't be easy to stop"
5317,"A fun game that's easy to learn, yet hard to master.  This game is the perfect example of a great strategy game.  You can learn how to play in a few minutes, but spend hours mastering new unit strategies."
5318,"This game is good, its quick, easy to pick up and enjoyable...for the most part. 
You're going to learn pretty quick when you get to Plat level play that theres a couple things that just doesnt make it super fun:
1) MTG calls it ""Net decking"" and that is alive and well in this game. So be prepared to hit the same decks over and over.
2) ""Stealth"" is broke, the reset for them to go back is wayyy too quick, its essentially free 3x damage.
3) While this game *isn't* pay to win, it certainly makes everything easier...by A LOT. 

If you have fun, don't care about getting molly womped by ptw netdecks, then you're good."
5319,Pretty Sweet Game So Far :D
5320,"The game is fun, the game is simple, the game has strategeries for the novice and the pro"
5321,"this game is good and fun , easier to control and character is good"
5322,"love it. fantastic game. especially 2v2 is fun. very balanced and various playstyles are possible. 
its good for beginners and with every hour invested you learn to appreciate the difference in playstyles of the advanced players a lot. loosing isnt even that tilting this way, if you lose to a cool and fun strat (unless its the scrat launcher or beam of doom, those are cancer xD).
its more skill based then it feels in the first few hours, because its really easy to get the gist of the game, but has a lot of hidden depth."
5323,Quick and nice game
5324,Beware... this game is fun.
5325,Fun game and it starts you off with a lot of decent cards. i personally dropped money on the game because its worth it to me. as far as free to play goes its amazing
5326,"Fun game, more involved than some of the ""auto"" chess style games.  Really easy to play a few matches and make progress with the collection pretty quick.  Even some of the common cards are powerful and it doesn't often feel like you're outmatches by too many ""legendaries"" at least at lower levels."
5327,Simple and fun ... nothing more to say than that. -- After more hours played still very good game to play with the idea in mind a simple game.  I do play games to actually have fun nothing else:)
5328,i love this game
5329,"It's pretty easy to learn, and by the time you're done with the tutorial you're already like like 7? It's free to play as well. The only things you can purchase are other ""Masters"" which, they have a rotating pool, so you can always try out new ones each week. Along with skins, I've unlocked something new every time I've played a match. It's pretty fun, and pretty rewarding especially for something free to play. I'd highly recommend trying it out at least."
5330,"Unique game, fun and balanced if you know how to build decks right."
5331,Half baked Pay 2 Win.
5332,The tower defense x deck building idea is genius
5333,I LOVEEE IT PLAYING WITH MY BOYF
5334,Amazing battles and so much to do in my way. Awesome
5335,i like that it is very artistic and interisting
5336,Its fun
5337,ok
5338,"It's a pretty good card game. Strategy is key and you can outsmart other players who aren't as good as you.
"
5339,Good and well-balanced game.
5340,"fun, easy to get the hang of
"
5341,Enjoying the game so far. It's very addictive for sure.
5342,good
5343,"As through game prompt:
Game is fun, 2v2 option makes it more enjoyable.
Haven't encountered P2W yet, if it comes itll be after lvl 10."
5344,Fun casual game once you get the hang of it. Competititve but not too much.
5345,very entertaining!!
5346,Easy to pick up and play for 10 minutes or invest hours into.  Genuinely free to play and not pay to win. Recommended.
5347,love the play style
5348,pretty epic
5349,Lots of fun to play.
5350,"Not any more.... It was great but it's turning in to a joke with each update...
In the last 2 seasons, they have all bar killed off the Volco master and now it's turning in to a game where you just copy a paste decks and anything away from that is either nerfed to kill it off or not even worth trying...

The game is NOT run by the devs but by a set of ""testers"" as the devs like to call them... or ""backers""

It's run by a Clique turning the game to suit themselves and screw the rest of the players... As simple as that..

They have taken away all the top level skills (probably because The Clique are not skilled and cried over and over to get it removed..) I just saw them as top level players who you could not play against, as they had a load of skill and I was just a plant, plant, plant and have 101 minions kicking the **** out of each other...

So now the game is over run with Moronlia and Dill Bringers.... Aka Morelia and StormBringer...
The 2 of the lowest masters that you need to have no IQ to play....

Allowing a set of ""testers/backers"" change the game to suit themselves and just ignoring the rest of the community... (The main player base.) is just a way of taking as much money as you can before it gets closed down...

They are already making a new game that is a rip off of Minion Masters..


Stay clear of this game... Even if you like it when you 1st join, unless you have a low IQ... They will keep taking away anything of any good..


and the new BP... 1 month instead of 3... reduced the levels needed to finish it and then charge next to the same price for a lot lot less rewards... Wow.. Final nail..

It's been fun. I've had more than my moneys worth... but it's now just turning in to a joke.."
5351,"I typically avoid card games but this one has the proper balance, time per match is nice and quick, not entirely P2W, and fairly impressed for a F2P game."
5352,"I was greatly enjoying this game until I found out that there is a good chance you are playing against bots instead of real players, with no way of being able to tell. I didn't download a PVP game to play against bots. Would play it again and change my recommendation if there were some kind of ""Choose not to play against bots even though you recognize this will significantly increase your queue time"" option."
5353,goood gme not bad u should try it n see
5354,simple yet fun
5355,"I was a huge supporter of this game at one point. But upcoming changes where the development seems to be focused on hunting for whales makes me not want to support this game or recommend it to anyone.

I guess it was good while it lasted."
5356,"Easy to learn, fun to play"
5357,"i don't write reviews but as an RTS fan, this is one hell of a first impression!"
5358,good game
5359,Good.
5360,it reminds me so much of an addictive game before.. oh well want to play more to collect more rare and supreme minions..
5361,fun little game
5362,I've played this game a bunch on Xbox before my switch to PC and it still holds up--fantastic.
5363,Great live battles and lots of interesting cards to choose from
5364,Better version of clash royale.
5365,Very fun
5366,"Super fun game, casual to get into but with some good variety / strategic depth and synergetic deckbuilding.
give it a try.
f2p model is also super fair
good devteam"
5367,Great Game!
5368,"Excellent game! fast-paced. Short matches, so if you're doing terrible at least the match won't drag out forever. LOTS of variety. Fun as hell!

If you're a fan of Magic: the Gathering, this is what MTGO should have been.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT TITLE! STOP READING THIS AND GO PLAY IT! :)"
5369,nice game for fun and play with friends
5370,its like clash royale PC version but better

5372,"I enjoy the game a lot lots of different ways to build your team and all that jazz.
cons are as follows though
-Cross Platform works for discord to steam but if you have a friend that plays on xbox don't bother trying to play together.
-Accounts aren't linked. I've played a lot on my xbox and was hoping to be able to play on my pc instead and with my xbox friends but it doesent work like that.
-Not excited for how much the new battle pass will be and how short.

5373,"Thanks for making this  game it is already a great game for me to learn and be able to try out new things in the game. the graphics are great to view and has a great feel to it awesome job.

5374,real time card game strategy. Makes me happy
5375,Fun game so far. Many wins and no money spent...wonder if it will continue..?

Now.


You'll thank me later."

5380,"I've played enough Clash Royal to know a quality Lane Pusher when I see one. Plus the cards don't level up, which means everyone is at the same power level. Excellent."

5383,This game is stupid and pointless. dont waste your time....ok. this is cool if you are 12 and kinda bright i guess.  this would work with a gritty coat of paint and a serious tone... 2/11
5384,Great fun..
5385,"I played this a while now and it will just annoy most players who wanna use brain and tactics. THis game has memory leaks and lags. The chat is just full of trolls and fanboys and no moderation. Alot of players when playing 2v2 will throw the game if their favourite streamer or friend is on enemy team or just to troll. The game is just full of random chances and people who use some premade decks for cheese and spam. i say the game consists of 25% the order game puts your cards, 25% luck in matchmaking, 25% copy someones deck, 20% boring life and 5% brain&skills. 
Addition: alot of cheaters if u are smart enough to count time and see changes on the board.
If u bored play it as a casual troll game, but as a serious game i give it a -1"
5386,Never has a F2P game been so easy and generous to get into it! All the cards feel super balanced. A much better game that some of it's competitors out there.
5387,"Best cards game. ^^

edit: It's not. :p
Each update makes the game worse.

last edit: The developers totally ignore all the players' opinions. they killed the fun of the game by nerfing most of cards and making unnecessary changes that killed the game!!!"
5388,"Yes, very game this is."
5389,"So far it feels fast and entertaining, good for killing time and its well-made, I wish there were more sort options in the deck creation, but overall I’m having fun with it"
5390,"A could-be good game  with a lot of hackers and bugs, and neither can be reported.

Can be a fun game, as can any other, but you will find reasons to avoid it eventually.

Pay to win? hmmm.... Yep. You can't buy stats or anything, but there are certain cards you will lose to 100% of the time, and if you don't have them, you just can't compete with those people, period. It is just a matter of science in this case.

Tons of wasted potential, and the moderators cost my guild one of its top rankers by denying the hacks exist, and being fine with the troll crowd that inevitably showed right up when this was brought up.

I will act surprised now. This is my surprised face --> ( 8^O You see? You see how surprised?! OMG right?!"
5391,"Great game easy to pick up and put down 
Some elements over complicated still figuring it out
Overall a great play."
5392,"is good, is easy, is easy to get good at."
5393,Too many hackers. I value my time and this game is a no go for me.
5394, I like this game because it's great fun.
5395,"Good game
"
5396,"simple, yet fun"
5397,Awesome game
5398,Good
5399,very fun game
5400,Fun
5401,Great game
5402,"fun game with worth while early rewards, good stuff"
5403,Game is fun
5404,one of the better card games!
5405,fun game
5406,most people in the game dont understand how to make decks well so its an easy clap everytime
5407,"A little hard to understand in the beginning. But after a round or two, you start too understtand how the dynamic works.
For one that never have played""Master Of Minions"" series, it is alot of card to make sense out of. It only seems like it in the beginning. Seems like you also only meet people with the same rank as your in ranked matches.

The battle  rounds goes fast- between 2 to 5 minutes. 
Adictiv game, 

8/10 points here


Thanks to the developers"
5408,"Had cheese thrown at me while summoning big spear bois to march to their death for me. 

10/10 would recommend"
5409,Progress in this game is far to slow compared to other games of the like.
5410,"Really fun and competitive game overall, recomend a lot. Plus it's low pc specs friendly and it's updated quite frequently. Thumbs up :)

Edit from a friend who can't recommend it : Very good game. It's a lot of fun and yet remains very competitive. It's fairly easy to get started. However, the game sure has depth to its gameplay with its tactical elements. The developers are putting very good work in further developing the game, with new content continuously being created and improvements being made. The 2v2 gives the opportunity to have great fun with a friend and opens a new way of playing the game. The community is good.
Overall, I think this is a very interesting game that's worth your time. It shows a lot of promise and seems to have a bright future ahead thanks to its hardworking developers."
5411,"fun game, still have to play a bit, but good concept"
5412,"I saw it maybe a year and a half ago, and skipped it because I mostly like RTS. Then it came up in an add, and I was bored, so I decided to try it, because I was bored. It was free, and I was surprised. I figured it would be a pay to play scam of some sort, and figured I could always uninstall. Boy was I surprised.

There are no ads, really, and it's not pay to play. I haven't spent a cent, and I am platinum. Don't even know why spending money would be needed. Not even a grind.

It's a lot of fun. Highly recommended. Not heavy thinking. More beer and pretzels. But terrific. 

"
5413,"This is not as much pay to win as I thought initially, and thus I am changing my vote to thumbs up!"
5414,"This game is awesome, i found it by giveaway so i started to play. Im only disapointed because theres no camera lead like to watch fight in 3D with camera movement."
5415,"I've had this game since alpha, and it keeps getting better, keeps getting tweaked.
I can't say I'm a fan of the DLC prices, but it's a FtP game... and I've never felt pressured to buy anything.

The gameplay: It's good. You build a deck of 10 cards (you have several deck slots), and pick a master. The maps, while having skins, are all a semi-cirlce on each player/team's side left and right, separated by 2 bridges one at the very top, the other very bottom. In battle you have 4 cards in hand at a time and can see what card is next. First card order is random AFAIK, but then the order you play them become the order you draw them.

There's a variety of cards costing 1-10 mana. There's minions, building, and spells. There's a spread of different de/buffs, some of which work with like cards, fitting a theme if you want. Or just throw cards you like together and see if it works. With minions some will only summon 1, others many, with differing HP, strength, speed... some other important differences.

Your minions will always walk toward the enemy ""tower"" where the Master/s sit, unless there's a foe within some aggro range. The trick is which lane do you summon to? Not only do you need to worry about enemy minions, but the last one to touch a bridge ""owns"" it. And gets xp for their masters to gain their 3 unique skills, and if the match goes on long enough you get Mana Rage which severely increases the rate of mana gain. You can basically play cards as fast as you can click.

Well... I could continue about the gameplay, but I'll just say it's fun.
They have different modes now that are interesting. 93hrs as of writing this, I realized I should give it a thumbs up.
Worth a try, for sure."
5416,Not bad
5417,great gameplay something that i can play for hours alone or with a friend
5418,Cheezy but fun
5419,"Great game and really fun, I needed something like this."
5420,"this game gets boring really fast. they constantly encourage you to buy garbage from the shop. it has a few nifty innovations, such as team play. the game-play and the artwork are less than spectacular. all-in-all its just not worth the time."
5421,I love you 3000.
5422,lick the pace
5423,Pretty cool
5424,"It's a fun game, I do think it would be better for mobile"
5425,"Better than the artsyle suggests
"
5426,Welcome to the team WolfMoon.
5427,"Makes me chill , and can enjoy playing it with friends"
5428,game is süper
5429,fun as h4ll
5430,"Love the game, simple yet very strategic great fun"
5431,"Awesome, needs skills and deck building on point. Good Job creator!"
5432,P2W crap u will face chinese and other kind of regions lag can fuck you up shit like that is constant and crappy as rewards.
5433,"Updated: 2 May, 2020  : I wanted to give a neutral review but we can't so I prefer leaving a bad one even if I enjoy the game. The game feel too much like a open beta.

Like Royal Arena on Facebook but better and bigger made (less basic).

The 2v2 battle with matchmaking queue is nice ! It would be better with a 3 or 4 vs big boss.

There is no in game friend list and no in game nickname. I play ""no life"" and I don't feel progressing at all. We have almost no rewards when we win, the achievements give almsot nothing, the account lv up give almost nothing, the paid battle pass give almost only hero skins, it seem to have only 2-3 good heros / about 10 that's ridiculous. The first time we play we have quests for about 3 hours then we have a daily one that we complete under 10 minutes only. In short, pretty much pay to win because the more money you have, the more legendary cards you can buy and the better deck you have of course. I would say 50-75% pay to win not 100% because we can play as free, this is just very very longer to have a deck.

Updated: 17 April, 2022

After a year boycotting this game because they stole my rubies (it was written all adventures pack but it was only for all CHAPTERS inside a single adventure ! They never accepted a refund) and because people were using the card named ""nyrvir's breath"" no stop in 2v2 (it was unplayable). I played it again for a couple xxx hours during 4-5-6 months but I just uninstalled it again, and this time it is forever.

The game has more and more hackers and more and more newbies making the game very frustrating. You can lose 3-4-5 games because your teammates are completely clueless in 2v2 and when you are about to finally win one, BOOM the game magically crash when the opponents has their tower under 50 hp ! YEAH SURE ! FUCKING HACKERS ! And they add nothing new to the game. This season they added the 2v2 adventures, but it isn't for all adventures, and you must buy it 750 rubies ! I cleared it with someone else, I was unable to claim the end reward because I didn't bought it ! THEY STOLE MY RUBIES I WON'T GO BUY THIS WTF ! 

2 years ago I wrote the game was pay to win. it isn't at all. I don't remember if they changed something or I was only a newbie but the game is completely free, BUT when you are a newbie, the more you play, the less fun you have, cause you make no gold at all. The way of making gold in this retarded game is by watching a streamer on twitch with the DROP ON. Every time they win 100 gold (from a key in game, randomly when they win) all watchers also receive the 100 gold. That's the mechanic they want us to play, they want us to be on twitch so the game looks popular and esport. I was streaming myself just for the fun, I was not that good but I wanted to help newbies. After almost 750 hours I was still unable to play higher than master, I don't know how to play there. I'm always stuck with a retarded teammate or opponents just a bit better than us. On the steam discussion people talk about ELO. There are no way to see our ELO but people told me if I was always stuck with a newbie it was because I had a high elo. I don't know how the fuck I could have a high elo if I can't go higher than the master rank and why the fuck would I be forced to be stuck with newbies day long ! I don't mind helping newbies, but not day long ! And when you watch the leaderboards, you see nobody use a deck higher than 3-4 mana. Which let us wonder, why the fuck do they add cards thats cost more than 4 mana in their game and why the fuck, if the game is that balanced, these low mana deck are ALWAYS the best ? In my book, lower mana decks add more actions to the game and make it look better on twitch. So they won't nerf these cards... But maybe I'm just too bad... If you want to spend money in the game, you can have specific stuff from the shop rotating every 24 hours, like skins, avatars, smileys (we have no chat in this game [while in a combat I mean], only annoying pings from teammates raging and smileys). If you want to buy cards, that's random. Like x5 the same random legendary card. If you already have it, too bad we love your money lol. This make sure the game don't become pay to win, but we can't buy the smiley or the avatar we want and if we happen to find one we already have, usually costing like 300-400 rubies, they give you back 100 gold. 100 wtf golds man common........... They are super greedy. They could at least refund half the normal value, but no... They don't care if you are a veteran or not, all they want is money. They had to face bankruptcy in the past but the way they manage minion masters, they won't do many games... And the worst, you know what ? IT WORK ! The free pass give the same 2 new cards as the paid pass but you don't get them from the season start, you must lv up the pass first. When you look at the amount of players using the new cards, you have an idea how much money they make and I personnaly find this super ridiculous... They are super greedy and people love it... Not me. We are far from a Dauntless marketing vision (a game from Phoenix Labs). precision : if we can have everything free they are not that greedy, what I meant is when you actually buy rubies with real money. What do you do with them ? Not much, you must spend a shit load for almost nothing, especially since the whole game is free... You don't get retired skins etc.

The game is 5 year old and they always refuse to add quality of life improvements to their game. like, key shortcuts, be able to drag a deck from a slot to another, etc. This game studio is very amateurish.

And also because the game is that old, less and less players play this game so some people started abusing the matchmaking. They start it at the same time, if they enter the same game, one of the two leave so the other can win easy. So you endup 1v2, you can't win. If you report them, nothing happen cause betadwarf does nothing with this report system. They added it only to look as professionnal as RIOT Games (riot games ban too many people for nothing, but at least, they ban...)"
5434,"So far, this game has been a fast moving battle game--it fees like I'm in control of my side, which is nice compared to many other games like this that I've run across.
"
5435,A week ago I would have said this game was fun then they ruined it with there latest update
5436,"wow
"
5437,What do you get when you combine a near-brilliant base game concept with an inept and financially unstable developer?  A very mediocre game.
5438,"I recommend this game to others because I find it very fun. It can be the physics of dead minions dropping that are funny. The game is challenging with a good skilled player base the higher the rank. The game has plenty of modes to offer for variety of playing. I think the game does not charge a crazy amount for cards, cosmetics. Afterall I like the game alot so I spend money on it."
5439,good
5440,"Fun games, great graphics. There are lots of possible strategies and builds to win battles"
5441,"This game looks promesing,need more updates and characters,maby new maps"
5442,midavittu
5443,Fun interesting game
5444,Its like the Indian in the cupboard of card games lol your deck essentially comes to life as you play it 1v1 or 2v2

5448,Still new and learning it all but it's a fun game
5449,Offers a lot of features and new ways to deafat your opponent. Really good time passer for a free to play
5450,👍
5451,"Oh man! I love this game so far. Its a MOBA/CCG/Tower defense cross over.

Thats all you need to know really."
5452,"Chill, quick and fun"
5453,"Great little game to waste some time, has the same appeal as auto chess, with gacha mechanics and the like."
5454,Recommended!
5455,oh god this game made me reach climax and also going for Challenger League with da boys. definitely a challenging game!
5456,Very easy and quick to learn! Simple and interactive enough to keep you playing! Highly recommended!
5457,"Minion masters felt strange at first for me but once I got over the small learning curve I feel like this game can suit almost anyone! -SuNNy1y

This game is a great free-to-play card/tower defence game to play with your friends and/or solo! Collect all the cards and master your decks, strategies, or just have fun collecting cosmetics.  What ever game mode you choose whether it be 1v1 solos, 2v2 team battle, or 2v2 pre-made, you can rank up and reach the leader boards with your friends ! Not to forget about the other fun and rewarding game modes like Adventure, Challenge, Draft, Expeditions, and Mayhem ! Each game goes towards your overall level with each level rewarding more and more things.  There is also a battle pass you can choose to buy with ruby's with many season rewards available. Ruby's are the payed currency in minion masters, you can also get coins used for the shop or spin tokens, and shards meant for crafting new cards. 

I wrote this review because I have been playing MM for quite a while now and I highly encourage new people to rough it out at the start because the learning curve may be steep but in the end more rewarding!  Can't wait to see you on the 1v1s battlefield soon! ;)

(cant wait for mobile!!)"
5458,Good Game fun to play while your all baked up in Quarentine.
5459,"Easy to pick up, varying strategies to win."
5460,it's a nice quick easy and fun game to play
5461,Relaxing game :)
5462,"i dont know why i keep coming back, but i do."
5463,pretty deccent fun game
5464,"Interesting mixture between auto-battler and deck builder, which I've been playing a lot of each, lately. I also greatly enjoy the cooperation available in team battles. This way I can carry my wife instead of stomping her. lol"
5465,Fun and visually entertaining. Have only played a few hours and am looking forward to playing it some more.
5466,"Fun so far, good intro / tutorial to the game."
5467,"Great Game, Loads of Fun, Very Integral To My Sanity."
5468,"gud

deck building screen could use some love tho"
5469,Fun
5470,"In my playtime game frozen 2 times. One of them I lost a reward chest and in last one I lost 45 minutes of progress...
Just no..."
5471,"TLDR; I have spent money on the game but reluctant to spend more for below reasons

This is an alright enough game but it really feels like the devs don't understand the player base enough

- Rare to earn crafting shards instead opting for random card(s) of a rarity
- Duo queue is a mixed bag since random and premade queue is combined
- Took them almost 3 months to nerf Restless Dead into a reasonable card
- Rotating skin shop for the longest time (will change but took a while)
- Shop deals are almost always incredibly bad value imo
- Lopsided rarity into legendaries (new one every month)

It's honestly starting to feel like a chore to play every day but that's the only way I feel like I get value out of the game"
5472,"Fun game, like a PC version of Clash Royale! Very enjoyable so far."
5473,best f2p game ive played so far (besides dota).
5474,it focuses on thought and stragegy
5475,Fun and you don't need to pay in order to win like in some other games.
5476,Easy to get into playing things are easly understood
5477,Fun Game so far. Leaving a review because the game asked me to! Free and fun!
5478,"Pretty fun twist on a tower defense and a deck building game. cool effects too and relaxing, not mentally straining but their is stratagy involved."
5479,good minions good game
5480,SÜPER
5481,A good and enjoyable surprise. Easy to learn and nice rewards for beginners.
5482,"Decent fun until you hit the pay-to-win tier. My first deck basically carried me all the way to Gold at which point I can barely compete. I always lose to better cards or paid ""masters"" and it's too much of a grind to unlock competitive cards. Not only that, there are numerous bugs that make gameplay frustrating - Lag during spawns, hotkeys or clicks not registering, dialogue boxes stuck on-screen.. plus more.

Everyone starts with a handful of cards which can be built into decks and used to compete. Each team has an arena to spawn units using mana, which builds over time. Each player must spawn units in a tug-of-war type battle until the units destroy the opposing team's tower. In order to unlock more cards you use Gold (won from battles) or Rubies (cash) to buy ""Power Tokens,"" which will essentially unlock a spin for a random card. Sometimes you get rare cards in the spin but most times its all common cards, most of which you start with. At first gold comes easily; You usually get either gold or a power token with each level, to be spent unlocking cards. Once you reach rank 20 it becomes more of a grind as you have exhausted most of the new modes and gold can only be won in matches, little by little.

On top of that, there's so many bullshit mechanics that can basically screw you if you aren't aware of them. Targeting for spells can be frustrating with the delay you have to anticipate. Units being spawned can be caught in the after-effects of enemy spells, essentially wasting your play. Most spells have a giant reach or can eliminate your whole wave, while costing less than most cards. For example: Lord-Sentinel Thelec (Crystal Elf 10-cost card) is essentially useless when it can be insta-wrecked with a Fireball (4-cost) or Chain Lightning (4-cost), even when protected by a 5-cost Guardian (shields all nearby Crystal Elves.) In this scenario you could potentially spend 15 mana on several units that are crushed in an instant for 25% of the cost.

While this game is good fun and all, I can't recommend it for the fact that you must pay to compete, else face a punishing grind to even compete. The amount of greed when it comes to cards and features in this game is ridiculous. I enjoy a good challenge but I'm not investing $50 a season to compete. 

TLDR:

Fun till level 20ish at which point you will get steamrolled if you don't start spending (basically 8 hours of play). Too many bugs/unfair mechanics to justify $20 battle-pass, plus additional cash you'll need to spend unlocking cards that can compete.

"
5483,fun
5484,gud game
5485,Nice
5486,"Nice graphics, Good game mechanics. Enjoyable in the beginning so far. Don't know about later on."
5487,"Repetitive but Fun....

I wish they would get more creative with the Battlefield..."
5488,Great Game
5489,A fun and innovative way to satiate your unit spawning habit. Good graphics.
5490,Very nice game! chilling and no tryhard!
5491,Great Game.. i love it
5492,"Super addictive card-collecting line war.
Games go very quickly, so even if you lose; it isn't much time lost.

Select a master. Build a deck. Queue up.

Games take about 4-7 minutes; I find.
Some games take only a couple of minutes; or less."
5493,"It gets more and more unstable the longer you play until it finally crashes.

It's not much different than any other Free to Pay game out there.  It's not as bad as some since the money is mostly for cosmetics and reducing grind.  However, any game where paying money to reduce grind is a feature, isn't a game I want to be a part of to begin with.

The game play itself is satisfying when it's stable but it's nothing that hasn't been around over 2 decades.

Between the instability and the F2P model, this game is a hard pass."
5494,Soooo You want clash royale on computer with more guys and a cooler way to watch the battle? Well Buy this game then its awesome.
5495,"good
"
5496,"I wasn't sure if I would like this game or not but after playing it a bit more I do find it fun. I like playing cards the same time as my opponent while making the decision to play something cheaper, just to have something on the board, or wait to play something more powerful. I believe that as I play the game I'll figure out more about it, but since I consider myself to still be a new player (even though I downloaded it quite some time ago) I think I should limit my thoughts about the game until I know more. I think it'd definitely worth it to give the game a shot."
5497,"Good casual game
No sweat needed
Great for chillin with the boys

*2021 Coax The Diplomancer Update*

Literally destroying your community with one update. Coax ruins matches. The fact to be so powerful it alters every single match hes in. Beyond the most OP card they've released for monetization. Made the game go from actual fun to miserable with the release of ONE card. Unbelievable."
5498,"CONS:
- The ways the devs balance the game are often questionable
- Too many unnecessary game modes
- Too many games against AI bots, which are boring because they don't test your skill
- Hard to find a guild where your contribution and the rewards feel worthwhile

PROS:
- I like it that they give out plenty of free stuff and it's free-to-play friendly
- The core game is just fun and I love the game after all"
5499,"Since latest update i heavily do not recommend this piece of dog shit.

I play mainly 2v2 and here are my experiences and why you should stay away:

They decided to bring out new cards and make them exclusively paid battle pass only.
Coincidentally they suck cock at balancing, because the flagship major card is a 10 Mana Legendary that auto-kills anything below 40% HP and makes everyone in an AoE run away and not attack.
On their shitty livestream they said ""GUYS SCRATS ARE REALLY GOOD AGAINST THIS LEGENDARY"", implying if you swarm the bullshit OP card, you win. Well riddle me this you small-brained retard bastard: how do you want to do that when the entire field is afflicted with constant fear effect.

Furthermore, slotting mandatory cards to deal with moronic Statue is still a must do, devs do fuck all to introduce commonplace tools to deal with this idiocy. If you have not previously played the game, Statue is a cheap fat threat that just keeps walking down the path until it reaches a building and whacks it. Because it's so far in hp, it takes a lot of hits and the cheap shitter strategy is to back it up with big dick ranged units. Unless you overcommit resources (which sets you majorly back in the match) or slot in specific cards, you autolose the match.
Morellia is still the most bullshit OP Hero, because the moronic Dragon is still a thing. Much like with the garbage Statue, you have to slot in cards to deal with it.

You are either playing Morellia/Miloween or you are building a deck to counter these 2.
That's dogshit game design.

For all those reasons, stay away from this trash."
5500,"Minion Masters has been my main game for 2 years, I would be a completely different person without it. The community on Twitch and Discord is amazing. There is no other game like this on pc. It is free to play friendly, has lots of modes to engage in, the twitch integration is fantastic. Give it a try if you haven't. If you have in the past and looking for something new, I cannot recommend grabbing a friend and playing the new Co-op Adventure enough, it is truly the best thing MM has put out since the game itself."
5501,ranking matching is so shit
5502,The game is a fun take on Clash Royale. Until everyone just starts abusing 3 of the same card decks and then it all goes to shit.
5503,Best Clicker game I ever played.
5504,cool great game
5505,"Pre: Hey look it's one of those games that I hate without trying.
Post: Hated it."
5506,Not very competitive as it's very easy to hit Contender (highest rank) in under a day of grind due to the player base and ranking system with win streaks. Same copy repeat decks everywhere at higher ranks so can get exhausting but still fun sometimes and is even better if you run premades with a friend.
5507,"It's looks and plays similar to some top down, tower defense mobile RPGs . Kinda pay to win, but the developers frequently give out free stuff.Got bored of it after a while, coz I'm not really a huge fan of the Clash Royale style games. Doesn't hurt to try it out coz the game is free and the community is extremely helpful and supportive."
5508,"Minion Masters is soooooo much better than you think it's going to be. 

Pro's

It's actually fun
It's free and ZERO Pay to Win
The Devs give out a lot of free stuff
There is no one best strategy. So many different things work
It's a PvP game with no shit talking (because you cannot communicate with your opponent)
It's a skill based game that lets you gradually improve due to a functional ladder system
Great art and sounds
Addictive
Short games (2-5 minutes) and doesn't take long to find another game
Plenty of features
SUPER balanced (not perfectly....but WAY better than most)

Con's

Some persistent bugs have not gotten fixes
New content tends not to be well balanced for a week or two
When you're a new player it puts you against bots and doesn't tell you they're bots
Uh.....that's all I got (it's super good)

Overall: It's free, so there is no reason not to try it. It's actually fun. It's got a MASSIVE amount of strategies and deck compositions. It's got a great Dev team and community. The games aren't long, so it's great if you have kids, and...did I mention it's actually fun to play?
"
5509,Fast-paced fun I can have with my boyfriend! Learning curve is low - anyone can play! Aesthetically pleasing both visually and audio.
5510,I can't lose
5511,Fun single and team play.  Upgrade your cards as you go!
5512,"It's free, fun and easy to understand, but yet complex."
5513,"Very nice and fun game, fast paced, nice graphics and fantastic voice overs - really put you in the mood."
5514,"Fun to play, easy to learn"
5515,"nice little timewaster, best version of this type of game ive found"
5516,"nice game to spend your time
"
5517,easy game to understand
5518,Clash Royale
5519,"Good game with a high skill ceiling

unfortunately its also massively subject to cheese builds though that can be fun too."
5520,not boring
5521,"Better than hearthstone, cheap, short and enjoyable. What else a chill player wants ?"
5522,graphics are incredible and the amount of push u can do is awsome
5523,"Pretty good, would play again."
5524,its fun :D
5525,"I received this as a gift from my friend Yohead, and boy have i gotta say, its a complete fucking copy of clash royale and every enemy is just a bot with a steam user's username pasted onto it. Overall doodoo"
5526,Really fun RTS. Less like a card game and more like a fast-paced RTS. Super recommended.
5527,Wasn't sure about this game. Turned out to be a pretty cool break from the norm.
5528,Only a couple hours into the game but very impressed so far.
5529,good game fun to play with my razor setup
5530,"The game itself is not bad, but unlocking cards you like takes ages..

You get far too less gold compared to how rare you get an actually rare card which is needed to get more shards, from what I've seen you get:
common- 15 shards
rare - 30 shards
supreme - 75 shards
legendary - 300 shards

of a card per spin, one spin costs 1000 gold which you can do with the daily quest arround once per day

But you need e.g. 2000 shards to craft a legendary, this is insane because there are no options to disenchant cards you don't even use.. Also every fourth spin you get a chance for more rare cards but you never have a guarantee to get the rarest so even 10 spins after paying money doesn't bring you further to the card you like except you are really damn lucky..

Also the glory system is just confusing and the voice of the announcer is really annoying - I played the game just without sounds, therse seems to be no plans for a mobile version and for me it seems that the game is extremely pay to enjoy if you want to craft custom decks and not just copy the ladders.  Unlocking cards is too much dependent on randomness which I don't enjoy, in my opinion it's even worse than in hearthstone because Minion Masters doesn't offer any disenchant mechanic.

There are also adventures which need to be bought but the price in comparison to the rewards is not worth it and there is not even a story (cutscenes or anything) in the adventures to justify the cost-reward ratio.

The 2vs2 mode is quite fun at the beginning but as soon as you want to test specific strategies you are dependent on the really unrewarding reward system which really ruined the game for me, I am used to not having much luck in games but with the time I spent I just managed to unlock 2 legendaries that I really wanted, which is insane compared to games like Hearthstone, Gwent or Magic"
5531,Cool game!
5532,"stuff. you hard...
"
5533,"It's just a fun game to play, especially with a friend.  Paying certainly helps you win, but I was able to get to Master rank without paying so it's not required."
5534,"it s a well made game. Very strategic. 

You do lay it down after the initial high.  but cant beat free to play."
5535,good
5536,"This game has no business being this fun. That is what we have been saying about this game. It looked so simple from the beginning, and did not expect it to catch my attention for long. However, I gave it a chance since I can't complain about a free game. Now 150 hours later, I keep coming back to it. The balancing is pretty great with frequent updates to overpowered cards. Legendary quality cards are a tad too strong, but you see much less people stacking a deck full of them than any other card game I have played. The monetization system is amazing as well. I purchased the battle pass the first season I played, and I have acquired enough of the premium currency through playing to be able to purchase the pass the next two seasons without spending real money. Card acquisition feels very slow at first, but this is only because there aren't that many cards, and the balance is so well done that you can get to the upper tiers of the ladder with the core card set given to you after the tutorial. Lastly, the unlocks are not rediculously grindy. This season I am on track to get to rank 100 (big battle pass reward for the season) while only averaging 3 hours per week. I cannot recommend this game enough. While there is not much incentive to play this game for hours on end (battle pass still ranks up the more you play though), this game is great to go play for 30 minutes to blow off some steam. Great side game since you can finish all your 'dailies' and stay on top of all the reward systems in the game with as little as 2 hours per week.

Protip: Join the lowest level guild with the most active player base you can find. This is where a lot of the card rewards come from. Also, don't waste your gold on power tokens. Craft the cards you want with crystals after unlocking your favorite champions."
5537,If you like Hearthstone style and quality then look no further!
5538,"awesome game. reminds me a lot of the early hearthstone experience:
super smooth graphics, easy to get into gameplay. different modes to keep you interested and some pretty decent depth once u get into deckbuilding / premade strategies.
lovely.

on top of that this has to be the most fair ccg monetization I have seen so far. Props to the devteam
still good fun"
5539,i just started and its pretty cool so far
5540,Awesome game.
5541,"Card-based strategy game with lots of tactical choices and varied competitive situations.  Easy to learn, lifetime to master (pardon the pun).
I spent $0 on this game and have spent $0 in game, and have felt no need to spend to win or improve.  The game is well designed so Minion cards and Masters are available on rotation to try before spending earned in-game resources."
5542,The games mechanics and critical thinking make it a joy to play. I love the graphics.
5543,amazing little game kept me occupied for hours learning how to build certain decks and out fighting people
5544,its a fun game
5545,Worth trying out
5546,"Classic, solid, playable for a while. but :S"
5547,fresh fun addictive game play! great break from smite!
5548,pretty fun
5549,"I'm someone who really hates the ""free to play"" model for games.  I would rather just buy the game outright than have some grindy experience where you feel stalled unless you make a million microtransactions.  That said, Minion Masters won me over and convinced me that not all f2p games are like that and made me more open minded in general.  

It's definitely not a ""pay to win"" sort of game, though I guess you could pay to make things move a little faster to unlock certain things to open the game up to more variety.  But I've got a decent enough amount of hours into the game and felt that the care that the developers put into their product earned my money, so I did buy some things with real world money and have 0 regrets about it.

Gameplay wise it reminds me a lot of kind of like a custom game / mod for Warcraft 3.  Both in the art direction and the sort of games you might find there.  It's sort of like a mix between a competitive (1v1 or 2v2) tower defense and also MOBA, but in a micro format.  MOBAs are notorious for toxicity, for a lot of reasons.  I think part of it is the commitment to such a long investment of a match... like 30 mins plus.  Matches in this are probably around 2-5 minutes.... you win, cool, dopamine... you lose, oh well, move on and learn.  It's fun coordinating and making new decks and finding new strategies too.  I've been playing with some buddies I got to join and we have fun playing.

Check out the emails too that you can sign up for, they give you advice on how to get started and give you plenty of free codes you can enter to the game to give you new stuff to add to your collection.  It's free, and it's non intrusive, and very helpful.  They really seem like a great team of people who love what they do and do a great job with their game (and care about game balance too)."
5550,Huzzah
5551,Pretty fun game. Kinda like a MOBA tower defense!
5552,20x better than clash royale i love the cracting card feature and ability to unlock masters f2p amazing game!
5553,great game its fun and free
5554,"game fun

game less fun"
5555,Amazing!
5556,How have I not played this game sooner? This is the best parts of card battlers and MOBAs in one game...and it's FREE. Running in DX9 fixed all crashing issues for me on a GTX1080. I'll happily be buying DLC/addons in the near future. I will definitely be dumping TONS of hours into this game.
5557,"A hamster wheel of imbalanced gimmick card progression with revolving door patch hot spot paywall expansions. Do yourself a favor, and play something else."
5558,"Good time waster. Is it the best? No, but for a simple game it's playable."
5559,"Technically amateurish developer (some of the bugs/coding solutions to needed things were hilarious throughout those years) with minimal effort, gacha shop and automated balance changes with reliance on data and so with poor interpretation or nuance"
5560,Awesome game! My friend told me about it. It's so fun and enjoyable to play!
5561,"Simple and fun deck building game, Quite easy to pick up and learn. Like every pvp games there's cards that are more ''meta'' but once you learn your way around you can compete without any problem really. Didn't put one cent in this game and got all the cards i need."
5562,Very fun game and easy to learn.
5563,pure sexiness
5564,such a wonderful game it makes me feel im playing old school card games but the monsters come to life!
5565,"very fun, competitive game."
5566,"Great game , easy to learn , cant go wrong for being free"
5567,fun
5568,i'm boss in this game
5569,"pretty fun and easy to learn
"
5570,fun and free
5571,good game
5572,This game is dope. Way more strategy than originally thought.
5573,not bad better than nothing
5574,Great deck building game that tests your mind. Always changing strategies and always updating.
5575,"Game is great but crashes all the time even on the lowest graphics settings and even if you try the ""fixes"" in the discussions."
5576,Excellect chill game
5577,"cool free game but has online paid to play 
but also good free play"
5578,GOOD GAME . RECOMANDED
5579,"This game reminds me a lot of clash royal (on phone), but opposite of that game this is a lot more fair game design. There are no levelling cards for stat bonuses and a lot of lower rarity cards are good, while quite a lot of legendary cards are niche in their usage or comparable to other cards.

All in all, I quite like this game and in 54 hours I managed to reach master tier in Dous and Diamond tier in solo."
5580,"Yeah, don't bother. This game is a joke. It has potential, but nah .... just stay away."
5581,"Quite good game, but there are some bugs"
5582,very entertaining
5583,this game is very easy to learn and has quite a bit of strategy needed to be good. Great game to play with a partner!
5584,Free games don't get much better than this. Very well executed.
5585,"Okay so I hate seeing reviews for games with less than 20 hours of gameplay, it just does not do the game any justice or people who really wanna know how the game is. So here is my review:

The game is very fun and addicting. The fast paced matches with constant back and forth between who you are facing makes this game challenging and fun and it scratches that pvp itch. 

The game is a pay 2 win but only to an extent. You can purchase cards that you need like supreme and legendary, but most of the time it's random, sometimes they have sales in their store for huge discounts off of the cards. 

The devs and the chat admin cater to streamers and allow them to spam the chat as long as they keep playing the game, if you say anything or make jokes about them you get silenced with no real explanation. 

Griefing is huge in this game and nothing is done about them, you can report them and still see them in matches a week later doing the same stuff.  Their team is small so I assume that they try their best but its not enough, Hackers also run rampant in the game. I have had many matches where you know they are hacking because they constantly summon 10 cost cards back to back in seconds and overwhelm you and you lose. So it's kind of defeating to your drive to advance when stuff like that happens. 

The dev sends out emails with free items often which is super cool, they always are welcoming feedback but don't normally follow up after, the game itself works good, some issues you will face is optimization, the game isn't very optimized. I run a GTX 1080 and a good I9 with a heafty overclock paired with 32gb of ram and I still have random stuttering from time to time and graphics issues for example, I have a 120hz monitor, the option will show up but when you click it, it just stays at 60hz. I am not sure if everyone deals with this issue but it's something I came across. 

The game is much less toxic due to the fact you can't talk to anyone in the game only in general chat or steam chat. In matches they don't have a chat function just pings. So you don't get flamed or trolled but you also can't be tactical due to the limited few options you have. You can message a user outside of the matches only if they make a post in the general chat by right clicking their username, so no search functions are available.

The pricing for items in game are ridiculous to say the least, they constantly have sales for 60-80% off because of the insane original price to begin with, so take the pricing or ""sales"" with a grain of salt. 

Overall the game is fun, it's a new game with a very green team who seem to be new to the industry, they are still working kinks out and learning how to speak to their audience on a professional level.  I do think this game is worth playing and has some real potential to become a huge success in not only a purely game level success but also a streaming one. 

I hope you enjoyed my review and I will add on to this when I reach 200+ hours of gameplay!"
5586,"It's good, quick fun -- games are only a few minutes long, so it doesn't need much commitment upfront. You may find yourself going for just another one, though."
5587,"great game would recamened, note that it achuly has good players somewhere at silver rank"
5588,"8.5/10

honestly i only gave it a 8.5 to seem professional, but heres the deal:

Game feels like a phone game without the gotcha mechanics, so its pretty dope, deck building/Hearthstone battlegrounds hybrid"
5589,the friend recruit wouldnt work. so would love a dev to reach out to me about this. will be sending a support request as well. loving the game so far. and looking forward to playing more with my friend as well play 2v2.
5590,Matching is still quick. It was fun while it lasted. It seems that you have to buy stuff now just to keep up with other players.
5591,Cool little game with a descent amount of freebies and such. Good time killer play for couple hours and roll.
5592,"Good game, i RPG thats worth getting into"
5593,Good to play with friends
5594,"Highly recommend it. From all the games I have played in the past years, Hearthstone, Magic Arena, Spellweaver, Stormbound, War of the Omens, this is truly a Free to Play game, no Pay to Win at all. You can see it clearly in the top decks, they don’t have that many Top Tier cards. Even when you manage to make a top tier deck, is more about knowing how to play than having powerful cards.

Pros:
-Intense game play, sometimes fast as 2 minutes some other times 5 minutes, rarely more than that.
-Low RNG
-Is more about knowing how to play than having powerful cards.
-Very generous with giving cards and gold. It’s easy to create fun decks and play the ladder.
-Amazing 2vs2 player games.
-Great challenges in Brawls that they call Mayhem.
-I have invested £20 after I decided it was worth it, now I don’t need to put any more money as I have most of cards I need to have different decks and my collection keeps growing.
-When you lose a game only 10% of the times is because of RNG, I love that.

Cons:
-The interface is a bit too bright and childish. I would like the option to change colours or make it a bit darker theme, or with a different themes. 
-Annoying prices with 50 gold with an annoying voice that is just too much after 100h.
-Sometimes minions act in unexpected ways. It could be better.
-Draft sometimes is a bit unfair, but still amazing.
"
5595,really fun little game
5596,"Fun game to chill with friends, a way less toxic version of hearthstone and more fun in my opinion. I feel like I could play it with my nephew all day without getting angry."
5597,"Minion Masters is a fast-paced online deck-building battle game created by BetaDwarf Entertainment. The game was officially released through Steam on 2 December 2016 for PC and later for Xbox One.

[u][b] Gameplay [/b][/u]
In Minion Masters you get to choose one of the 11 unique heroes (more heroes will eventually come with future updates) and build your deck around that hero. Heroes have three different spells that can help you decide what archetype of deck you want to play. Every deck you make consists of 10 cards, either spells or minions. Cards have different stats, attack range, synergies, abilities and their cost vary from 0 to 10 mana. You can draw up to four cards and every time you play one, a new one will be added to your hand recycling these 10 cards until the end of the game. The positioning of your minions, as well as their spawn points and timing can make all the difference because, for example, a melee minion can’t touch a flying minion and must actually reach and be able to hit the target in order to inflict damage.

You start the game in an arena with two bridges that separate two territories. The left part is your spawn area where you can summon your minions wherever you want and the right one is the enemy part. In order to play a card you pay the cost from a mana bar that refills slowly all the time but it can’t exceed 10 mana. Heroes start at 0 level and they gain experience when you control a bridge. In order to control the bridge, the last unit that touched it must be a friendly one and there must not be enemy units contesting it. When heroes gain enough experience, they level up allowing you to use their skills. When they hit level 4 though there are no more spells so you enter a Mana Frenzy state, meaning that your mana bar regenerates very quickly for the rest of the game allowing you to spam cards. Your goal is to kill the enemy hero before they manage to kill you.

[u][b] Online Features[/b][/u]
The creation of BetaDwarf Entertainment has three main different modes, Ranked, Draft and Mayhem. In Ranked you can choose the Solo Que, the Random Team Que or the Premade Que. Every one of these options has its own ranking starting from Wood, Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grand Master. Draft is a classic arena game, letting you choose from three random heroes and then making a deck from random cards. Your goal is to win as many games as possible before losing 3 times with your custom deck. Mayhem is more like a story PVE mode allowing you to unlock multiple rewards if you have the time.

[u][b] Graphics/Sound[/b][/u]
The cartoon-ish graphics look great and the card models are very detailed. I couldn’t find any bugs or rendering and the movement of the pieces is extremely smooth. As for the sound, there is a perfect voice actor in the announcer seat that makes you feel like playing in a crowded stadium. The sound effects are decent making the combat more realistic.

[u][b] Unique Features [/b][/u]
This title is not your classic card game. Your cards become pieces in the battleground like a giant chessboard, although they move automatically, so positioning is essential in order to achieve victory. Minion Masters also have a 2vs2 Team Mode system that allows you to either make a premade team with a friend or team up with a random stranger. You don’t see often Team Mode in card games and it creates a new whole perspective for co-op deck-building.

[u][b] Pros [/b][/u]
-Combines chess elements with deck-building
-Card Game with 2vs2 Modes
-Smooth Gameplay
-Fast small patches improving the cards

[u][b] Cons [/b][/u]
 -Small collection of cards
 -Playing in the same Arena all the time can get boring

[u][b]  Rating [/b][/u] (7.8/10)
Online: 7/10
Gameplay: 8.5/10
Graphics: 7.5/10
Sound: 7.5/10
Uniqueness: 8.5/10

5598,nice game
5599,if your looking for a fun easy to get started battler game this is it
5600,good game
5601,"just a cute timewaster in between chat calls.  Simple enough, doesn't seem to cost much to be competitive, and it does reward more than the dumb stuff.  No oonga boonga mode."
5602,good
5603,Seems like a fair game so far unlike others which are entirely pay to win.
5604,Yep.
5605,"It's pretty good, has a few flaws, but overall a nice game. You won't regret downloading and giving it a try."
5606,"This is a PTW game, if you want to dump money into the game to get legendary cards then you will win every match.   Just a battle royale rip off, discription on the card do not match actual ability of the minion.  Some high level cards are very week and some cards are very over powered.  The game is in need of balancing of the card types and balancing of the avatars by types. If you go against someone with legandary cards you will loose hands down every other match is a coin toss.  DO NOT PLAY UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY."
5607,"Its Fun :)
"
5608,Noticed hacks and you know what happens to a game when the morons take root.
5609,I love how easy it is to pick-up and play this game!
5610,best side game to have running while u multitask
5611,"Noob like me feel casual in the first several matches, no matter play solo or coop. But this is the wood league."
5612,JUST YES!
5613,fun time killer
5614,Pretty fun game if you are into turn based card games
5615,nice game
5616,"One of the only PvP games (incorporating play against A.I. if humans of the same general play level cannot be found in X time) where PvP'ers do not have much opportunity to be silly. The game itself *is* indeed as much fun to play as the gameplay videos look. Great for quick fixes of action. Fine in co-op mode as well, though one wishes the different ""modes"" were Friend co-op enabled."
5617,"There's not a lot of games out there that combine Action RTS/MOBA gameplay with deckbuilding/card game mechanics and add a dash of tower defense too, while they're at it.

Well, there was Valve's Artifact... but let's not talk about that.

Minion Masters combines all of the above to create a truly unique new game which exists in the space between all those genres mentioned above. It's incredibly fun, free-to-play and more people should be playing it - before inevitable clones of it start appearing on the market."
5618,"Well after a few hours. Seems like a fair game. Its fun with short games lasting 5 to 8 minutes, sometimes 1 minute if you just wipe the floor. Battle Pass is actually a great deal  since you can complete it by getting win chest and challenges."
5619,Really fun!
5620,Similiar to Clash Royale with is very fun too play.
5621,"fun, easy to learn hard to master. very addictive! waiting for more cards"
5622,Das good shit
5623,really makes my nips hard
5624,forced 50% win rate matchmaking in draft mode
5625,This game is a little like minesweeper but instead of sweeping for mines youre sweeping all the people who suck literal poopy at this game
5626,"Before I wrote this review I had to ask myself if I would seriously recommend this game to any of my friends. And the answer is clearly no. Why? Is this not an enjoyable game? No, that's not it. The gameplay is somewhat fun even though it is a very simple format like Rock-Paper-Scissors and isn't really skill based. It is a very simple task and playing it alone might be boring. I had fun playing it with a friend but - and that's a big but: 

This game is a collection of all the things that make gambling addictive. This has Roulette, rewards for everything, coin quests, focus on points. It's really hard to picture without having seen it. Basically the game wants you to get addicted and ultimately buy the in-game points in the game's shop. It's not completely pay-to-win but you can invest time or your real money into unlocking the cards and features. 

If you're a parent I highly recommend not to let your children play this. Always be careful with any ""free to play"" games."
5627,So addicting!
5628,"fun game, easy to learn"
5629,"I would only pick this up if you are looking for something like a mobile game come to PC. Its got everything from the microtransactions where you can pay to win, all the way to the little to do other than fight. Which is fine, I'm only playing this because its the end of the week and there is literally nothing left to do in my MMO. 

6/10
"
5630,Fun game! big difference from other card games.
5631,"If you haven't played it, what are you waiting for?!?"
5632,p2w trash
5633,"Pretty fun!
"
5634,Seems like if you are willing to invest a bunch of money this might be fun to play but personally I'm not interested enough to do so and honestly I find the mobile game style strategy set up to be off-putting.
5635,"fun game to pass the time.
"
5636,"Lots of fun to play with friends!
"
5637,Mini warcraft xixi<3
5638,"Literally 0 pay to win, just get good"
5639,as a veteran MTG player ( i left MTG years ago ) .. this has animated attacking minions  with deck building very very enjoyable.
5640,"its fun strat game, fun you can do it with friends
"
5641,So far so good. only issue i have is the connection problems. way to laggy
5642,Its like a mini warcraft 3
5643,"This game is fun - I was invited by a friend - simple and easy to use, yet really fun.....hope it continues...."
5644,"I think people place too much credit on anything that goes on for too long, so I wished to make this long too. Alas, I realized I don't truly care, so let me give a summary.

1. The game is poorly optimized. Although the polygon count isn't too high or anything like that, the game can stutter and closing it takes ages. Some people even close it by using the task manager instead.
2. The game is unbalanced. Lets skip the theoretical balance discussions here and just say both experts and normal players see glaring issues in the game's balance.
3. The game doesn't reward you enough for playing, most rewards are for watching other people play. Some people just open 2-3 twitch streams, sign up for any giveaways, and receive tons of gold that way. They may even win giveaways for rubies and power tokens."
5645,"yes.
"
5646,"nice game, teamgame, fast rounds, high skill cap/counterplay options"
5647,its fun with friends
5648,"I cautiously wander into the territory of card games, but this one I must say was/is quite good. Although it has its pay-to-win element, you can get everything with a little bit of patience, and you can combine your less-epic cards as well into a very effective deck. Thumbs up to developers on this one!"
5649,"love it its fun as heck :P
"
5650,"It's pretty nice and can get you cought up in the game really fast. The only thing I don't understand is why it's drawing so much power, even if my resourcess don't pass 50%. Other than the fans going really loud and having to close the game and open it again after 2 hours, because of random constant lag spikes every 5 seconds, I'd say it's a pretty good game."
5651,"Fun game, could update more often tho, from all this kind of games its one of the better ones"
5652,"Set up a nice deck after 5 rounds. Played another 10 rounds with the same cards. This made it seem like there was no progress as i didn't have to upgrade anything.

It's easy to learn and has nice visuals. 2v2 is fun. Matchmaking is very fast and is well balanced unlike many other pay-to-win games where you die instantly as a newb. Holding the two bridges like ""capture the flag"" is an interesting game play mechanic and really skews who wins. Your character's powers are automatically applied during a match so you can focus more on the fighting.

Overall i can't recommend it because the cards seem linear and my choices don't really matter. I don't play these kind of games much and if i can win 15 rounds straight with almost the same deck and main character, it shows the game is too flat.

Suggestions for the devs: add more ground vs air, fire vs ice, melee vs magic kind of strength and weaknesses.  Add a character and card upgrade tree. And make the character powers more skewed. That way i have to craft a different deck and also adjust my play style to win against different players."
5653,"i like this game bc u can play with people on your team with better cards than you which helps you out..



"
5654,Casual fun game
5655,If you want a quick and fun strategy you came to the right place! The creatures are all awesome and there is no lack in creating a deck that fits your style! I highly recommend to try this game!
5656,enjoyable
5657,i love it like i love my wife
5658,I CAN PLAY WITH MY FRIEND
5659,"I had high hopes, but honestly, the options are very shallow, the crafting system is shallow, the deck comps are shallow, most matches are just the same bullshit, which is fun for the first few days but it grows boring quickly since the game punishes theorycrafting, and rewards simplistic design, a problem that most DTGCs suffer - this one it's more obvious since  the matches are so repetitive and the rewards scarce, and unmeaningful."
5660,Nice free to play game! No pay to win! Play free and enjoy a different card game. If you liked the Hearthstone? Then you most likely have a fun with this game too.
5661,super fun and easy to learn
5662,It's a fun game and they don't bleed you dry to unlock new stuff.
5663,"Love this game. Very addicting, but lots of fun."
5664,Gud Game
5665,Clash Royale
5666,Very beginner friendly and immersive. Nowhere near necessary to buy the micro transactions but if you want more cards or more masters then go for it. Def recommend for free game.
5667,Belo
5668,Awesome! Good Job :D
5669,"One of them best minion game i think, descent gameplay like a clash royale.It's suck game when it asks you to pay money, the game gets bored and starts to annoyed you.
 6/10"
5670,I really like this game so far. It's graphics are charming and the game play is easy to pick up. I would highly recommend to others especially as it costs nothing to the base game.
5671,nice
5672,"Great free to play game kinda of similar to Clash Royale, although it is less grindy in terms of obtaining cards.

Devs are generous to provide with freebies to start you off and always offer their DLC to claim for free for a few days when released."
5673,i like it
5674,eh is good
5675,League of Legends and Hearthstone in one game <3
5676,Yes
5677,Yes
5678,Nice
5679,"Played though grand master in team battles this season. This game has a lot of potential and really wanted to like it more, but I think it needs lot of work. May revisit if they make some changes.

Pros:
-solid core game design
-""free"" content and codes every once and while
-team battles can be fun with a friend
-cards can be fun to collect and there is some fun in deck building

Cons:
-very unbalanced. Several units just need to be removed from the game or reworked because they ruin any game that they are in.
-cash grab micro transactions. would rather pay for the game up front and get everything.
-many griefers and the community isn't all that friendly.
-lack of casual mode. everything you do is ranked which limits you from experimenting without destroying your rank.
-very limited single player experience that is mostly gated behind a paywall."
5680,"Fun, challenging and over all a good game. What more could you wish for?"
5681,Free to Play! A very fun tug of war style strategy game.
5682,"Very easy to get into, awesome graphics and love the turn style used."
5683,.
5684,"Premade without cancerous Wildcards is a 10/10 recommendation.
However, 1on1 and 2on2 randoms is absolute hell. Too much cancer on the ladder which ruins the game and 1on1 is also very luckbased (counter/non-counter) except for the top of the top meta-decks, the game has almost 200cards but only like 20-30 are viable if you wanna hit the top. 

Also there's no option to save-lock any offer in the shop. Which means even if you're about to buy Rubies with money because you want a certain offer, you have to do that in those 24h (even less since timezones are different and theres work+sleep etc...) which is also quite disappointing since it's a way too short timelimit.
Or even for gold-offers. Imagine sitting on 100k Gold for months and then being so unlucky, that you're at 95k for only ONE day and THEN the ""Treasure Trove""appears and you have no way to get it in 24h. Wtf pls? 

Will review again after the WIldcard nerf is around long enough. Though I won't recommend it yet."
5685,Devs couldn't balance a scale with 2 grams.
5686,good
5687,Simple complex game all about getting and playing your cards correctly based on what is thrown at you.
5688,"Plenty of good casual fun, but depth in deck building and strategy is still there. 2v2 is a ton of fun with friends!"
5689,"I play this game on another account, but as fun as the game may seem to be, don't bother playing.  Every 2 months a new update will come out that will completely screw up the balance of the game and render a good portion of your favorite decks useless.  They set up a Chinese game server, but tons of Chinese players come to the Western servers (just like with every other game) to just screw with random people by losing team matches on purpose and just being all around internet-fuktards.   So don't bother trying to be competitive, as some bat-munching idiot will be there daily just to ruin your progression.  Maybe someday they will put a region block on this game and put a stop to the stupidity.  But then again, probably not until the game is dying...  Go play another game and save yourself the trouble."
5690,game
5691,"It has many of the best parts from games like Hearthstone and Battlerite in that the deck you thoughtfully craft is only as strong as your reflexes, tactics, and ability to adapt to your opponent's combos. Matches are quick and the numbers are huge, making for a satisfying grind. Try Minion Masters: it's highly addictive!"
5692,"Easy pickup time burner, would make a great mobile"
5693,fun game
5694,I liked it
5695,What can I say Fun and challenging
5696,good stuff!
5697," Fast to get into and fun. Very nice so far : )
"
5698,"Pretty fun so far, only been playing a couple of hours though"
5699,This game is brilliant!  Free to play and so addictive because of its gameplay.  Highly reccomend the download!
5700,"Best game ever, there isn't really steep learning curve, but their is still depth to it. The developers are also super generous!"
5701,"Terrible pay to win phone game, but it's the best pay to win phone game I've played. I had a good 25hrs before I got bored"
5702,10/10 well played
5703,Fun.
5704,Good Game Still have Fun.....
5705,cool
5706,really cool
5707,Easy to learn and fun to play.
5708,"Good music, good exciting content, easy to learn play, grabbed me just in seconds... A well made game i think. Don't know about later thoughts, thats just 40 hours review but exactly worth it. GJ guys."
5709,I don't play games like this but its really fun lol
5710,"kind of fun...

takes a while until you have some useful cards and until then it feels a bit pay to win. But a little farming and RNGesus on your side and its quite balanced.

PvP aswell as PvE are good to waste some hours."
5711,"alright i am playing it this far and i like the tactic aspect of it , pretty effect nice rg doll physics and matches could really get heated ,  not bd"
5712,Great game to pass time
5713,i loved the game but never craft nyrvir the fallen because its a rip off.
5714,Great Game simple to play and great for passing time.
5715,great game
5716,its really fun
5717,Makes fun.
5718,Milloween is cute.
5719,GOOD GAME
5720,"Don't know why I never reviewed this. 

After 157 hours I can safely say the Developer team behind this is very active in doing balance changes and trying to make new content. That's all that matters to me really. 

The game is free and in my opinion REALLY free. You can EASILY get everything you want by just playing. I'd actually dare say they're TOO generous as I wonder how they even make money? I bought some things purely because I wanted to support them and not to get a specific thing. 

The graphics and voice acting is a bit goofy at times but the game itself is very enjoyable and fun. They also update older models/effects once in a while and they're significantly improved each time. I can absolutely recommend trying it out! Especially because it's free."
5721,Macht spaß und ist Umfangreich
5722,doing adventure get disconnected at map 6 2. time and no save start again fuming....
5723,"Good fun way to kill some time with fast-paced reaction strategy. The rewards come in a pretty steady trickle, too. If daily quests are your thing, there's decent supply, but no so much that this game becomes a job.
I love it."
5724,"Very very like this game. Even it's free to play, but the gameplay is awesome. You guys need to try this. Enjoyable game!"
5725,"I have fallen in love with this game, especially the 2v2 mode. I love games like this, simple but addictive."
5726,"So far so good! Game seems pretty interesting and I like the concept. For a F2p game its not bad. I dont know if its P2W, but ill do some googling to find out."
5727,its a fun casual game and you can really be experimental with your gameplay
5728,It's a beautiful game. You must try it.
5729,good game
5730,"Finally a good game again in the CCG Deckbuilding type genre.
Unique spin on it, super nice graphics, good gameplay, easy to get into and hard to master. Nice rewarding feeling of deckbuilding and using synergies. Not too hard on the P2W front. rewarding gameplay.
TRY IT OUT

Edit: still going strong, love the recent updates"
5731,4 hours in and I'm not bored yet. Great variety of units and spells. Cute graphics.
5732,It's okay? Though it asked me to review it so I'm thumbing it down.
5733,"Easy to pick up game mechanics. Matches are found quickly and games last between 1-7 minutes (average probably in the 3-5 minute range) so there's not a lot of time commitment. Also easy to rank up for a while too, which gives you time to understand what you're doing before you need to start learning meta to win. Regular updates and rewards keep the game exciting to play over time. I am definitely enjoying this!"
5734,"Best minion based card game yet. Smooth game play, great rewards and its easy to learn. 5 stars!
"
5735,This is a must play!! If you have a friend it's even better
5736,great game
5737,bad game
5738,"This is a great game, easy to play, minimally pay-to-win, and the games are short and sweet. Will continue to recommend it so long as the devs continue to make appropriate balance changes, which they've shown they can do.
"
5739,"Fun game, I like the free hero rotation, and its pretty easy to get the cards (they even give them out for free pretty frequently)."
5740,"Hella fun to be honest! 

It's an evolved clash of clans and devs really put a lot of work to keep it simple enough that when they introduce a new mechanic - it really excites the player base. Beyond that, they do a pretty good job in balancing. 

Is it p2w? Not really. Even less p2w than HS or LoL. Yes, you can get a lot of legendary cards if you pay real money but actually acquiring in-game currency (3 to be exact) is quite easy. The most investment I did was 6 hour grinding for crafting my first legendary for which I also got an achievement giving me the highest currency. Other than that - if you want to play the super fun challenges, extra boost with a battle pass or get cosmetics, you gotta pay. I haven't done that yet and I'm having lots of fun."
5741,"After playing and learning long enough to reach masters level in every game type, inhale to not recommend this game. Random teammates in 2's can spam pings to you, basically being toxic, to newer players and you're unable to mute the pings. Also the amount of frustration this game will cause is insane. The marketing is, as other reviewers say, very manipulative. I've made a purchase and basically felt scammed. ""5 5 copies of a legendary card."" I read that as 5 copies of 5 legendary cards. But no, its 5 copies of the same legendary. At the end of the journey, at least I had something to pass some time during my quarantine,  though the marketing isn't even clever. It's simply false advertising. Buyer beware."
5742,"Minion Masters is very fun. That said, it's  much more addictive than it is fun. You'll be playing and wanting to spend money long after you've lost interest. Also, it's moderately pay-to-win."
5743,awesome :)
5744,havent played much but it dece
5745,fun with a friend. Spices things up like a moba would
5746,Minion Masters is a great game but very grinding. I dig it though so I give it a thumbs up.
5747,great game.
5748,its a fun game to pass time and get to play with others during this time we are all spending so much time at home..
5749,good fun
5750,"Even after accumulating 150+ copies of this game in my inventory.

It's.
Not.
That.
Fun."
5751,"*An average RTS game*, if you don't mind...

1. How unbalanced some decks/cards/masters can be (looking at you, Morellia and Stormy)

2. How unbalanced the mana spooling is

3. Trashy teammates at certain times of the day

4. Bots

Try out this game, you just might like it. But it didn't cut out for me."
5752,"Good Game ! Recommended for playing with friend !
Quick Match Making and around 3-5 minutes per match."
5753,Enjoyable for 5mins of 5hours.  A touch addictive.
5754,This game is good
5755,I like the game as long as you understand the mechanics playing it is fairly simple
5756,Fun game.
5757,fun
5758,Nice game. Good mechanics. Very fun to play
5759,Nice game and high brain
5760,Like a more creative 2010s clash royale
5761,Mindless and addicting
5762,"Simple and fun game play, a touch of MTG with Tower Defenders... :D"
5763,Pretty cool game. Easy to grasp and lots of progression and unlocks. I wouldn't say it's pay to play either. You can freely earn stuff to put up a good fight.
5764,Basically PC Clash Royale.
5765,"First time playing this sort of game, nice graphics, like the variety and different strategies available when playing with different masters and minions."
5766,"It's a fun game to play. Sometimes you will be lost in just a moment.
The above is my early evaluation of this game.
But now the game is less and less fun. Because the balance of the game is getting worse. There are only a few neurotic ways to play and win. I don't want to play with some retarded people any more. And let these three-year-old be delighted themselves.
It's time to leave. 
--------------------------------------------------
Manual achievement:
38/38"
5767,is good.
5768,"Very fun game! Makes a unique twist on games we already know and love, and with all the free items and such, you constantly feel like your being rewarded for playing!"
5769,good game
5770,It's fun to pass the time.
5771,"This game is everything i've ever wanted out of a card/board game.  The skill curve is wonderful, as well. It's simple to jump in and play, so new players can enjoy the game. However, the game also has some insanely intricate mechanics that can keep even veteran players on their toes. 

Highly recommend."
5772,So in the beginning this game was great then recently they decided to change the economy of the game to make it more pay to play. They said months ago they were going to remove card sets and they still haven't even done that. This company obviously doesn't care about it's players
5773,"very fun, need to create some more monster cards with high lvl. i would pay $ for this."
5774,I find minion masters expansive and imersive. Also one of my friends likes it so it's one of a few games i can meet up on with others and have an enjoyable experience.
5775,epic game not bad
5776,Truly a great game!
5777,"Easy and casual to get started, strategic depth once u got a first grip on game mechanics. reasonably balanced. fun and addicting gameplay and quite nice deckbuilding. Lovely!

Edit: still probably the best dev team out there."
5778,"Surprisingly good. easy to get into, and rewarding to finetune your deck and build synergies as well as counter popular strategies. good rock paper scissor meta so nothing is clearly unbalanced.
got hooked after a few hours of casual play :D

try it out!"
5779,"if an advertisement was a game. Its bad enough on android, nobody asked for games like this on pc."
5780,decent game.
5781,"good
"
5782,An fresh competitive game you will truly enjoy in quick sessions and is not pay to win.
5783,"good game good garphics 
"
5784,"A not so mini, mini game"
5785,"Aesthetically a bit of mess, but game play is pretty fun and engaging"
5786,"First time playing, so far pretty fun! Still lots to learn tho."
5787,"Pay to win, baby"
5788,good game. mix of clash royale and hearthstone. great game and brings something new to the table. isnt just a clone
5789,This is the best game of this format that I have played. They are very fair with giving you rewards and plenty of cards for free. I only spent the $20 on the extra coins/exp per game because I felt like the company deserved my $20.
5790,Played this game on Discord. Bought all account upgrades. Worth it and devs surely deserved it. It's a pitty you can't transfer Discord Account to Steam. Still a great game.
5791,Fun game to get into if you're cool.
5792,"It shouldn't be this fun, and yet..."
5793,Super fun
5794,Just started playing it. Seems fun. Short and sweet.
5795,Good game!!!
5796,Nice game
5797,Simple but interesting.
5798,"You know one of those predatory mobile games with cartoonish graphics who spam their ads only for you to download them and watch more ads? Minion Masters is an attempt to port that to PC. I was thinking about giving a negative review, but decided to give a positive one because they're at least somewhat honest about their intentions, ""dangerously addictive"" is literally in their description."
5799,love
5800,"There is a lot of good strategy, it's sufficiently hard, and it's easy to understand."
5801,o

5807,Can you say ADDICTION!
5808,Achei muito legal e versátil :3
5809,I believe that I have mastered minions. thanks
5810,FUN GAME!! love the team play
5811,"This game is a really stress-free deck building game with loads of cards to build with. I have had this since beta and have been playing it very casually but it has a lot of potential for competitive. Real easy to get used to and easy to play. It has quite a bit of extra ""campaign"" you could say that updates and changes frequently. 
Favorite part is being able to team battle with or without friends and make super strong combos and team decks with your friends and smash the competition. Also they have been updating the graphics and let's just say that it has almost had its own HD remake.
Great game and keep up the awesome cards!"
5812,Good
5813,"47hrs and going. Fun and fast pasted. The ""card decks"" are small so choices are important, and co-op play offers fun strategic opportunities."
5814,Player-friendly.
5815,good
5816,"Pay money and enjoy, cheat a little, make your scripts and own everybody else. This game in it's core is entertaining, but there's so many cheating scum around it's disgusting. Played 2vs2 against two asians who had 9HP left and almost never managed to hold a bridge - BAM! Out of a sudden they overwhelm you with cards ranging from 6-10 mana, pulling them out of their asses very 2 seconds and fuck us up! They managed, completely naturally of course, to make it from ubernoobs to grandmasters of faceslam in one single match. Same thing some round later: sucky enemy players who barely could use a mouse, became MONSTERS OF BUTTFVCKING when they had 35HP left and raped us anally without lube. WTF IS THIS?! Others pulled out a Colossus right from the Start and made us eat our own feces in 46 friggin' seconds! And so on... and now i have to check every fckn' replay where something seems fishy. And it mostly gets fishy if you play against asians or dudes with a ""???????""-name. Still, i managed to climb up to Platinum 4 rank and today i had like 15 matches and won 3. Even scum who only had 2-4s in his deck ripped us apart. I could have spawned Jesus merged together with Satan, Jesusatan and still would have been one-hitted by some rank 2 Voidborne s-hit or smth like that. Fix your shit, motherfuckers!

Edit 2022: I got back to this trash and it#s even worse now. Unstable servers who collapse mid-game, lags, insane unbalance (me being rank 3 platin getting put together with a rank 3 wood dude and so on) in 2v2. The game has not improved a single bit, but the opposite."
5817,hur dur nice game
5818,Casual and fun. :)
5819,"dis game its good cuz i think its good
"
5820,Very entertaining. The rounds are short so it's easy to play while watching kids or communicating in stream.
5821,"Gave it a try because I had a Twitch code for a DLC.  The instructions on Twitch were wrong (hit lvl 6, you have to hit 7).  Also, it wouldn't even recognize my valid code.  
The game is laggy and has stuttering issues.  I'm on an AMD 3600x with a 5700XT.  Not my PC.  
Gameplay is very F2P, meaning that it's over-monetized.  Everything seemed to be all about getting new 'minons', for money, of course.  
At least the gameplay is fun, but will stay away from this one for the bad coding, and inability to properly give out their own microtransaction DLC."
5822,Fun. Fantastically easy. Great strategical play.
5823,Top
5824,Its was fun to play with especially if you like to battle other opponents

Thanks to the developers :)"
5845,fun
5846,"Simply, AMAZING game!"
5847,Ok just newbie for this game enjoy it i though it fair enough
5848,"Do you like skinner boxes? 
Do you like mobile games but want to pretend you're actually PC Masterrace?
Do you want to feel like the ultimate Pepega?"

5851,Really fun. Clash Royale but more ironed out
5852,"good
"
5853,"Not my normal type of game play, but I am enjoying this one much more than Originally expected.
I like the pace and the ability to select your next card. Sometimes the load time seems longer than I want it to be but it is a great challenege to my patience."
5854,Fun and addictive  game. If you catch the DLC when they launch they've all been free.
5855,"Fun, simple,, addictive.  Easy to get into yet tough to put down.   Really decent for a freebie!"
5856,"Great game, the performance still needs improvement."
5857,"I got this as an early access bonus in a humble bundle and figured I'd give it a chance. I have been playing since the first version and a lot of new cards have been added. 

I can't speak for new players, but if you sign up for the newsletter, and play for about a month you should have have a decent deck going. The game is not pay to win, and you can unlock everything by being a loyal fan. Again, I can't speak for people just now getting into it but I haven't spent a penny on this game and I absolutely love it.

there's still some UI improvements that can be made but all in all, I give it a solid 9/10 for what it is.

TL;DR: If hearthstone was free and live action."
5858,Amazing!
5859,"Amazing, nice and easy to play."
5860,Dope af.
5861,nice

5879,"With a friend, Team Batlles can be quite fun"
5880,"simple
I prefer playing heartstone"
5881,the duo play mode is a lot of fun and really lets you have custom options with your cards.
5882,"very enjoyable easy to play, good graphics new content frequently. Only downside so far is no new masters"
5883,"I'm actually surprised by how much I like this game, I honestly didn't expect much from Minion Masters, but it's a wonderful game to spend a little time on. So far it seems like the matches don't take any longer than 10 minutes, and it's surprisingly easy to get cards to create decks. I was a little scared to see if the game was truly ""pay to win"" like some of the reviews suggest but honestly I haven't noticed anything of the sort so far. You level up pretty fast and get coins to spend fairly easy as well. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but I just really seem to be enjoying it and haven't really noticed any faults with it."
5884,"A charming little Clash Royal style of game. While you can pay to buy new cards faster than you would earn them for free, duping your cards doesn't seem to really increase the power of your cards, but rather increase the amount of battle pass progress you get from using them which seems to be a very fair system.

Maybe something will happen to make me change my mind on this game, but for my experience so far I've been enjoying it quite a bit."
5885,Very fun game
5886,"love quick play through with a strategic twist

5887,"Wasn't going to give the game a try at first, but I got some free stuff from my Twitch Prime and I figured why not. Game is pretty fun, it's like Hearthstone if Hearthstone had better graphics and an actual battlefield. Haven't played much yet, so no idea if my opinion may change or not as I get further into it."
5888,"I play this awesome game on an old Windows 7 Laptop (I'm too poor to afford any real gaming PC rigs, lol!), and, the game is just phenomenal! I could just imagine how it would look and run on a real gaming PC! The game is like Yugioh, but, better! Try it for yourself, and, be amazed, for yourself!"
5889,monkey
5890,Its a fun and nice game to spend time on
5891,"its got potential to be good, but two big problems besides being p2w-

-its too easy to play and win with aggro builds.  The nature of your tower being pretty low hp compared to other moba / tower defense games means esseentially that whoever smashes face the fastest will win.  Control builds should counter aggro, for instance your opponent plays three ground creatures, and you cast a fireball to kill them all, but the reality that you will still take some dmg in the meantime means that you are on the back foot even if you gain a mana advantage.

- no ability to really upgrade units.  upgrades are cosmetic only or allow you to put another copy of a unit into a deck.  this just funnels the game into p2w again where whoever buys the most expensive powerful legendaries wins...not who was able to tweak their strategy to the current meta."
5892,"p cool.
"
5893,"The game developer interferes in games and cheats for or against certain players. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH IT IS ""FREE."""
5894,Great game to play with friend
5895,"Ive really enjoyed the entire experience of the game, aside from the incredibly annoying over-the-top announcer voice that reminds me of some type of evil carnival or game show lol... however thats obviously a personal opinion, and doesnt effect the gameplay or make the game less playable in any way. Looking forward to seeing whats next ,thanks devs well done"
5896,yee haw
5897,Good Game
5898,...it's a great little lane game
5899,"Is there anything better? Seriously if anyone can reply with a game they enjoy more of a similar genre, because I would love to try it!

I've been playing Minion Masters for closing on two years. I have yet to find ANY game that pulls me back to it the way it's been able to do!

As far as a game you can play Casually OR Hardcore, you have both options. Cards are VERY easy to obtain IMO. You can make a build of all commons and rares and be competitive. Having legendaries for the most part just gives you more options (sometimes very powerful ones) but aren't essential for starting out or even playing competitively.

Pros: 
- Easy to Jump into! You can play a few rounds when you want to take a break from work for example as I do. Games last 1-8min typically. Averaging around 3-4 min typically at Master where I tend to end up. I'm always fully engaged each game.

- Easy to learn, hard to master! Another beautiful part of the game is learning all the ways to win every exchange to gain a mana advantage and steamroll opponents with pushes.

- VARIETY! There's so many interesting decks you can build and I think this is what brings me back the most. You can constantly try something new and even after 700 hours I'm seeing unique decks pop up.

- Skill Based! I'm going to counter some of these points in the Cons but overall I feel that skill out paces OP or cheap strategies. With that said if your deck is a fun deck that doesn't have many strong counters you may have some rough battles, but typically that's only in the higher levels. 

- Devs appear on top of the game and always fine tuning it.

CONS:
-Morellia: I can't believe she's done being tuned. I would say her normal abilities already put her into top tier but add on that dragon that ALSO casts a 6 cost AOE spell for 8 mana... She's fun to play but far too strong compared to other masters and I think tweaking the dragon by removing the AOE spell is the bare minimum the could do. I would further nerf her dragon. No other master has a 3rd tier ability that comes close.

- Stormy: They need to make it so you can't heal him, it turns him into a non stop chain lightning that with Jadespark made him far too strong. Even without the ability to heal him he would still be strong but not oppressive the way he can be at times.

- Meta decks that make the game less fun. It's a bit annoying when you encounter a steep meta where everyone is running something and your only move is to play it too or a good counter deck. It's still not a deal breaker because there's ways to deal with it but it's annoying. Like any game it's to be expected to encounter some of this.


Conclusion: It's FTP, and it isn't P2W although I've spent some money in the beginning, (maybe $50). More than anything to support the developers. I'm very happy with the game and honestly worried I may be a bit addicted LOL."
5900,"WOW GOOD
"
5901,"not bad

The cards are good except that I would personally changed some cards, bcs they sometimes can be OP.
I recommend everyone to try this game and enjoy a lot of fun!

5913,good
5914,"Tactical multiplayer sorta tower defence game. Games are usually around 2-5 min, allowing you to play for a brief time before switching to something else. Plus, since you can only communicate through emotes, there is no toxic multiplayer chat"
5915,I am liking this game... well then
5916,The usual pay to win garbage
5917,not really for me. but if you like clash of clans it's kind of like that

5919,Pretty Cool Game!
5920,Its really good
5921,it is really fun and awesome game just a thing u need to relax ur mind and have soo much fun
5922,cool stuff
5923,"It's a fun, little game that starts off simple.  The seasons and design detail run deeper for those that want to really spend some time in it.  I like that I can pop in for 10-20 minutes and enjoy a match or two."
5924,looks like clash royale but most focused on PvE
5925,So far I am enjoying the game.
5926,"cool
"
5927,"This is a great, fun, game and they often give out free DLC!"
5928,+
5929,"Another great game to suck at. Just kidding, the mechanics are easy and newbie-friendly. Give it a try. After all, it's free. :D"
5930,"Its a phone game. Balance is bad to get to to spend money rather than grind for cards.

5931,its a good game.
5932,pretty fun so far

5934,So far great
5935,found delegen
5936,Good game

5938,Better and less of a Pay 2 Win than Clash Royale.
5939,So far it is a good game i like the card/action game play reminds me of magic the gathering i play
5940,Fun game
5941,Perfectly balanced. Went in not knowing a gosh darned thing and won a match. Heck yes.
5942,LOVE THE GAME
5943,"awesome
"
5944,"The game has a lot of potentials, i enjoy it.
p/s : i know the dev have to earn money somehow and i am not against the whales, but free stuff occasionally ( doesn't have to be big stuff, just about the frequency ) for players is a nice gesture showing the dev cares about all player base and not just whales. it's something the game like Warframe has been doing for years and it made the game pretty much the best F2P game model yet."
5945,"This game used to be decent, but isn't fun anymore because the other players act like children and they get away with it. 

About a third to half of my games, even at master rank, my team mate refuses to play. He'll even spam emotes so that I know he's there, but he won't play any cards. When this happens, I report these players for griefing. However, it must not be working -- evidenced by how prolific these toxic players are."
5946,"I like it, it's fun, and it's free. I play with my best friend."
5947,Really fun and quick to pick up. Once you get used to the game prepare to learn different deck metas as the seasons change.
5948,yes i like ur game give me free stuff and i will like it more (i just want king puff idc how just gimme) thank.
5949,"Easy to start, easy to see the power of cards increasing. Promises much for future teamwork and strategy."
5950,fun
5951,its a fun take on the Clash of Clans arena gameplay. Grindy but still fun
5952,Good for a free game. Gives you loads of free stuff and does not force you to buy the DLC/ ingame items unlike other games.
5953,Perfect
5954,Is fun.
5955,Game for braindead morons. Candy Crush requires more IQ.
5956,i don't want to leave a review i changed my mind >:V

5959,Simillar to clash royale in a good way.
5960,A fun game!
5961,lovely simplified visuals
5962,"gameplay is fun but it just lacks cards, once they add more cards ill gladly come back."
5963,It's a fun free game :-)
5964,"Minion masters is not a bad game. The main theme of the game is battling an opponent in a closed arena. You drop cards in the field and minions spawn or spells are casted. It's a great idea and good implementation. A lot of fun can be had playing it with friends. 
It's not easy for me to explain why I will not recommend this game while I still consider it fun and keep coming back at it. To do that, I'd have to risk sounding like a dork and give my thoughts on why I believe this game was better when it started. 

I've played this game a lot as you can see. 
I'm one of the early players of this game and really stuck with it. I believe this game builds on a great concept and has many virtues. 
The developers have also put on great efforts to improve it. From its release, Minion Masters has received many more interesting features, has been optimized, balanced etc. It's now much more polished so I can't say that the game was overall better when it started. The game's core concept and play-style remain the same, if you take aside the side-features and bonus schemes that were added later, so at least that hasn't changed for the worst. 

The elements of Minion Masters that changed for the worst in my opinion have to do with the game's 	[b]monetization[/b] model. When this game first came out, it wasn't free. You would have to buy it and with that you could get all current masters, most cards and a decent amount of in-game currency to get started. Back then, I had gotten the game from a free giveaway that the devs did. 

Getting the game for free didn't include the sort of ""welcome package"" people that had bought the game would get. Kind of like it works now while the game itself now is officially free to play. But by putting in some hours, you could get all masters and enough powerful cards to build a very powerful deck. 
Back then I used to be very vocal saying that this game wasn't pay to win and I considered my self a live example of how you could perform well at this game's ranking system without paying a dime. 

With maybe 200 hours in, I was reaching the top ranks each season. Back then it wasn't hard to rank high. maybe a weekend's grind could get you there. It was just skill and a good deck that you needed. That's nowhere near as hard as it is today, with BetaDwarf releasing myriads of cards each season. But in the process something changed and I wasn't ranking high anymore. I kept coming back to this game thinking it might be my deck, or that I'm not putting in enough hours... But it wasn't that simple. 

What's the difference now? Well, with each season there also comes a new set of cards. Nowadays, hours alone won't cut it. You could be playing this game full time and still you wouldn't be getting all the season's top cards. Ever since the seasonal cards were introduced, I've ramped up my hours but I'm still falling behind in getting the top cards of the last two seasons. 

But without new legendary cards, you fall behind in the meta and no longer can compete. And to be perfectly honest, I'm not looking to get everything for free. I'd be very happy to pay a reasonable amount of cash and support the devs. At this point, I would even consider ""buying"" the game. Really, if I could pay for something like a VIP account via a one time payment so I can forget going crazy to grind for cards I'd happily do it. But the current model makes me think that the developers are really just after a constant stream of cash other than caring to do something so high rank players can be competitive without having to worry about grinding. 

Currently, you can not purchase single cards you want with in-game currency. You can only pay real money to buy all of a season's cards as a DLC or buy in-game currency and spend it on boosters or the season pass. So unless somebody spends like 15€ each season to get the new cards together in a DLC, buying in game currency can only reduce the hundreds of hours that would be needed to get the new cards for free, to dozens. 

[b]TL;DR[/b]:this game can still be fun and I would say that people looking for pure pvp fun should't miss the opportunity of trying it. But overall it's a very addictive game and the devs are very cunning in their ways of bringing you back. If you ever think of trying to be competitive and perform well in this game, the only way to do it now is to keep pumping cash into it. Unless you have superhuman powers and the endurance to keep grinding a single game more than full time hours every day."
5965,this game called minion master
5966,Fun fast and challenging quests solo and new events good stuff for all ages.
5967,THIS IS A VERY GOOD GAME A STRATEGIC AND COMPLICATED BUT IN THE SAME WAY VERY ENJOYABLE
5968,"Fun free to play game. Simple to learn. Fast paced. Free hero rotation every week. I would suggest playing it for 3-5 hours before giving up. 1v1 and 2v2 multiplayer modes.  If you do not like multiplayer, the solo content is fun too."

5974,fun way to pass time
5975,"bad, 2 years ago devs said they would optimize the game with the like 1.4 patch or something, they still didnt do it, the new co-op campaign is broken and literally unplayable."
5976,"Good Game, very much like other games of this style."
5977,fun time waster..  just wish we could merge accounts between steam and discord nitro
5978,I honestly don't know why I like this game so but I do.
5979,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME.  I have 1000s$ in Hearthstone and just realized this game exists.  Please play this game and make it more known!  such an underrated game! My wife and I found it while exploring xbox live store looking for a game to play co op.  We DID NOT realize it doesnt do CO OP local on console but realize it is a fun game.  You CAN ONLY PLAY ONLINE TOGETHER FOR COOP, PLZ UNDERSTAND THAT.  GREAT GAME!!!!"
5980,I'm not 100% sure how to play it but its quite fun
5981,"great game ,Takes skill and brains to overcome your enemy. would recommend to anyone who wants an easy game to play and not have to use your keyboard."
5982,"There are instances where the reward chest glitches and you can't back out or claim it. When you restart the game, the chest disappear and/or the progress gets rolled back. I was level 16 once this happened, and got rolled back to level 11 and lost all my loot along with progress. Not cool"
5983,"So go, cant stop playing. someone send me food"

6006,Nice relaxing battle card game
6007,"Crashed during end of match loot chest opens twice. Didn't get any rewards, no response to bug report. 

Rewards are minimal for victories, it seems much more money grubbing than the usual f2p game. Played exactly one round of ""aDVeNtUrE"" before it tried to make me buy something to even continue with the storyline. JFC give SOMETHING to people so they actually want to give you money, this is absolutely stupid. 

"
6008,"easy to play, easy to pick up, easy to master"
6009,"People have complained about bots for years, but the devil that kills the game is social bots. They are animators, they work for the industry - they are here to give life into online gaming... they have cheats, gems, and other in-game money... in the virtual world, they are powerful gamers, kings, and lords... this game uses them. A very boring industry trick. (Ro)bots are better though.

6010,"fun game. like a hearthstone type with solo, 2v2's and you can play with guilds :)"
6011,"Card cost in this game: 1-10... but 80% players use 3... max 4  mana cost decks. Copy paste, next game..."

6013,Fun to play if you like card games you should play it and yea it for free you won't lose anything
6014,Pretty graphics but that is about it
6015,Very Nice Game
6016,good
6017,"A shame that discord became jewish and wouldnt let me play it on there, so I had to reset my progress. Very enjoyable game, would 100% recommend for people who like games like clash royale"
6018,OMG! This is so fun! It's like tower defense had made a baby with Hearthstone!!!
6019,its fun to play ;)
6020,"It's okay I guess. 

Just kidding. Wanted to go along with the meme. No Minion Masters is a pretty fun game that I just somehow keep coming back to no matter how many times I feel I don't think it's interesting anymore. It is just something I do before I go to bed, or in between, when I have little time. I've tried the competitive side of it. Something I like to do with any game. It didn't go all that well, despite me always being GM every month without trying. I don't think the game is entirely fit for it. While it does have a fairly high skill level, it is kinda like rock, paper and scissors. Especially since the implementation of wildcards. If you end up against a specific type of deck that counters yours, you will be screwed no matter how good you play. Also, due to it requiring a work around to actually see what happens in game on time, you oftenly find yourself just too late (for example, you cast lightning when there is one creature, the opponent then plays a creature and then it hits, possibly hitting the newly placed card). Now this is a high level thing, something you would not notice when you start playing for quite some time. 

It is why I dont think it is very fitting for high level play, even if it does have it. But it is a fun game. Alone or with a friend. Now I am unsure this game is free atm, but you can always find free codes for it, so I recommend it to anyone"
6021,Good Fun Game
6022,fast fun games
6023,Nice moba game
6024,"A mix of Hearthstone, Hero line Wars (Warcraft 3 custom map) and MOBA.

And its free so its neat!"
6025,Fun!
6026,i love the game so far cause of the diversity between players decks and the way cards get stronger
6027,"I spent $30 on the account upgrades and I have all of the cards but two after just shy of three months.
(Disclaimer I also have twitch prime and got some DLC stuff for free)

Game play is fun and engaging.

More fun with a friend."
6028,good times
6029,Solid free-to-play game.  Not the highest skill cap game but definitely fun!
6030,"Fun game to spend time in, easy to get stack in this game, but you can almost quit when you wannt.! Love the frequent rewards and that something is always happening!"
6031,Fun game to pass the time with a friend
6032,Fun
6033,Good fun with mates.
6034,"Highly addicting, here's a reffer a friend link 
http://minionmastersthegame.com/referral/?ref=BH5W
Many f2p games tend to force you into a corner when buying in game stuff, but this one, at least for me, didn't do that.
There's also not hundreds upon hundreds of cards, so there's a good chance you'll eventually recognize all the units and how they function as soon as they hit the battleground"
6035,"As an avid fan of card games and auto battlers this game scratches all the right itches. It's fast, fluid and most importantly fun. Give it a shot!"
6036,"Got the game for free but geez it feels so PtW... i face players that basically whipe me away with a smile so easy I feel like I can't win without paying! The artstyle is okay, very cartoony but hell there are some ugly models, like so ugly I don't want to use them...  even if they are powerful..."

6046,"Changed my review -- it was negative in the past for the reason: ""It's a fun game ruined by certain overpowered cards"". Now I think the balance is in a fairly good state so I can recommend it. The expansion is coming out soon though so... who knows what's up coming up, lol. I'm gonna leave the below comments the same so the stuff about balance doesn't really apply so much anymore. There are a few balance issues but they are fairly minor imo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Positives:

-Cool different playstyles with each character.

-Graphics are ok.

-Easy to get into.

-Quick games (usually around 3 minutes, going up to 5+ minutes for the really intense matches).

-If you're patient enough, it's free. If you aren't patient and mind losing to overpowered cards then it's not and would be a negative. Characters are quick(ish) to get.


Negatives:

-Heavily P2W for new players. The game isn't new so the basic card loadout it gives you isn't great vs the cards you have to unlock. Obviously you have some decent ones but you can leave a lot of games thinking what the hell you could have done to stop that loss (nothing). Even after playing 40+ hours of the game I still don't have some of the essential cards like Chain Lightning or the knight guy who goes invincible every 10 seconds. The essential cards usually cost a lot of ingame currency if you want to buy them directly.

-To further on the point above about ""heavily P2W for new players"" -- you'll be put up against bots mostly for the first few leagues and you even get them much higher like in Masters league. You won't know they are bots until you've already put several hours into the game and can tell what bot spawning vs player spawning patterns are like. You'll also notice the most generic sounding names given to these ""players"" (or weird ass common names like ???? or [Loading]). There has been little ""proof"" of bots, but everyone knows they are there.

-Unit balance is terrible for very specific cards. Sometimes a 7 cost unit can just obliterate everything (light beam wolf) even up to 10 costs and other 7 costs are more or less useless in most situations. Example from the above is chain lightning, it's a 4 cost spell and can 1 shot (and stun if not) almost everything up to a 3 cost. It also links from 1 minion to another which means you can cast it from 1 end of the arena and it can keep linking until it's on the other side of the arena. It can easily get over double it's value back and sometimes even triple. Meanwhile, Fireball which you get at the start does slightly higher damage, is about half the radius (small), doesn't link between minions and it only does about 3/4 hp to most 3-4 cost units (and no stun).

-Loot boxes. I get that it's a free game and they have to make money somehow but when you have options to buy all the characters for £15 and battle passes etc, you shouldn't need loot boxes. You can get lots of loot boxes for free just by playing and spending your daily gold etc but you'll find you will start getting an absolute ton of duplicates which is essentially worthless for a lot of cards. To play more than 1 of a certain card you need to get lots of duplicates of that card which involves RNG loot box rolls or having to pay cash monies to directly upgrade it (very expensive).

-Game hardware lags/freezes sometimes and occasionally just crashes.

----

I'm not saying I'm pro at the game and I know how all the balance works perfectly but I've come to not enjoy the game nearly as much anymore due to specific cards just clearly bringing in a shit ton more value than they're actually worth every time they're summoned. Yes, sometimes you have hard counters and that's fine, but sometimes the hard counters are so niche that unless you take the most boring all-round build out there to deal with everything possible then you're gonna lose hard to literally 1 card you don't even have yourself. I wouldn't even be bothered much about loot boxes either but the fact that you have to unlock them to get more shards to either buy cards direct or get lucky for the good stuff really grinds my gears."
6047,Meh
6048,"I absolutely recommend this game.
Downloaded it while expecting nothing, but got a very enjoyable game that surprisingly does not require you to pay.
PROS:
-Quick games
-Skill>Meta
-Many combinations while building decks that ultimately depend on what you want
-Daily/Weekly activities that don't feel like chores
-No need to pay to compete, the paid currency merely speeds some unlocks like masters/cards
CONS:
-Artwork and some of the cards could have been better thought out
-Most masters (main characters of a deck) are underwhelming both in design and function

Conclusion: I had to nitpick for the cons. This is genuinely a fun game for those who enjoy strategy or card games. Also for those who care for a game not being p2w, this does it very well. There is a currency that can be used to unlock things but since game doesn't revolve around set meta decks that are inflexible like in hearthstone, you can make your own deck and play competitively."
6049,]\.
6050,I try and find games that are fun for not only myself but for my clients with disabilities can understand and learn as well this is great for those who need help with math and simple strategy.

6052,"This is actually a lot of fun, check it out."
6053,"Super fun, simple and free! Matches are the perfect length. Game gives me a dopamine rush!"

6061,i can play it wth two broken arms so im not bored
6062,"Monkeys spamming boss cards, and 5k hour andys using their perfect cycle decks are really annoying. 
$300 worth of dlc that barely adds fucking anything, is scummy, pathetic, and cluttering. 
Apart from that and their bad balance changes, its a good game and i have alot of fun."
6063,"Nice flow, upgrade system, could use better music but it's a fun alternative to traditional style of gaming"
6064,ya good
6065,"Game is dope, the card synergies are cool. Would like to see a few different ideas and exploration with mechanics, though that's more personal preference."
6066,
6067,Best game of it's kind.  This isn't like that garbage pay to win Clash Royale.
6068,its stable and fluid with high FPS but it would be nice to see the xbox version get optimized and get higher frame rates.
6069,Very fun game!
6070,"GOOD GAME
"
6071,I so far really like this game it is a good time killer and it is also very fun
6072,Great time killer
6073,"Buy it, very good"
6074,Great game very active.
6075,Very good game
6076,Best game ever!  I just absolutely LOVE this game!
6077,"obnoxious ui, micro-payments, apparently you face bots in ranked which ur not told about, such a shame cus gameplay is fun and relaxing"
6078,Good
6079,"Like any other online game, it's P2W. There are cheaters or people who've paid a bunch of money so they can win. Either way, it's extremely frustrating to watch your opponent summoning 4-5 units every 30 seconds when you can't even field 2."
6080,Very nice :D
6081,Cool lot of free stuff all the time
6082,"Love this. The perfect blend of RTS, Moba, Tower defense, deck builder, and auto battler. + the shortest matches around."
6083,great game fun so far
6084,"Hey, don't get me wrong, I like this game and spend the money on it. The thing is it just eating up my ram ( 16 G) and make it lag , even for just 2 seconds, it makes you feel sucks!"
6085,"Fun game; fast action yet relaxing. Seems simple, but allows plenty of room for strategy. Annoyingly addictive too, with matches rarely lasting longer than 5 minutes, so it's really easy to talk yourself into just...one...more...round...

A word of warning for people who got all excited about the 'deckbuilding' tag though: this is NOT a deckbuilding game- it's a CCG. In fact, not even their draft format is a true deckbuilding game, so I have no idea how it got that tag, but it is what it is. A fun RTS arena CCG- not a deckbuilder."
6086,I enjoy teh card base but also a visual of seeing the units duke it out.
6087,.
6088,"Minion Masters is a good game overall, a little repetitive but fun. Progression and resource income is slower than I would like it to be, but it's not a deal breaker. I guess they want you to lose patience and buy stuff to make it faster haha!"
6089,"2 words to describe this game. Fun and free. Such a simple concept yet it delivers a lot of variety in the game. Cool cards to play with awesome characters. Hero rotation is kinda meh but other than that, i'm hooked."
6090,fucking awesome
6091,Its a very addictive game that i think many people should play its very fun and it it a non stop fighting game :)
6092,it's a good and calming game
6093,This game is fun! I was skeptical at first because I have had my share of bad experience with addictive card and brawler games but this was is very polished and enjoyable even for a 40 year old casual gamer like me :)
6094,"Pretty fun game, I got it while it was on sale for free.  Game play is pretty tight, it rewards you for paying attention and good deck building.  There is not a lot of strategy in the beginning but I can see how at higher levels in the ranking ladder strategy and deck building really can come into play."
6095,Good game is good.
6096,"Fun to play. If you like arena multiplayer, card battler, deck builder type games then you will enjoy this.  Graphics are good enough, sound is very well done and the gameplay its self is solid. Not pay to win although if you spend some money you will have a better experience overall.  4/5"
6097,sexy
6098,Don't even waste your time on this ****
6099,funny lolllll pay to win
6100,"This game is really good except for the ""pay-to-win"" players who are bad.  i really like :)"
6101,Sehr aufdringlich
6102,yes
6103,"It's pretty nice, reminiscent of Clash Royale but looks like a League of Legends
It is highly recommended"
6104,good game
6105,besxt in slottt X
6106,"A very fine game, not so P2W . I only played it a couple of hours but I literally dominate the lowest rank lol"
6107,This is proably the best set i have seen for one of these games So far to date It is well thought out and well played
6108,lots of free op stuff
6109,this is good games
6110,Game is solid fun for real time strat. Just hoping things don't get pay2play stupid
6111,"I'm liking the game so far, it reminded me of Clash Royale the game I played in the mobile. This seems balance for now, the graphic is good, its like RTS but a Card Game.. :D"
6112,"It is a good game on the majority of levels. It is reasonably well balanced, has a generous free to play, good pacing, suitable high quality graphics, and solid gameplay.

The only reason I can’t recommend this game is the match making algorithm which is the most anti-competitive and manipulative I have ever seen.

It makes any kind of competitive rank climbing nearly impossible without a crazy amount of time and multiple high quality (expensive) decks. 

So if all you plan to do is extremely casually pop on every once in a while to play a few games it is a fun game. But don’t bother trying to learn the meta-game because the algorithm essentially makes it worthless."
6113,I like it.
6114,It's pretty fun.
6115,"So far so good on my end.

No technical problems.
Nice and casual for someone to just pick up and play.
OST is fitting enough, and the announcer enthusiastic enough but not heard outside of start/finish."
6116,not bad
6117,"Fast paced rock-scissors-paper with board control and placement / target priority thrown in. Extremely active devs who keep tweaking for balance as needed. There's unlocking masters, but no pay-to-win here.

Blood Imps is never the answer."
6118,"Nice game, good to play time tot time to get a good mood."
6119,Fast paced. I like it. :)
6120,"pretty fun. fast matches. it's fun to win, but not frustrating to lose. team battles are fun!"
6121,"Fun tactical game. It's easy to keep up with the rest while playing f2p, though if you want to progress faster, do all adventures asap and get more cards easily you will need to pay.  I really like it!"
6122,nic
6123,Quite good FREE DECK duo game
6124,"Just jumped right into this game, and it's lots of fun. You just play, and enjoy the game. So far, the matchmaking is quick, and the battles aren't gimmicky. I haven't delved too deeply into the store, but I'm hoping that the free-to-play, in-game rewards continue at a steady pace."
6125,"it's fun to play
"
6126,GG
6127,Simple and fun
6128,"Well firstly it's free to play and the developers go one step further and the first week of a new DLC they also give the DLC away for free, I know of no other game developer that does this. There's micro transactions in the game, but it's so balanced that the game is not Pay2Win, and you don't have to grind 6billion hours for one card. There' no card levels, that would give Pay2Win people a greater advantage, you'll only get all cards faster, but not be better at the game. Pay2Win normally kills games for skilled gamers, we know Pay2Win, smurf and hackers are the same non-skilled people, but it's not the case here. Free players can compete fairly with paying clients."
6129,"Minion Masters,

Is the best tower defense game I've ever played."
6130,Pleasing and Charming.
6131,"pretty fun and easy to pick up
"
6132,"Nice learning curve, no need to level up the cards. It's a very fun game."
6133,Shallow and pointless.
6134,"everyone sucks at this game, 1 hour in and im bronze lol
"
6135,"i just like it okay! 
just joking awesome free game"
6136,Easy to enjoy your time when playing it.
6137,i love it
6138,"The game seems fun for the 4-6 hours i've played it, i like it!"
6139,its fun. but i have only played a short while. quick matches are good.
6140,good
6141,realy enjoy it... no challenge so far
6142,"It's very addictive, especially since the mechanics are so easy to learn. Not only that but there's tons of rewards for playing for about a week."
6143,i like evrything about it you idiots!
6144,Loving this game.  It combines what I like about card games and reminds me a bit of another battle game I really like.
6145,fun and nice
6146,Brilliant fun
6147,"Tiddies

"
6148,Puse velnio.
6149,Is cool game iz nice
6150,"I've barely started playing this game and I'm extremely impressed. From the perspective of someone brand new, you are tapered into the experience in a very fluid and progressive manner - it's very easy to pick up, good fun, extremely generous with the in-game resources given that it is a free game, and all kept light-hearted with some satire from the announcer. The game play and UI all seem extremely polished too. I think I'll have to find out what other games these publishers have released! 5 stars all round."
6151,Fun Fast Funny
6152,great gameplay!
6153,"it is a fun game and like how all have diffrent skills
"
6154,LOL meats magic the gathering..on the edge of my seat sweaty palms..love the deck building in this lots of fun that can put you in the time suck. Start playing think you been playing for 15 min ...look back at the clock 4 hours late like... D; WTF!!!! Its cleaver its colorful and its fun!
6155,"Simple, quick and extremely fun!"
6156,The real-time element makes this game like a better version of Duelyst and almost as good as Faeria (but still alive).
6157,"it's free,

It's fun,

I'm drunk,"
6158,I am just getting into this game but it seems pretty fun so far.
6159,"Quite enjoyable, would recommend to most for casual pvp without stress"
6160,"pretty cool, if you play clash royale you will transition well to this."
6161,pretty cool and and a addictive cute graphics
6162,Addictive and fun!
6163,Very Fun!
6164,good game but the \ unlock progression is so greedy either pay money or accept that you wont have the best cards
6165,Its alright
6166,"Fun game. I don't play deck-building games ever, but I enjoy the doubles mode a lot."
6167,Bring back Monkey Meta or I will destroy everything you ever loved.
6168,A simple but fun strategy game that mixes card games with rts elements.
6169,I was skeptical about the game but its a nice quick easy card/moba type game
6170,love it
6171,"first card game that i can actually get 
haven't rage so much in a long time"
6172,if you like playing bad games then dont play this one
6173,"Sweet game. One of those ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" type games. I'm highly competitive and this game scratches that itch. And it's free.

"
6174,"10 card decks. Rewards that work less than 50% of the time. Extremely childish and toxic community. Racist Germans that call people monkey. Its fun for a day or two, but overall pretty simple and stupid."
6175,"goood game
"
6176,"fun game, similar to clash royale."
6177,good game
6178,"Reminds me of Clash of Clans Arena, but better. I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with this game."
6179,easy to pick up. fun all around. did have some problems connecting at first but they patched it quick.
6180,"Amazing free game! The only downvotes you will ever see, are people who unfairly blame the game for making them purchase things that you can just as easily get by playing the game.

Basically, it´s like they are blaming the supermarkets for making them fat, because there was the option of candy, and they couldn´t help themselfs to buy it.
Except, you know, they would be getting free candy everyday anyway just by visiting the store"
6181,This is the world best card ever love it gonna waste money on this one:D
6182,"its game
"
6183,"I had to use task manager to close it, as there was no in game exit button. It is also just a clash royale clone"
6184,"You've probably seen or played a mobile game that plays exactly like this. You're wrong though, this plays better."
6185,Good game
6186,"game is fun to play u can end match easy an match making is so fast u don't have to wait too long for match ups.....
"
6187,Is a fun game though!
6188,is nice
6189,entrete
6190,good game
6191,A spin on this genre and I like it! Good balance of rewards vs keeping me interested
6192,Fun game. Love the graphics. Good set of cards. Need more for diversity.
6193,"que buen game, es muy divertido 
"
6194,"[h1]Summary:[/h1]	[i](longer version below)[/i]
A fast-paced, deck-building, tower-defending, bridge-capturing game. I personally never felt compelled to spend real money. Invest some time in the game to get to a certain level of skill and improve your deck. Thanks to all the free currency available online and generous rewards, you can get there in due time.

[h1]In-Depth:[/h1]
After having played Dota for so long, Minion Masters was quite the refreshment. There is barely any queue time and the matches are really quick, making this a great casual game in case you don't want to get too competitive. If you want to compete with higher ranks, expect to invest some more time into the game until you build a good deck or get enough resources to craft specific cards you want (which is a handy).

It doesn't feel extremely P2W, though it's a card game, so be aware that good cards will often win you games. There are constant updates with various game modes to pick from, numerous cards to build your deck with and additional cosmetics if you feel like it. The achievements are really fair so that's always a bonus."
6195,oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
6196,"Honestly, this is the best game I've played in like five freakin years.  I've also been hammered the whole time but thats neither here nor there"
6197,phone game... meh
6198,"You hit a wall pretty fast even with free DLC because there's a clear ""card"" advantage. This game is just as bad as MTG and you'll find yourself annoyed pretty fast because people have better cards than you."
6199,"so much fun, so addictive, we must throw money at this game and make it huge lol"
6200,A fun game with a range of strategies to test and experiment with.
6201,"I like this game so much and also I like the company very much, but there is a problem. When I lanch the game it throws me out and seldom its running rightly."
6202,"This game is just a copy of Clash Royale on PC. It's a free to play, pay to win ""deckbuilder"" where you summon the cards in your deck, but it's a gatcha system where you open chests to try and get the cards you want and you can buy them for out of game currency. 

The only upside this game has to clash royale is that your king/leader/etc. has skills that you get over time if you control a bridge in the middle of the map.

This game didn't even let me quit the game from inside the program. THERE WAS LITERALLY NO ""QUIT"" OR ""EXIT GAME"" BUTTON."
6203,best game ever!!
6204,"pay to win , if you pay you get better chance to win. if you dont then prepare to lose allot when you want to rank up"
6205,fun please play with me guys
6206,"I actually enjoy this game a lot but what kills the game is the quick nerfs which force you to either fork over cash to build new decks, or lose match after match in frustration. I did buy the pass plus the starter pack to at least support the game and I did get my money's worth for the time I did spend playing."
6207,Awesome game for some quick fun! Quite addictive too.
6208,love the game clash royal for pc lol
6209,"This doesn't play like a slow paced, card time strategy game."
6210,Really like the concept of the game strategy deck building is one of my most enjoyable game types to play and this has a fun twist added in that makes it more compelling to play!
6211,AWESOME!!!
6212,Very fun!
6213,Great game
6214,A nice game for who want to play something like clash royale but with different cards.
6215,Amazing game a bit pay to win but if you get the right you can become a pro.
6216,fun game but trash server
6217,"It's a quick and fairly easy two-lane attack/defense game with aspects that you would find only in old WC3/SC1&2 multiplayer custom games, which were fun and laggy if they got too far into the game. This game implements shorter bridges and forces people to think far quicker and use their limited choices correctly.

Note: it aint perfect, but at least it isn't Hearthstone or some Activision BS."
6218,great game
6219,Visually and aesthetically appealing !
6220,goodgame
6221,EASY INSTRUCTIONS AND NO TOXIC WAY FOR OPPONENT TO FLAME YOU.
6222,Easy
6223,good game
6224,great game :>
6225,"I won't even act... it's just fun. It reminds me a lot of one of my favorite mobile games, Paladog."
6226,i am not really a fan of these kind of games but i like this one its fun
6227,fun and easy to learn
6228,Game is so easy. Got to wood division in no time. 10/10
6229,"I've had the premium upgrade for Minion Masters since December 2016 but only bothered to check it out recently due to a slew of free updates and seeing people on my friends list play. I kinda shrugged the game off as a mobile cashgrab game... and in a lot of ways it does have a lot of the same addictive trappings. You get bombarded with free stuff and daily quests and weekly rewards and monthly events. 

But at the same time, I've honestly really enjoyed the roughly 5 hours I've put into Minion Masters. It's a very casual card game/tower defense that makes for great fun playing with a friend or partner. My girlfriend and I have been playing it when we are done with DOTA for the night. You get games extremely quick in Minion Masters and they only last between 1-6 minutes but that's just how fast-paced the game is. 

I think you can easily get a lot of enjoyment out of the game without spending money. I wouldn't be surprised if the highest ranks consist of decks that you have to pay at least some amount for, but that's par for the course in any card game. Minion Masters is very fun and fast-paced. I think it has to be one of the better casual F2P games on Steam."
6230,Great fun and easy to pick up. Level and challenge variation are plentiful so there is always something to do that keeps things fresh and interesting.
6231,Nice lil lane game. Fun with friends.
6232,WC3 players will love this game with the minion summoning
6233,Pretty Chill
6234,good
6235,?
6236,"They don't have enough player to support the ecosystem so the vast majority of games are against bots, especially at lower levels. They also give no indication what is a bot and what isn't a bot. Complete waste of time IMO to play against the very easy bots."
6237,"Card Game, Cute designs, and Time based vs Turn Based.  While the write up on Steam claims to be a cross of three types (and tagged as things like RPG) there's no Role playing so I'll blame Steam not the Devs.  After playing it even through the tutorial you'll quickly realize there's Cards and that's about it.  It's not unique and new in any way that's amazing, insightful or catchy.   

I can't recommend because it's just horribly sad execution on something others are doing already and doing better and it uses the poor side of the Free to Play models, Free to Play is a dangerous game for companies to fall into and this one has gone the wrong way I'm afraid."
6238,Solid casual and competitive games
6239,fun little game to pass the time
6240,the cube reminds me of Halo's cube or Destiny's cube. nice small easy game to play with friends.
6241,"Interesting concept for a strategy game, very high paced and addictive gameplay.

The downside of this game is, that its kind of a borderline mobile game, and as we all know they're evil.

give it a shot. you might like what you find!"
6242,Fun game :)
6243,"Very fun game loving it so far, love how i can play with friends 2v2 and lose together :D"
6244,Great game. Lots of variety. Free stuff everywhere and no p2w. I love it.
6245,good game ty
6246,OK..
6247,Great game
6248,IT FUN
6249,"Cool gameplay, Cool cards, Cool sound effects, Irecommend it for everybody!"
6250,it is fun if u know how to play :)
6251,"There is a cheat to this game witch allows you to kick your opponent out of the match and get a victory. was wondering why i got that message almost 10 times in a row, but it must be a cheat witch is widely used. Do not play, unless you want to play witch constant cheaters."
6252,cool game
6253,godd
6254,"I was a bit iffy on the idea of this game being a mix of tower defender, hero characters, and deck building all mixed together but I got to say they do a good job mixing all of it together. Each hero so far has felt different from one another and each card feels different from one another. The community has been nice for someone who is still a beginner like myself and for a free to play game this game does not feel like you are forced to pay to win the game. Overall I'd rate this a solid 9/10 game."
6255,Such an awesome game! Very casual yet satisfyingly fun!
6256,"good game ,hope better connect"
6257,"Really fun, not a huge time sink but lots of enjoyment. Rewarding gameplay and really fun 2v2 mode as well. Try it out!"
6258,"Good first impressions - neat little game so far!
(Haven't played long, yet, so we'll see how it holds up.)"
6259,fun game :D
6260,Nice
6261,Like it so far definitely worth a try
6262,"This game is really fun, because it is challenging, and the game only will be fun when it is challenging. I like jerome"
6263,nice
6264,"Pretty nice game, quite enjoyable. Doesn't require excessive grind like many similar games, play how much you want. Fun gameplay. Playing as a complete f2p seems alright."
6265,amazing
6266,"Love this game, really enjoy it. Thanks."
6267,Excellent game that satisfies my instant gratification needs but also gives me something to strive for long term. Yummy graphics and reasonable grind - no need to sacrifice your life like other games require. A worthy investment!
6268,"great game always something new
"
6269,This game is awesome and enjoy to play.
6270,Fun Game!!!
6271,"Good game with lots of deck optimization options. You can create lots of decks and try them instead of creating 2 or 3 decks and then having to make changes there. The games are reasonably fast and hence if you are looking for a quick game as a break from some activity, you can do that too! Also there are many game types including random 2V2 and weekly quests that keep you engaged. Definitely worth it."
6272,Better than Clash Royale tbh! Great GFX and sound.
6273,great game if you want a casual few minutes of game play
6274,it be good
6275,i didnt expect to ever enjoy a game like this but it's been an hour and im hooked!
6276,"[i]If you don't wish to read the entire review, here's a summary: Minion Masters feels very cheap as a whole, as well as overly simplistic and gimmicky on a strategic or tactical level.[/i]

[h1]Review[/h1]

So, after 75 hours of gameplay, after having reached Diamond 1 in Solo ranks as well as unlocking all the achievements, I can tell you that I'm relieved to never touch this game again, at least in the foreseeable future. Here's why:

Firstly, the game itself just feels rather cheap. Other reviews have touched upon it as well, but basically, given its F2P nature, Minion Masters is littered with ""baits"" that try to motivate you into purchasing packs, tokens, additional content and the like, and they're not exactly shy about it either. To give you two examples, the second, much more beneficial route of the Battle Pass, is locked behind a huge rubies requirement, but all the rewards are neatly displayed behind a little lock, just to tease you and show you what you [b]could[/b] get. Or when you try to open a power token, the announcer shamelessly shouts ""It's spinning time!"" as if to suggest that opening luck-based packs is absolutely thrilling, exciting or pleasure-inducing. Details such as these ones are all over the game.

Additionally, the minions themselves also feel rather recycled most of the time, which is why you'll find like 5 almost identical looking holy knights, 6 big rocky dudes, a bunch of monkeys and rats, whether flying, walking or poisonous, and 2 more or less identical demon warrior queens. To me, this feels like the developers are struggling to create unique and interesting designs. It's not a major issue, but just adds to the cheap feeling I mentioned above.

Finally, and this is by far the greatest issue, if you're looking for a deeply tactical and strategic game where you'll get to outplay your opponents cleverly with interesting card combinations, this is [b]not[/b] the game you're looking for. Minion Masters is, at its core, an implementation of rock-paper-scissors with a pinch of mana management. The fundamental winning tactic is to manage your time, space and mana in such a way to spawn two complementary minions into the game, which - if successful - basically denies counterplay on your opponents side. E.g. imagine playing a tanky minion with a ranged minion right behind it (yes, it's that simple).

Now, the more experienced players among you naturally know that one has the ability to disrupt such a situation using a powerful spell - and while that's true - I'd claim that that's more or less as deep as the game goes. In just a few lines, I have more or less summarised 90% of the gameplay. If this sounds exciting to you, by all means, go for it. Unfortunately, all the DLCs and expansions have only contributed further to the exploitation of gimmicky tactics, such as the one mentioned above, to the point where the majority of games more or less last only 1-3 minutes with either you rolling over your opponent or vice versa.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

All in all, I don't think you have any reason to play this game in particular as there's superior free alternatives out there."
6277,go fast
6278,cool
6279,Easy to learn and fun to play
6280,"Very fun! It is a deck building game, a tower defense, and a MOBA all in one!"
6281,Dunno why but game is kind of addicting to me. Might not be for everyone but I love it.
6282,decent time waster. games are short
6283,one of the better game in this genre
6284,its pretty fun
6285,"better than i expected, quite fun, and it can be thrilling sometimes"
6286,"Great fun, while relaxing"
6287,Fun so far
6288,"You look at the trailer, the screenshots, the game play on youtube and you think to yourself ""It's Clash Royale on PC"". It's not, It's Minion Master. In the genre of MOBAS, it stands as a wave, tower defense with cards, the main difference and selling point is, there is no card leveling system which makes you become more powerful as Clash Royale does to entice the typical ""Mobile P2W""

Many compositions work well, and strategy makes them even better. Once you get to Gold rank, competition starts getting a bit more interesting.

I like the QWER system to place cards and the Masters passives which get leveld up due to the length of time you control the bridge.

It has different ranking brackets i.e. Solo, Premade Team, Team, and other modes to grow your card collection. Currently at Plat3 and enjoying every bit of it.

6289,Strangely addictive. Not bad.
6290,"fun and easy to learn , has a strong element of tower defence but with a mix of magiv the gather very cool."
6291,Me likey.
6292,♥
6293,"I liked the idea that this is a card game in which minions come to life and fight. I always wanted to play such a game since I first saw YuGiOh episodes back in 2002. Excellent game, which evolves nicely."
6294,"Game is marginally fun but ultimately fit for a mobile game. Get loot boxes in game through leveling and some for free, grind up your cards to increase their strength, adjust your deck to how you like and what is most effective but you will mostly be waiting for mana to charge."
6295,Great Game.
6296,"The game is quite fun, specially when you are playing with someone you like :)"
6297,"Easy to pickup, fun to play. Deep, but not deep enough you get lost."
6298,Good combination of tower defense and card game.
6299,NICE GAME
6300,a cool game for a good price...a lot of potential here
6301,"Fun and simple 
Nobody's rude and the rules are simple.
it's addictive but always the some thing over and over.
If you love Magic but don't have the knowledge this game is for you."
6302,Nice game
6303,"fun, fast adn easy to pick up. I have not gone into paying any money yet though i think it may be required later on? 

I hope not but we shall see. either way playing with friends or against rando's online this is a good time killer and would reccomend it to RTS, PvP and Card colletors alike!"
6304,"It's like Clash Royale, but fun. 7/10"
6305,not PTW
6306,I LOVE THIS GAME. I support you with all of my heart i hope you never quit this game love you
6307,`
6308,"I just started to play games on PC and i never though i would like a card game this much, it is very fun and exciting"
6309,"This game is realy good for the grafisme and the gamplay
"
6310,give me more red shards
6311,"i like how simple the game play is, and challenging the matches are."
6312,Amazing PvP
6313,026569841
6314,"Unfortunately, as there is no PVE option, I have to give this a negative review. I really enjoyed the tutorial, and if there was a PVE option, I'd gladly sink many hours into this game. But... there's none.

I personally hate PVP, going up against another player is just bad for me. It's not a difficulty thing. PVE can be very brutal when it wants to be. As the community seemed to suggest that I should go play minecraft instead, I get the feeling that the general consensus is that only real gamers PVP.

Most of the community was friendly, so that's a point in the games favour.
But, if like me, you don't like PVP, and want a very basic thing that could easily be added, bot matches. Avoid this game.
Just avoid it. 

Sorry to the developers, I know you want a PVP game, but I doubt it'd be very hard to add a PVE option. Since you had that for the tutorial."
6315,This game is so goood
6316,"Lovely game with a friendly community, worth your while even when 100% F2P :)
Don't get fooled by DLC prices, you get them for free if you actively play.. and otherwise it is a measurement for people to support the developers by paying instead to still get the late rewards."
6317,ya
6318,"awesome awesome fun game.  simple, quick and easy to learn with lots of depth"
6319,good
6320,mantab mantab
6321,"This game is totally underrated. 
It's for free, it's pretty good balanced (you will see almost every card used for different strategys) and it is not pay to win. You can pay for something here and there, but you will get a really good variety of cards (including legendarys) with the time without paying anything.
Definitly recommend to try it out!"

6323,bored? play this :)
6324,Very funny to play
6325,"easy to understand, good starts, liked the team game mode lots"
6326,"nice little time passer, matches are short and it doesnt feel like a high skilll entry"
6327,Nice game
6328,"This is awesome small-scale MOBA. If you enjoy this, try ""Gears Pop"" on ur phone. same deal but gears of war universe"
6329,fun and time consuming
6330,Super fun. I really enjoy the game. better than clash on mobile..
6331,"Very fun, but need to see if its pay to win at higher tiers. Loving it so far though, like 1 hour in."
6332,"w0o0w really love this game have so much fun 
you should be aware is taking all your time but worth it"
6333,"game great, good good."
6334,Still to early to tell but so far it's fun and doesn't seem too grindy.
6335,Seems cool so far. Been playing for about an hour maybe.
6336,"About 50 hours into the game, I've hit diamond at both 2v2 and solo queue. The game is INCREDIBLY fun and addicting. Your first decks and steady progression into unlocking new cards and new combos feels amazing at first. You start to get a feel for what makes a good deck and figure out how to progress your collection + pass. The mechanics are fun, the game is truly one of a kind and it definitely deserves to be more popular than it is... BUT.

BUT -  The game has massive balance issues. All that fun and enjoyment of deckbuilding and ""brewing"" stop once you get out of the lower ranks and start going against non-bots. It's at a point where the same two cards are ran 3x copies of in 80% of the top decks. Right now the only way to play at a competitive level is to run 3x Brothers or Jadespark Watchers. 

Every game after diamond in both 2v2s and 1v1s is running these and it becomes an RNG mirror match fest. Where you know your opponent will play X card so you must play Y response and it becomes a coin flip over whose deck will have the answer to win the mirror. 

I want to love this game, but I can't in it's current form it actually gets considerably less enjoyable the longer you play due to the current meta and balance issues. If I could get a refund of all the ""account upgrades"" and DLC packs I bought for it I certainly would, but for now I'll settle with leaving this review in hopes that they fix things and I can change this to a ""recommend"". 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MinionMasters/comments/ffmsa7/has_a_new_card_ever_taken_over_the_leaderboard/

Update: At this point the clear issue with the game is Wildcards. They make every single busted card 3x as bad due to the ability to just run more of the broken card. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MinionMasters/comments/fgog35/wildcards_should_not_be_allowed_in_any_form_of/"
6337,good to use time
6338,I like the pvp part
6339,Game has no audio. I have uninstalled multiple times and reinstalled to no avail.
6340,Fun and fast game to play during league ques
6341,nice
6342,crazy addictive. fast paced and fun as hell to play
6343,Simple and fun game to play.
6344,games really good in everyway possible.
6345,This game is stupid. Play it if you love to loose over and over to people who have insain cards. If they had this divided into groups of equal players it might be fun. Its just stupid.
6346,Super fun game to play to kill time!!
6347,minen mas
6348,"AWESOME GAME 999 STARS.
"
6349,good fun with a friend
6350,"It's very fun, and most importantly, NOT PAY TO WIN! Very rare trait for a free competitive game to have. Many different playstyles as well, so it fits just about any player."
6351,"So far so good, little laggy but I believe thats just my laptop fault. Great and fun visuals. Looking forward to what else the game has to offer.
"
6352,"Fun game with a wide variety of strategies to try out. I particularly like the team battles.
Downside is that it crashes way too often, which ruins the fun."
6353,Great Game!!!
6354,its fun there isnt much els to say
6355,Good Fun
6356,fun.
6357,very fun game and easy to learn
6358,Quick easy fun
6359,"Game is good, highly recommend"
6360,It's good
6361,mindless fun
6362,"Clash Royale on PC and sideways, even the fireball costs 4 mana shite"
6363,Quick matches with a good 2v2 mode
6364,"Completely unbalanced. No longer fun after last patch.
Balance in this game is a joke.
Whoever is responsible for it is total idiot. Nerfing underperforming cards, buffing strong ones and leaving problematic cards untouched."
6365,Pretty fun for a free game
6366,"There's something with game.. It takes on glitching out on me, causing me to force quit the game.. Not sure why, this would be the 4th time that I had to this. I think I like this game better on the mobile"
6367,Really fun chill game to play
6368,"Something small but overall the minions are too dumb in terms of AI and some masters are just overpowered compared to others. Or maybe it was because I kept getting matched with people with vastly more powerful cards, either or balance is an issue. Cannot recommend given the lack of PvE content."
6369,I don't know why but this game just clicks with me lol. seems to be an easy to learn but hard to master type of game!
6370,"Enjoyable game, it's pretty fun and addictive."
6371,This game is like Taking your favorite Card game and auto chess combine. Love it!
6372,i was kidnapped by an elf and ended up becoming their king but i ran away to find potatoes for my wives and 17 children
6373,Simple concept and strangely addictive.
6374,"I love Clash Royale but nobody I know plays it anymore and it started to get stale for me anyway. This game is SO DAMN GOOD! It's everything I loved about Clash Royale and MORE! It has more depth, the graphics are pretty cool and the art work on the cards are awesome! This game is on sale for free but if I had known about it before, I think it's definitely worth $15 and probably would've bought it."
6375,"Really like this game, ususally hate these sorts of games especisally clash royale but this, this game is well built and feels more balanced"
6376,"it's pretty good game, strategy and so, hahahaha, keep doing up, you are great!
"
6377,"Simple and fast, I don't have time to play games anymore, this is one is perfect, short and sweet."
6378,good game
6379,Nice game!
6380,is good if u like games simerler to clash roale
6381,Its a fun game
6382,fun
6383,"it seems fun so why not give it a try!! cool artwork, nice abilities, overall fun fun! with a friend is the best for sure..
with good comunication you can win all battles!!"
6384,Awesome game <3
6385,"it is good 
i like it
there it is"
6386,nice game
6387,"Nice game, love to play."
6388,I honestly just started playing this on a whim and I'm having a great time!
6389,I love that it's co-op! Huge bonus!!
6390,An ok mobile TD-game becomes a rubbish PC game...
6391,It is a relaxing game
6392,This is really fun and time consuming game. very enjoyful. challenging against other players with the right deck build
6393,"For being a Free to play game, you would think it’s heavily pay to win. However, it’s not. It is very easy to rank up and get new cards without spending a dime. The game takes on the paladins art style, and plays almost like clash Royale. There are different masters that work well with different decks, each with unique perks and strategies. The game offers a lot of ways to get free items, and is very welcoming to new players. The community seems pretty nice as well. If you’ve played clash royale before, then this game should be easy to understand."
6394,Great table top battle game relaxing and enjoyable.
6395,"Literally the same thing over and over, most of the time if u lose then because u have to deal with people who have broken cards and are spamming them. Especially one waling paladin who is casting some holy fire on the ground or something like that, in my opinion everything that is over 8+ legendary should have a limited use per round 2-3 times, people who don't have cards to deal with that kind of enemy are just losing. Don't wanna call it p2w but its close :)"
6396,"Really user friendly intro to the game, fun but also has depth if you have a competitive craving"
6397,"Boring ranked match with grinding from the bottom, in 3 hours i reached bronze and level 17(I only pressed start battle in menu). Story mode is unrealisticly hard with given cards!
I do not recommend it. Try it if you can but only for free! Does not worth your money!"
6398,"A very neat amalgam of tower defense and CCG. I've yet to spend any actual money on the game, but I think i will as I am of the opinion that a game is worth a dollar for every hour i've enjoyed playing it. The production value is high, even if the announcer is mildly annoying."
6399,"It's fun, especially with a friend."
6400,Quick game that is fun to play when you don't have a lot of time. Might even find yourself playing it when you do have the time as well. It can be addicting.
6401,Good game
6402,"Year/Half Later still playing!

Pros: 
Short Game Times and Wait Times normally (usually gets longer the higher ranked you are)
Games typically last 3-5mins great time killer or something to do as a short mental break.
Cute, colorful animations, varying abilities, enough cards to keep the gameplay entertaining only felt the burn out a year later
Nice Free to Play options if your not impatient
If you sign up/connect your Twitch with minions and watch minions twitch streamers every time they win you get 100 gold a nice option as u gather that gold to buy power tokens feels like it speeds up card gathering by 30%.
Favorite Game Mode is Drafts as it feels slightly more balanced, enjoy drafting different kinds of synergies and seeing what works w/ what master

Cons:
Lots of Cheese builds and as u climb higher you'll start to see some of the same decks rinse/repeat.
Random teammates in Random 2v2's that play questionably or afk
Interesting chats and oddly enough some drama, ignore it and you'll be all good.
Most Guilds prefer active members and active guild contributors if u don't have as much time that could be a slight problem ofc not all guilds are like that.

Balance: 7/10
Community 6-7/10
Gameplay: 7-7.5/10 keep coming back to it o.-
Graphics: 7/10 if u don't mind that cartoony style :3"
6403,Pretty engaging and fun to play on quick & on spare time
6404,mixing 3 types of game that i love <3 recommend!
6405,A fantastic game
6406,its a great game first time pc player here and im loving it
6407,"this game so good
"
6408,"A toned down ""Raid Shadow Legends"", but you might actually need a semblance of thought to win,"
6409,It's quite amazing！！
6410,"Action packed, quick paced, intense strategy game. Great game dynamics and game art. Loving the game so far."
6411,"ok,easy to learn n master..fun"
6412,this game is very good for easy people because it's game is very easy and easy to control but need some extra things
6413,"Thought I would not like this game,there is tons of strategy,and surprises! Lots of different cards to choose from. I am having a blast addictive!"
6414,fun game
6415,ez gameS
6416,That's one of the best f2p games i have played so far.The f2p system is very fair.keep up the good work
6417,"good game,can't help playing!"
6418,"NOPE.....Scam all the way through. Be prepared for a serious P2W Wall at Silver league. You will mow through the lower leagues and see what I mean. Not even worth the free weekend I got it on. Don't waste your time.

Play Hearthstone or an actual MOBA

This is a money grab."
6419,"this game is great when you don't want to play a grindy game or put too much effort in, though you still need to think pretty quickly to counter some moves."
6420,"The game is amazing, a bit like clash royale, 9/10"
6421,"Fantastic game! I love how fast the matchmaking is 5secs most I had to wait at almost 200games played now n you jump right into it! battles are fast, addictive really fantastic I wish more game's had this type of  matchmaking it's what drives this game! no one want's to wait over 2mins to find a gameXD  

It's not pay to win I have 134win's so far out of the game's I've played you don't have to spend any money unless you want to be ranked 10 in the world:P 

10/10 just keep expanding the game(: more an different type's of arena/ battle set up even players

Cheers! and Happy gaming!"
6422,"Great game, glad to see continued support!"
6423,"I dont recc if you live in Iran.
Note :
- online multi needs VPN
Thanks for 100% OFF DLC."
6424,"the game like clash royal in mobile , i like the gameplay"
6425,"Got it free. Easy to pick up, easy game. Nice graphics and gameplay.
Don't imagine I'll play it for long...."
6426,Good Game
6427,Super addicting
6428,good stuff reminds me of clash royal with better graphics
6429,"Your Game Is Awesome I Had Fun
"
6430,"Honestly not worth your time.
I'm sure that with enough money and enough time you'll be able to be the best on the game but I have neither of those things."
6431,"Great fun game with tactics and moba,Highly recommend!!"
6432,"I was not expecting much ya know but, somehow I ended up having the most fun from a game i have had in a while. i started playing and in the blink of an eye 4.5 hours just flew by. Give this game the old college try, it wont disappoint."
6433,i was expecting to see mobile game type pay walls and pay to win everywhere..... and now im wondering where my night went
6434,"Fast paced and accessible, nice looks, great sounds...not sure i would have tried it if it had not been for free but happy now :)"
6435,This game is pretty good. Only had a night worth of gameplay worth of playing before it received my stamp of satisfaction and approval. A friend and I went 20-0 in team battles before calling a night so I would clench your butt cheeks and pull them britches up when you see our names. Do not let that keep you from buying this game though. Good game. Nice balance. Not a Clash Royale rip off at all. Overall 9.9/10 because I didn't see one nipple the whole time playing but will continue to play it!
6436,itza good game!
6437,fun game good way to kill time
6438,game very good
6439,"""yeah lemme try this game cause it's free EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE  A GAME FOR 8-YEAR OLDS""

many games later

FUCK IT'S ADDICTING

EDIT: Need to uninstall. I can't stop playing fck"
6440,"fun
"
6441,It's really fun:)
6442,Love the game!
6443,good game
6444,It's fun
6445,very good
6446,Interesting. Can waste time. It has a way to buy all the characters from now on in one easy payment which to me really is the only thing you need to spend money on.
6447,I like the game so far! I like the amount of characters and units that have been created to battle with. Great strategy and mechanics. I look forward to see what they will come out with and watch the battles unfold.
6448,"LIKE CLASH ROYAL.. But with more stuff! And cards!  If a FREE PLAYER CAN HAVE AT THE END GAME THE SAME STUFF as PAY TO WIN! The Game is ok! 

9/10 PTS So FAR!"
6449,"Good ganme untile now, might change later based on p2w maybe"
6450,quick easy games. fun with the bois ayyy
6451,clash royal rip off but still good
6452,Quick to learn and very addictive.
6453,"Easy to get into, entertaining and quick gameplay"
6454,"Fun game, exercise your brain with some strategy plan"
6455,"Like: matching is fast and I match against enemies who can beat me or who I can beat.
Dislike: The deck-building process is not very clear from starup."
6456,"only played a little bit, but game seems super fun, and i love that they have 2v2 matches it is so hard to find good 2v2 games"
6457,"33 hours so far.
It's fun.
Games are quick.
Wish it had in game chat to flam- tell my teammate he's doing a good job.
oh yeah more Morellia Milloween skins pls kthanks"
6458,"Love it ! Imagine clash royal that was way more fun, clean graphics. Chill game"
6459,"I play this game if I want to have a bad day.

I'm also convinced it's just money laundering software."
6460,Enjoyable game.
6461,"Honestly didn't expect much from this game, now I've obviously reconsidered. It's a nice game to just chill and get your mind off things, it can get pretty intense at a unusual pace depending on your opponents deck. Overall glad I installed it, twitch prime users have a free code for some rewards so I'd definitely take advantage of that, gave me a very strong hero that I use for all my decks."
6462,"this game is super easy to navigate and super fun at the same time.it can be quick, or if strategically done it can take a little bit of time. regardless its just as much fun either way. 10/10 would recommend."
6463,"Fun game, reminded me a bit of Phone Destroyer.  Good to pass a few minutess"
6464,great fun
6465,Play 2 win confirm.
6466,"Better than Raid: Shadow Legends 
"
6467,Lancers.
6468,haet
6469,"All the stuff I hate about online card games is balanced by the MOBA focus of the game. IT feels more frantic and you can spam spells as opposed to being overly strategic. I recommend it, especially with the free expansion on right now."
6470,SO GOOD
6471,Well made.
6472,"Definitely a fun game, unfortunately it's one of those season pass ftp games.  If you want a season pass you need to spend 1875 of one of their three currencies.  You can buy 1650 for 10 dollars, or 3350 for 19 dollars.  So it's one of those.  You also don't earn near enough of the currency to chain this pass into a new one.  Many ftp do this, so you'd spend 5-10 usd, but as long as you're active you earn your next pass.  Lacking that kind of pass is a massive strike against this game in my opinion.  Definitely feels like a game that just wants to milk you for as much as it can, which is a shame as the game is fun in my limited experience."
6473,"quick easy fun, free to play, great dev's...why wouldnt you try this?"
6474,fun and free <3
6475,"Spent 20 minutes in this, it's not terribly deep....
Probably my 9 year old nephew would like it."
6476,"it's got a cool blend of mechanics that in a vacuum sound really tired and played out, but mesh together in a unique way. worth checking out."
6477,amazing and exciting game!!!
6478,Its fun
6479,This game was good. It was really good and fun to play. Now its just trash. Devs have no idea what they are doing and are just tanking the game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD it Sucks now!!!!
6480,"This game is fantastic! I will follow up with more later, but I am enjoying this so far."
6481,"Fun and easy, seems like a player friendly game that doesnt cash-grab even though it really could."
6482,great game
6483,Good game that doesnt make you spend a lot of money to be competitive
6484,Fun and colourfully addictive.
6485,"its so fun
"
6486,fun game
6487,"Avete presente Clash royale? ecco questo gioco ha tutto cio che quel gioco non ha. Hanno in comune solo il sitema di gioco. Sei un evotaore che vede il suo mana aumentare over time, man mano che hai mana evochi creature più o meno potenti, si hanno molte rewar facili e spesso e non è per nulla freemium. Gioco immediato, partite veloci e ottimo sistema di lobby. Consigliatissimo per i casual gamer competitivi."
6488,"It's a bit pay to win, but it's pretty fun to play."
6489,"Sick game, reminds me of others of course..... but the cards I have I kick butt with !!!!!!!!!!!"
6490,So good so far only 2ish hours in and seems like this could be the new casual fix
6491,It´s a fun game and beginner frindly.
6492,neat game. fun to waste some time on it. play it. it's free. wooo.
6493,If i liked the esports scene then maybe... but I don't. Its your basic esport look at me I'm on twitch fight for fame game.
6494,cool game
6495,best game
6496,"simplistic, yet challenging in a unique way that doesnt feel too easy"
6497,its fun. and wood rank is easy. people are bad.
6498,"проснулся сегодня поел белеши думал их много а их 2 было всего

не рекомендую."
6499,Great fun! Reminds me of Pants vs Zombies & Hearthstone!
6500,Fun
6501,"Good fun, simple to pick up"
6502,"Great game, fast paced, good difficulty, easy to learn and play"
6503,"the anouncer did a very good job. The art direction is great. The mana system alows for not only moments of extreme power triping but monents of ""Oh shit, Oh, Shit, Oh shit!"". But even after a defeat the games are just quick enough to want to give it another try. I could go on but i wanna keep playing. Keep doin what ur doin! :)
"
6504,"I have absolutely fell in love with Minion Masters. I saw this for free and I desperately wanted to get it before the weekend deal came to an end, so I got it and I am doing so well on it! Thank you Steam for making this game free, I still would of bought it to be honest if I knew it was going to be this good.

Thank you Steam for making such an amazing and highly addicting game available on your platform!

-Mia."
6505,"Enjoyable little way to pass the time.  Acquired it for free; don't know if it would be worth the base price of $14.99, but it's definitely worth free.99. :)"
6506,one of the mosty relaxing and just chill games i have ever played
6507,Super fun right off the bat
6508,A very addictive card game
6509,Game is pretty decent look like ifs filling the void duelyst left me but other than that its fun i guess
6510,"Very nice blend up of moba and tower defense. Very fast paced so games don't take long like smite or other mobas
"
6511,good game like clash royal bu not p2w
6512,Cool for a free game.
6513,Fun !!
6514,Its just cool!
6515,"Joyful strategic game, easy to learn and fun to play"
6516,It is... oddly addicting
6517,Had a unique niche in card games but execution is bad. I dont like the playstyle outside pvp matches. I missed some depth progression rpg elements maybe to heroes or minions
6518,This game puts the F U in fun.
6519,my favorite pay to win mobile game that has been ported to pc so far
6520,"Simple yet addicting!   
   
P2W Rating: 2/10"
6521,"Fun, quick pace, good graphics. Fairly simple to learn as well."
6522,yaes
6523,Great!
6524,ok
6525,funn
6526,it's a fun deckbuilding game
6527,10/10 will summon again
6528,"If you want to play some rounds and just chill, then this game is perfect. And you should check Twitch Prime for free DLC's or other stuff sometimes."
6529,"really, this game brings you quick into battle! \o/ nice to play.
what i do miss is more choice at sorting cards i own (or do you really suspect, me keeping each card and specifics in mind? to search them by name?)

well i guess this is cool and quick. pvp starts withing few seconds and it takes team-match 2-5 minutes untill its over."
6530,"Easy to pick up but work to master, a good balance of competitive and beautiful.

Love the team battle mode."
6531,never played the game and i can review it  0.1 hrs (on - off removed) sorry can not help but recommend you to follow me lol
6532,"Really enjoyed the idea of the game. 
Strategy on where to spawn and how can be the key to winning.

Making more epic cards and minions would make it cooler."
6533,The game set up my default language which I can't read. It took me a while to change it back. With this simple reason I will not recommend it.
6534,Fun game that is no grind.  Great balance of cards and towers and lots of different game types.  Only major drawback is that it crashes my computer after about 30 minutes of playtime
6535,its fast
6536,Highly addictive
6537,its cool
6538,Yes
6539,Fun game if you give it a chance and don't take it too seriously.
6540,Macht Spass :)
6541,"Fast paced, fun an interesting mechanics. Easy to learn the basics but gives high reward for master.y"
6542,Really Good Game
6543,yeee
6544,Awsome
6545,"I have tried this game a couple of times over the past year or 2, but i keep coming back because of the developers just making the game acsesable to all players, by adding a free dlc sometimes it makes it enjoyable to come back!"
6546,Very nice
6547,"The game is awesome, great for casual and online play. It has great fun especially when you have no idea how to play this type of game. I would recommend this game for anyone want to have fun, enjoy deck building, and single mouse click game types. Please support this developer as they made a great game. Great character choices, fun gameplay, and rewards are great for simply playing the game."
6548,"Free game, lotsa fun"
6549,Great game
6550,"Feels like i found my Duelyst game replacement, will be streaming this game"
6551,"i mean its free, so y not lol"
6552,game is pretty fast paced but still allows for some strategy and doesnt feel too overwhelming
6553,"Not a bad game, drawn in"
6554,its fun!
6555,is fun and quick games c: ftp is nice too
6556,"seems fun and quick
"
6557,"Dope game, try it!"

6560,good
6561,im iffy on ptp games but overall its great but i could eventullay get sik of playing it made overtimie you should give out more free stuff defnlety would be good idea
6562,decent card game
6563,I finally found a game that I can win once in awhile and I don't have to do all kinds of other stuff to play the game. I can actually battle and keep going. The game is great! Thank you :0)
6564,It's alright
6565,Played this before on Discord. Still a fun game to kill some time.
6566,Awesome
6567,good

6585,It's fun so far.
6586,"Gotta say that it's a cute casual game that's equally addictive, thought-provoking and not very demanding in terms of time for required each session"
6587,Awesome
6588,
6589,Cool game if you wanna change a litle bit from fps games
6590,It's a new different kind of game I haven't played before and it has varying degrees of satisfaction but also a decent mix of strategy. so far enjoying it.
6591,What an exciting game!!!!
6592,...Nice Card Game...
6593,kayak clash royal wkwkwkwkw
6594,it is one good game actually when you are like waiting your or smthing like that it is fun to play

6597, amazing gameplay
6598,"good
"
6599,:)
6600,Great characters and i love how it is easy to understand
6601,just a great game to play if you got some time to kill
6602,"I got it on a free (including DLC) weekend, doe's not disappoint. It's a boiled down MOBA game that just leaves the essentials. Been fun so far"
6603,"fun
"
6604,"easy to learn, a lot of fun"
6605,"<3
"
6606,"Relatively fast paced action, with lots of minions blowing up... 
What's not to like?"
6607,funj
6608,Great!!!
6609,Our enemies tremble beneath us because they suffer from a lack of IQ and we stomp them
6610,Good fun!
6611,funny gameplay :))
6612,"Really great F2P 1v1 game. Much more casual than a MOBA. Lots of characters, card, options, etc. to keep things interesting."
6613,I love strategy game
6614,good game
6615,"Clash royale type mobile game with a few tweaks, along with a overall smoother experience on PC"
6616,"nice game with really easy handling
"
6617,炉石+自走棋+王室战争
6618,"LIGHT QUICK GAME WITH LOTS OF GIFTS IN THE BEGINNING.  THE MASTERS HAVE DIFFERENT PERKS AND THE MINIONS OR FIGHTERS THAT ARE USED HAVE INTERESTING ABILITIES. IT IS SIMPLY FUN TO PLAY AND IT WAS FOR FREE ON STEAM.  FOR FREE, SO YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!
"
6619,"It's a 2gb game that you can play with friends. It's free so there's no real downside to playing. If you enjoy any sort of rts, tower defense, or card games like hearthstone then at the very least I say try it."
6620,it good
6621,"Love it! Simple, but fun, can't stop playing"
6622,Fun and Interesting
6623,It's a really neat game.
6624,Great take on tower defense games! Easy to learn with depth to master!
6625,"Like the style, the mobs, and 3d work here"
6626,GOOD GAME
6627,"Card playing MOBA, simplified.  Fun game to pick up and play casually."
6628,Great game! Think magic the gathering but faster!
6629,"only played for a small amount of time but it is really good so far. 
If you like clash royale mixed with hearthstone, this game is definitely a game for you."
6630,"Just started playing tonight, seems like an interesting game. I have lots to learn yet."
6631,eazy fun defence game
6632,Progression feels good not to fast not to slow. You get decent rewards I don't feel like i have to shell out money to progress (full disclosure I did buy the premium upgrade which gives you a permanent 50%gold gain and 20% XP) all though for $20 if that's the only thing you ever buy for this game (which you don't need to buy anything for nothing except cosmetics are locked behind a paywall I believe) that's a fair price.
6633,"Fun, Simple, Free-To-Play Deck Builder game.

Pros:
- Simple Mechanics, Easy to Learn.
- Not really Pay-To-Win if you know what you're doing, although there are card packs available.
- You can play Solo, Team Battles or battles against A.I. so there are options for how you want to play.

Cons:
- The chat can get toxic, but it's not as bad as a lot of game.
- Pay-To-Win cards do exist and it can be kind of frustrating, however as mentioned earlier you can out-play people if you know the mechanics."
6634,Fun game to play around with.
6635,"Pretty fun

* Match Type - involves 2 vs 2 or 1 vs 1 or 1 vs AI ...

* GAME * What kind of game is it?  A speed card game in which as you get MANA or ability to play cards as a constant Timer happens which you place summoned monsters on your side of the map or spells in different parts of map as your enemy does same.  The cards involved and when to use those cards is the game.   The custom cards is the preset of how you plan on playing the match such as if you plan on playing spells, monsters or effects.   

* CARD SET
The ability to win the match can rely on more than a few factors one is the BOSS you bring, the CARDS you have and when / where to PLACE the card's effect.  

 The rewards for cards are slow but I seen slower. The cards that allow more custom decks must be gotten via winning matches."
6636,Awesome game play and the commentary is pretty funny at times. Great download for Free to Play players.
6637,great game been playing for about an hour and i really enjoy the team battle
6638,So good. Better than Battle Breakers
6639,"pretty fun, deck builder. reminds me of the old magic game on original xbox that was like this"
6640,awsome game love it
6641,"While you're off playing fucken hearthstone, chads over here playing minion masters."
6642,Honestly a good game all around thanks for the time well spent
6643,The Game is quite enjoyful the extra content is expensive totally pay to win
6644,"It's good, that's really all I can say about it. Simple to play, not too much of a cash grab, it's just really fun."
6645,"Just another pay to win game, avoid at all cost unless you plan to spend 1k to be caught up to other players."
6646,Herpa derpa duu
6647,Best of its kind!
6648,Love the animations and the PvP in this game
6649,i find the dings addiction and the game fast
6650,GoodGame
6651,"Genuinely surprised at how actually fun this game is. I thought it was just a 'free to play' mobile game ported to Steam (which it honestly could just be) and I'd delete it afterwards but I ended up playing six hours. I don't think its perfect but, for what it is, I've certainly played worse. I might actually continue playing it."
6652,"Like Clash Royale tho, and it is really, really fun to play."
6653,"Good game, fun game yes"
6654,"Really easy fun, especially if you have a pal to do ranked duo with. The game is quick to learn and hard to master, the learning curve as you rank up feels nice though. Great in doses (although I've already played way more in the first day then I thought I would.) Get it when its hot and free :P
"
6655,Fun game. Awesome time killer. I got it for like nothing on sale and as a free game its great. Would not advise buying at full price for sure. But catch it on sale and its a fun game.
6656,"This is a great game, easy to play, minimally pay-to-win, and the games are short and sweet. Will continue to recommend it so long as the devs continue to make appropriate balance changes, which they've shown they can do."
6657,"awesome fun like clash royale
"
6658,so far ok i guess yo
6659,Nice spin-off of Clash Royale
6660,this game is literally clash royale but its actually fun because it doesn't have 3 total mechanics and has so many cards with themes so you can have an actual strat highly recommend this game they give the players what they want
6661,"got the game on steam 100% sale.
MTG/HS and Legion TD made a love child and out came a fantastic game. been a long time since i had so much fun with a new game.

"
6662,"Easy to learn, hard  to master. Really reminds me of the old Battleforge :D. Give it a spin!"
6663,"pretty fun so far, somehow i get a feeling similar to slay the spire with pvp"
6664,it's so cool
6665,Game is great like clash royale but different and unique :)
6666,Best pvp game
6667,Only got an hour played and already have a hard time stopping
6668,"funny game, nice intro"
6669,Yes
6670,"Fun mix of an RTS game and MTG, clever and creative.

Graphics could be better but it's no big deal."
6671,"One of the few Clash games I really enjoy!

Solid game play and fun as well!!"
6672,cool game.
6673,"Game is fun so far, cute sounds and comforting idea. 
But if its pay to win im gonna leave it - not looking back."
6674,"Sweet game, easy to get into, and fun...."
6675,its good dynamic and intuitive
6676,"The game is amazingly  refreshing, quick paced to release stress and very easy to understand and play.  Good job"
6677,"Pretty fun and simple, not too microtransactiony"
6678,pretty enjoyable and draws you in :)
6679,"funnnnn, cuz its fun"
6680,"First, forget about a MOBA/Tower Defense game, it is only the gameplay part.

The units you spawn in the field have to be collected like cards in a CCG.
And like in a CCG at some point you reach these players who are either :
-veterans who grinded like maniacs for weeks/months/years;
-whales who decided to break the piggy bank.
And they have some far better card than you and you either grind like a maniac or break the piggy bank or you get stomped.

It's not a problem in itself, these players can exist if ""the devs need to eat"" (save it's not for the devs' meals, it's for the publisher's shareholders obscene fortunes), but then WHY are newbies pitted against them ?
So whales have something to beat ?

F2P is all well and good in theory, in practice it devolves into ""pay to have fun"".
It is not unfair it is an entertainment product so money has to come from somewhere but then explain to me what is playing without having fun and why should people bother with it."
6681,"awesome game , cant stop playing !"
6682,"fun so far
"
6683,"Having fun with this game. Easy learning curve. Fun for a bit,"
6684,i have little bit of fun :D
6685,I like this game ..
6686,"nice
"
6687,awesome game.. love it
6688,gnklnkl
6689,it's aight
6690,"This game is very pay to win. I stopped playing this game when I switched to PC but was quickly reminded why I stopped playing this game.

There's one specific unit called Queen's Dragon, it essentially calls down a giant dragon that will fly by shooting fire breath and then landing. Keep in mind, this only costs 8 mana. The worst part is, you don't even know your opponent has it until they call it in. You can be beating your opponent and out of no where lose because they called in this dragon.

I was on a 15 winning streak with a balanced build, and now I keep losing because every other opponent seems to have this card. I'm not gonna pay money on this game and hope for the most OP thing in a free to play game, just to have a decent chance.

So I obviously do not recommend this game. Won't comeback unless they nerf this overpowered fucking card."
6691,Interesting game a lot of strategy involved can be a stress reliever :)
6692, a good alternative to heartstone hope it aint gona get pay 2 winn later looks very good so far
6693,"Kinda pay-to-win but a good game all around, probably the best Deckbuilder game i've ever played plus the community is nice."
6694,Amazing game i and my gf really enjoyed!!!
6695,"Its easy to get into and to start, with room to grow into somewhat strategic experience as you progress. Plenty of variety in playstyle."
6696,I don't know it just got me.
6697,Fun game !
6698,"Fun free to play game, is pretty well balanced, and pretty strategic."
6699,game is fun and you can get all the cards you need without spending real money and just playing the game. made it to grandmaster 30 with all basic and rare cards and no legendaries
6700,Quick easy fun entertaining
6701,"Great game! fun and polite community, I've literally NEVER seen a community as nice, they'll legit help you with achivements, carry you in 2v2s, or give you advice and tips on what cards to get. The game is simple and easy extremely casual and just lets you unwind after a crappy day."
6702,It has good multiplayer and decent graphics :)
6703,"Game is fun in the early stages. Seems simply, but entertaining"
6704,so much fun if your into these types of games i love em
6705,"fun, fast paced, quick rewards"
6706,its my favorite
6707,The game is straight forward and good if you can scrounge up a strategy.
6708,It's good.
6709,GG
6710,Awful
6711,"This game has become so unbalanced and every update that gets pushed out just makes it worse then it was, at one time this game was enjoyable, but not any longer."
6712,A great game if you are looking to kill some time inbetween sessions of other games. Definitly worth a try!
6713,"1. Stable play experience
2. Beginners  had a balanced deck
3. Need for better nemesis teaching"
6714,Really well built game. No bugs. Tight gamplay. Like old card games but real time.
6715,very fun minion battle game with a nice collection of features.
6716,nice game far more better than clash royal
6717,"great so far, will edit when i hit the pay wall, if there is one..."
6718,"good game, that's all"
6719,It is basically rock paper scissor with cool animations
6720,Good game
6721,"A fun game to play, I like it. :)"
6722,Fun game.
6723,If you are into Clash Royale then this game is worth checking out! Very fun and addicting
6724,This Game is one of the best battle games I have ever played...It could be because I got it for free but still its dope!
6725,"good game,I like it"
6726,"The design is a weird hodgepodge of fantasy, historical, modern, and sci-fi themes.
Players claim its not P2W, but its pretty hard to believe that when you start with random trash cards and get matched against players with every card in the game.
Includes mobile game style slot machines and free chests with timers."
6727,very smooth
6728,"Fun game to pass the time when you dont have the ability to concentrate on a million things at once. 
"
6729,"Its like Clash Royale,but more epic!!!"
6730,so far so good :D
6731,good game
6732,"Awesome game for a f2p, really addictive"
6733,nice game to play
6734,"Amazing game, kinda like clash royale but more in-depth and fun. Feels unique in its own way

Editing after a bit of experience: Official discord server has toxic tryhards who'll bully you just because of your low knowledge of the game with little to no moderation. Apart from their discord server, there isn't much to get a teammate for 2v2 or counselling on your dec. The game starts to feel lackluster once you hit gold tier, 1v1 is still fun."
6735,Pretty good game. Similar to Clash Royale style. Fun and sweet.
6736,i like it its a little bit grindy but its fun
6737,"Nice and cute little game, however, I am often confused by the new rewards and perks. It often disconnected while playing."
6738,"Actually a really good game, I have great fun so far. With all the different mechanics makes it not boring and fresh. And it's a fun game to stream also. *Wink*"
6739,nice to nice
6740,"Basic card based game, but the battles are still pretty fun. 
"
6741,"its an alright game with a little bit of inspiration off clash royale but who am i kidding, other games are the same so why shouldn't this game be"
6742,"good game i can play on my low pc
"
6743,not bad
6744,Ce jeu est original mais je trouve donc devrais maître un temps limite au match
6745,Good game! Many combinations
6746,It's fun
6747,"Hi,
I enjoy it because it is fast paced. Don't needto reserve a time just come and play when ever you have 5min free :)"
6748,I was looking for a good casual strategy game and this scratches the itch. I like a lot so far.
6749,"simple game yet alot of fun, just been playing for about an hour but i can say it's really good, nice game for every now and then, couple of rounds when you've got nothing to do, good humor"
6750,legendary cards ruined game balance (also spells are overnerfed)
6751,"How do they call this game ""Free2play"" when it costs $15 to buy?  Oh, it was a $15 expansion with a 100% discount...

It was a fun for 3-4 hours.  Then I met the human competition and it ruined my day.

There is a little bit of strategy, but it is all lost when you feel like it doesn't matter when you need to pay real money to catch up (or grind forever)."
6752,it´s fast and intuitive. some nice casual game
6753,"I would give it a 7/10.
The reason is:
-It's for free
-Most of the DLC's are for free, when you are early enough of getting them
-Gameplay is pretty fun
-If you like Clash Royale you would like/love this
-Pretty basic, put some cards on a field and see mayhem unfold 
-Mostly strategy-based, you have to make a deck that's A: Good for you and B: Will wreck other opponents
-Like I stated, it's for free and it's pretty fun
-You can make it a pay-to-win, because you can buy literary almost every card and hero with rubies. (Shards can be bought with rubies, in the store)

So I would recommend it, if you like a strategy-based game or a deckbuilding like card game.
Just give it a try, it's for free!
"
6754,Just stared playing but enjoyable and fun so far! Love the variety and the choice available. The characters are cute and the commentary voiceover is great :D I like that the games don't have to last a really long time so you can just jump in and play as much as you like
6755,extremely fun and entertaining
6756,awesome.. simple and fun
6757,No option to quit this game before you get lvl 7 is kinda fucked up
6758,good
6759,"IT'S A VERY COOL GAME.
WITH THIS FREE DLC YOU GET THE STRONGEST MINIONS."
6760,interactive and fun xD
6761,"I'll be honest, this is a bit better than I expected. Definitely worth your time at least for a bit; it's free."
6762,Bad Clash Royale copy
6763,"Funny strategic game. 
"
6764,"Games done, reminds me of Clash of Clans but better!"
6765,GG
6766,Easy to get a hang of game
6767,Fun
6768,didn't think this game would be pretty fun.
6769,"I already  LOVE THIS GAME. So many rewards, so much fun !  I really enjoy a strategic card game where everything is explained, and really easy to master and a challenge at the same time. 11/10. I recommend this game ! Devs, keep up the good work !"
6770,best game ever
6771,"Excellent Q-W-E-R button fun, place the minions, have them fight for you.

Simple and fast games.

Excellent fun!! ;D"
6772,This game is simple but challenging and would recomend for any age.
6773,Relaxing and fun game.
6774,Clash of royale but not pay to win
6775,"Very easy to pick up, fun game, simple yet with a lot of depth"
6776,It's cool
6777,This is how i imagined yu-gi-oh shouldve been played
6778,"got mine for free, seems a bit predatory... spent ten bucks on some junk.. but you know what; i am liking the game!"
6779,It's like clash royale but not so p2w ! If you like that kind of real time strategy game definitely try this out!
6780,fun sia
6781,very fun game
6782,nice play
6783,good
6784,Fun and competitive pvp
6785,good game
6786,"For the moment (few hours) this seems to be a very good game. I don't see any pay to win mechanics. For me it's a trully a nice mixte of TD and Carte game. There is something similar to a Battle Royale but without the pay to win obligation.
All the cards are of the same lvl, always.
Rewards are great, progression is great.
So far I am totally enjoying it!

Try it!"
6787,Fun
6788,great game to spend time with freinds
6789,fun
6790,Feels like clash royale
6791,Very fun game
6792,Game is worth my time wasted. I like to play this in the office without being caught by the boss.
6793,Fun. easy to pickup. hard to master
6794,"===== NEUTRAL REVIEW =====
Build a deck, plop units (minions) onto a battlefield and attack a tower that has a ""master"" with specific abilities on top. There's also your basic selection of spell cards like Fireball and Chain Lightning. 

NOTE: Due to recent changes, I'm specifically saying this is a NEUTRAL review. It's still an okay game to play, but the game was MORE enjoyable when I first got into this.

===== THE GOOD =====
+ You have plenty of ""Deck slots"" to experiment with new decks. I'm the kind of player that can never settle with a favorite for very long.
+ Large card selection to toy around with.
+ A match is around 2 - 7 minutes or so. It's easy to jump right into.

===== THE MEH =====
- Shop is pricey if you want to skip the grind and get a bunch of cards.
- Game features seasons and a ""battle pass"" but both are quite short.
- Leaderboard only shows top 50. There are various ranks like Platinum, Diamond, etc...but you can't really tell how you compare to the entire Minion Masters playerbase.
- NEW: Cards get changed often for the sake of balance. Some cards that were perfectly fine end up getting overused or useless depending on how drastic they have changed it.
- NEW: The ""meta decks"" and bumping the mana cost of completely basic spells have soured my game experience and that's why I'm specifying that this is a NEUTRAL review instead of an all-out positive one. Seeing the same trick being used over and over makes the game boring, on top of all the ""balancing"" that's constantly being done.

Final thought: I rarely play this nowadays, but I did manage to squeeze 400-ish hours out of this. Although I had much more fun in earlier seasons, I'd say this game is still worth trying out."
6795,i like it
6796,You know!! Reeeal Good.
6797,"I like how there's no way to actually log out of the game in the options menu, unless you tab out and close it or switch to windows mode to x it out. Pretty cheeky."
6798,"The game is great. try it out
"
6799,"Fun simple game, a little heavy on the ""please buy everything"" front but the core gameplay is fun."
6800,"easy t o pick up, and enjoying the mixture of chance and strategy. Wonder if its a pay to win though"
6801,Easy and laid back.
6802,OK.very good..Is fun And with my friends play game very happy.
6803,Nice game
6804,Good fun. Nice casual game to chill with.
6805,"I'm actually enjoying this game... kind of a rock paper scissors style 2 lane strategy game. So far the deck building is pretty fun,  its easy to where the meta is though..https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/489520#."
6806,"It's free and fun, so give it a shot!"
6807,if i could sum up this game in one Bill Wurtz reference it would be: HELL YEA! NOW WE GOT BUSINESS!
6808,Good game so far.
6809,"Honestly wish i tried it earlier
"
6810,"Awesome game, and not incredibly time consuming. I got the expansion for free on a promotion and now im waxing fools out here."
6811,WAY better version of clash royale. Highly recommend
6812,Fun
6813,Fun so far
6814,It is like a mobile game but good.
6815,"YESYESYES
its like a mobile game but not bad"
6816,ok
6817,"Just started the game this morning, and I must say, it is quite fun!
"
6818,so far pretty good
6819,"Really fun game, seems like it rewards good strategy"
6820,Cool
6821,"excellent game

fast matches (1-8min)

easy to learn, difficult to master

not P2W

excellent matchmaker

don't have to spend money, but after you've played it for a bit it's worth spending a little money to unlock all masters and buy premium

new expansions come out free for the first weekend

Devs really stay on top of balance and updates.

Highly recommend. I mean: fuqit it's free."
6822,"good game fast to play 
"
6823,"Addicting,chill,awesome game."
6824,"Great game and easy to learn, hard to master maybe"
6825,wow
6826,"It is a good strategic game! Best regards to developers of the game but the majority of master's skins shoud be avaible to be bought in every moment not only in ""daily offers"""
6827,Like!
6828,Its pretty fun so far
6829,The game itself is free to play and I got a free expansion through a Steam deal. Totally addicted and ranking up quickly. My friend uncommon at twitch.tv/uncommon_gaming gave me some excellent tips and advice and has helped me wreck people left and right! Definitely worth the time.
6830,"Lots of fun. I like that I can play it on my laptop without a mouse. It's like League of Legends Light version. Check it out, it's free."
6831,Its easy and strategic all at the same time
6832,"Thrilling game; a mashup of Hearthstone, Tower Defense and MOBAs. The gameplay is always fresh- and ever changing, as cards are added and new combos discovered. There is no one meta, and what combos there are that can be called meta, all of them have simple counters. It's a really wacky, wild game that always feels fresh!"
6833,Addictive
6834,clash of clans on steroids gg
6835,simple  but fun
6836,its awesome
6837,fun :)
6838,Fresh concept. Feels fun like playing Magic in real time.
6839,good game i like the many minions and strategies like starcraft
6840,too easy
6841,is ganz cool
6842,"PROS:
It's great fun and really addictive.
CONS:
It's TOO addictive! I have to keep uninstalling it so I can do other things with my life :/
UPDATE - CHANGED OPINION:
There are a lot of bugs. Crashes way too often, even while on menus. Only seems to get worse with each update. The latest crash deleted all 12 decks I worked hard to put together for different strategies! Think I'm done with this game for a while until they fix these crash issues..."
6843,"Pretty cool game. Seems kind of mobile moneygrubbing at first, but it looks like you can play reasonably well without sinking money into it.."
6844,"Fun game, exercise your brain with some strategy plan."
6845,This game is awsome! I love it because the characters are so cool! You need to play this game!
6846,"Great game to pass the time with,FUN"
6847,"My favourite game.
Easy to pick up,
lots of possibilities to design your deck,
not microtransaction-dependent,
and very fun to play alone or with friends.

Only con that newly introduced cards or masters can be unbalanced at first.

9/10"
6848,"Thumbs up. This game gets deeper and more interesting the more you play it. Push through the slight learning curve, you'll find yourself enjoying nuanced meta within 5 hours of play."
6849,fun fun?
6850,It's  clash royale ripoff that is even worse than the mobile game.
6851,"It's a very good and well made strategy game. It's extremely unique as well. I have been seeing a lot of content updates, no reason to complain with this one."
6852,Awesome
6853,"Very nice game! Love the gameplay, the graphics. Still need to understand everything about it but this makes it interesing"
6854,"Great and fun game, its relaxing and fun. looking good, and great way to control thing around here!.. :D"
6855,fun game
6856,"I went into this game skeptical about it, and immediately lost myself in a four-hour binge at 2am in the morning not wanting to go to bed. It's actually a ton of fun, easy to learn and so many possible ways to play."
6857,"I didn't play game like this ever, i started playing this today and i like it, chill game"
6858,"very good, clean and enjoyable game"
6859,good game
6860,stinks so bad that they had to hide the [b] quit game [/b] option
6861,"I played games like this on my smartphone, but after a couple of days and playing with random opponents, it was easy. Then, you needed to pay real money to get your deck stronger. I don't know what will happen to this game in the future, but for now, it looks good to play to chill and leave your trouble behind. At least, its cute atmosphere makes you feel weirdly happy.

The balance between cards are good, if you play smart, you can even beat people who have stronger deck than you. Its marketplace is not for pay to win, because there are some cosmetics, and also account upgrade which provides you with the other heroes. All of the heroes in the game has their own special abilities and heroes are using these abilities if you can provide them with enough experience (XP) from the Bridges."
6862,its ok
6863,"I would say yes, but there are some things that should be mentioned::

This game suffers from some of the downsides of other free games. There are a lot of microtransactions. I haven't played long enough to say whether or not they're necessary for progression, but there's a lot of stuff on the screen that you can buy. For red gems. That you buy for cash.

I'm not knockin' on the business model, per say, because they have to pay for the game somehow - but it's there. Heavily. There are cosmetics of every kind - for the heroes, for the arena - and I'm not sure what the point is in upgrading the cards besides it lets you use them more than once, but you can buy gems to do that too.

THAT BEING SAID ::

I downloaded this game, then spent about 12hours straight playing it. It's actually fun. There's certainly strategy involved, besides just smashing whatever 'card' is up as soon as they're up, and I think there might be a bit of a meta involved, but I don't think I've played enough to figure that out. Each 'faction' definitely plays and feels different. The different heroes I've played feel different too and I already have a favorite.

I wish things weren't so expensive in the store. I'd probably be inclined to actually buy things if... each thing didn't cost like $20...

So. Yeah. The downside? All the microtransactions don't feel very ""micro"". I feel like I'm buying a small 'game' when I'm just... buying random chance cards in a free game. The price is a little too steep for me.

The upside? It's fun and you might not have to buy anything to enjoy it."
6864,fun. pretty fking fun.
6865,"fun, quick matches, not a play to win very enjoyable"
6866,Interesting game kinda plays like hearthstone but with actual stats
6867,"nice game with you F ,"
6868,Wow this is addicting...also just the thought of what could be added into this lil gem of a game is enough to give me goose bumps..brrrrrrr weooo! Too far? Ok too far...but ya defs give this one a go!
6869,it feels faiur enough
6870,"Its a fun game. 
Time and a few bucks well spent"
6871,"Minion Masters to a T https://youtu.be/xNjI03CGkb4

This is a pathetic free to play PvP focused game where you set down minions/cards to take out and counter your opponents minions/cards until one of you eventually targets the other and destroys them. Gameplay is monotonous,  and the characters and strategies can be cringeworthy. The graphics and the world are insanely childish and entertaining to look at. The game feels like they scientifically formulated and maximize the elements that make other free to play games exciting.

Unfortunately, this is a free to play game that AGGRESSIVELY seeks out ways to keep players addicted and playing every day at any cost. No...the game isn't necessarily  pay to win. However, joining the game, players will be bombarded with additional sign ups, random questions and pop ups, emails, pictures of the devs, etc all reminding you how WONDERFUL and FREE the game is. Ohhhhh heeeerrreee have another FREEEE bonussssss. We havent seen you in awwwwhillleeee. Have anotherrrrrrr. It's actually quite an effective strategy. ALWAYS making players feel like they are being gifted extraordinary deals and are given favor. ""Oh yeah! This secret bonus code I got is gonna give me an edge!"" Being highly familiar and emotionally invested in the game is a superb way to nudge players toward purchasing in game content. . You will feel uncomfortable knowing you are being funneled and herded into something by something unseen. 

Yes, all free to play games do this to some degree, but not with the subtlety and finesse of Minions Masters. Whoever is in charge of promoting this game could have done a superb job promoting propaganda for the KGB or a political campaign.

If you enjoy the creepy predation, and like wasting time in a game where you're going to be collecting forever without getting any better whatsoever - It's still not worth playing. this game is for MOBILE and TABLETs where kids can accidentally put in their mommy's card info without having physical access to it. On PC, even those kids can do better."
6872,"Even though there are so many possibilities, the game is easy to understand and play, graphics and effects are nice, rewards are nice from the very start."
6873,"This game is essentially a mobile game ported to PC in order to attract Whales.
When you first start playing the game It's amazing and Fair and you can see the potential it have. However after playing the game for a few hours you'll come to realize more and more that the game is Pay2Win. Not only will you find yourself lacking essential cards you'll need in order to win, but after a few lost games you'll come to understand why this game is Pay2Win.
From what my friends and I have found is that if you spend money in this game you'll get a massive boost in mana-regen (cards cost mana) and cards will cost less mana.

Not to mention you'll get unwanted emails with ""free"" unrelevant items constantly trying to convince you to spend money.."
6874,nice game
6875,Simple and addictive. Love it
6876,interesting intuitive game. Grabs attention fast and beginner friendly.
6877,good
6878,nice game
6879,its a good game i advice to play it
6880,cooooooooooooooooooool!!!!
6881, youxihenhaowan
6882,Interesting game. Easy to pick up.
6883,"i love it 
"
6884,"Neat game , has interesting team battle , cute animations .. just kewl"
6885,"It's fun, it's free, it's not pay to win, matches are fast and you can play it very casually. It also requires you to use a little bit of brain which is a big plus :)
"
6886,It is ok for passing some time..
6887,ii bun
6888,10/10
6889,"Great game! 

Good diversity means more build and more strategy on how to win.

"
6890,"Extremely boring gameplay. Very little player engagement - you choose which minions to spawn, and then you have no control over your units, just watch AI do attack-move with all of them. I expected more, since they tagged it as moba/tower-defense, neither of which it has anything to do with."
6891,"Love this game! It's quick, easy, and fun to smash for hours"
6892,THIS GAME SO GOOD
6893,"Pretty fun game. Make sure to get some codes from the ""guides"" section."
6894,Simple game mechanics with satisfying action.
6895,"Writing this review having reached level 10, this game is pretty easy to get in to. It's neat coming up with a quick strategy in your head then sending the team onto the field to see what they do. If you've played Team Fight Tactics on League of Legends then you'll be pretty familiar with how this works. The use of cards to place a them on the field fills my recent urge to get into some sort of card game as a bonus. I highly recommend giving this a game a shot. It's user friendly and the cards are set to quick commands Q,W,E,R. The program is very responsive and it doesn't take forever to find a match. It seems pretty well polished so far, though I have not gotten into the upper levels."
6896,Nice game
6897,osem!
6898,I like!
6899,"it's very fun and addicting
"
6900,Good
6901,"It's something different and fresh 
"
6902,Quality Fun Worth the Time
6903,"Very simple strategy game to start with, lots of scope for tactic growth as you level and gain more units/cards. Pleasingly addictive a MUST try for all."
6904,"Fun, dynamic tactical game with very pleasant atmosphere and graphics and intuitive gameplay. Enjoying it!"
6905,good game
6906,Pretty fun. Solo matches can be challenging or impossible if you come upon a P2W player. But Team matches seem good so long as you can anticipate what your partner does. Overall a pretty cool game. I'll update when I get to level 11 and can do adventures.
6907,Love the game turn base hopefully they add more playable Masters.
6908,"i really like this game, it is very fun it's easy but you still need to think or you will be fuck"
6909,So far I am enjoying the game. It's really fun!
6910,"Really fun game, I really enjoyed playing.
I did pretty well with all of the base mechanics, ended up getting to silver, so it's not fully pay to win,
the matches are fast paced and the game is fun"
6911,"fun , fast -->awsome"
6912,its like desert strike from sc2
6913,"It's a cool game, games can last a really long time though if you're pretty much at a stalemate and that's pretty boring. I can see how it would get pretty enticing to spend your money in game. I felt spammed and pushed to spend money on Rubies. Got bored within an hour of playing."
6914,Fun game
6915,good game ! well balanced so far ! New content to come !
6916,This game is a junk food video game. But somehow it's just the perfect junk food that you can't get enough of.
6917,I don't know who is put on sale first.The game is similar to Royal war.But the game has different cards to Royal.THE BEST IMPORTANT.The game needn't spend time waiting for open the box.It's so cool.
6918,just started but good so far
6919,"like CLASH ROYALE 
"
6920,"nice game not boring 
"
6921,"Fantastic game. Not expensive, and you can get amazing prizes, rewards and deals! Love it!"
6922,"game is fum
"
6923,"good game
"
6924,only just started but it's pretty fun!
6925,amazing tutorial and it brings new things to games like this with the xp system OVR 8/10
6926,cool game. love it
6927,So fun game
6928,It like Heartstone fused with DOTA. I love it
6929,game is emjoyable
6930,Very fun!  Not pay to win and the matches are quick. I highly recommend!
6931,"Easy to learn, very quick pace. Great animations and colors"
6932,if your looking for a chill game minion masters is a great choice not only is it a pretty simple game but it has the same features and tactics just like the famous mobile game clash royale.
6933,love it hard but fun
6934,Like a mobile game but with better aim! More grid less chance.
6935,definitely amusing
6936,Awesome game
6937,After playing League of legends for awhile then quiting this is a nice throw back to that and clash of kings.
6938,"I got a BSOD, after winning my first online game. Quite strange, maybe its my hardware but  havnt had a BSOD in awhile"
6939,"This game is pretty cool, reminds me of clash royale, i recomend this game guys enjoy it!"
6940,Game good
6941,"After dozens of play hours and a few bucks I am finally uninstalling this game for good. Hackers left unchecked and It is an even bigger disappointment that the record and report function ironically does not work and they seem to not be interested in fixing it at all.

Another update as I still cannot seem to make any kind of report in the game what so ever. Not even a suggestion.

Don't Invest your time or money into this game!"
6942,Not bad for a free to play game.
6943,"Fun and fast.
"
6944,Fun card game =)
6945,i love this game i play it 24h on 24h
6946,"I guess i like the game because i play before Clash Royale many years and this game looks 70% like that game! 
I love the HD textures and gameplay and i apreciate the chest don t need a time to unlock! 
From a scale to 1 to 10 my note is 8! GJ!"
6947,Very nice and flouid game ;)
6948,Love it! One of my favorite games!
6949,"  YYup

6950,asd
6951,Fun so far.
6952,its really fun
6953,"changing from thumbs up to thumbs down.
they ask you to give a review like 1hr into the game and i did, it was 'fun'

but now 60hrs into the game i can give an honest review.

the game is fun, At first.

you build some meta deck following the trend, blow all ur shards on those cards, and then the nerf comes (monkey nerf was honestly too over nerfed.  i spent everything on monkeys, 2days later they nerf monkeys... now i'm playing vs collosus, stormy's, and crap i can't handle because i dedicated my start-up stuff to a single ""meta"").

instead of nerfing monkey's, they should've just buffed other cards making mana cheaper, etc.  a lot of cards cost too much mana and the game is pretty slow paced...

but those honestly aren't the gamebreaker for me.

it's once you hit master.
everything becomes a sht show.
1 out of 3 games you will have an afk teammate.
1 out of 3 games you'll have a teammate with a clown deck.  (10 mana cost cards, and the servitude spell card) a clown deck.
and then last but not least 1 out of 3 you'll have a teammate with stormy and OP cards and basically u two will just roll the enemy.
if you want to go up in duo's, it all is based off how well you can carry the clown game.  you'll lose the afk player game, so you basically must win your 2/3 games to climb rank in duo's.

i recommend your first shard cards to be stormy, collosus, and the healer.   or atleast that's what they use at the grandmaster level.   gl, have fun.  it was a fun 60hrs timesink but i'll probably uninstall, theres no actual point to playing past these 67 hours."
6954,"★★★★☆ – PLAYSTYLE
★★★★☆ – ART
★★★☆☆ – MUSIC/SOUNDS
★★★☆☆ – DOABLE ACHIEVEMENTS

I like playing a game of Minion Master once in a while. The achievements you can all complete, but some will take a long while. So for achievement hunters wanting to complete it in a day or two, this isn't your game."
6955,Never thought I'd be interested in a game like this but so far I am enjoying it greatly.
6956,"it good game to play
"
6957,"love this game 
and the devs are nice as well
"
6958,Quick fights
6959,Just perfect game design
6960,"meh.. borring.. i realy don t like it , you better play other games than this"
6961,"I have often looked at the videos above and thought that this is not for me.
Having now played the game for a few hours I can say that I am pleasantly suprised.
It is a fun experience, reasonably paced, with intuitive controls and satisfying gameplay.
Initial impression is...Well worth investing some time in."
6962,"i bought minon masters 
and i =ts really fun to play on your own or with others
entertaining card game ive ever played. they come alive!!!
"
6963,best shit i ever smoke
6964,"Shit game. Gameplay wise it's a copy of clash royale, a bad mobile game. Assets wise? That's another story. After playing about a little less than an hour it made me think they straight up stole assets from Heroes of the Storm. The ""ravager""s icon is only a little bit changed version of Dehaka's, ""Diona""'s model is 100% Valla, ""Ratbo"" is quite literally ripped off off Tychus, same gun, spinning barrels animation and everything else, just changed into a rambo rat. Also, the little fish is blue Murky. I didn't think the rambo rat was a rip off at first and there are many minigun characters, but the other thieveries off off Heroes of the Storm confirmed it for me. I ain't playing or endorsing the playing of the game of an uncreative, thieving company. Usual mobile game style extreme pushing of pay-to-win aspects are also obtrusive and annoying.

All this obviously shitty nonsense made me think the store page was bought reviews. Is this a chinese company or what?"
6965,"An odd mix of Tower Defense and Card Game. It works very well, I haven't spent a dime and have 95% of the cards unlocked. Really well done FTP game."
6966,"Usually avoid playing games like these, but this one really got me. The game is awesome...  with so much strategies that never expected this game to have. All in all this is a really nice game that can be played for fun and won't get bored for a really long time."
6967,"pay to win :( 
"
6968,like Royal but better animation..so far so good
6969,i love jade spark jungel i beat chapter 1
6970,Fun game
6971,so far so good
6972,f2p butt fun
6973,"Really good game, even tho there are some bad bugs from time to time"
6974,"Un excelente juego, subestimado para mi gusto. Es facil conseguir las cartas sin necesidad de pagar y jugas con gente de todo el mundo, lo cual hace que encuentre super rápido las partidas. Esta muy bien optimizado y está excelente para jugar con un amigo."
6975,Fun and free!
6976,Absolutely amazing game and super fun. Try it!
6977,"The game is fun, clean and innovative. The devs are doing an awesome job supporting the game and its streamers through the twitch incentives program."
6978,fun game indeed
6979,Finding matched is fast and matches are short and sweet. Getting the cards can be a bit of a grind if you want to be competitive but it still doesn't feel P2W. Great Game!
6980,This is pure and simple pay to win ripoff of other games
6981,"Easy to learn hard to master.
One of the few good F2P games which aren't P2W.
You get many shit for free. I´ve got plenty of it only because i´ve hit silver rank last season.
Most of the time im only playing the free champion nightbringer and it was always enough. 
He´s a good one for starters but you can try the 2 other ones. Every week theres a rotation.
Im not into ""card"" games but this one is fun and the sessions are short, so you can always come back for few games and have fun. Just try it, nothing to loose :)"
6982,"Seemed fun at first, but as you progress thru ranks you realize the game is P2W, if you dont put money in there you cant really progress any further."
6983,"somehow i have 460 hours in this game...steam asked me if i want to leave a review i guess i should

here is my review:

its pretty good"
6984,The best part about this game is that you can be in and out of a match in less than five minutes. Super easy to play a few games before work.
6985,"Very fun blend of deck-building and MOBA. Fun solo or with friends, and it's free! Try it out!"
6986,"Out of all the horizontal tower take-down games, this one is the most fun. Tons of cards and it's balanced pretty well. Great game."
6987,Good game
6988,good game
6989,ONLY PAY 2 WIN
6990,I was recommended this game by my friend Gum (https://steamcommunity.com/id/A__Friend) and as soon as I started playing it I began to enjoy it more and more. While I do have minimal hours and that opinion is subject to change I can clearly recommend this game now.
6991,"Fun to play, good game"
6992,Broken bug report system?
6993,I really enjoy this game. I especially have tons of fun playing with my partner. The mechanics of the game are good and the graphics are good too. Wish it was easier to customize the masters and buy stuff by using gold coins like costumes and such.
6994,VERY FUN
6995,"Love this game, it is really well made and has hours of game play. Worth it."
6996,funny game!
6997,sick game
6998,This game has to be the biggest unbalanced piece of garbage I have had the unfortunate displeasure of spending 300+ hours playing.  I am sorry I ever spent money on it to support developers that cannot even manage a basic level of game balance among the cards or masters in this game.  I say this as someone who has played this game enough to reach Grand Master and Contender on multiple occasions and has access to every card currently in the game.  If I could get my money back I'd do it without a second though.
6999,Lots of happy fun
7000,"The fact that you can play WITH a friend and not always against one, yes im talking about the 2v2 battle.
Me and my lil bro love to team up from time to time."
7001,"Light tactic's based fast games, good fun, see how long it lasts, and if there is more depth"
7002,Chill and Ez
7003,"Really hooking me in.  Just beginning the game (Level 14) and it looks like the game's pay wall isn't very high.  I've been offered a $5 ""one time"" starter pack and have been given lots of opportunites to just play the free to play content.

Mobile games around this genre of play have usually shown their hand with their paywall by this time, so I'm curious to see how forgiving the game will be to F2P players."
7004,"nice game, short matches, a lot of fun"
7005,11/11 VICTORIES ON A FIRST TRY.
7006,the game has no strategy just random play. you basically you have to fight several times to win 1 match and the game has no pvb battles only pvp which sucks because if you lose you lose rank which is stupid and it is broken when i played my mana didnt go up as it normally should and my cards had no order i had 5 4 mana cards and only 2 which showed up i also had to double click to place my unit if you are a person who prefers strategy and balance gameplay this is not the game for you its repetitive and stupid fix your game developers
7007,clash royale but on pc
7008,"Nice concept and a good game overall. 

rating (8/10)"
7009,Digging it so far. Feels way more fun and has more personailty than other auto minion battlers
7010,"Fun, chill game with high skill cap. Great for short gaming sessions."
7011,amazing game
7012,"Not Bad fo9r now let see the end game
"
7013,"This game is better then clash royal , i like how is looks like  3D"
7014,Pig man has gun
7015,Very fun
7016,"Didn't lose a match for the entirety of my playtime. Didn't get to play against any players either apparently. It's all bots, and it will ask you to pony up cash in the first ten minutes. Bad game."
7017,it doesnt suck
7018,Clash royale bassicly but pretty fun with unique stuff
7019,"Not a bad card game, mix of moba and ccg, pretty fp2 all and all as someone who enjoys card games its great."
7020,"Simple, pretty, and easy to learn, this game in my opinion exemplifies the genre of card-collecting battle games."
7021,horrible
7022,"Tug of War with ""strategy"" elements.
You can break the game with some cards."
7023,It's a lot of fun. Lots of customization
7024,1:36 duos everytime come at me noobs
7025,Clash Royale for PC with it's own unique mixs pretty fun enjoying 2v2ing with a bud of mine.
7026,"Like this game. Its good, runs good, and make me chill."
7027,gaem.
7028,It is a relativly good game. It is good for short bursts of playing.
7029,"good game
"
7030,Fun little game - Play with Random cards/mobs! :P
7031,its fun if you got skill of some sort
7032,Good thing to play when you just want to have FUN ^^
7033,nice game
7034,"Very interesting gameplay, hooked me in for hours already!"
7035,"Edit: With all the changes they made, this game is just a bunch of cheese decks on a run to mana frenzy. Absolutely unfun to play. Combined with a almost non existing matchmaking I can only say: ""Stay away from this game!""

Free to play deckbuilding game. When you know Clash Royal or South Park: Phone Destroyer you know this game. You build a deck with 10 cards, chose a master and off you go to fight your enemies. You got constantly recharging mana and try to play your cards in a smart way to gain an advantage over your foes and deplete their health while protecting yours. This game looks great, has nice arenas you fight in and good unit design. There are plenty of cards to play, wich is a bit hard for a new player but in the beginning you play against bots and you can make your self familiar with your cards. There is also a challenge mode where you can play against bots again and again and test your decks and just train to play the game. If you think you got it you start to climb the ladder in 3 modes, 1v1, Random 2v2 and Premade 2v2. Each mode plays a bit differently and allows for different decks and strategies. It is not really hard to build a good deck, but the higher you climb the ladder the better your deck needs to be cause you will run into experienced players with specialized decks. Wich is my biggest problem with this game. After a few hours, when you stop playing against bots and newbies, you run into a giant wall of experienced players who just mop the floor with you. That is pretty harsh and can rob the fun out of the game. There is no real matchmaking, you just play against players that are your rank, but that can be SpecialProSuperGuy with 9000 hours experience that is climbing up the ladder again. You will also notice that you run into just a couple of decks in higher ladder ranks. I think the balancing is a bit off in this game wich is a bit annoying.
You got a few other game modes, like for instance a draft mode, a chaos mode where some rules of the game are changed and even a rogue like game mode. All in all in it is pretty fun to play this game. It is not big on the Pay 2 win part and does not try to get every penny out of you pocket. Gaining achievements gives you plenty of in-game cash, cards and shards and if you look around in the internet you will find some threads with free codes that also help you out in building good decks and getting new cards.

I can recommend to try this game out. It is f2p but not p2w and can be quite addictive, but not because it forces you to play again and again to get free bonus stuff, but because It is fun to play."

7037,"Entertaining, but boring after a while."
7038,<3
7039,Great game!
7040,way to much fun
7041,great
7042,veri gut gaem
7043,great game
7044,"Fun game for some time, earning and collecting rewards at the beginning of the game is so satisfying, but after a while its gets boring because no one plays it"
7045,"Very nice game, sometimes unstable servers. But all in all, a good game"
7046,"This is actually fun! My friend mentioned for me to try a few games, just to see if I'd like it and it doesn't disappoint! It's a very unique style of game, one that I first played through Clash Royale on my phone (and yes the skills do translate if you've played that ;)) But I would definitely recommend this!

P.S. I'm only leaving a review because said friend asked if I was enjoying the game at the exact moment the game's ""Are you enjoying the game? Would you mind leaving a review to tell people about your experience... So I just had to!"
7047,"Fun little game. Could never be a ""main game"" for me, but a fun title to play while you figure out which game you wanna play next ;)"
7048,"Good game, still balanced. The devs hear the players so thats all."
7049,Just bad...
7050,Great game i'm trying to recruit as many people as possible.
7051,quick fun game :)
7052,pay to win vcl
7053,when u start to learn counters and tactics can be very challenging against real players countering you 4 people its quite epic
7054,"I'm enjoying the game. Quick and easy start, free to play (very fair), clearly lots of routes for money well-spent, silly, light-hearted."
7055,"The game is pretty enjoyable. Fast paced and strategy involved, doesn't take up too much of my time."
7056,"relax it is a cool game , well made"
7057,"This game feels like an old lane wars custom map from wcIII b.net days using card game-like mechanics that remind me of playing mtg... its free, give it a go and maybe it scratches that itch."
7058,"quick matches 
easy to learn
good bit of depth 
decent mix of deck types and useful cards"
7059,"It is a lot of fun, building decks that work cohesively, the only problem is it needs more people playing"
7060,it is very funny
7061,nice game for fun and competitive
7062,"i have thousands of hours playing this game and i am in the top 20 proly top 10 players in the game i strongly recomend this game. 1v1 me bro(chick) ill reck you
"
7063,"Fun game which reminds me a lot of Clash Royale for tablets and telephones.
Minion Masters however, have a more advanced approach as you earn xp for controlling the bridges.

The match lenght is awesome, even though you get pounded, you still feel that you have the opportunity to turn around the fight and win the battle.

So far I have only played for a very short time, but even though I sometimes lacked the strategy in the first stages of the matches, I haven't lost any yet.

Love the game - try it out - it's free!"
7064,"This game is great even if you have limited time available. Matches are short and intense.

And most importantly it is one of the few card-ish games that actually has multiplayer in the form of 2v2."
7065,It's fun. A lot like Nexus Wars from Starcraft. Free players still get a good deal :)
7066,Good for casual free card game.
7067,10/10
7068,Worth
7069,"fun game with good mechanics
"
7070,"The game is so fun, you can try a lot of new strategy.
"
7071,Better than clash
7072,Pretty fun as a duo game
7073,"I enjoy the game, it has a quirky sense of humor, a deck building mechanism, short matches with good animation and sound.  

PLEASE NOTE: like almost all free to play games your progress is effectively capped until you spend some $$ or invest a lot of time and grief attempting to rank up (good luck).  I understand there may be some exceptionally skilled players who can rank up without spending money but they do not represent the vast majority of the player base.

For someone starting Minion Masters I'd recommend playing it to see if you like it and then buy either the Starter Pack (offered in game) or the Premium Upgrade if you decide you like the game.

Save your rubies until a new season rolls around and then unlock the new season unless there's 60+ days left in the current season.  If you unlock the season at the beginning you stand a decent chance of earning enough rubies to unlock the next season pass once it launches if you play regularly and save  your rubies."
7074,"very addicting and fun
"
7075,"Very fun lots of cool minions love it
"
7076,This is actually pretty damn good!
7077,"TL;DR: PAY-2-WIN Game all the way. You Cannot be competitive in this game without paying lots of real world money. Has potential to be great game. You'll lose to the exact same deck 30% of the time. I paid for the Starter Pack and the Battlepass. I'd rather have paid for a regular game without the RNG lootboxes.

Pros: 
Can be very fun. Especially when trying out weird decks with friends.
Beautiful character/card designs.
Intuitive fight system.

Cons:
PAY-2-WIN
Rigged/bad matchmaking to keep you from progressing.
Rewards tried directly to paying money.
Game breaking Legendary cards.

Rant:
First off, this game can be *Very* fun at times. But the pay-to-win system corrupts the entire game top to bottom. The Loot Boxes of this game are called tokens, and while they can be earned in-game at a decent rate, they are required for progression and cost 100 ($1 US) of the in-game premium currency (Rubies).
These loot boxes contain only a Single ""Random* card from the entire card library; and you can (and will) get copies of these cards that are also required to use a card more than once in each deck.
You have to pay (~$20 US) just to be *allowed* to progress via the Battlepass, with lasts about 170 days. They hang a cake at the end of the Battlepass named ""Unlock Feature"", and if you take the time to complete all the levels of the pass, you get rewarded with more levels that only give 20% of the rewards of the main pass (1050 gold for and 1 million exp per 7 levels, NO card unlocks). 
If you have hundreds of dollars to blow, you can immediately gain an advantage on other new players by simply buying your deck and filling it with legendary cards. All high level play requires legendary cards and most decks will have 3-6 of them. Many of them either can't be countered or require a specific card(s) to counter. Get used to losing to Ritual of Servitude decks because they are nearly impossible to counter because matches are supposedly random.
On that note, the matchmaking is either broken or rigged to prevent you from winning too may games in a row. If you do win 3 games in a row, your next match will almost always be against someone several ranks higher than you. Best I've done is maybe 8 wins in a row. Average is 3 wins before a loss."
7078,Good
7079,"I've always had a soft spot for CCG.  While I much prefer that one that is the godfather to all of them; I like the paper version to the online one.  And the paper one requires money, and friends...
I'm digging MM because it is pretty fast paced, but still needs use of tactics.  No need to really remember dozens of deeply interconnected rules.  Just common sense kinda stuff.
Sure there is the pay to get further aspect, but.. what with it being free; what game doesn't have that.
I'd recommend at least giving it a try if you like easy to follow card games with so far as I've seen in the first 30 minutes or so, a varied and unique ideas for um... minions?"
7080,A very well balanced CCG which is actually winnable as FTP. Would highly recommend
7081,"fun
getting crazy lagg spikes though so unplayable"
7082,awesome game
7083,"Played for a couple of hours, seems good. Will update later!"
7084,"Constant updates and a great game overall, it's just fun :)"
7085,"I used to be an avid player of Clash of Clans's ""Clash Royale"" until this.  This game is much better, has more variety in characters, and much more rewarding.  Team battles is where it's at.  In-game purchasing options but I've had fun with this game for weeks (84 hours) without spending a penny.  Just download and try it for yourself!  Why not, It's free!"
7086,"Awesome, calming, relaxing. Great pair while catching up on anime!"
7087,Great game... have fun a lot with it
7088,"silly, simple to learn yet very deep, quick matches, totally f2p playable"
7089,"Awesome addicting game!
"
7090,very good
7091,I like this game.
7092,great!
7093,lots of fun
7094,"Easy to learn, quite difficult to master with fairly deep tactical gameplay. Very addicting.  If you want all the cards, it definitely gets quite grindy, but the gameplay is fun enough that it never really seems like a grind. Playing with friends makes it even more fun. As of this review, I'm 83 hrs in and not even close to tired of the game yet. Try it out for yourself and see, it's free so you have nothing to lose."
7095,cool
7096,is good
7097,Just play it. You will see. The Addiction is real.
7098,"For a free to play distraction, this is quite morish and very one more go-ey"
7099,"seems fun
"
7100,game is cool cause i say so
7101,A+
7102,"Not bad of a game, it's just repetitive. I know these types are repetitive but this one just feels repetitive. I also feel this game can feel like a p2w game at some moments. 
Matchmaking could be a tad better.
Appart from that if pvp tower defense type games are what you like i would recommend this game. You can also get freebies often by subscribing to there newsletter.
Fun game, i just got bored very quick."
7103,Lovely game !!!
7104,you should play it
7105,"very good and adictive
"
7106,it's ok
7107,fun
7108,it is a very shit game
7109,Clash Royale for pc but better
7110,very good! l love this
7111,"It's fun and relaxing.

Get's updated often and the rank seasons get reset often enough to keep it fresh. 

Minion masters additionally is a really fun game to stream, as it allows your chat to show up in the game and interact with it, which I think is pretty cool.

Personal rating for the game: 82/100"
7112,"my friends are playing this, I decided to take the leap and see what the hub-bub was about. Been playing for about an hour or so now and I gotta say, not bad at all. I celebrate the positives.. this is a Clash Royale type game but without the pressure that I'm sure we're all exhausted about these days as gamers. Keep up the good work on a nice game like this ;)"
7113,"very active
"
7114,AWESOME COMPETITIVE GAME
7115,I played the game some and I just can't recommend it. The game has way to many barriers that just cause you to lose progress and ultimately fail unless you GRIND a LOT.
7116,I like this game
7117,yess
7118,"Good game, Remindes me of good old Clash of Royale."
7119,nice game
7120,"Nice game play, smooth interface and straight forward.  Also love the cross platform capabilities"
7121,It is amazing!
7122,"Minion Masters is ideal for a quick, competition minded gamer. From first startup to first competition with others is under half an hour. There is a lot of fun to be had for free. And if you want to have access to the full game it is not expensive."
7123,
7124,"Too much to get into. If you enjoy card games and, competitive matches while still being a laid back experience give this game a try."
7125,One of the best free to play games I've ever played. Fair and fun. You can be competitive free to play.
7126,Good time sink. Not too difficult to learn.
7127,Fast and easy to learn - Addicting gameplay - Cards - What's not to like :-)
7128,"MM is an arena duel game with some similarities to various other games of that genre but also quite unique.   Definitely would recommend anyone looking at this page give it a try.  Play is quick enough to spend just a few minutes on at a time, but can keep me interested for hours at a time.  Definitely is a better game with a partner.  

Some aspects of the game could be better developed.  
- Expeditions basically amount to a small extra reward for just playing the way you normally would and don't provide enough bonus to adjust much.  Computer bosses there generally require a slightly different deck but are not too difficult or can be outpowered simply by doing more PvP matches.
- Adventure is fun but not getting any reward for beating it with multiple heroes or on hard mode doesn't feel right in a game where every other game you play gives at least a little reward (beyond the fun).  I think it also could be a bit less random and go longer.  It's also still quite new so may improve over time.  There is also no option for multi-player in adventure.

Pros:  
- Little to no Pay-to-Win which is refreshing in a Free-to-Play.
- Varied metagame with more variety than I've typically experienced in MtG over the years and with regular rebalancing.
- Great game to play with a friend without needing a large team.
- Draft is cheap enough to play almost continually and gives even more variety as does Mayhem.

Cons:
- No option to play in a team with more than one friend.
- Adventure mode can be fun but feels unrewarding."
7129,POGGERS RAG DOLLS
7130,yes
7131,Easy but not repetitive.. soo much fun to play with a friend 10/10
7132,I win every game so far
7133,A
7134,Pretty fun game.  It's insanely deep when you get far into it.
7135,fun & quick
7136,"clash royale
"
7137,Its ok so far
7138,Great game!
7139,what is with this lag? im running a 1080 and this is just a S♦♀♫ Show
7140,A really good online card game. The real time elements actually add to the tactics and complexity of the card interaction. Now you have to manage position in a continuous space rather then the discrete grids other card games with spacial elements use. Basically the only online CCG with real time elements I can approve of.
7141,Game fairly balanced so far. They give a lot of early rewards so not pay to win so far. Free game so I bought the starter pack for 5 dollars to help the game makers out but you don't need to spend a cent on the game.
7142,Se lo han cargado con las actualizaciones. Para PC no lo recomiendo. Pantallazos verdes y reinicio del pc incluso con los requisitos recomendados. Desinstalado. Una pena. A partir ahora lo jugaré en XBOX.
7143,"[h1]A Good card brawler in the style of ""clash of clans"" with little to no P2W elements[/h1], so a good start so far.
The only things premium currency unlocks is more ""masters"" (can be unlocked by other means), skins for those masters and allowing you to climb the battle pass and the leader boards in less games than than those who don't pay extra, yes there is a battle pass i would say it has some insane value for money if you by it and unlock it all the way, please do note it dose not give you back the currency used to by it."
7144,"Pretty fun game, quick matches. nice to hop on play a game or two then go to bed"
7145,This game is alot of fun for hours
7146,It's a good combo of a few different game types and well done so far - we'll see how the grindy gets but the quick random team play feature is spot on.
7147,"Charming, simply charming awesomeness of good clean PvP (tower defense) with cool graphics game cards.  Get into it - it's a ton of fun..  PLus, don't forget to join MY guild - ""Irresistible Conquerors"".  U can check my experienced (I hope) card arrangement and off you go...
Seriously, a bit to learn, but GREAT FUN ONCE YOU GET INTO IT...
"
7148,Free and fun!
7149,"What can be said about MM other that it's a genuine good game. It combines elements from a lot of places- it's real time  Hearthstone, TD and dota combined. The best part is that it's not pay to win, it's easy to learn and have in infinite replayability. The matches are qick and rarely take above 6 minutes which means it doesn't require a lot of time to play it and still you can enjoy it (as a working man this is what hooked me up and keeps me going).  There are 3 game currencies which you can earn fairly quickly so even after just a few hours you can buy amazins cosmetics for your masters. As a conclusion I can't recomend this game enough. Even if it's not for you I think most peple can enjoy it for tens of hours."
7150,one of the best F2P
7151,mantap mantap.
7152,Good game i like it
7153,a+++ game
7154,Pretty Fun
7155,probly my fav pvp game out right now
7156,juegardo.
7157,"Quite a fun game actually. It has alot of strategy to it, a variety of cards(minions,spells etc) to play.
You can really make a deck for how you want to play like:

->Low mana minions to try overwhelm the opponent
->Alot of spells to keep a certain control of the battle
->Super tanky kind of minions but it starts to cost more mana, but also worth it
->You even select what master you want to be and each have different skills/attacks to offer

Just to name a few. You can also play 2v2, and i see as you level up more and more modes get unlocked.
It has a ranking system, and you can spend money into the game, but it really doesn't seem necessary
with where i am in the game so far.

You get cards/gold/crystals etc. when you level up. You can also use the crystals to get a specific card that you want.

Overall it's actually a very fun game"
7158,Fun pvp tower defense strategy game. One of the best games iv'e played.
7159,"Great content, frequent updates and free DLC. Amazing pvp game."
7160,pretty good game
7161,"Sh*tty support, sh*tty game."
7162,"Even I don't like PvP games, this one is good, easy to learn, match lasts 2-3 mins"
7163,"quite good addicting when your trying to just wait some time
received this for free"
7164,"A quite fun game that I actually enjoy playing once in a while. Believe it or not but the characters all have very good perks and abilities that you can exploit and not only that but a fun 2 v 2 mode that you can do with or without friends. 

"
7165,Just a great game in general
7166,"What the fuck this game, I have expensive minion but like a shit!

"
7167,"As a fan of other games in this series (Forced Showdown) I wasnt expecting too much from Minion Masters, ""just a reskin of a popular type of mobile games within an universe that I know"" I said to myself. After serveral hrs into the game I started to enjoy te core gameplay, build up your deck is easy does not require that much of grind, I love to play few games per day just as w filler between chores. The matches itself are fast and addicting there is no p2w just a typical CCG mechanic of filling your library of cards with usefull stuff. I can really recommend the game for anyone that likes this type of fast gameplay.

TL:DR: It's good try it :P"
7168,better than fortnite
7169,"An awesome version of this game style so far, team battle with a friend is the ultimate way to play, covering and moving forward"
7170,"Fun game, definitely something that's easy to kill time with a friend"
7171,YEET
7172,"When I received a number of free goodies for Minion Masters through Twitch Prime as well as weekend promotions, I took a look at the game and expected to be disappointed by a bad mobile game port with an unrewarding free-to-play economy designed to drive microtransactions.

However, Minion Masters surprised me. I found a well-polished deckbuilding game with reasonably deep mechanics and, sure, a reasonably frustrating F2P economy. Yet, I also found it relatively easy to put together a reasonably viable deck and make meaningful progress.

Perhaps most importantly, I found the fundamental gameplay of Minion Masters to be compelling and enjoyable, and I found it both easy to sit down for a quick round and easy to want to keep playing. My biggest gripe is the time-based structure of events, quests, and rewards, which tend to reward play frequency over playtime, and run the risk of making it feel like a chore. However, this also means that if you ever get bored, you can simply come back a few days later, and you'll have a suite of new objectives to keep you interested.

Overall, I think Minion Masters is a great value for a free game."
7173,Funy game :)
7174,"Braindead game, lol."
7175,"Harmless fun, chill and play some games
"
7176,this game if f2p freindly unlike other free games but spendiing the 20 dollars for premiuem account upgrade is not a bad idea the game does feature a battle pass system but what game doesnt anymore
7177,"Fun in small doses.  Quick games.

Disappointing UI and ranking system.

Pay to advance, but good choices are often more important than legendary cards [i]and[/i] there's a counter for everything."
7178,"a garbage pay 2 win , most of the time the fagots devs of thsi game dont put you in your own leage ..60% of time i play as  ( i am diamond league) and i play with master league ?!?! wtf is this shit

no good thing to put you fight players more higer in ranks for noe rason"
7179,"Good graphics, easy to learn and get into.  Fun depth"
7180,game keeps crashing while trying to enter a team battle!!!!
7181,Clash Royale for PC
7182,fun
7183,Its a fun game. Similar to some you may know already.
7184,Great game Mad Fun
7185,Just started but a quick and easy game. Also no farming a billion cards to catch up on level tiers
7186,"Matches are 2 to 7min. cards come pretty easy. Its more about counters to minions and how to use the ones you have that make a good player. Seldomly about the ""luck of the draw"" or ""he has all rare cards he wins"". When i lose i can tell i got outplayed 9/10 of the time. 
Cheap to get into if you want all the Masters up front (kinda have to get the best ones Milloween and Morellia)

Only negative is the best masters aren't always in the free rotation."
7187,"Really good game, CAN be a bit unbalanced at times, but is none the less counterable"
7188,"A game with quick to grasp rules, steady progress and a nice art style"
7189,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER!!!! YES THEY  GOT IT RIGHT DON'T PASS ON THIS PROVEN WINNER! YOU GOTTA PLY THIS GAME.
7190,"till you are in low tier is ok and fun...
After that, if you don't purchase some pack from +100 euros you are screwd"
7191,This game is the best game iv ever played on pc
7192,it's a slightly better clash royale but that wasn't a high enough bar for me.
7193,pretty fun free game micros not 2 bad pretty fair
7194,"I used to play a lot of this game and I liked it for its simplicity, like other old people! But the game began to complicate more and more and thereby went too far! I have lost interest, like many other players. Beginners without investing real money have nothing to do here)"
7195,best card game gg no ree
7196,"Gold rank in one day - good game wp fireball finish all the way
"
7197,it's good that no one can report u or say bad things to u in this game and all r friendly i guess in this game and i really like it ^^ ♥
7198,fun times
7199,"Luck based gambling card game. Stay away if u have addiction/gambling issues. The team mode is completely garbage, due to no differentiation between pre-made and random teams, so the mixed ranking system is unable to filter out the losers and griefers, and nothing has been done about it."
7200,Fun little game for those moments when you have no idea what to play.
7201,Addictive and fun
7202,Fun game.
7203,Simple quick and good.
7204,"Fun game, fast rounds :)"
7205,It's more of the same you have seen elsewhere. With addition of bugs like decks having removed cards every time i launch the game(really?). If it even launches cause sometimes it takes like 10 tries.
7206,"A great card game, BUT there's a pay to win system so take care. 
You can reach the top for free though, but it's kinda frustrating.
I recommend it if you just wanna play few matches for fun, don't recommend if you want to be a Grand Master."
7207,k
7208,This game is a combo of magic and a moba. It seems the winning strategy is to front load your deck with 1 and 2 drops and then have 5 and 6 drops.
7209,Endless fun.
7210,bored
7211,Everything in this game is either really cool or really cute. The visuals are rad af <3
7212,EPIC
7213,So far has been a really fun game. Waiting for more
7214,"free fun, and I joined a guild already ""Skeletons of Society""...."
7215,"Fun free to play card game - and there's enough ways to get rubies, gold, and shards without paying additional monies that I don't feel stifled if I don't want to spend actual cash. Kind of like a mix of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering Online."
7216,"Sometimes there are serious issues but they are seen to in a timely manner.
The game play is fast paced, dynamic and reactive. Great game!"
7217,really fun and I am not that into card games
7218,"I've put enough time in to say that the game is fun. There's quite a few different modes that make it refreshing for this style of game. There's an adventure, a rogue like mode with rewards, a normal 1v1 and a team battle that reminds me a lot of clash royale. There are other modes too. It is pretty fun for the most part but like with all free to play games there is the pay to win aspect but I haven't really encountered a scenario that was too bad in the aspect. I really like the champion part of the battles, that is the coolest part of the game. Your tower basically is defended by different champions with different abilities. Pretty cool. It is worth a try for sure."
7219,"Very nice ""little game"". Should do some work on it, make more content and stuff and make it more then just a nice little game ... Anyway nice to play but lack in content, so far so good and I hope to see some big updates soon ."
7220,"it was alright before it became pay to win, it is now trash"
7221,"i like the game just wish they added a 3v3 mode
"
7222,gg
7223,game is gud pls play you ae good time
7224,The game is well balanced and compared to other card games this one probably needs more strategies/techniques. Luck plays the least important role.
7225,Fuck Jannies
7226,Simple yet fun to play! If your looking for something to keep you entertained while watching netflix or listening to music look no further.
7227,"Well balanced, truly free-to-play and very addictive :)"
7228,"Really fun and addictive game!
Creating your own deck is pretty easy and soon you'll find a strategy you might like.
Most of the common cards are already pretty good to play with. But you get uncommon and rare card drops quickly. You can also craft the cards you want if you have the resources.
The matches are in general fast (few minutes max, which is for me a great plus) and are pretty well balanced, with a ranking system which doesn't punish you too much for losing. 
I personally like 2v2 plays more as they give you more breath to develop your strategy during a match.

A couple of improvements I'd like to see: a better deck management, as currently there is basically none. I need to filter, sort, mark as favorites the cards, etc. Now they are just ordered by mana cost and that's it.
Also a bit more ""story"" things to do (challenges, expeditions, etc) as I ran out of them pretty quickly and I have to wait 1 or 2 days to get new ones.

Overall, I can recommend this game for anyone looking for a casual multiplayer game.
"
7229,I actually like this game but it often keeps crashing and the support doesn't help me. My PC can play Rocket League and Dirt 3 just fine so I'm quite sure it's not a hardware problem.
7230,Didn't even notice that I was 150 hours into it. Addictive and fun.
7231,"80/100

This is a great game to jump into and have instant entertainment. 


NO PAY TO WIN 


Game-play is fun, quick,easy and is more about skill than having better cards.

The creators make it easy to get new skins and cards by checking the store daily for deals, Everything can be earned in-game with game-play.

If you want to support the creators you can buy skins and other in-game items.

Great game worth checking out."
7232,so much fun to kill time with this game!!!!! 10/10!!!!
7233,"Minion masters is a pretty easy to get in to deck building RTS. Typical matches take 2-3 minutes, and a bit more if you get evenly matched up. Its fun, and the free to play model isn't particularly greedy."
7234,everything about this games is awesome
7235,good
7236,"Just recently returned to the game.
Took me about 40 hours to get past Gold.
After about 120 hours you should be consistently Master/GM.
Pretty dope game.
Also kind of simple.
I suggest this as not being your only game, though.
It gets super repetitive and they don't release content often enough.
Fortunately, though, lack of content due to a small team is the only actual setback.
That's not to say that they don't add content once a month or so, they just don't add enough."
7237,"[h1]CCG With Extra Steps[/h1]

It's not a bad game. The card-game-RTS-moba mashup is interesting and in short bursts can be competitive and fun. The P2W becomes apparent early, spending cash will get you better cards (which is an rng crap shoot) and masters and your win ratio goes up. The rub is anything can be acquired in the game through grind, even with the premium upgrade though it's an uphill battle. I'm not willing to grind or pay so I give this game a thumbs down, but if you think it sounds fun definitely download it and give it a try, you're not going to be out any cash."
7238,"This game is ""What if clash royale (TM) was actually good?""

Upgrading troops only offers cosmetic benifits, not numeral.

Higher level players only have more vairity in cards, not just straight up better.

This game is good."
7239,GG
7240,"Fun, well made and quick matches! Highly recommend!!"
7241,"Easy to pick up, and you can easily get enough resources that you don't need to pay for extras.
Maybe you can't succeed at the top without paying, but I'm not good enough that it matters."
7242,Fun so far!
7243,if ur good at clash. youll be good at this
7244,epic!!!!!
7245,"Played a few matches, clapped a few cheeks, ok game i guess."
7246,"Great game, super addicting."
7247,"This is exactly the kind of strategy game I like, great job!"
7248,Awesome
7249,Great game
7250,is fun
7251,fun
7252,"Such a great game, free to play also"
7253,"decided to download it cos i got the twitch prime thing, thought i'd try it for 10 minutes an then go back to what i was doing since the art style looked too childish for me... 2 ish hours later ive ranked up twice, earnt enough to buy a champion and made a couple deck's only to have the ""are you enjoying this game"" message to pop up reminding me that i actually had things to do ha... honestly its fun. i dont really know why it is, but it is.

i mean its free so whats the harm in giving it a go?"
7254,its a fun army game like lords just better
7255,Think LOL/Hearthstone and Clash Royale had a healthy and balanced baby.
7256,Great game!
7257,p fun
7258,i guess its ok for a free to play if i had to i would pay 2$ i give it a 5 out of 10
7259,"In some way it reminds me of civilization wars game/gamemod of some old strategies  - but in this case you do not build houses of your civilization at your side of arena, but uses cards you have selected o your deck.

Even as there is buy option for now I believe game is still balanced and not pay to win/play...."
7260,Fun to play
7261,"It's fun, it's fast to find a match, and really good graphic. 9/10 recommended."
7262,"Garbage pay to win game, porn games have done this exact thing to a higher level of quality and integrity..."
7263,This game is definitely not like other F2P games. You don't have to spend any money to have fun or even win games. If you sign up for the email list you even get free things sent to you frequently. Highly Recommed.
7264,Landscape Clash Royale
7265,fun but far easier than yugioh
7266,decent f2p game.
7267,"Very fun game, and easy to get into!"
7268,There's no denying that this game has heart. It's really going for it.
7269,"Was a sweet game at first. Super fun Co-op two player mode.  Very much a pay to win game though.  Paying gets you better cards/more cards.  Super easy at first and fun, but then you hit a wall where everyone's cards are way better than anything you have and you lose every multiplayer game."
7270,idk
7271,Really fair and really fun :)
7272,"nice
"
7273,Very fun with no incentive to spend money.
7274,"Time killing, Love playing this."
7275,super
7276,good
7277,"like any other balancing team in videogame industry, these guys appear to be freaking cavemen that know absolutely anything about feedback."
7278,"Alright to floss on for a period of time, nothing to grab ya balls at though, mildly satisfying"
7279,"Sometimes, when you're browsing your library aimlessly at three in the morning, you can be pleasantly surprised."
7280,"Lots of glitches, The ""roguelike"" adventure is a complete false advetising. Anything interresting requierts you rupees to be bought like the season pass that you have to buy every 3 months if you want to keep up with the others or simply to play the adventure.

It's fun to play for free but the game gets repetitive real fast."
7281,it is very fun and is not p2w imo. very active and friendly community and updated frequently
7282,"This game is great. At first glance, I was skeptical due to the game looking a little bit like a mobile port. How wrong I was. I might not have the most hours in the game, but I feel like I have enjoyed enough of the content to write a helpful little review of it. 
Minion Masters is essentially the love child of League of Legends and Hearthstone.

You control a Master sitting on top of what is pretty much your nexus (LoL). You then play cards from a deck that you have constructed to summon minions or cast spells. There are 2 ""lanes"" that the minions travel down to reach the enemy master and each lane has a bridge that, when controlled, give you more exp, giving you an advantage. You win when you have reduced the enemy Master's health to 0.

The biggest worry with card based games like this is the business model and how much of an advantage real money will give you. The way to get new cards is through Loot boxes or crafting with an in-game currency called shards. You cannot buy shards directly with money, (although some packs paid for with money do include shards). The  ""real money"" currency is used to buy Loot boxes,  skins, Battle Pass, Adventures (think Naxx in HS) and new Masters and will not give you an advantage that is significant in my experience. While real money can get you a solid card base quicker from buying loot boxes with real money, The average player can definitely progress without spending a dollar and not feel like their lacking for being F2P.

Minion Masters has three in-game currencies. Shards to craft cards and to buy masters like mentioned.
The ""real money"" currency is called rubies.
And then there is gold which is rewarded after every game and should be used entirely on loot boxes in my opinion. There are daily deals in the shop for random legendaries and epics and what not. These are usually not worth it for new players who are wanting to attain a solid card base. Spend it on loot boxes.
You can also gain all three resources from daily spins, level up rewards, daily quests, achievements, etc.

The game-modes are great and offers a wide variety. You can play solo or duo with a friend and the Expeditions, adventures, draft mode, and challenges offer a wide variety, and tons to do. On top of it all, the devs seem really involved and are rolling out new content frequently with clear deadlines, setting the right expectations.

I have come to love this game, it is a simple concept with a lot of depth to it. It is pretty easy to learn while still being able to master with patience and time. 

Pros:
* Free to Play while not being Pay to Win
* Fun and has the ""one more round"" feel
* Frequent Rewards for simply playing the game
* Fair and rewarding business model
* Very Active Devs 
* Frequent new content
* Many game-modes

Cons:
* Loot-boxes are not always the best for some
* Frustrating if someone beats you simply because they had better cards
* Can get a little grindy at higher ranks/levels


Since the game is free, there is really nothing stopping you from trying it out. So go try it out!"
7283,I played this game already for 500+ hours I think its ok! but I m not 100% sure!
7284,Love it
7285,Great game if you don't have a ton of time to play. You can get the daily's done in 30 minutes or less. The cost to get into this game is pretty low too. It's just fun.
7286,"Minion Masters is really awesome game.
I much appreciated efforts of the developers.
I like to play this game with my son. However he is too young now and can speak and read only in our native language.
The game supports so many other languages. It would be great to add Ukrainian Localization to the game. I'm sure it will expand gamer auditory a lot among Ukrainians.  Just for notice there some enthusiastic localization groups that would help you to localize the game in Ukrainian. 

For now I can not do ""thumb up"".
Thanks for understanding.

#AddLocalization #AddUkrainian"
7287,Very fun with a variety of possible deck mechanics/strategies. better than many games you actually have to pay for
7288,"quick and fun game play, pretty lights and sounds"
7289,it's fun.
7290,Just started - seems pretty similar to clash royale - its nice
7291,Really enjoying the game so far.  Like that you can get in a few quick matches when you only have a few minutes to play.
7292,Game balance just gets worse with time.  They have no idea how to balance despite there only being 184 cards.  When they nerf something they generally simply ruin the card.  Current meta is cancer and the game can't hold on to player base so it hovers around 1200 concurrent players.  Great idea marred by bad balance choices and limted player base.  I continue to play only because there are no other games like this on pc.
7293,"Fun and not to hard!
"
7294,I lost track on the clock.. haha
7295,"stupid developer, support does not even reply"
7296,YES
7297,"I having fun, fun fur all whom play dis game, i recomend dis"
7298,Easy to play to pick up and go!
7299,"Develepors are quite good people,is a free game which is not pay to win,it's fun overall"
7300,"This game just asked me to leave a review like it was a mobile app...
I guess if you are really bored it can be, Ok?

Pros: My newborn nephew can play this.

Cons: People stream this on twitch?"
7301,"Good, chill, stress-free time spender!

Build decks and fight enemies with tactical placement, can play with a friend in 2v2 for additional fun. I did not find the game pay to win much (even thought you can PAY to get cards, it didn't take me too much time getting some good cards to feel equal).

The thing is, games are between 1 to 8 minutes long. You can't really become mad for very long and the next game will refresh your anger (if any, I found I had almost none).

GG"
7302,Minion Masters is a Leetzorz game of this 'kind' 'type' 'thang'. I likes it; itch do scratching...
7303,Entertaining. Colorful.
7304,"Cool idea, needs more explanation around having multiples of cards.
Game will close if you change the language, just re-launch."
7305,great games
7306,this game is like clash royal only that it is actualy good
7307,"Interesting game, first time im trying this kind of RTSTD, its not that hard to get your head around the game, the gameplay is fun and a lot of elements to experience, but my greatest fear is that this game may not be as challenging, i have yet to find out though, because i recently joined this game but i reached Gold V without much effort with only 6 hours of play time."
7308,bad game. pay to win. loot box mechanic has unusually low drop rate.
7309,"Great free to play game that isn't pay to win. Great online community around the game as well including streamers, youtube vids, reddit threads, discord chats and so on. Check it out!"
7310,Fun and fast so you can pop in and out as needed.
7311,Great game !!!
7312,great game very addictive
7313,"It is a wonderful game, to pass the time."
7314,Good with a friend
7315,"[b][i]product received for free because it's a free game lmao, i know i should only check that s#it if the devs gave me something of monetary value which might cause me to be biased but whatever[/i][/b]

okay so, it's quite a good game IMO. i can't be bothered to write a real long analysis-review of this game because:
1. I don't play often enough to be at a high tier to really understand all the intricacies and possibilities of deck building from fellow players and my own experience
2. The balancing updates happen pretty often anyways, nerfs and buffs going left and right
3. The only other ""card-game"" i play is Slay The Spire[strike](go check it out btw its real fun and complex but watching ""Jorbs"" helps a lot)[/strike]. So I can't really compare how well this game does ""card-game-balancing"" , and there's not much can be done about ""enemy balancing"" either since the main focus is multiplayer where everyone has their own decks. You do get put into tiers and climb into higher tiers to meet opponents of the same tier, and I think this is a very common system in online games like LoL tho I never played it.

That being said, I still have something to say though. [b][u]I can confirm this game is not really pay-2-win.[/u][/b] You just need to learn what you should counter things with. There's a little grind at the start to collect cards, but once you own most (60%) of cards, you should have enough tools to work with. Some of the best counters are quite common = Stun Lancers, Gremlin Bomber, etc. But of course, some rare s#*@ cards are nice to have too but why the hell would you spend money on them. as long as you can manage to live long and spend like 10-20 hours, you should have enough cards. [strike]of course you should google all public minion master codes from all corners of the internet to help you get enough shards for cards and rubies for, possible, a 2nd master, that's why it didn't take long for me either[/strike]

also King Puff. so cute. I understand why another character in the game loves him. [strike]imagine his tongue game...[/strike]"
7316, Hearthstone + League of Legends + no p2w = this
7317,"Came for the free, spent money.
:( feels bad bad man"
7318,"It's like a combination of Starcraft and Magic: The Gathering, and it's awesome."
7319,.
7320,good for a free game!
7321,"It isn't p2w when you eventually get all the cards, but unless you put in some money that is going to take you a hundred hours. I suppose that is fair because it is a free game.

I would be happier if the money went to cosmetics instead of buying cards. There are enough people who put many hundreds of hours into this game who would be happy to pay for cosmetic upgrade.

To keep you hooked, the game plays you once against a bot and then once against a real person, so essentially you win one and lose one when you reach your level. This is my biggest criticism of the game. I still find bots at grandmaster level.

I would prefer it if there was an option to wait longer and not play bots."
7322,its a quick and easy game to learn. love the fast pace
7323,very fun
7324,"Its fun, easy to pick up and both the community and developers are great. A very enjoyable experience"
7325,"I didt play for a long time but Im enjoying the game so far. It reminds me this mobile game I played long time ago. Easy to catch up, intuitive and simple. I recommend."
7326,It's a game
7327,great game
7328,Can't tell you how much I love this game!
7329,"Ill admit, at first i was a bit sceptical when i started the game... infact... i played like 2 games... than i left the game for like 2 weeks... but than i tried it again... and wow... this game is addictive as hell, its got something for everyone...

if you like to play with friends... strategize your combo's and climb a ranked ladder... this game is for you!"
7330,"The game lies to you, matching you against brain dead bots but tries to convince you that they are real players.
That is inexcusable manipulative BS imho. Don't play."
7331,great game
7332,"The game is unexpectedly enjoyable. The game is very easy to pick up, and the matches can get chaotic in a hurry once Mana Frenzy kicks in. Can definitely see myself playing this for a while."
7333,gREAT!
7334,Fast paced - easy to understand - humorous - fun stuff
7335,"The gameplay is very satisfying, but the amount of loot crates and rewards is too overwhelming and quickly becomes annoying."
7336,"Smooth graphics, well put together, sound is great, music rocks, Love it, love it, suck it, nugget"
7337,"My personal experience with the game is that it is not for me. Apart from me being more into anime themed games, I feel like there is too much grind and money involved to get anywhere in this game.

- I want to choose a character to play as. This cost real money because they are not free.
- I want to try solo content. One of those cost money.
- I want to collect cards. Sorry, this game gladly gives you duplicates that only boost your battle pass exp instead of helping you get new cards.
- I'm interested in skins. Mainly real money or heavy grind to get them.
- I found this draft mode fun. But it costs virtual money, so I have to choose between buying more cards, or buying an entry to this mode. It is 100% RNG though, so it feels like playing the lottery and sometimes you pay virtual money just for losing.
- Mayhem mode also seemed fun, so no surprise that it also cost virtual money to play.

As I see it, in short this game is probably best if you either go all in and buy most of the DLCs and play the heck out of it, or you don't play it at all. Because much more than a few RNG cards is not really given to you."
7338,Very fun game
7339,Clash Royale CTRL+V
7340,"it is a good game that we must try, good graphic and playing system."
7341,epic
7342,Its good when you get to higher elo then you get destroyed by 5 legendary card that just out trade your epic common and rare cards for cheaper!
7343,ok
7344,"GOOD
"
7345,"a good card game like clash royale, give it a try."
7346,Its simple and fun and i think it will get better in higher leagues havent met any hard resistance yet
7347,devs fucked this game beyond comprehension
7348,"this was a nice for not wasted time 3 or 5 min for free its fast game end don't worry you will late your work
"
7349,This game is AWESOME!!! I could sit here for hours to play it. This is my new game to play now
7350,"Only played for a few hours so far, but this game is legitimately fun and addictive. It's like a fast-paced card game where your cards come to life and skirmish in real time. It's much better than I imagined, and it's free, so you have nothing to lose for trying it. Check it out! [url]https://youtu.be/AmJyDIFIIDw[/url]"
7351,"TL;DR : If you like minion combat, strategy, or deck building games... you will love this.

Even though this type of game is not really what I like to play, I manage to have a good time any time I play it.  It is well polished and easy to pick up and get going.  I have not spent a dime on the game, yet I feel like I have enough cards/minions to be competitive if I want.  There is more to do than just battle other players, and the feature where it shows you people who are streaming the game while you are in game is really kind of nice.  There is probably a lot more I could say good about this game, but I cannot think of anything bad to say.  Just try it, it's free."
7352,This game is fun
7353,"Great game, better community. You are welcome to join"
7354,It's like if Autochess and Hearthstone had a baby.
7355,Interesting and comfortably
7356,"An amazing game. Clash Royale feeling.
"
7357,"Another pay to win game. Your opponent spends real $, upgrades their deck, you play free and ...you lose. Don't waste your time."
7358,great game love it
7359,"The biggest issue I think this game has is the fact that it [i]STRONGLY[/i] favors the winning player. Due to the way mana and XP work in this game, the losing player will be stuck struggling against near-impossible odds, while the winning player will have more than enough resources to keep their opponent down. The 'win-more' gameplay in Minion Masters is only further enforced by the 'Mana Frenzy' mechanic, which grants a hilariously unfair amount of mana regeneration if a player has collected a certain amount of XP in a match (again favoring the winning player).

Following up on this, there's the awful matchmaking and card balance. A match is an all or nothing 90% of the time. Either you get stomped hard, or you're the one doing the stomping. It's [i]very[/i] rare to get a match where it feels like it was fair. 

Finally, a lot of the cards in this game are just carbon copies of another card, just with [i]slightly[/i] tweaked stats and/or a slightly different effect. For example: Prowler, rabid prowler and caged prowler. This is in my opinion pretty lazy card design.

Conclusion; I do not recommend playing Minion Masters [b]at all[/b]. The gameplay itself is pretty fun as far as lane games go, I'll admit that. But that gets overshadowed by the very frustrating flaws mentioned above."
7360,Great free to play game.  Free cards can actually be used to get to higher ranks fairly easily.
7361,"Certain monsters not being in your deck really hurts you regardless of the type of deck your trying to play. I also wish there was more synergy within the deck type you use, currently they only cards i see with any deck effect go from kinda bad to ok. But i don't have every card its also just my opinion. edit: came back one type decks no longer exist because of just how weak they are, which is how i like to play so this game goes in the trash."
7362,"Simple, quick matches, easy entry into competitive. Pretty standard F2P cash grabs will be found, but you can have a very good deck without spending money. The game revolves around PvP only essentially, there are some PvE scenarios but the AI is crap so they let it cheat and there isn't much content there.

I am a huge fan of quick push and pull style games like this and I am super addicted."
7363,"I do find the game itself pretty decent, but the playerbase is decreasing rapidly, thus resulting in 'the same old' matchups as well as hacking and bot-users becoming a larger and larger part of the experience.

Thus this was fun while it lasted and I'll keep going for the last 2 achivements, then I'm Nope!-ing the hell out."
7364,"An excellent duelling game, with quick rounds (less than 10 minutes, usually less than 3.)

Despite this speed, battles feel weighty and exciting.

It is very easy to get a game, the queues are rarely as long as a minute.

Just a well made, fun game :)"
7365,Awesome !
7366,very fun quick paced and easy to get into definitely not pay to win which is a good change
7367,"Fast paced, easy to learn, and a lot of fun. My only complaint is that the deck only contains 10 cards. Doubling that amount could add a lot of uniqueness to deckbuilding and strategy."
7368,"Honestly can't recommend this game any more. It was a great game once upon a time. Used to be a very free to play friendly game if you were to grind the game a bit. Takes a while to get cards and stuff but you could have everything just by playing enough and it was cool the devs would periodically send us codes for small free stuff. It was nice for a change to see a free to play game that was just that. 

Now its becoming very pay to win and not worth anyones time. A few updates ago they started locking cards behind the battle pass. And everyone argued you only had to wait until the next pass to craft the cards. which i a lame justification since players who simply dont have the money to shovel for this game will always be behind on a competitive level as players who did pay would have access to all the new stuff fairly fast. While every one else will be a month behind. During that time the devs also decided to shorten the length of that seasons battle pass with out telling anyone while charging the normal price, and then didnt even find a way to compensate those of us who did buy it until there were only like 12 or 13 days left in it and the compensation wasn't even worth it at that point. And then today they announced all the glorious economy changes to the game which will undoubtedly make it very pay to win from what I read.

I understand as i think most people do that free to play devs have to make money some how. And i can get making their premium currency less readily available with out buying it. But there are better ways to do that than by locking other things in game behind pay walls. I could see locking cosmetics behind pay walls, maybe new looks for minions and what have you. But not things that make the game playable. I would come back if i could still be competitive by having just as much access to all of the cards and heroes as everyone else but thats simply not the case any more. Games just not worth the time investment any more. Was nice seeing a free to play game that existed that was actually free to play while it lasted though."
7369,Fun game. Nice to play in between other games. Games are pretty quick also which is nice.
7370,its good its like clash royal and its free nothing to complain about
7371,For a free game an absolute banger if you enjoy either card games or MOBA
7372,Fun so far - just starting but spent some money for Battle Pass look forward to playing more
7373,good.
7374,awesome 10/10
7375,"I often win againts player for streaks by 3 times at least. After that, i had unbalanced match because they force me to having matches with PAY2WINPLAYER which its ""WTF"" lol.
Their cards are SUGOI IKEH KIMOCHI #NOTHINGCANSTOPITMOTHERFUCKER

There were like to SPAMMING almost all ""LEGEND'S"" cards. uuuuuuuuuuum.................what to do, i am just a free to play player and of course im losing and hell no there is no chance to win againts them

7377,"WAS A GOOD GAME / BUT THE DEVS HAVE RUINED THE GAMES PLAYABILITY  FOR GOLEMS. IF U LIKE THE GOLEMS THEY NOW GET SO RIDICULOUSLY WREKT BY SO MANY TINY  CRAPPY LITTLE MINIONS.They need speeded up slitely/ but Devs wont touch them/ they have abandoned them
THERE R ALSO 2 MANY SNIDEY CHEAT MINIONS LIKE GHOST & WIZARD PUFF. Whoever designed some of this Cack must be Childishly retarded.
The other BIG ISSUE & Long standing one is there is NO LEAUGE Tables for ALL PLAYERS/ Only the Elite Top 50 . and there are at Least 500 players S o frustrating as you cant Gauge just where u r in the over all game,  or who is your nearest rivals/ or whos on the way Up & down. in other words u cant study the ' form'. SHOULD BE A FULL LEAUGE TABLES LIKE U.K FOOT BALL LEAUGE S
P.S u CAN GET GET BANNED FROM Chat by PETTY mODERATORS. i was and i have spent some £60.00 on the game over the Last 2 years"
7378,Awesome game! Love how
7379,i don't really know why i just... do
7380,Fun and addicting.
7381,"It's very good, simple!"
7382,fun fun play it?

7386,Fun free game with active community
7387,It's fun :)
7388,"Very easy to get into, love the comedic tone of the narrator; it's a way better version of Clash Royale."
7389,"I couldn't connect server even I used UU accelerator in the beginning, so I uninstalled it. But the day before yesterday, I downloaded it again, I used UU accelerator this time, it worked. So I can play the game enjoyably even the net is still unstable."
7390,"Highly recommended!

This is a refreshingly original and addictive game that often rewards both thoughtful strategies through deck building, and tactical adaptability with careful timing and placement during a match."
7391,this game is amazing for a free to play :D nice new spin on deck building game types
7392,"so far lovin this game, the premium currency so far isnt a pay to win and most of the minions seem fairly balanced
"
7393,Is it a moba or is it a card game? Is it a mord game? Is it a caba game?
7394,nice
7395,"Fun game, got it for the beta, forgot who gifted it but, it's interesting. It's basically Trash Royale but good and for PC."
7396,Just installed it an hour ago. Love it so far.
7397,"The PC version of Clash Royale, the smartphone game.
But thats actually good thing, in fact its a great free-to-play game without a pay-to-win wall!
Choose your master, your minions and spells and battle it out against other masters!
Looks great, has quite a tactical depth to it and also makes fun in team battles together with a friend.
8/10"
7398,"Fun and free!

7400,.
7401,Basic and easy to play
7402,"Honest review, totally:

The game feels fresh, it's quite addictive and it's absolutely NOT pay to win, I've been playing the game for 1 week and i had a blast so far. The hour count in almost every other review should tell you just about how much time people sink into this game, meaning it provides a lot of entertainment and it's free to play, important feature to keep in mind.

Now, the game obviously has it's flaws. For instance, players tend to abuse cheesy tactics, and in the end you'll face more or less the same 5-6 same strategies. I've reached Platinum 1, close to reach Diamond, which is more or less when the game becomes challenging as far as i know, and yes every other match the opponent doesnt just play minions, they tailored a specifically abusing tactic which you can counter only if you have the specific card to do so. This makes the game feel a bit like rock-paper-scissors.

Still, for being free imo it entertains quite a lot, and btw i got the Crystal Elves DLC for free, sometimes they give out one DLC for free, yes. Considering all these factors, the game is quite good, you can rack up wins with only common and rare cards and you can compete without spending a dime, even though i bought the premium upgrade and i'm considering buying the all-masters upgrade.

MM has very little to do with Hearthstone, i must say. I've been playing Hearthstone since mid 2014, i have quite a big collection and quitted the game for good 5 months ago because it's an enormous money sink if you wanna keep up. The only aspect MM shares with Hs is the card collecting aspect, and in MM there are only like 200 cards (i already have 94, after just a week of gameplay) while Hs has thousands of cards. If you feel the collecting itch, MM can provide you with a fix for that.

This is the first review i write, but considering how much fun i've been having i deemed it necessary."
7403,Fun
7404,this game Is  pretty dang  good   i mean i  i did n think it would suck but i was proven worng

7407,"a good and intuitive game similar to clash royale
"
7408,its epic
7409,"Pros:

>Free-to-play.
>Not pay-to-win.
>Medium playerbase with an average of 1500 players at any given time.
>A lot of card variety hence the different variety of gameplay.
>Unique mix of tower defense & digital collectible card game.
>Gameplay can be both simple & complex.

Cons:

>Can get repetitive in terms of the gameplay itself however this would depend on the person.
>The strategic & tactical aspects are somewhat shallow.

With solid gameplay and free-to-play it is definitely worth a try at least.

Overall I give it a 7/10"
7410,gg
7411,"Took me 20 minutes to get hooked into the game. Purchased the 5bucks starter kit and got Colossus. GG game, love it"
7412,"After more than 100 hours of playing MM i have finally uninstalled it. MM is a great game to kill time, non pay to win and initially somewhat entertaining. But once you dwell deeper into the game, understand the mechanics and get better, it starts to feel dull and uninteresting pretty quickly.
Under gold rank you wil only be matched with bots and as soon as you climb up the ranked ladder you will increasingly encounter people that just abuse certain unbalances in the game, that do exist. Imagine to play exclusively against face hunter in hearthstone, you get the idea.
The really only positive highlight about MM is most ceratinlay that you can complete your card collection in no time thanks to the twitch drops and the massive free rewards and codes you get. But this is in no way a possible balance to the just absolutely non-rewarding feeling of winning a round.
What does it matter if i have all the cards and reach grandmaster with ease when it feels as rewarding as taking a successful shower or mawing the lawn. I would go as far and say, mawing the lawn sometimes has ignited somewhat of a feeling of joy in my heart, something MM wasn't able to do.

To summerise, MM is a great game to kill time that will pretty fast become as interesting as watching the grass grow (to use a last gardening metaphor here)"
7413,A deck builder plus tower defense.
7414,surprisingly fun
7415,"Nice simple, quick gameplay that is still complex enough to take some real skill to be good at. You cant make the cards more powerful, so the main difference between a good player and a bad one is knowledge of the cards. That also means its not pay to win at all, its just pay to experiment with more decks. Putting $30-$50 into the game is worth it for the extra fun you can get from experimenting with different decks.
I would recommend playing with a friend, the pre-made team battles are a lot more fun."
7416,game seems really fast paced team battles are awesome
7417,love very good game to pass some time!
7418,"pay to win
"
7419,"I bought this game when it was originally pay 2 play, I got absolutely nothing of value (a few common cards and an emote)? and now the game is unplayable in plat+ cause they released expensive, overpowered legendaries to make people pay if they want a chance. pretty fucking lame to BUY a game and then they make it free, give you nothing, and then release OP garbage cards to make the game totally unfun everytime u see them. Literally whoever on their dev team came up with the harbinger is a brainless shit-eating monkey. Lets make a super tank flying destroyer that knocks back anything that can fight it back to the other side of the bridge. big fun, much counter play. 
TL;DR don't play now, wait to see if they fix the massive amount of unbalanced bullshit."
7420,"Made by a small hardworking Danish team who really seems to want to just make fun games, and in my case they're hitting the mark. :)"
7421,"So just shy of 50hrs into this game and yep its enjoyable! Options for solo or team battles offers variety in game play and with plenty of card combinations and heroes you can spend hours tweaking your deck. Once you join a guild you can also get access to random cards that you might not have already, which is nice if you are a free to play player and have a limited deck available. 

Matchmaking is reasonably fair and quick and you can get up the leaderboards if you are willing to put the time in."
7422,Great game 9/10
7423,very enjoing
7424,Yes.
7425,this game is 100% better than raid shadow Legends
7426,"Just started and i am loving it, fun interactions, good quality and on top of that this varities of strategies u can put in are countless i guess. The only thing i fear is to find out that there is like this one OP combo that i should stick with cuzz its the best... if that will be the case i will leave but for now it doesnt look this way so i am gicing this  a thumbs up"
7427,"This game is simply fun and very friendly to newbies. You get codes for gifts via mail and they help to get a good collection of cards to start. Try it, I could not stop ... It's free and not pay to win. Timing and a good choice of cards is essential. You can decide of you want so spend money to get more bosses or special cards, but if oyu like the game it is ok to spend some money and support the developers imo ..."

7429,nice game
7430,Way better than Clash Royale!!
7431,Just found this game today and i'm enjoying myself
7432,fun and fast pace. times feel like it can be easiy and just rushing minions but there are counters to every set up and it just depends on how you enjoy playing!! keep up the good work!
7433,It's pretty fun :)

7441,"It's like Hearthstone, but less gay and lame."
7442,THIS GAME IS FOOKIN' FANTASTIC. IT TURNED ME INTA BRAVEHEART!
7443,It's a very smooth minion game. Sort of a combo of hearthstone and Clash Royale. Lot of fun so far
7444,"Great integration of elements *****! Great production value, *****! Open, approachable feel to this game. Nice looking variety for the long term ****.5!"
7445,"Very entertaining and fun to play. One of the cool features is all the help you receive from the start like; emails with tons of free stuff from the game creators, links to video's to help you out, and tip and deck build help just to name a few. I've never found a game like this before. A+++"
7446,This is a great game with great graphics and game mechanisms. The only thing I would add or change to the game would to be a time limit to how long a game could last.
7447,"Great game all around. Easy to understand, gets you immediately into playing (literally the initial cutscene goes into the tutorial), and has a great combination of progression, cards, and team play."
7448,good good good
7449,I LIEK IT
7450,"Put a few hours into this game so far and like it.
Nice kinda MOBA. I like the 2v2 and all the extra PvE challenges.
Devs seem to care about updates and fixes."
7451,Total waste of time ...
7452,"Watch my gameplay video here, and remember to try all your Steam games! https://youtu.be/E-KpVFc43Ug
Incredible gameplay that defies categorization, mixes deck building, strategy, moba, and tower defense in a unique way that creates a beautiful symphony of fun and competition. Minion Masters has a clear and logical meta that has had a natural evolution so far. Some cheese exists and you can get overpowered by more senior players without much skill involved just like any card based game, but once you accept that some losses are out of your control until you get a few key cards in your arsenal, it becomes a much better game and when you get to a point where you can hold your own against another player it feels so fulfilling to have slow, close games and total bumrush buttfucks all the same."
7453,"A very fun game... takes a sec to learn, but what I like there is no pay to play or pay to win... every card you can farm with ingame currency"
7454,Im enjoying the game so far
7455,"tl;dr: Extremely good example of a game that is 'easy to learn, but hard to master.' Very well thought out strategy game that has a satisfying card collection mechanic that doesn't leave you out of the meta by lack of cards. Furthermore the extra strategic elements offered by placing minions on the board instead of 'card hits card' makes the game very satisfying.

If you've never played Minion Masters or have no idea what it is, and you haven't played Crash Royale (which I hear is very similar), the game is a fairly unique execution of RTS merged with a card game. If this sounds remotely interesting, I highly recommend dropping an hour into the game and coming back to this review - No really, the review will make a lot more sense with more context for how the game plays, and if you find the gameplay at all intriguing then I assure you it is likely worth your time.

With that caveat out of the way, I love the game because it rewards quick, cool-headed thinking and an in-depth understanding of the win conditions of your master/deck, and the potential downsides of the deck and how to mitigate those threats. Very rarely do you feel like you get out-cheesed by your opponent, most losses I have feel like my deck has a unrecognized weakness or I made a poor strategic decision (I touch high plat or low-mid diamond every season, not 'super high' rank but it plays differently than the tiers before, where cheese strategies prevail over panic. If somebody puts down a cleaver or a colossus, DO NOT PANIC, just wait for the right moment to drop a swarm minion like scrat pack or skeletons and they melt. Your mileage WILL vary but you'll figure out the caveats soon enough). 

Furthermore, the card collection mechanics are extremely rewarding and I think they are well paced. Simply put, you get packs with a single card in them of random rarity, and depending on the rarity of the card you get shards. Shards are spent to buy new cards or to increase the 'glory' statistic on the card. Glory does nothing inside actual matches, but instead progress you through the battle pass more quickly. The battle pass is a free (but I highly recommend getting the purchased version) progression tool through the most recent expansion.

I could go on (seriously, I haven't covered some of the mayhem events, the new roguelike... thing they added, the exciting reworks of cards that comes with patches, and the incredible depth of complexity of each master), but overall the depth of this game combined with the generosity of the developers alone make me interested to keep on going. That doesn't mean the game is 100% perfect or doesn't have any problems - of course it has some problems - but it is still an excellent game in my opinion and is worthwhile to play.

In case you are still interested, here's some quick but possibly overwhelming advice: 
- The most recent expansion's cards are in the 'season tokens' which are most readily available through the battle pass. All other cards are obtained in the 'Power tokens'. 
- You get battle chests daily (can have 3 stacked up at once), and when you get 3 wins you open the chest, getting 10x the glory from the decks you used in those wins to contribute to your battle pass - this is the best way to make battle pass progress in my opinion.
- Join a guild, you get free cards and other bonuses for doing conquests. When you are more comfortable with deck building, you may experiment with using the 'guild conquest' cards to gain more progress for your guild.
- Join the mail list, sometimes you get free stuff in the form of steam DLCs and shop codes."
7456,FUN FUN FUN AND RELAXING
7457,"Yes, it's an unabashed ripoff of Clash Royale, but it's a ripoff that has a legitimate reason to exist. The biggest upgrade this game offers over the competition is that you can actually place units and structures precisely without clumsy phone controls, which makes this game much more enjoyable than the game it's ripping off. It also has a lot of cool ideas in the units and deck building which you won't find in other games of the genre, such as wild cards which allow you to place up to 2 duplicate cards in your deck."
7458,Very fun and involves a lot of strategy.  It's not P2W which is huge.
7459,free dlc
7460,dont interupt me when im playing a game
7461,"[h1] Fun gameplay, slightly marred by loot-box RNG[/h1]

Pros:

First let me say this is a fun, fairly well balanced game. It's basically a 2-lane Clash Royale style game, but the mechanics and skill elements are more advanced. 

Cons:

The RNG loot box mentality makes it very difficult to spend real cash. I was really enjoying this game and wanted to support it financially. But I was struggling to find a way to spend money that I felt good about. I finally settled on the All Masters DLC ($20) which grants you access to all Masters. Masters are similar to characters in HearthStone. They all have unique powers and when you run out of hit-points, game over. (Unlike Heathstone, this game is real-time, not turn based, and once summoned, the minions are autonomous.)

There is only ranked play. So if you care about rank (and the associated rewards), creating secondary decks and experimentation is discouraged due to the design. There are no ""sand-boxes"" to test and experiment with new decks.

If you are a skilled player, its pretty easy to get to a high rank. But as you approach the end-game (Master/Grand-Master), the decks you face all become pretty similar as players clone successful decks. However, if you are not lucky enough to have been blessed by the RNG gods, you might find yourself stalling out as decks beat you that you cannot duplicate. Like many Freemium games, the pricing strategy is targeted at whales. So buying stuff with gems (the in-game currency) is very steep.

Conclusion:

I still play this game, just because its fun. I'm starting to taper off, because I'm not about to spend absurd cash for cards just to advance to Grand Master. But if you enjoy this type of game, give it a try. I was a good 30-50 hours in before pay-to-win even crossed my mind. I"
7462,great game like a mix of hearthstone and clash royal
7463,"Just a fun little game to tinker with.  Matches dont last very long, only had one go over 7 minutes.  Simple and enjoyable"
7464,Quick games ... enough randomness that even uber players can occasionally be taken down by newcomers with weaker decks.   Epic competition at higher levels.
7465,Easy to get into. Jump right in and play. Customization of decks.
7466,"Decent customization,
OK gameplay, tho the concept is more unique than most games.

Unfortunately pay to win/FOMO mechanics turn this game super ugly.

Total waste of every penny I spent. Don't recommend this game ... it's a whale hunter."
7467,"So far I'm liking this game.  It's reminiscent of a mobile game in how it's constructed, so you can expect similar concepts.  Worth a shot."
7468,"A fun and cute competitive deck building RTS tower defense game. Easy to get into and collect cards with bountiful amount of opportunity for newer players. Art style is very appealing and rag doll physics when eliminating enemies is hilarious.

I recommend giving this game a try!

 PS: I wouldn't so much call this a MOBA though."
7469,never played it
7470,this is  a really fun game quick matchs and  easy progressen not too p2w can still play and compeate with out spending any money great fun game
7471,"Good game..but not for me. Not a fan of p2w lootboxes. Lootboxes should be for cosmetics only. monthly subscriptoin fee in the form of a battlepass..ya no thank you. Thought i'd give this another shot, but after seeing that I'm not remotely interested. back to hidden it goes."
7472,"I'm a huge fan of card battle games. This one is by far one of my favorites, and it's super addicting. You have so many cards to choose from and you can continually unlock more as you play which means if you're getting bored, you can just change up how you battle. You also get to choose from quite a few different minion masters who all have their own special abilities. I highly suggest trying it out, I mean it's free!"
7473,is fun starts entertaining and doesnt let down
7474,"very fun and gets u hooked in and u dont have to buy to win
"
7475,"Pretty fun fast paced game, i like how you can customize your decks and its not pay to win which is the best part. I can easily see this game become an e-sports game in the future. It def has the potential."
7476,Fun game to pass the time.
7477,"So far the battles can get very crazy and fun, i have come to enjoy it quite a bit in my short time playing."
7478,really fun blend of strategy and deckbuilding
7479,"very interesting game!
"
7480,It's so fun and ridiculously addictive.
7481,good
7482,"its basically a Clash Royale clone. While it seems well made the menu is busy and confusing. after 11 or so hours played i still dont know what to do with the shit i unlocked. I used kripparrian's deck when the game 1st came out, but now it can barely get out of silver rank. gameplay is a pretty fun for a brainless time waster,"
7483,"Pretty epic game so far. and free to play you cant argue with that
"
7484,Pretty fun game
7485,Just another pay to win platform...
7486,It's a fun and casual game that you can pick up at any time and experience the feeling of victory.
7487,"Very unexpectedly epic.  Never played this type of game before so was quite surprised to get into it and have so much fun.

Game eases you in, but, very quickly you can see it takes time to get good.  So many ways to combine minions and the strongest not always the best.

Give this lovely experience a shot :-)"
7488,its fun but not when i lose
7489,It's just fun.
7490,"Im not sure why Im liking it, but its addicting and good ;P"
7491,"too many cheaters and too many liars that say your just too stoopid lol i find that certain games u are against people who are hacking into your system and just talking shit just to fuel their demented minds, if it was truly based on skill then why are there so many glitches in one game but not the next game, this is where i find that people are controlling the out come of the battle before it even begins, you can tell me lies but u can hack into my replays and see for urself how they have managed to mana spam with impossible mana spaming i know their are ways to get mana but not early in the game its impossible and yes i know u can save mana but also at the same time they are sending out troops that are 5 mana then able to send out a 9 mana in the time that we take the bridge back straight away, so its impossible this is why you need to fix ranks and also with ranks give better gold in different ranks, so its not pointless to have a rank, i also find that there are people making names up and this is when all the cheating happens, just to destroy your chances of becoming a grand master, its just a repeative cycle of them controlling all outcomes , its truly a trolls paradise not totally skill based, if you want to waste time with people always saying come watch me stream and tell you your stupid cause you cant understand basic reading well then this is your game lol also when cheating becomes so obvious they kick u out and also they cancel my report they troll u and then try make u seem like u started all the trouble and then try get there friends to report on u so u become the one who gets questioned even thou all u gotta do is scroll up and see how they act over n over and when they get caught out they try to act normal lol they love to say block to the whole crowd like it meant something but the point is they went out of there way to act stupid and try act like they did a deed lol talk about shit kickers in your community buddy"
7492,"It's free. It's not a gacha game. You can play it and play it and play it. For free. And if you want you can buy a battle pass. Or not. You can rewards the Devs by throwing them some coffee money. A jar of own brand or a premium coffee from a well known high street outlet, the kind that rots your teeth. Because money gets you skins, it gets you more exp per battle. But it doesn't make battles easier.
That

7493,Just started playing this game but it's super addictive.
7494,just love this
7495,"Great game, I've been playing this game from the start.  The devs are awesome, constantly updating, tweaking the game, throwing out freebies all the time (seriously sign up for their newsletter).  Its free to play but its definitely not pay to win at all.  Heck one of my favorite builds is pretty cheesy and its all standard cards (not legendaries) and works with any of the masters.  

If you don't want to spend any money on the game at all they do give you different masters each week you can use for free so that keeps the game interesting instead of always using the same one or two masters you own.

The lastest update Adventure mode is a blast.  Its Minion Masters but with a nice Rougelike feel to it.  If you think you'd be interested in it give it a download its free to check out and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
7496,Great game for the frst hour
7497,I like the mana rush!
7498,"Great Game! so much fun to play with friends
"
7499,"Hard at first, but now it is a great game
"
7500,"It's a solid game.  Minor strategy.  It involved spending a lot of time or money to be able to 'chase the meta' so to speak.  Overall I'd recommend messing around with it.

Issues are there are clearly imbalanced cards that all the top tier folks seem to take.  But they do actively look into balance, which is something that is nice to sere."
7501,"The good thing it's very cheap, in a sense you don't have to spend eternity finishing your perfect deck. Game always throws card and resources at you, and you can afford to experiment with different playstyles easily. Also it's very addictive, the rounds are fast, 1-3 mins average. So you jump in more and more. Bad thing, its very addictive, so i'm moving on so i don't think hundreds of hours into it :)"
7502,So far a very positive f2p experience and game generally. Will update after more hours
7503,"shit be like ""oh no!"" and then it be like""syke, gotcha bitch"""
7504,Fun game! Not been playing long but really addictive!
7505,its funny

7510,
7511,One of the best free games around!

7513,Good content
7514,"It's no Art of War: Red Tides, but it's still pretty good."
7515,Pay to play
7516,Quick and fun gameplay. Not complicated. There's even decent strategy involved.
7517,Fun and easy to play.
7518,"Very good and addictive game, try it and get suck in :D"
7519,"Simple, fun deck-building MOBA hybrid with light strategy. Quick matches make it easy to play for a short or long amount of time. Would recommend. :)"

7523,"Really fun game. Fast, action-filled rounds make it easy to play for a couple games or a couple hours."
7524,"Cannot say how fun and easy this game is. I have amassed a decent card collection without paying a cent on the game and have had SOOO much fun.

New updates and cards regularly, fairly well balanced, great counters, high risk/ high reward cards, and I would stress that matches are fast to join and never last more than 10 mins (at most).

I just cannot recommend this enough. Shout out to the devs for such a great job."
7525,good game
7526,Great game!
7527,Great game has a tower defense feel mixed with offense.
7528,"real cool game . just what i wanted .strategy + lots of cards to choose from + online multiplayer.
"
7529,it is verry good
7530,A Thumb up from me :)
7531,fun AF
7532,Fun and addicting game. Easy enough to pick up
7533,good
7534,"Simple, yet complex. Endless entertainment and strategies to explore."
7535,its fun but really boring
7536,Entertaining
7537,"Its fun and really good, probably more fun with friends"
7538,fun
7539,"some how stumbled across this game in my inventory, no idea how it got there but thought i'd give it a go.

never really enjoyed these types of games but this one has got me hooked.
the games are quick, fast paced and can turn around at any point.
you can jam a quite a few games in a short period if you don't have a lot of time to game

after a couple of hours i found the game is F2P, so i messaged a few mates on and we teamed up for some matches.

would be a minion master again/10
"
7540,Fun game and easy to play.
7541,"easy to pick up but hard to master, lots of different strategies and game types mean you can keep trying different things to keep your interest without being pay to play"
7542,"can u work on the textures other then that its amazing\
"
7543,"The game is very fun. there are several game mods: 1v1 2v2 expeditions(which i have no clue about as I haven't tried it much) and many more. 
The game is very similar to clash royal but still has its own appeal. 
This game is very enjoyable and addictive. the devs update the game regularly and give the players many free gifts for staying loyal to their game and following them via the email.
There is no way to tell if you gonna enjoy it or not unless you give it a shot.
why dont you give it a go? its free :)"
7544,They make it very easy to get into. Seems like a game that'll be hard to master. Perfect
7545,Very smart game. Nice gameplay
7546,This is a very good game. It is not pay to win and actually has the least amount of RNG of any of the recent strategy game I have played lately. It should be way more popular then it is. I would recommend you give it a try.
7547,Pretty solid
7548,"How should I put this, pay to win, and basically zero strategy game, the further you get into this game the less strategic play there is and the more ""powerful"" reign.  Typically to most card like games the clear advantage exist to those that either spend money or an absurd amount of time playing it.

It should also be noted that they use a lot of BS color coding and random mechanics to make you think you are getting something worth wild, the power token system that ""grants"" you a card bonus quality might as well read you can only get  this one quality while excluding you from the better ones.  If this mechanic was ment to help you then it should allow the card pack to give you a minimum quality card but still allow the highest quality to appear with in the roll, if that is not the case then those higher level cards are not showing up near enough."
7549,best game ever made
7550,Pretty interesting card game.
7551,GRET GAME FUN AND EASY TO LEARN
7552,"Nice combo of animations, strategy and blowing stuff up"
7553,They gave me free DLC.
7554,"Fun with friends, not so much fun with randos"
7555,mhm yes
7556,".
"
7557,"Good game, nice depth, almost no pay-to-win. Better version of CLash of Clans."
7558,"One of those free-to-play games that randomly showed up in my Steam Inventory that I thought was just one of those garbage indy games that wasn't worth my time installing. I was wrong. I looked up some gameplay and decided to give the game a shot. At the time I am writing this review, I have only been playing for a little over an hour and I have to say that it is very addicting and I can see myself playing it for a long time. It has your typical freemiun options, like getting yourself started for $5 to get some gems but honestly it isn't needed. The hero you start with and the speed of your progression is satisfying enough for you to keep playing without you feeling like you have to open your wallet. It is a lot like League of Legends and Hearthstone where you can spend ""rubies"" (which cost real money) to unlock a champion permanently, and help you open chests and craft cards. There is also a Fortnite-like Battle Pass. The paid options are there, but not needed. Very enjoyable thusfar and looking forward to playing more!"
7559,"Didn't think I'd like the game too much, but it's actually really fun.  Couple that with very generous devs and you have the workings of a great game."
7560,"i just playin this game today, and u just got so hook up , idk why, but this game is so addicting , careful guys, you may not see sun tomorrow"
7561,SDFVSVDD
7562,"This game actually got me surprised. I got it through the Xmas holiday for free and I am about 15 hrs in by now. It is quite addictive and challenging at the same time. The graphics are nothing world changing but the design make it likeable for bot kiddos and grown ups. It has a great variety of cards and heroes and the developers are actually spending time working on their title. If I would need to say something on the downside it would be the price of the micro transactions. I get it guys, it is a collectible card game, you should purchase the cards but not at random for rubies. When I am paying for something I am expecting to know what I will get for my money.

Easy to learn, hard to master! Bit grindy if you're not willing to pay, what is absolutely reasonable with this game.

If the developers would publish it on IOS or Android it would definitely be a massive hit as I can imagine people spending more time playing this on a mobile rather then a PC or console."
7563,Love it so far.
7564,Great game unless you go up against people who spent tons of money and have multiple legends and stuff. Mana frenzy ruins the game.
7565,"I see a friend playing this game all the time, and looked it up. Honestly, it didn't appeal to me at all. I gave it a shot, and it's pretty good the first two hours. Seems simple, but fast paced. From what I've read, there is no P2W, and I've been taking on experienced looking players with just the starter gear.

Once I get into the game a bit more, and understand the different cards, I'll update this review. 

Not a bad enjoyable game. More points for it not being toxic."
7566,Enjoying it so far. Very good game. I havent lost yet. Looking forward to some real challenge!
7567,"Good strategy game, imagine clash royale but with significantly more depth, and more interesting cards/builds."
7568,it's a chill game :)
7569,"Fun game for anyone who likes Tower Defence games and does not seem like a P2W as you can just grind but... its really unbalanced... especially 2v2. Games last under 10 minutes but if you fuck up in the first minute... your fucked. Not to say you cant win but its a upwards struggle and can be sometimes fun coming back and winning with like 20 HP left. Or..... your teammate just quits spamming angry faces because they cant take losing halfway through the game or maybe they they start up a game and then go AFK. Or if your are really lucky your teammate will ping crosses on the screen after you put down a card to say that was a shit move instead of actually using the ping system to coordinate attack and defence.

Like i said its a good game but its let down by 2 things, balance and a community of tards. The Admins are also known for harsh banning but ive been ok so far as i keep myself to myself. Game pulls you in and you enjoy it but then you start to notice these issues. I wouldnt even bother with it....

Its addictive.

...but so is smoking.

Edit: So some guy in chat called me an idiot so i called him a cuck, another guy says ""someone Ban him"" and 5 secs later im Banned... yep.... Community is toxic as well as has incompetent Moderators.

Fuck knows where they get these Mods from but the Devs don't seem to care about balance or how their player base is treated. Its actually quite shocking, 

Avoid this game."
7570,It's just a satisfying game. Well crafted.
7571,"This Game is really fun! If youre wanting to play a quick game, This is the one. Queues are fast, Fast game play."
7572,eh yeah
7573,"I enjoyed the game before the recent expansion dlc that was released. Adventure mode is a hard mode slot machine gamble, More frustrating than fun. Not enough events going. The times im in the game they either are not active or the events are 2-3 days away which is lame since I am there playing and in 2-3 days im busy doing something else. So its rare I get to play them. The season spins for new cards are rigged af. 

I literally get the same 3 cards every time. Ranked games are fun.....1v1 that is, Random team varies tho. Fun to play with friends. Its free to play so give it a go it might be your thing. It was my thing for awhile but I have not been happy with game as of late."
7574,"Easy to get into, tricky to master, and amazingly fun at any skill level. With each match being in the range of a mere 1-5 minutes, this is an great game for people with strategic minds and erratic schedules to pick up and set down at will.

This game filled the nostalgic void in my heart left behind by [i]Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds[/i] way back in the day, and my only complaint is I wish I'd discovered this game sooner."
7575,"Just a great game with simple enough mechanics to learn but complicated enough to require skill to continue ranking up and offering varied levels of achievement
"
7576,Now that Atlas Reactor closed this game is the perfect subtitute. Recommended.
7577,tier 1 videogame
7578,"Game is fun
"
7579,"I am not usually one for casual games, but minion masters strikes a fun balance between being casual and competitive.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just sit back in their chair and chill but if you are looking to find a hardcore RTS this probably wont scratch the itch."
7580,Very nice game ;)
7581,ΓΑΜΕΙ
7582,"Terrible pay to win game. Unless you have the PERFECT deck, expect to loose 75% of your matches."
7583,"good free game collect cards to build up a deck of minions and send them to war, also level up and gain in-game rewards and games can be fast paced or long depending on your style of play 8/10"
7584,its a cool game. it's easy to get into.
7585,Just writing something because Steam wouldn't let me do a blank review
7586,"It's a very clean, polished version of Clash Royale.  No massive pay to win wall that I've seen yet and I'm consistently satisfied!"
7587,trash game. broken mechanics.
7588,good game really fun if your bored in sometimes
7589,You can totally F2P this. The climb is really grindy but you should 100% try it out. I mean its free so just go for it.
7590,yes
7591,Cool. Easy to pick up. No pay wall. 10/10
7592,it's ok
7593,"Great game, i enjoy the deck building and the 3 d lane pushing"
7594,"Good game, not poisonous F2P like others as far as I can tell. Adventure mode RULES also"
7595,Very easy to start playing and trial and error.  Not overwhelming...
7596,lit
7597,"Clicking to get new items every time, is tiring"
7598,This game is great it requires strategy and lot of concentration it is really fun.
7599,"This game is very underrated and is literally the 100% free-to-play game with combined elements from MOBA, deckbuilder game very similiar to Clash Royale on mobile in terms of gameplay. Matches are short usually around 2 to 5 minutes meaning you have much more play sessions and each card is very unique and there are a lot of strategies and deck archetypes you can try out. It is a casual game with a semi-competitive scene and tournaments if your into that as well. This is by far one of the best Clash Royale type games out there and what makes is great is that you don't even have to spent a dime on this game. I suggest playing with friends in 2v2 or dueling them in a 1v1 as it's always more fun to play with friends."
7600,Ok
7601,good fun
7602,listen you smart people i want this game on my phone please sir i love it i enjoy it
7603,Realmente entretenido.
7604,Amazing development crew and game!
7605,Great game
7606,Fun strategy game. Easy to learn.
7607,"I like the deck building, it is rewarding"
7608,if you like clash royal you will love this game i got it cause the dlc was free for a limited time tryed it later and loved it i only have 5 hours cause i have other games and school but really ducking liked it
7609,"its a good way to pst the time in a good way is fun 
"
7610,Very fun
7611,It's a nice break from the stressful games. Chill and Master
7612,"Fun, easy to start, but lots of options and different strategies available."
7613,"I'm digging the fast paced matches. (I didn't receive additional compensation, this game is free to play for everyone across multiple platforms.)"
7614,"Pretty fun. Does not feel pay to win. Games are quick, and there are plenty of different strategies."
7615,Fun game.  The pay to win mechanics kind of bring it down though.
7616,aaa
7617,"Edit:  I am now turning this into a negative review... while I still think this is a great game, month long seasons pass are way too short and do nothing but promoting mind-numbing grinds... since the company has made this change, I went from a regular monetary seasonal subscriber to a non-contributing subscriber...  News flash, there are no seasons in real life that only last a month!"
7618, awesome game
7619,"...Well I'll be damned, this is actually really, really good - And not (really) P2w at all.

It seems very simple at first- And it is quite simple. You gain mana which you use to summon units on the playing field and then they essentially use their AI to battle and try and destroy your opponents base. As you play, you begin to learn the synergies and tactics and come to realize that its actually quite deep and skill based.

I ended up buying the premium service (double gold winnings and 30% XP boost for life ) and I would say that this is the only thing you will need since all the card sand everything else are slowly unlocked through play... This would be the only (debatable) P2w mechanic and TBH once you've played for 20+ hours and decide you are going to continue- Purchasing this seems to be like something you would 'want ' to do...And if you decide not to, you can still play at a slower progression (which doesnt really matter since matches are scaled)

anyhow- Great game. I didnt expect it to be good but grabbed it to kill some time and ended up finding a game I will continue to play ."
7620,Great game
7621,fun game
7622,fun and easy to learn!
7623,Surprisingly addictive fun!
7624,you will enjoy this game if you play
7625,"It is really addictive! Not only that, it doesn't just throw you in the game clueless, it has a tutorial that is not boring at all! Keep up the good work"
7626,"I have enjoyed my time with this game. To me it seems very balanced and when you get beaten really badly you can examine the other player's deck to see where you went wrong and try to strengthen your own deck for a future fight. I like the animations and the graphics style and it plays very very well, frame rate stays solid. So far I've not had any crashes. I have even enjoyed the single player content. Finally the prices do not seem crazy for the various currencies in the game and so far I haven't HAD to spend money but I did as I wanted a specific card. It definately does not seem pay to win to me."
7627,"Minion Masters plays very similarly to Clash Royale for Android/iOS. That's not necessarily a bad thing, however. Minion Masters separates itself from Clash Royale in the form of a larger emphasis on deck-building mechanics that more closely resembles traditional card games like Yugioh. For example, there are summon effects for various cards. If you enjoy Clash Royale but wish it was slightly more like traditional card games (and also love the idea of not having to deal with a level system), Minion Masters is definitely for you."
7628,"Good fun, and slightly addictive. This type of game usually isnt my thing, but I love it. Some things could be explained better, but maybe it's just me who didnt take the time to actually thoroughly read everything, cause... Here for the gaming."
7629,nice game and fun and easy to learn :D
7630,"One of the best card playing multiplayer games around. And you don't need to pay to win. So many different game options as well and very strategic, Some of your decks may work for pvp or might be better for group pvp or just single player, A lot of variety and strategy involved."
7631,"
It's s'alright.  Just started playing so yep."
7632,"5/5 Would Recommend

Essentially clash royale but has was more aspects; including clans and team battles. I just started playing and I've been on for hours."
7633,worth it
7634,Such a great game!!! 50+ hours so far and not bored at all. Me and my brother play co-op against other players. So much fun!
7635,It is fun and quick to learn plus it fun to play with or against friends and family.
7636,"Lots of fun. Pretty to look at. Cards are cool, interesting, and quirky. Two thumbs up."
7637,"top game 
"
7638,quality game newbie to it but so far looks great
7639,its fun so far
7640,"Really strait forward game with 2 lane tug of war to push. Similar game are fun on mobile and this one is a bit more balanced with improved graphic VS their mobile counterpart. 

Fun game to waste some time but nothing to take competitively serious."
7641,"Not cost gated at all. Any legendary card can be easily rock/paper/sci by common cards. eg colossus beaten by stun lancer or any flying unit. Very fun and the best thing is that games last 1-5 minutes each, avg 3 mins. So easy to have fun if you don't have gobs of time."
7642,easy to play
7643,Not bad...
7644,"OMG! This game is so much fun and addicting. 

I just wish there was 3v3 and 4v4 as that would be so much fun and chaotic. That would also make guild runs better as you can team up with more guidies."
7645,Quick PvP
7646,"It's pretty simple and easy to get into, plus it's free."
7647,"Dablitfamfoot

7648,Simple but deep in strategy and gameplay.
7649,good times
7650,LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT.... GOLD!!!!!.....   FUK OFF.   STUPID ANNOUNCER KUNT.
7651,for a free game it is really rather good i like the game play so thats a bonus
7652,really grindy at first.. but lots of fun
7653,So far its a fun little game.
7654,It's a fun game that reminds me of Clash Royale on my phone.
7655,Its very fun and easy to pick up.
7656,"Good game and fun. Also, easy to teach my 5 year old so they can play too"
7657,"easy to start playing, but tough to master? or some shit"
7658,fun time passer
7659,This game is good and easy to pick up and play.
7660,NICE
7661,"a game for ppl with no dreams 
like 60 card total have fun, take a week getting few... booring"
7662,I have only played it for an hour and this game already has me hooked. May post a follow up review when i have more hours in the game.
7663,"Excellent F2P game that uses the model correctly. Easy to learn, but hard to master game-play with a ton of different game modes for whatever strikes your fancy."
7664,"Fun game, no toxicity and negative attitudes. Players are respectful and sportsmanlike."
7665,"Discovered this game today and so far really like it a lot. Not sure how far I will get without spending (too much) money, but so far - great fun!"
7666,good  my Hamburger ate it and then black more than white ...HALO
7667,"Easy to play, short games to fill up an extra 5 minutes. All in all really good free to play game"
7668,It's pretty good.
7669,this game is very additive...LOVE IT.
7670,"One of the best free to play games ever made.  Matches range from 1-7 minutes; quick to put up and put down, little commitment.  They are so generous at first when you're leveling up; chests give you random cards and are typically so fucked lol.  I have opened 40+ packs for the ""Sand Wars"" update and never got a legendary, let alone Wreckinator (which I wanted, and was nerfed :*(  )  The Mountain Shaper event has come out now, so old Legendaries are half off, like Wreckinator, but the new cards are FULL PRICE.  To summarize, I haven't spent a dollar on this game, but damn have I been tempted to!!   Every time you level up from playing any kind of game, you earn less and less...... Eventually, the grind becomes disgusting; you want specific cards that are OP, but holy shit do they take long hours of gaming, on a game where matches last 1-7 minutes.  SOOPER FUN GAME, but the drop off is bad when you get late game.  You can spend around $10 and get over 40 packs lmao at my state, and it shows/tempts you with the rewards"
7671,"One would think this is a copy of another game.
But those people... to put it simple way...
They are wrong.
Grab a friend and hop into a gamemode called team battle.
You will know what i mean!
9/10 would recommend"
7672,"fast combos, deck build. mana on a timer. you have to think about how to push, and what the other people are doing. its fun to put together an deck idea around how things combo. like procing rage to trigger or decks around the masters power. like what could come back to life etc
you can win enough gems to not need to spend $ if your good, and the daily quest are a fun goal to hit.
a lot of this games fun would result from the people you play with, as the AI lvls are too easy, but out side of the top players, most people dont think at all: muti player is a mixed bag. a lot of people just copy the top players decks without understanding why the deck was made.
you get a lot people who will jump in a game with nothing but high cost decks. 555667889 kind of madness and then get mad at you for not covering for there bad build.
the worst opening is the crossbow guild, or the Lord Sentinel Thelec are the worst cards to open with that you will see others use despite them needing a buffer in front, for some reason spamming a Living Statue to defend when base is under attack is a thing right now when they could play something to attack whats hitting, stuff like that."
7673,good game
7674,So far so good.
7675,"Great game, like a better version of clash royale"
7676,"Its free to play.

Somehow,
its actually free to play,
done right"
7677,pretty nice game got hooked quickly
7678,"It's a fast paced deck builder in the same vein as Magic. Unlike magic however mana is gained by a ticker and the battle plays out in real time and is not turn based. The strategies and deck styles are otherwise very similar and enjoyable to build. The match queue moves fairly quickly and only really slows down at higher platinum rankings. There are also team and guild matches, quests, adventure paths and challenges that are usually pvp match ups. Add in profile exp, rewards and seasonal rankings and you get a f2p worth it's weight. As the final bonus there are very few advertisements for payed content and they are almost all exclusively in the market window allowing the player to blissfully ignore them at will."
7679,Clash Royal booted...good game
7680,good game
7681,Great card game! Love leveling up the cards and collecting master skins. Fun battles!
7682,Not a bad minion game.
7683,Very fun to play have lots of tactic that u can choese to play vs other online people keep i tup
7684,Awesome! Better then clash royale
7685,"Just absolutely addictive game. Love it. Perfect system, perfect FUN!"
7686,It's a fun game. Ideal when you have so little time to play game.
7687,"It's an excellent game. First time reviewing, easy to pick up and play. Has depth as well. F2P mechanics well implemented"
7688,fun game. easy to pick up and play
7689,great game
7690,This game is easy to pick up and addicting! Def.  worth giving it a shot.

7696,Awesome!
7697,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE
7698,"pl;, po"
7699,"boil my eggs, daddy"
7700,Tower and card battle game merged into one.  What's not to like?
7701,"I really like this game.  Easy to play hard to (minion) master.
"
7702,Perfectly fusing card and moba Games. Te team fight is great. give it a try folks :)
7703,Its very fun to play i recomend this to play
7704,It's good.
7705,it's fun! Try it out!
7706,"Great game, simple premise. It's like Magic the Gathering and Starcraft had a baby. I mostly play draft. I bought the into pack that includes a Battle Pass for $5 and I can draft until the end of time. Going to get over 40 hours out of this F2P game that isn't pay to win. Highly recommended."
7707,"This game lets you do so many awesome things! Like

- zapping flying rats
- slapping vomiting dragons
- rain down daggers on unsuspecting armies of elves
- throw stones on walking, metal death contraptions of doom and destruction
- etc.

Also very, very f2p friendly and fun."
7708,FUN GAME
7709,good game
7710,Nice game at first i wasnt sure about it i mean by looking at video but i really enjoyed it after playing .....card lover will love the game.
7711,If you like Clash Royale yyou will love this game i really like the hero class and the importance of objetive control of the bridges.
7712,Very nice!
7713,"Very fun strategy game that's not hard to learn. Everything has counters, even the most powerful 10 mana unit can be killed by a 3 or 4 mana unit, if it's the right type and placed correctly. You earn all the cards from lootboxes but you earn lootboxes with free currency that's pretty easy to obtain, so all you need is time in order to collect all of the cards. 
The only negatives I have is that the game does not support native fullscreen, it's just borderless windowed. And on top of that, game crashes pretty often on my laptop.
Other than that it's a great game!"
7714,"Seriously a great game, having loads of fun playing it. 
Quite balanced, I hope it continues like this. Recommended ++"
7715,.
7716,good game
7717,Great game
7718,Basically Clash Royal PC with loot boxes
7719,BERRY COOL GAME
7720,"very fun, great way to spend a relaxing night"
7721,"Some very critical points here.
* Mana for some cards is incredibly imbalanced.
* The AI does not have its priorities straight in any way shape or form. From a games developers perspective the AI is sloppy,
* Some ""masters"" are imbalanced
* Microtransaction pricing is questionably high but some are reasonable.
* Match making is completely f*cked though

Don't get me wrong the game is good and I recommend the premium and all masters upgrade but once you get gold rank onwards you'll encounter numerus pay2win people and a whole load of smurfs.

Came across one fellow, he was wood rank but he told me he was grand master but let himself lose to lower his rank again. I 1v1'ed him and his cards indicate this.

After extensive playtime bugs are incredibly noticeable mainly with the targeting; hell sometimes Ratbo's ""More Dakka"" doesn't even work after being casted"
7722,mint
7723,"good game. this game is very similar with hearthstone, but this minion is moving."
7724,Easy to get into. Fun Strategy PvP.
7725,"EXCELLENT! No pay-to-win, fair matchmaking system."
7726,nice to see a game like this that is not pay to win
7727,This is a fun game to play during a quick down time; each match lasts only between 1-9 minutes. It is a unique game play genre that is like a mix between a CCG and a tower defense. I like that is has a 2 player teams mode where you and a friend can battle other teams.
7728,I love this game.
7729,Fun Game
7730,"Amazing to play with a friend! the combinations are limitless!
10/10 would play again , no joke
"
7731,fun and simple
7732,"its a fun time killer, but im pretty sure you only get so good. but id give it a try if you are on edge about it"
7733,"this is one of the best type of games i have ever played and i think there should be a few updates be other than that well done keep up :)
"
7734,cool game!
7735,"straightforward casual deckbuilding, pretty fun, although grindy if you're set on using a particular set of masters"
7736,Very interesting concept! I enjoyed it!
7737,good game
7738,"its a fun game to waste time on.
not too hard and people who dont wanna put money in arent held back too much... i am climbing without much trouble so far but we will see beyond gold/plat how that goes."
7739,"It is quick, it is fun the announcer is hilarious and the art style is great. I have no idea what I am doing but the game is an enjoyable experience."
7740,"a fun game, dont play it if you are drunk like i do lol. not far in the game but it is interesting and so far is has the feel of a game that has many options. can you tell im drunk? no? its because im spellchecking like a true legend. i am the epitome of minion masters, i will rise to the top. there are none who can conquer or rise above my drunk a$$ i am god and all those who play this game shall obey me. if you disobey me there will be a fine of 3 cheesepuffs AND YOU WILL PAY THAT FINE, IF YOU ARENT WILLING TO SACRIFICE THE CHEESEPUFFS I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!!!!!!  GIVE ME MY PUFFS YOU HO HO HO. in conclusion i am THE PUFF GOD!!!!!!"
7741,pay to win
7742,Good game
7743,Tug-o-war style card game.  Reminds me of the good old star craft custom map days but more well polished.
7744,really well done and a lot of fun.
7745,Really creative idea with a fun art style. Simple to start playing and it looks like there's enough complexity to continue learning and digging in.
7746,Great game lots of fun with a team mate . graphically pleasing and get good rewards for playing . very addictive
7747,"Great game! It's so fun building your deck and deciding which card is best for your play style and strategies. It's also fun spinning tokens (Which get you a random card of a select few) hoping that you can get a good one. And that's just the menu!! 
There are a multitude of game modes that put another twist on the tower defence game. This game is also good with friends. You can destroy.... I mean have a friendly fight with your friends or work together to fight others. 

10/10
"
7748,fun game
7749,Great and fun Game so far! I really like it and can reccomend it :)

7756,Extremely addictive experience.
7757,"get this shit off my library wtf
"
7758,I cant even remember that I played  this
7759,"This game proves that you don't have to have the best cards to win, all you need is a good strategy and enjoying the game."
7760,It's better than any other game of this type. Needs more masters though.
7761,I thoroughly enjoy this fast paced game. Easy to learn and super fun!
7762,A better TFT
7763,gud gayme
7764,"this game is LIT!

7767,So far its pretty neat.
7768,"its like clash royale but on pc so its better?
"
7769,"Super fun game, games take less than 5 mins. Highly recommend!"
7770,possibly the best game ever created by man
7771,Clash Royal but without the shitty mobile elements. Also has slight MOBA elements (XP gained during battle for maintaining bridge control). Pretty gud.
7772,"epic very cool

7774,"Great business model, fun game. Thumbs up from me"
7775,Very fun and gets alot of attention
7776,"Game rocks. Fun to play, fun to strategize. F2P rewards are great"
7777,yes
7778,"Seems fun. A little early to tell. Will update if my opinion changes.

Ok, about 30-40 hrs in.


Here's the jist:

I've made it to diamond tier, and watched a few streamers... many of whom are in this tier, so I'll get that out of the way. It's NOT a complicated game, very much rock paper scissors with deck types. I'll play games where I stomp my opponent in less than a minute and games where I can not fathom how my opponent drops 50+ mana of creatures (early in match) in less than 10 seconds. 

Is there hacking? I don't know for sure... if there is it's relatively rare... seems more like the game is glitchy in very subtle ways. I've been in matches where I had near-mana frenzy mana generation for NO REASON early in match, and I've had the same happen for my opponents... seems like games internal timer is either buggy or deliberately does this to make the game more exciting (feature not a bug complex). 

Back to the streamers. The game is DESPERATE for an esports community. To the point where WATCHING A STREAMER IS MORE REWARDING THAN PLAYING. No joke. Watch a streamer for a few hrs, you get WAY more rewards than you'd get playing, even winning every match. The game isn't too horribly grindy and does have a nice balance of reward for playing 15-30 min a day vs dropoff for playing all day every day. That said, the amount of codes, free stuff, handouts, prizes, etc in the streaming environment is just silly. At least until there's a picture in picture feature that lets you interact with streams WHILE STILL PLAYING. Otherwise, it's a game that rewards you not to play.


That said, the ""expansion"" bundles are a quick jolt of power... basically giving you a hard to get (Legendary) card and a few much easier to get cards for $15ish. Not really worth the asking price, really should have some rubies or a big stack of shards attached to them if you ask me. 

Shards are not handled well. Very hard to get until you own most cards (Unlike say hearth where you disassemble cards, this game automatically does so for all cards... but only after you have the maximum allowable count of them). Costs a fortune to make the rarer cards. I'd say close to a month of logging in, doing the daily, and logging out to get the 2k needed for a simple legendary (Pretty sure I've seen as high as 6k needed for some). 

You can get the expansions through promo codes (one expansion right now is free if you sign up for twitch premium trial), but they DON'T integrate with steam, so it never shows up as owned. Not a huge deal, but be aware. 


What did they do right? Spending real money lets you have a lot more flexibility to try various deck styles and jump right into high powered versions. The way it seems to work is if you own ""enough"" copies of a card, you can use that card as a ""wild"" card, and put 3 copies in your deck... instead of 1. Needless to say, for strong cards (in the 10 card decks), this makes entire deck styles built around A SINGLE CARD not just possible, but encouraged. 

Problem is, it'll take you weeks, maybe months to get enough copies of a particular legendary... Or you can buy rubies and basically get whatever you want. Not that that is a bad thing. I'm certainly not top tier, but I have access to PLENTY of overpowered deck builds (And I spent $1 on this game so far)... and like I said, it's very much Rock Paper Scissors though, which is only fun for a game or two a day... any more than that and it gets boring and grindy.


The alternative is draft games... where you can't buy an advantage of any sort. Costs 750g (You get at least 1k/day from simple dailies... and earn maybe 50-100ish? gold every win after that) to draft a deck which you play until 12 wins or 3 losses.

Much more fun mode, but has a few weaknesses. First, air defense and low cost cards. You can get a draft where you got ZERO air defense options and no cards below 4-5 mana offered. This can put you in a situation where no matter how well you play, you simply lose against most opponents. Also, You can run into decks where they basically got the dream draft and are playing a cheesy top tier deck and stomping everyone... happens once, ok... happens 3 times in a row and ends your draft? Not so fun. 


Other complaint... the cutscene intro/exit to each match (a la Final Fantasy games of old) is so insanely irritating after awhile and can't be turned off. Nothing like 45 seconds of cutscenes to play a 55 second match. 


All in all a fun time sink, but definitely not a sufficiently complex and interesting game to justify dropping more than $20 or so on. Luckily, the structure of the expansions (primarily just card packs) makes it so you don't need to."
7779,Try it and you won't regret it
7780,Addictive tug-o-war style card game where you summon minions and spells to overwhelm the enemy.
7781,A refreshing game in an industry full of repetition.
7782,"great game runs better than on the xbox
"
7783,"good game, quick rounds :)"
7784,GOOD GAEM!
7785,"Really enjoy it :D
One of the best so far!!! <3"
7786,"I'd like to like this game - it's normally decently balanced, with a good number of viable strategies and counterplay, and pretty fun. Game-to-game rewards are decent, especially if you stick around for them releasing past paid DLCs whenever a new one is released. Powercreep does exist, but it's not too hard to stay on top of without spending money.

However, the ability to add duplicate cards to the deck (a practice banned in competitive play, organised outside the game itself) makes it impossible to reasonably tech against some strategies - say, minion-generating buildings on one side and minions which just rush face on the other; you can generally deal with both strategies and a pile more besides with reasonable space in your deck, unless between your opponents there are four of one and three of the other, plus two copies of a certain minion which becomes annoyingly sticky and powerful if you ever play spells to interact with either directly.

The matchmaking meta then devolves to ""play x broken combo, or spam y/z, or lose"", which gets very stale very fast. Community is also fairly toxic, but that's beside the point and out of the game devs' hands. Can't recommend the game itself as it is now."
7787,this game is perfect for free time and relax!!
7788,Minion ka ai meng wa liao lor
7789,lit
7790,its fun
7791,"Good game, nice Mechanics"
7792,"While the mobile market is saturated with similar genre strategy games, this is probably one of the most well developed and fundamentally strategic game out there. What you have matters and how you play it matters even more. I rate this game 8/10. Easy to learn, hard to master"
7793,yep
7794,"Comecei hoje no Minion Masters e estou impressionado com o jogo. Os desenvolvedores resgataram tudo o que há de benéfico em jogos do estilo cardgame, recuperaram a essência do início do Clash Royale e conseguiram criar um sistema de lootbox fora do padrão. Continuarei jogando!"
7795,awesome 2V2 RTS. short matches.
7796,"This's game for relax but its my opinion, also good game rly. I hope this game will be develop and get popular.
"
7797,"decent graphics, easy to learn"
7798,sample and good
7799,tis just a simple and fun to play game. Better to play duos in my opinion
7800,Dat's fine:D See u:)
7801,Its fun!
7802,"Great game for short bursts or longer sessions, fun to play with friends."
7803,nice grafics . not lagging i recomend
7804,addictive lots of cool monster types   not bad for a game where you point and click
7805,"Update as of 04/12/2020. I still recommend this game, however be warned that developers are started to lock content behind temporary paywall.

Easy, fast, accesible, no p2w, active development. Stop reading, go playing."
7806,its good for chill
7807,"Masterful blend of CCG and RTS.

You build a deck of a Master (i.e. hero character) and ten cards (which start the match shuffled but will recycle in the order played.) Mana trickles in every couple of seconds, and you use it to play your cards; if it's a Unit, it springs to life following a rudimentary AI that, given the chance, will make its way to and attack the enemy Master. Spells target physical space on the board (or occasionally the entire board) and there are also Buildings with a finite lifetime.

While not 100% original in its initial core concept, this game stands out from its contemporaries in that it excels both in the variety of approaches the player can take in deckbuilding, as well as its accessibility—from the getgo, you are given a toolkit capable of Master Rank levels. On top of that, procuring new cards even at the rarest rarity is the easiest time I've ever had in a digital card game.

In contrast to other such games in this pseudo-genre, there is [b]no[/b] grinding or leveling of one's units/spells/buildings. The largest number of copies you'll ever need to collect of a card is 3 and even then that's if you're planning to run three copies of it in a deck.

Tons of fun, would recommend."
7808,"its really fun, easy, fast, addictive

feels a bit like a cheap makeover of hearthstone but it rocks so what"
7809,This game is pretty fun for the complexity that can be accomplished with the decks and playstyles available. You can go easy swarmer style to complex number cruncher.
7810,pretty good game so far
7811,Fun game to play
7812,"Liked it for a while but the fact that you gave chapter 1 of the adventure for free and rest you have to pay for is just a money grabbing scheme. In 2v2 you automatically lose if your teammate disconnects or quit the game, I would rather have a bot replace them and penalize the other teammate- seriously."
7813,"fun, fast paced. a bit gimmicky, but still better than being too hard"
7814,"Do not try this game, unless you won't be addicted to it. 

Shame on you, devs!

BetaDwarf, rly great game. 9/10"
7815,great game to play with a friend!
7816,better than clash royale
7817,Epic fun game!  nuff said.
7818,awesonme game
7819,"Card game with collection and building mechanics. Timing and strategy are important because the summoned creatures march toward the opponent instead of sitting on the board like Hearthstone.
Rated down because I don't like forced PvP, and the PvAI is limited to a few battles. The progressive mode is very unforgiving. Everything is ""level"" gated at the beginning, so you have to do certain gameplay modes to progress and unlock basic features. Allegedly there's a ""roguelike"" ""adventure"" type mode, but I couldn't find it or didn't progress enough to unlock it before I was forced into the progressive mode, which made me quit and uninstall."
7820,"You can pay to win, but it's not completely neccessary. You still can have a lot of fun for free."
7821,"Game runs very well, I feel like I am going to be playing this for a while!"
7822,meh
7823,Very nice game like Clash Royale. Addictive as well.
7824,"weirdly addictive, but a bit microtransaction desperate"
7825,This game is sick and it feels like Im getting rewarded for playing! Which I love!
7826,Fun game to play with friends to pass time. Good Free To Play
7827,good
7828,no
7829,"this game is fun, I enjoy playing this game so much."
7830,"This is a Clash Royale style game. Can you spend money to buy ingame goodies? Yes, but that wont change the outcome of the games. Cards wont upgrade its power or stats even if you try to max them. The only thing you gain is more overall power for rewards on won games. This is a game made by an indie enterprise tand they are doing quite a good job updating this thing. You can support them by bying the season pass ( that makes things a bit more interesting)."
7831,Great Game (21-0 win steak) if i lose i will delete it
7832,"I am absolutely loving this game, so addictive"
7833,"Stupid amounts of fun, free to play and easy to learn. I'm digging this."

7835,its fun
7836,Enjoyable game!
7837,"Relatively easy to get into, can play with friends, and strategy-oh hell, it's fun to win. Okay?"
7838,"great fun game with lots of updates. Lane defense mixed with card games. Fun Fun Fun

update: Needs a bit more content - as soon as conquests are completed, there isnt much to do. Needs more team variety and is desperately in need of a 3v3 or 4v4 map - that would be carnage!"
7839,fun game to relax and still pvp
7840,good
7841,nice game
7842,"Really liking the gameplay. good alternative to moba and auto chess games. oh, i like the humor too, Nice touch!"
7843,"The game itself is pretty funny, i ike it and would recommend it. But i am not, and here's why:

I found a Guild in the game with the name ""Nationalsozialisten Gilde"" (in english it should be ""Guild of National Socialistics"") This is an abuse of the terms of use in the game Minion Masters, thus it's illegal!
First i contacted the Steam Support for help, but they refer me to the BetaDwarf Support. I wrote a request to delete the guild, at the 09.12.2019 but till now (14.08.2022) nothing happened.

I will change my rewiev into a positive one only if you (BetaDwarf) will take responsibility!"
7844,"Pay to win, if you don't pay you don't get access to all the gold, exp, card tokens, rubies, crystals, etc., etc., etc. in order to buy all the heroes with top tier abilities and all the cards. It's no different than any other ""Card"" game. Just like Magic the Gathering, if you don't spend tons of money you will never have a competitive deck. If you don't pay you do nothing but feed other people wins who have paid. Free to play means ""Frustrating to Players"" unless you pay, and pay, and pay, and pay. $80.00+ for the heroes and card packs on a pay-to-win free-to-play game?

It's a good thing I haven't paid one cent because I would be really upset right now if I had. Instead I get to dodge this bullet and give my money to another company that actually gives you a ""game"", not a tiered payment reward system designed to milk users.

Remember when games were made to be fun? I do.

I am so very thankful for games like Minion Masters because they let me see all the frustration and headaches up front without me spending a dime. It is games like these that make me appreciate other real games all the more."
7845,"Cute and interesting!
"
7846,"I have played a lot through discord and I asctuaqlly like the discord version better  
But this is awsome too. exept  al the money  they want from you  
"
7847,Not pay to win
7848,"Never been a fan of these kinds of games.  Never would have even bothered to look twice.  By chance i saw it on steam and for some reason i downloaded and tried it.  Haven't stopped playing since.

[December 2020 update]
The game is taking a horrible direction at the moment, with a series of updates that's just become thinner and thinner on content, but more and more talk of ""better monetising the game"".  Let me be clear, i have no issue about making money here.  But where's the content?  So the last two updates have been talking about this a lot and when i logged on after the early December 2020 update i saw a battlepass for 1200 rubies that isn't worth napkin the idea was written on.   But we want to better monetise the game.  Forget it.  Give me good content to pay for, and I will pay.  Instead, what you are doing is putting a paywall on what your historic player base could earn through investing time.  So EF the old players and get ready for your mobile market then - fine. 
Thumbs down and thanks for the kick in the teeth."

7893,it s  a so funny game and addictive i like it thank you <3
7894,"Game is fun and interactive, you have a deck but in the same time you have to think where to put your army of minions and how to play your cards smart. iI like the unique style of playing this game"
7895,I had to much fun with this game and the best think is that its free
7896,"So far, 6 hours played and it's been a great 6 hours spent... in the long run, i suppose is still to be determined, but for a free game, so far has been worth it. i would recommend giving this game a shot for sure though."

7898,"Honestly pretty lit, its like clash but not cancer :)"
7899,"great game keep building
"
7900,good
7901,"Fast games, and so far solid gameplay."
7902,Iv'e played this game for roughly 151 hours and Iv'e come to the conclusion that the devs are only interested in creating a cash grab heaping dumpster fire of a game so I wouldn't waste your time or money on this. The cards are very unbalanced and the cooler PVE stuff is basically impossible to beat because of very poor planning and execution on the devs part. Maybe down the road the devs will get their priorities straight and correct their mistakes but right now it's a lost cause.
7903,"Clash Royale on steroids
"
7904,"Found this game in Dec 2019 and wished Id found it sooner! Very very fun, seriously addicting and though its free-to-play completely I found that alone worth spending the extra $20 for all the masters DLC a worthy donation to their already great all around good game.  This may say a card based play but its so so much more!"
7905,kick pirate booty
7906,"slow to start but gets intense, love this game!!"
7907,"It's like Clash Royale, but better honestly. Clash Royale was a fresh and refined concept that succeeded on mobile phones, but Minion Masters has pushed for more innovative gameplay. Examples: RNG (seriously clash royale didn't have any), 2v2 (somehow clash doesn't have this either), more updates, and more. Overall the game is slightly less polished, but gives you  surprisingly more content."
7908,Good game
7909,Interesting game so far. Hopefully don't hit a paywall.
7910,its a cross between Hearthstone and LoL i  guess. not bad for a free game
7911,awesome game!
7912,"this game provides high quality gameplay experience  from all the angles
"
7913,"[h1]Good game and very F2P friendly...[/h1]
First off: This game has a huge memory leak... You can't play the game for more than an couple of hours without the game stuttering and glitching out. The game is constantly updated with new balance 'improvements' and new content, yet the memory leak is ever-present for several years now.

Also, ALL your replays are deleted from your replay folder, when the game gets updated... so they don't even give you the option of keeping the replays to look at in the future... NOPE, they just delete files, which are on your computer, without your permission and without notifying you... I wanted to go look at some of my replays from the previous week, and POOF! I found that ALL my replays from over 50 games were gone... deleted from existence.

Also, some 'heroes' cost 500 shards and others cost 1500 shards... this means that according to the developers, certain 'heroes' are automatically worth more and thus MORE POWERFUL than certain other 'heroes'... Do you know how big of a problem that is, wrt. game balancing? It's a MASSIVE problem. That's like World of Warcraft saying ""the warrior and druid is 500 gold, but to play the mage you gotta pay 1500 gold!"". It's an absurd mechanic in the game, as you simply CAN'T have heroes that are stronger than other heroes, because that means that 'only the rich people' will be able to afford the best 'heroes' in the game. The game also has a 'battle pass' system, which is never good and is something that developers should stop implementing in their games.

Another problem is the fact that the minions on the board actually have 'collision pathing' so that means that it's automatically WORSE if you play a 'ground minion' deck, since air minions don't suffer from collision pathing... I've literally had my ground minions bump into eachother a bunch of times and then they just get slaughtered by ranged minions, because they struggle to reach their intended target... I seriously think that the ground minions should NOT have collision pathing, since it screws you over if you have a deck that has a 'zerg rush' or 'horde rush' setup.

On the good side though: The game has a good monetization system going, with the money you spend on it ACTUALLY giving you lasting power, unlike other games such as Warframe or Hearthstone where spending money gets you only a temporary boost in power, and with every card that you get through the loot system (called Power Tokens), you also get 'crystals' which is essentially like ""Dust"" in Hearthstone, and it can be used to craft any card that you want. I don't however like the huge amount of RNG that is involved with the ""Power Token"" system, since you can never reliably get the card that you want, unless you outright buy it in the shop or get enough dust to craft it.

Another good thing is that the game is basically 100% reliant on skill and quick-thinking... it's not like Hearthstone or many other games where you can literally lose 5 games in a row simply because all your 'best cards' are at the bottom of your deck... in this game you cycle through your deck at such a rate that the chances of you being disadvantaged by a 'bad opening hand' is basically nullified. I WOULD however maybe like to see the health of the master tower be increased from 3000 to 5000, simply because 'face decks' (which require much less skill to play) would then be less prevalent and effective.

Overall, it's a fun game that depends on skill, with a very fair monetization system, but still has a few issues that the devs can easily fix if they want to make this 'good game' a 'great game'. There's no free speech in the game's in-game chat though, so if you're a loudmouth sh!theel, then it's probably best to not play the game, since you'll end up getting yourself banned. Devs also basically never ban players (no matter the offense) which is troublesome and means that there's MANY toxic knobgobblers in the game's community.

7914,An awesome twist on a card game. Fun and engaging combat. It's like a card game with a bit of Moba twist.
7915,:)
7916,"Great game! You can spend 30 min's playing and feel like you got somewhere. Love it, I am hooked. I built a deck with about 5x 2-3 cost cards and then a few higher level cards and I just started learning from there. Very cool game."
7917,fun game
7918,"10 out of 10 would recommend this game. It reminds me of hearthstone a little with the cards. Seeing your deck come to life and fighting other troops to battle a core is awesome. I like how with the different heroes come different attack power, rate, and patterns. I also like that in case you run out of energy there's heroes fighting troops on the territory. Overall really good game with competitive battling."
7919,Great game to play
7920,I love this game.I play everyday and wait new updates.
7921,"Great game, having a lot of fun! Try it!"
7922,"Epic game

10/10"
7923,"good, fun and addicting."
7924,good one
7925,"The game is unstable. It randomly disconnects, forcing a loss. When it works it is fun, but under no circumstances would I recommend investing money, and after only a few hours of play I'm starting to run into limits on game modes from not having bought expansions."
7926,good game
7927,good game for time passs
7928,Not PTW despite appearances and pretty fun.
7929,ez clap
7930,"Fun game, early in the process, but what I have liked so far is the speed of matchmaking and the speed of individual matches. Able to bang out a match or two in 10 minutes or less, so nice to fill in those quick bouts for games."
7931,Nice free to play game that involves using cards to place minions on a battlefield. Easy to understand but getting the timing down on where and when to place your minion or spells can determine victory or defeat. Like any card game using cards that combo well with each other helps a lot especially when you take in your avatars abilities. Reminds me of Hearthstone but with a lot more concern over card placement. Good game overall.
7932,Super Fun and Polished for F2P!
7933,"It's free, Doesn't take up much space. Fun. Lot's of minions and some incredible and memorable masters that are all worth playing. Cannot recommend the all masters dlc enough cause earning them in game is a painfully slow process if you don't have the time to play all day every day. Seriously there's not one master that isn't fun or at least useful. And the minion and spell variety gets bigger all the time. There's always new strats and new cards to try. Even if you don't like games like this it's free. At least give it a shot. Ya lose nothing for it."
7934,"Game is full of cheaters fond 7 ways people are cheating the game mostly exploits
Don't play this game. if you like playing with cheaters enjoy the game."
7935,great game love it
7936,I started playing because of MTGNerdGirl. This game sneaks up on you like a good hot sauce.
7937,i really like this game because i cant afford to upgrade my rig.
7938,"  Not bad so far, hard to navigate early. Not really throwing the shop in the face.
"
7939,Good quick fun!
7940,Fun game to play with a friend or alone.
7941,très bon jeu :)
7942,Short game but manage to raised my BP. Like it.
7943,yes
7944,nice
7945,"Lots of good game design, really pretty well done ... until the last few months, when suddenly it's been much more unstable.  Maybe half the matches will freeze up and dump you back to the main screen, dinging you with a defeat because of some bug in the game.

Kind of a shame - used to be pretty good, but there's just no way to recommend it in its current state.
"
7946,"Всё отлично,есть баланс,есть возможность делать интересные колоды 
Тактика (куда выставлять юнитов)
Один ОГРОМНЫЙ МИНУС В ранкеде явно сидят боты наравне с обычными игроками, играть слишком просто зачастую"
7947,Game good.
7948,"its fun when your not sure what else to do. i sometimes just load it up play a few rounds and enjoy myself.,

yea it can seem pay to win but they give out new dlc on release usualy and ive never fought a battle that felt like the opponent bought every op card known to man,

"
7949,"I really enjoy the sandcastle wars style of play. Fun characters and announcer. Also tons of of fun without giving any money, but it is the type of game that makes you want to put money towards things in it because of the fun, not because of the crappy mind games so many FTP games do."
7950,yes
7951,Terrible support - buggy - next to no good drops - rewards big in start then hard to get as you progress. MILLIONS OF MICRO-TRANSACTIONS.
7952,Typical PTW garbage
7953,:)
7954,Love It
7955,"Very fun and easy to pick up gameplay, the game clearly has a good baseline for the future. At first glance the microtransactions seem a bit pushed even though they are not needed to play at a respectable level. The main menu feels a little cluttered but the gameplay more than makes up for this."
7956,Just starting out but really like the simplicity.
7957,Rock solid boner.
7958,I definitely enjoy and recommend this game to others. Pretty chill and not a lot of toxicity so far as I have seen.
7959,So far its been quite fun
7960,"love combo of deck building, strategy and arcade kind of action"
7961,"Game is Fucking Dog shit Lmaooo, if you want a game that is like a broken record on repeat, then this game is for you. As soon as you get to Rank Master you go against the same abusive, broken cards over and over there is no originality, everyone just copies top 10 so from Rank Diamond up, its just a bunch of brain dead kid who dont have any idea how to play their deck because they just copied it, take my advice find another game. This one is a waste of time."
7962,LOL
7963,"Highly addictive, and damn do I love the options of troop choices aplenty"
7964,"It's fun enough, Don't like the casino style unlocks though, but there are few card games that aren't that."
7965,"Pretty interesting take on tower defense and deck building games, with some fantastic character models and humor mixed in. Definitely worth a try!"
7966,"Only a few hours into this, but i'm engaged and enjoying the play style."
7967,"THERE'S NOTHING I DISLIKE. Its a pretty smooth game
"
7968,"Lots of different game modes to play (solo, dual, mayhem, draft, expeditions) so you can do quite a lot. Quite a bit of things need rubies to unlock (E.G. Adventure chapters) and naturally the fastest way to get rubies is with money. I like the style of combat and the deck building aspect. Combat keeps you busy and requires you to combat your opponents minions."
7969,I'm still learning but so far very fun.
7970,yeah
7971,good game like clash royale
7972,Very fun and fast paced.  Great addictive game!!
7973,"Divertido jugar con un amigo 
"
7974,Good details and a really great game overall
7975,very fun
7976,not a bad game for what it is but it does get pretty boring the higher you climb in rank. Every one starts to use simlar cards and stratgies making them very repative. Due to the sheer lack of card and master varity. I think the game would benfit greatly from new cards and masters maybe some rebalancing on some of the current masters because not all are equal some are far more broken then others. Graphics and game play are fairly good aside from what I have mentioned. not bad for a unity deployment good job
7977,tHIS IS A GREAT GAME
7978,"[i] If you're a fan of Clash Royale and have been dying for a PC version that allows you to even more modes to play, more variety of units to play for bigger strategies when it comes to deck building and usage, and for an active community to help you find game in such a short about of wait time (estimated), then this game is definitely for you! I highly enjoyed my time on here since 2018, but to be fully honest, this game is really taxing when it comes to trying to learn or even relearn the game and building a deck really takes up a lot of the fun that can be had in the different modes and in just regular battles. My only gripe with this game is that they would have preset decks be available for purchase, be it in-game currency or actual money. Maybe there is and I didn't see it, but it would make things a whole lot easier when it comes to finding a strategy that suits you as a player. Overall, this game is extremely fun and have great potential for future growth, probably sooner than later if they keep doing what they're doing and growing the community, especially with more free DLCs, events, and content coming on! Thank you all for reading this, and have a great day, sweethearts. [/i]

[i] Sincerely, Rosa Mendez, The Reborn Strategist [/i]"
7979,Awesome for a quick hit game. Play a couple games per day before longer sessions
7980,"Any game with a pay to win element is only so much fun. You can pay to unlock everything, and then you just get rekt against wallet warriors . Not fun! the basics are fine, just don't wanna have pay to win, and once unlocked, what's fun about the game?"
7981,Honestly this game is really fun. At first I thought it was just a clash royale copy/paste but I've been really enjoying it! It is a very fleshed out and fun game!
7982,"Great game, fun to play."
7983,"A great game! Whether you want to play solo or with a friend this is a game you can keep coming back to. Often times, you can play it only for 5-10 minutes as you wait for something else!"
7984,The teamwork required for team fight are excellent and promotes covering each others' weaknesses.
7985,gud
7986,"Well I was watching Twitch earlier and saw this game on the menu, checked it out; so far, I have to say it's pretty addicting. Matches are fast paced, you can get through them pretty quickly and it is a lot of fun. I like that there is quite a bit of complexity to the game so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing the different combinations and strategies that can be employed. 

5/5 - Free Game."
7987,игра с мобилок?
7988,best game ever just try
7989,"The game isn't that bad, but the roll system to get new cards is clearly rigged. I've done 50 rolls for cards and 38 of them were duplicates of the few cards I started the game with. In my almost 10 hours of play I've managed to gain a pathetic 12 cards more than what I started with. The balance is bad, and the massive grind to try and get anything isn't worth it."
7990,"Fun as heck, if it wasn't for the balancing issues. Currently it't just broken. I've had enough, I'm out."
7991,great
7992,"fun game with no money spending required
"
7993,good fun
7994,It's fun......period.
7995,love the game
7996,This game is FUNNN!!
7997,gud game
7998,"very nice game, free to play, not bad"
7999,"I didn't come in expecting too much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The card system seems balanced and versatile. Sometimes I get several opponents in a row that are pretty easy, but eventually I always find someone that rolls over me, just to remind me that my deck isn't perfect and has its drawbacks."
8000,"Devs are completely ignorant and don't communicate with the community at all.  The core game-play is great (why I have so much time into this), but don't expect much for basic quality of life things or balanced matchmaking."
8001,"Though this game is a quirky and cute take on tabletop fighters, it lacks any real competition or finesse. The balance isn't great as some characters/cards are way more overpowered than others. The new modes and updates really aren't fun, especially given that they make you start over entirely if you close out of them. There isn't a whole lot of strategy to it, it's essentially a ""gatcha"" game when it comes to actually getting cards. Overall disappointing, but at least it's free."
8002,simple and easy
8003,GOOD GAME XD
8004,"the game doesn't have enough cards for one. and the cards that are there are unbalanced + pay to win ... some one just starting will always lose to someone who went and got the legendary cards and is using them to roll low lvl ranked players.

the shop is cool that they give u free stuff(like gems) but most of it is still premium gems but you cant get that many unless u grind everyday and even them its not enough."
8005,"Sexual Intercourse In My Brain, Havent Lost Once"
8006,Not Pay to Win
8007,"Excellent game...seriously...
The definition of easy to learn, difficult to master.
Play it"
8008,"time killing, clash royal"
8009,noice
8010,"It reminds me of clash of clans, but a bit more dynamic. So far so good"
8011,Competitive yet chill
8012,C'est un des meilleurs jeu du moment!
8013,Its like a 3D-simulated version of Hearthstone.
8014,FUN GAME!
8015,Simplex game
8016,"It has really stellar Twitch integration, and the skillcap is quite high!"
8017,"fun little card game that is also like a tower defence, it is a little bit of a pay to win, but unlike others you really don't have to pay anything to earn or get cards. sign up for the news letter and you often get free redeem codes to gets free stuff. you really can get lost into the game fast, later there is a bit of grid to work towards teh cards you want, but you be suspriced what you get free each day.
the party/invite system does not work, curently only about to join a party via an invite throught discord or steam and NOT through the game it self is very much a pain.
over all 9/10, good for a quick little play or get lost in it for hours"
8018,"Nice game, good for passing the time"
8019,"Awesome game! I've been enjoing it so far. Rewards are quite easy to get and matchmaking is fast. The game is very fun, having a variety of characters and decks to use. You should definitly try it!"
8020,"Lots of fun, similar to a tower defense game but on PC and pretty easy to play"
8021,the game its so good
8022,Fun Game
8023,it the best card game i play yet
8024,Like clash royale
8025,"Fun, light-hearted game, low investment. Super fast games, seems like there's a decent amount of strategy as well. I'll update later if this opinion changes as I am just getting started.

 It is EXTREMELY pay-to-win. You can literally translate IRL money into Cards which means you have more options and better decks. If you think Hearthstone was bad, wait till you meet Minion Masters."
8026,"Get this game immediately. Great on all front, feels fair, lots of fun."
8027,okay game. I hate the shop and crystal mobile game token bullshit
8028,Pretty Fun
8029,"Besides it being your obvious mobile game brought to PC with all the disgusting mobile game transactions, the game itself is actually pretty fun."
8030,solid pare
8031,Nice and good am having fun with these game <3
8032,Fun little game
8033,It's so simple you can be completely hammered while playing...cheers
8034,This is all kinds of fun and I love it
8035,THE NARRATOR VOICE SOUNDS SO RETARDED I COULDNT PLAY THE GAME
8036,Very yes
8037,fun game
8038,This is one of those cute fast paced games that is very easy to get into but takes time and effort to master.
8039,Its fun to play!
8040,"Fun, balanced game"
8041,Better than clash royal.
8042,"People are claiming this game is play to win, and honestly, I can see where they're coming from.
HOWEVER, unlike many other card games, there are plenty of opportunities to receive some incredible cards just by playing the game and completing tasks. 

I personally was skeptical of this, but quickly fell in love and found a lot of deeper mechanics as I began to rise in rank. This is a truly underrated game."
8043,Solid game with just enough tactics. Ranked goeswell soloe que premade etc. Only issue I guess I would have is not owning all the cards and trying to play comp. But its free so need to make money somehow. 9/10
8044,very dynamic and playful
8045,Extremely p2w
8046,it is a good time with a bud
8047,"Excellent game! Either by oneself, or friend(s), this game has plenty to offer, is free to play, and keeps me entertained with some of the more zany antics of its minions. Thumbs up"
8048,"Many funs, Much good"
8049,"Fun game, quick matches"
8050,Easy to pick up and a great time passer.
8051,"Horrible game, really bad balance, waste of time"
8052,Getting tired of some of the nerfs.
8053,This is better than Clash Royale.
8054,"Hello Minions ;P 

I love tower defense, card games and love seeing cards come to life visually. 

The game is simple, but I like how there is different levels to how you need to place the cards/creatures.  Left or right, maybe a 50/50 split of both.  

There i a good countering options, and I think the cards are balanced out.  

Really fun and tactful."
8055,great game to pass some time the game is clash royal but on pc
8056,fun
8057,"Quite a nice game. Great for killing some time by playing a game or two now and then.
If you have played heartstone or similar card games you are going to learn the basics quite easily."
8058,"Really good game. Personally it feels to me like clash royale but the PC version - with higher quality and improved mechanics. in a 0-10 this game gets a solid 8, which is a lot becouse this game isn't really popular."
8059, .
8060,As free as a game can be. With enough patience you can earn and/or craft all the cards in the game.
8061,Super fun and free game. Has quick games and a great strategy element to it.
8062,"THE BEST GAME





"
8063,"I like the gameplay, I think the cards are interesting. In fact, in terms of the game itself, I have no complaints.  Unfortunately the performance of this game, even at the lowest setting spikes all over the place, and - for whatever reason - this is the only game I've played in a long time that literally makes me dizzy in real life.  I have no idea what it is, as turning off bloom and motion blur does nothing... maybe it has to do with the frame rate jumping from 60 to 5 and so on, but I don't know.

I just can't recommend a game that is the only game I've played to causes me literal physical pain while I'm playing it."
8064,awesome
8065,Bit of fun. Similar to mobile game.
8066,Simply amazing
8067,"Good game, still not so many cards so you can easly create deck you like"
8068,"I like it , idk why but it s nice
"
8069,clash royale wanna be
8070,Fun game
8071,"Fun game easy to learn not that hard to master, F2P but not P2W at all, every new season comes in with new and free cards and there is many events every day and every season that also rewards legendary cards, Free masters rotations, lots of rewards for new players very easy to jump in."
8072,"good game, cuz fun to play ^^"
8073,"It's basically tower defence with cards, with possibly a hint of Yu Gi Oh about it. Also it's free so......"
8074,"Could be play as F2P, but you are recommended to P2W, LOL !"
8075,"This game has great graphics, great gameplay and i really like the story and that there are alot of challenges. 
So i would really recommend this game, and it does take a while to set into it, but you just have to take the time you need."
8076,harbinger op 11/10
8077,good
8078,Good
8079,tis gud game
8080,This game hella fun bro
8081,"great game, fun and entertaining, co-op battle system to complement each others builds really fun so far"
8082,it's fune
8083,"This game is pay to win. I'm constantly set up against players that have a ton of legendary cards in their decks. Some players have said that this is more like a pay to progress, however I cannot progress any further without getting better cards which I would need to buy."
8084,"I'll be honest. At first I criticized it as a Clash Royal ripoff, but with the Free DLC weekend I decided to give it a chance. Dont listen to the people who tell you it's pay to win, people at your level will most likely try to pay their way up, but even so the game is pretty balanced and the drops are random and unlockable without money. They offer both premium currency (Which you can get as a drop in chests, or you can craft the items. It is very much like hearthstone in that aspect. Either way, the game is great and I highly recommend. Simple to learn, easy to play."
8085,"It's no more pay to win then all of the other card strategy games out there, and it's rather fun as well."
8086,dope
8087,It gud
8088,fun game
8089,a nice fun quick game for everyone
8090,"This is a really fun PvP based game with a side PvE adventure quest. It is worth the play if you are happening to look for a fun and competitive time killer. 
 The only ""Con"" I have witnessed is that you randomly get disconnected from the game when you finish a battle ( Also and Error that follows as: Someone has logged into the game in another instance)."
8091,"Pretty fun, but for a f2p game it gets REALLY stingy with rewards once you get past the initial starter quests.  If you grabbed this to check out the roguelike addition like i did, it's basically in demo form and requires purchase to play 2/3 of the chapters and 4/5 of the characters.  You can buy it in rubies, but getting that many rubies for free is a heck of a long term task, and looks like it'd cost almost all the possible free rubies you can obtain."
8092,le' dank
8093,I use to play a lot of clash royale before and this one is a have a good variety of ways to make a strong technique.
8094,This game is a whole lot of fun. I had no clue that a deck building game had actually intreseting strategy and combat. Would defintely reccomend this.
8095,"This is just another generic card game with two bridges. I consider some minor things funny, but when you play for a little while, there is not much originality to be found. Everything was seen before. It's not a bad game.... it's just that kind of ""another"" game, that will not stay in your memory after you turn it off. I kind of miss at least some upgrading of cards or master. It's yet another time killer and yes, I'm playing it and will probably for a few moments until I realize, that it's not giving me anything anymore and keeps repeating it's pattern over and over again :) I guess this is such era.... nothing original and a lot of copying, mimics, remakes, HD versions, etc. One has to ask, where all the creativity has gone :("
8096,"Easy to learn, hardto master. Minion Masters is an excellently crafted  deckbuilder meets arena battle. Game balance is actually pretty good, and developers are constantly improving the game. By all means, this game is far better than it needs to be."
8097,...
8098,fun game
8099,This game is fun even tho its kinda like Clash Royale but still good
8100,"evil, cant play 2games in same wtime with this game"
8101,simple and easy to learn and it hooked me right from the tutorial. Already level 24 and its been two days since i started playing
8102,"Game is like clash royale(as you might already have guessed), however, masters has ability to have you teamed up with your friend and engage into 2v2s(fkin awesome imo), defenetly a kewl f2p game"
8103,"Easy to learn, fun to master. 
I pick up and play a few rounds every few days and find it challenging and fun to play. Rounds are quick so a short game is possible. But its also easy to play for a long time without realizing it. 
"
8104,Fun and addictive.  Matches are incredibly short (1.5min - 8min).  Wins are fun and losses aren't dragged out
8105,Great F2P game so far.. pretty challenging at the higher ranks... and the npc challenges need to be buffed
8106,fun game
8107,"Nothing says, ""seedy game development practices"" better than not giving the player a ""Quit"" button until they reach level 7.  I literally had to Alt-F4 to exit."
8108,I enjoy it so far :)
8109,fond
8110,This game is underrated. More people should play it! I recommend it to anybody who is scrolling through reviews or just thinking about it in general. The game is overall calming and fun. It deserves a bigger fanbase.
8111,"fun game
"
8112,Fun
8113,simplicity with enough depth to keep you engaged.
8114,I like it
8115,Addictive and this game is similar to Clash Royale (Mobile Game) if you know that game.
8116,free to play done right. never feel forced to pay for cards to keep up with other players in ranked and is more about synergy than individual cards
8117,good stuff
8118,"Pretty good game, tried it out because of the twitch prime benfits."
8119,"very hectic very fun very fast queue times. never a dull moment. 

Only complaint is that I want more"
8120,enjoyable game
8121,"رااائعه 
"
8122,Pretty cool game that is ez to play. Even if you lose it is fun. 10/10 Try it out its free also :) But not so scammy as other card games.
8123,Loving so far!
8124,its so fun!!!just a quick game to relax
8125,"I was cautious of this game. It isn't my normal cup of tea. But it has a fun style and a good tutorial. I can't really describe why I came back to play it again, just that I was having fun and wanted to have more fun. I'm still at the start but I feel like I will keep playing to see just how absurd I can get my deck and how intense the higher tier fights can get."
8126,"This is a very fun PC game. I've played hundreds of hours in it. But the fun stop after Chinese HACKERS came and do lots of cheats.

1. They make a unit have infinite health, so it cannot die.

2. They can spawn units more than allowed by the rule. It is not during manna frenzy.

So GOOD BYE to MINION MASTERS !!!"
8127,ITS PRETTY GOOD
8128,Great early progress reward system
8129,very gg
8130,very nice
8131,"free to play, fun and entertaining, simple and easy"

8133,A nicely made game
8134,very good game
8135,its fun
8136,"Very Fun and entertaining, Wish you could get resources faster but thats because im a cheap person and dont want to spend money LOL"
8137,Good game
8138,a worthy game for wasting time on your potato pc
8139,"compared to any other game in the same genre that I know  of (looking at you clash royal) Its pretty good, still pay to win but much less so then its other counterparts and much more strategy involved in this title"
8140,yup
8141,Short but entertaining matches. I'm enjoying this so far
8142,"short games, quite addictive, kinda wish i got into it sooner"
8143,funner than other games like this
8144,Wabalabadubwub
8145,"Great game;
Easy to learn but difficult to master is the old saying...
Could do with more heroes but so far so good :)"
8146,Its good.
8147,A free game to suck money out you.....avoid
8148,Awesome ! try it
8149,good giem
8150,play clash royel pc
8151,"Game is a lot of fun, really enjoy the pace of the game. They have team battles so you can play with a friend."
8152,Amazing Game!!!!
8153,"The game is very fun to play at first, but F2P progression is very harsh. Anyone with half a brain can easily climb up to Silver rank with just the free cards, but then you meet everyone who bought the DLC's or has had the game much longer. You won't be able to beat them and will lose within one minute after the match starts.

The pve modes are extremely limited and won't give you much progress, they're basically just for training. The new adventure mode is like in Hearthstone, first chapter being free and the rest behind a paywall.

Hearthstone has better F2P progression, since cards there cost just 100 gold for a pack of 5 and you can easily get 100 gold per day. In Minion Masters the cards cost 1000 gold for one random card and you won't make 5000 gold per day once you finish your early game achievements. Early game is basically a boost period during which you earn more than ever again once it ends. That period is probably the most fun you'll get in the game, I played ten hours  in the first day during this rush of constant unlocks & achievements. 

Minion Masters is easier for the wallet warrior though than Heathstone. There are no 40 nor 80 dollar preorder card deals, though cosmetic purchases cost way too much for a game of this size when they are mostly just recolored skins.

Don't get me wrong though, you CAN spend a hundred or two every month if you get yourself addicted, since you can buy tokens for the loot box thing which gives you cards & bits of crafting material for cards. In theory if you keep spinning the same cards you can pump thousands of dollars into this. 

-DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE TO GAMBLING ADDICTION. 
-DO NOT GIVE THIS GAME TO CHILDREN EITHER. 

I'll probably buy one or two of the DLC's to see if it enables me to get any wins in the Silver rank, but if it does not I'll just uninstall. 

As the game has this loot box mechanic and sells tokens for it for real money, I cannot recommend the game with good conscience. It would get a thumbs up from me if it had only free currency lootboxes and just the cosmetics costing real money. 

"
8154,"This is a fun game, however the caveat is that it is pay to win. The issue is the same as any game following the pay to win format, after a while you hit the pay wall in which you either fork out cash to progress or give up. I am almost at that point nine hours in, the game does a good job peppering you with rewards and the dreaded loot boxes to keep progression going. I got this game for free and have enjoyed my time with it, but I would feel pretty pissed if I paid twenty bucks for it and then found out it was another loot box grindfest."
8155,Aulak ma naaa poddak Kammaliyi
8156,veri free dlc yes
8157,nice
8158,easy to play
8159,Surprisingly fun game to play in between ques
8160,yeah
8161,Solid fast paced game with tons of modes to keep you interested.
8162,"At first, I thought the game would be a bit boring, but eventually got bored and wanted to try it out and I was wrong. Game's actually pretty fun! Stragety and the right cards will turn the tide of any battle, with many cards and Masters to go for, who knows what you'll create?

I personally went full-on Crystal-Elf deck... so far having fun with it!"
8163,"Absolutely amazing. Brings back memories of games like Clash Royale.
"
8164,"This game allows you to compete with others in a very fun manor. I'd highly recommend people to play this. From what I'm aware, it's a free game too. However, the only complaint I have is that you have to pay to unlock a lot of the features I wish I could use. While that's not a bad thing since games usually need revenue to improve, I just wish there was a feature where you could unlock these things with in-game currencies that you earn as well, giving players like me, a chance to unlock these things."
8165,Is fun!
8166,Great game!!!
8167,great game esp 2v2!
8168,"tbh thought 'd be trash but its actually addicting and progressive
"
8169,"It's not really an awful game at all. It somehow straddles the line between mobile game and real game.

Unfortunately it just doesn't get away from the mobile elements enough and suffers as a result. The monetization model for it alone is enough to stay away. It's basically just pay to win like most card games out there. And sure you can say that it's 'pay to not grind' but whatever. The way it's implemented means that you either spend tons of time hoping you get the right cards or just buy your way to victory. That's P2Win in my book.

But anyway, I don't think I have to discuss gameplay all that much. You can easily see what the game is all about just by watching footage. There really isn't a lot extra to say. In some ways there is depth to the game, but in others the depth is more or less in hoping the enemy doesn't counter you. Rock, paper scissors doesn't work well in 1v1 games. The 2v2 helps to offset your possible weaknesses or strengthen your strengths, but it's ultimately still too shallow to call 'deep'. Anyone who thinks this game has deep strategy is kidding themselves. I'll be happy to never hear another person compare games like this to chess. Like hearthstone, and many other card games, there just isn't enough here to warrant long term dedication.

I think my second biggest complaint is that there's literally one map. It's the same formula just put on one map. I really hate this. There's no variance to actually think about once you're on the field and how different things will interact once you've learned the game.

Again the game is just too simple to be worth dedication.

I suppose the art style is ok and I love that there are plenty of elf women, but I'm a gameplay first type of person. And while the game does occasionally have moments, they're gone very quickly.

Also why does this game say it has a roguelike mode? I gave it a peek and was basically just shaking my head. I really hate that this is what people consider 'roguelike'. It's not even roguelite let alone roguelike. It's just random buffs/cards and that's literally it. I get yelled at when I ask why League of legends if considered a 'multiplayer online battle arena' and Quake isn't, but oh some dev uses the term roguelike incorrectly and it's ok? What you have here is nothing like rogue. It's just random cards/buffs. Hardly even worth the mention. Same problem I have with FFXIV's palace of the dead. There really isn't a lot of effort put into it so it's so half assed and boring.

I suppose I should've expected as much though from a game with one map.


But anyway, the real reason I have to not recommend is the monetization. If it wasn't for the P2Win I'd say yeah, give it a go, but no. And you might ask 'well how are they supposed to make money?'. The instant response is to charge for cosmetics only or ask an up front fee. I don't care if this is the way you make money, it's garbage. Even real life trading card games at least give you something physical to hold onto and I think those suck too.

What are you gonna do when this game shuts down and all that money you spent is just gone? Say 'oh well, that's life!'. Meanwhile I'll be over here playing all my old games just fine. Seriously screw this crap P2Win garbage. I hate you all for supporting it and making it the standard."
8170,Good
8171,This is a great game to kill time and to relax from the day for me! I enjoyed the Twitch Prime extras that I got as well. I recommend this for anyone who wants something to wind down with and still have fun.
8172,"Only a couple of hours in, but I am really enjoying the game so far.  It's like a real-time version of something like Hearthstone, but more engaging.  It remains to be seen how F2P friendly or annoying it will become after I play it more."
8173,"It's entertaining to build various decks and play around with the comps, not a bad time sink tbh."
8174,The game is fun less of a money grab then expected. fun summoning minions and strategy does come into play. Didnt like the card idea at first but its ok so far.
8175,Fun game. Can play without transactions if you want. But it is a grind. Small transactions make it more enjoyable.
8176,yeyd
8177,"wow actually pretty neat so far, not sure how's the balance, but so far it's a yes"
8178,"Love this game.
Really cool Warcraft-like strategy game.
Playing cards game, but with fighting monsters."
8179,"I Would GREATLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME
Reasons:
-Good As Hell
-Nice game-play
-better than you would think it would be
-GET IT
-Its good"
8180,"Seems fun so far - A little confusing up front, a lot too take in - I'm still unsure if cards are single use etc or if I should be using them?
But I'm confident in time once I understand it all, this will be a really fun game - will be recommending to my friends."
8181,"jogo estilo clash royale muito mais elaborado e com um maior grau de dificuldade
bom desafio"
8182,"After January patch game is unplayable because of freezes every sec.

Dev's done nothing to repair it but you know there is 1000+ stuff to spend your $ on...

//EDIT

Those are well known memory leaks.. You have to restart game/pc after a while of gaming and empty your Documents/MinionMasters/Replays folder. 
Even streamers have to do it regulary. Insane..."
8183,"good game. :).
"
8184,Simple but strategic. Easy to pick up but lots of ways to get creative!
8185,Its a casual game
8186,very funny game
8187,"It's a fun two-lane RTS creature summoning. Squash together a MOBA, RTS, and Hearthstone and you're in the ballpark. The matches go pretty quickly and you're constantly doing something.

That said, I don't think it needs to lay down the F2P layers as thickly as it does. From battle passes (yawn) to the slot machine-like glitter & sound when achieving various not-particularly-impressive achievements, it's all been done.

Publisher: Your game is good. Create matches that are excellent and well-balanced and people will pay without psychological manipulation or this ""me too!"" F2P layer."
8188,very nice
8189,"CCG+Tower Defense, great free to play model, what's not to love?"
8190,"This game's mechanics are fantastic. Simple, tight, but requiring good reactions and a solid tactical plan. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a different card game. My first night I think I played 5 hours of this, straight.  

I would also recommend not paying a cent for it out of spite. The ""home"" ui is terrible and cluttered and more reminiscent of a mobile game trying to bilk your kid out of all your credit card monies. It is fundamentally off-putting and I can only imagine the amount of PC gamers who take one look at it, laugh, and promptly uninstall. The monetization is amateurish at best and predatory at worst.  

THIS IS A GOOD GAME devs, why are you so invested in making it seem cheap and a mobile scam? Drop your FTP prices, offer a REAL premium package that unlocks EVERYTHING, including STORY MISSIONS and maybe we'll talk."
8191,"Game is pretty fun, seems a little pay 2 win heavy but you can still earn stuff over time"
8192,"Fun game, basically a copy of Clash Royale but for PC. I think it is fun because I also like Clash Royale, and knowing/having played Clash Royale really helps you understand and get started in Minion Masters. It is a very strategic game about mana, how to spend it wisely and when to attack/defend. Once you undsterstand what the best counters for different troops are, you will have much more fun and it will be a better experience playing the game."
8193,"Reminiscent of Clash Royale for the mobile. Two teams or four teams face off in a VS match. Colorful well animated graphics, and each battle pushes you closer to unlocking the new Rank or finishing a daily mission. Making you constantly say, ohhh, just one more match. Perfect for those busy days when you just need a quick fix of mayhem."
8194,nice game
8195,This is quite the enjoyable game and quite addicting c: i do recommend
8196,good
8197,Cool game. :D
8198,"really fun, you can build lots of cheap and fun decks without a ton of grinding but it will take a while to build strong decks. (I'm g3 and im using mostly beginner cards, but I bet plat+ requires really good synergy and higher tier cards) In the end, it seems everything can be had for free in time, but there's definitely some decent incentive to buy currency if you feel like it. Personally, as with all other in game currencies, they charge too much for what is free for them to give away. I would buy it if it was 25% the cost, I'm sure more people would and net profits would be better as those who already pay would still pay and just get more. Anyways, great fun, great for quick playthroughs. Think tower defense combined with magic the gathering."
8199,"i enjoying playing minion masters. good game, good graphics, keep up the good work."
8200,"I started playing this because of the free dlc that was offered.  It is a really fun game, especially team battles.  Although there are microtransactions in the game, it is not just play to win.  You can do well with the starter stuff.  Besides, you unlock stuff all of the time by doing quests, so you can eventually buy up or craft the cards you want."
8201,An Easy quick fun game. 2v2 is where its at
8202,"lot of fun 
fast 
easy to get into
even if you have only 10 min  to spend"
8203,"I don't really like losing! Who doesn't and here you have a chance ! Just need to put time into it!
 That's worth it to me!!
Also has a good vibe! Been a long time felt that!
 ;-)
Seems like a great game!
Thanx!"
8204,um joguinho legal para passar o tempo e matar o tedio
8205,nice game
8206,"It's an easy to master game with nice voice over.
And doesn't require too much time per match so you can play plenty of them without having to commit too much time"
8207,"I'm obsessed with this game! Love the creatures and community. They give away lots of free stuff and I like the new battle pass better plus it's cheaper! Only thing I don't like is how hard it is to level up your minions past level one . 6k shards is A LOT. Also some of the crafting is too expensive, 6k for a 5 mana card? The old way of spinning for new cards sucked I'm REALLY glad they changed that because I would miss out on cards and not have enough shards to craft them :(...I spend a little money but not a lot and leveling up all your cards with shards is crazy expensive, I like when you get like 10 copies of a card on battle pass that helps but I still think it's way to expensive to level them up with those shards, like 50 shards for 2 points when you need 80 ugh, or 6k to level up a card. It takes FOREVER to save up a bunch of shards! Paying to unlock adventure stories etc major micro transactions but if you don't really play those modes it's not that big of a deal. Like I'd rather have the option to pay $50 for the game in a deluxe version and have everything unlocked than be nickel and dimed to death unlocking all this stuff. Like keep the free version like it is but add an option to buy a version with every card, adventure mode, master etc unlocked for like $50 and either give WAY more shards to level your cards or make them way cheaper. Other than shards and unlocking adventure mode etc the game itself is really fun to play and the battle pass rewards keep you coming back as well but it does take money to level up your cards and do really good in the game and get farther. I've only been able to get to platinum and then I just get my azz handed to me constantly."
8208,Good.
8209,Epic game I like it
8210,"I very recommend, good game to play foe hours!!!"
8211,nice thank you
8212,seems fun

8214,so far so gooood
8215,"This game is fun and ez to understand.

Fine graphic with less uses of ram"
8216,COOL GAME !! I OFFER THIS ONE!
8217,nice
8218,"Very good game, plays awesome. Great devs :-)

It would be great if the memory leakage could be taken care of but it's fine"
8219,Great casual game to free your mind and just have fun!

8224,"easy to play fun to master, easy access entertainment! give it a try"
8225,"Grabbed this on steam when it was 100% off + the DLC. Very fun game and saved me from suffering the night in boredom. Has a 2v2 mode which I've been doing with a friend, standard 1v1, some VS against AI for rewards and a few other modes you can mess around with. Was a pleasant surprise to say the least!"
8226,like clash of royal :|
8227,Fun game
8228,It's cool nice twist some lamps
8229,good
8230,"pretty fun card game to play while stoned. very intense, or it can be a very quick match. overall a good game"
8231,"Pros: very short matches 
 - fast matchmaking
 - was fun for a couple hours figuring out the mechanics of the game
 - HAS DOUBLES MATCHES!! (2v2s) (arguably the best feature of this game)

Cons: random video lag on lowest settings suggests latency issues?
 - matches snowball very easily
 - a lot of content seems level gated (I think I stopped around lvl 18?)
 - the additional single player chapters must also be purchased with gems

additional thoughts: ended up stopping whilst trying to do the first chapter of the adventure on hard mode. reminds me very much of hearthstone during that time. the frustration of doing it over and over until it can be beat (randomly) is not much to look forward to. (I have spent months on certain single player modes for hearthstone before getting the RNG to work in my favor)

I don't really care for the normal (1v1) game mode all that much and the art/world building/aesthetic doesn't have anything specific that I like. was hoping I could enjoy the single player more, but it seems like it's just another ""live service"" game that will require time, dedication and doing the quests/achievement/events over a long period of time to grow one's collection.

And since I already have hearthstone and league of legends for that; I won't be wanting to add another time-sink game. =/"
8232,"It's Clash Royale. You know Clash Royale? That you play on your phone? Well, it's that. But without little towers. And I dunno why but it's more fun. Maybe. I need a couple dozen more hours to say for sure. I still like Clash Royale but this is good too."
8233,สนุกดีเล่นเพลินๆ
8234,"I honestly only tried it cause it was free but it is very enjoyable it's like a card game / auto chess mash up almost, would defo, recommend at least trying it out."
8235,banana
8236,realm roya but  has a good duo mode not a terrible game many mobile games like it
8237,"Good game, well played. Giff steam levels."
8238,Easy to understand and really fun. 10/10
8239,"It's like Clash Royale but with better units, more choices and much deeper meta-game.  Great for short gaming sessions!"
8240,"Just super fun, all the mons look really well thought out. Good time!"
8241,"Neat game, in-game purchases are annoying but whatever, you can have fun without buying the special currency"
8242,"Nice different take on battle arena card game.  Downloaded it after seeing the good reviews, and found myself playing it for a couple hours without stopping.  Only been at it for a few hours but so far so good."
8243,Cute game and fun.
8244,Good game.
8245,it be fun
8246,its a fun easy game and mind numbing would highly tell others to try out!
8247,Good game FeelsOkayMan :point_right: <3
8248,gg
8249,"good game, but don't forget your credit card!"
8250,Fun fast paced and balanced combat mixes card games and RTS in to one beautiful experience
8251,"This game is super fun, I have spend way more hours thanI thought."
8252,good game
8253,Greatt Game
8254,"It gets very boring after a while when you get to the higher ranks. Lack of full epic and legendary cards for your deck set up and you lose 78% of the time.

While the pacing of the combat is nice and fast, faster than hearth stone card battles; this game is only good for when you are on air flights, long car trips for out of state visits, or maybe on your vacation. I would not waste any time on this if you own a console system, this is a game for poor people only."
8255,"great casual yet  maybe competitive game in the future, has twitch integration for streaming."
8256,"Game shows promise in the first couple hours or so, then its just a cavalcade of failure, and the general community is as toxic as MWO. I realize that the game was not made for free, and that it has to generate revenue somehow, but the amount of greed is EA's Battleground 2 lootbox level."
8257,"Ok so I dont normally play games as these. But I got this one for free recently and I will say it is actually a not bad game to waste a little bit of time on. only have roughly an hour and around 15 matches played, but this game almost has a ""strategic laidbackness"" about it that makes it rather enjoyable. Now can this game be VERY competative, yes, for me, no. Will I play this game? You betcha. Will it be all the time? uhh no :)"
8258,It gud
8259,"good game,i am like it
"
8260,"Very fun and fast-paced, engaging games"
8261,great game and very easy to understand the cards you use in battle
8262,"It's quick and easy to play, at least in the beg the matchmaking it's good, dunno for further lvls tbh"
8263,"Reminds me a lot of Clash Royale, and other games along that vain. That is not a bad thing, in my opinion at least. Very similar mechanics, but still very fun. 8.5/10.

P.S. I got the game for free during a sale, so keep my input with a grain of salt."
8264,super fun to play with freinds
8265,Totally addicting!
8266,"Starts off exciting and quick, slows down pretty fast, but still fun for a free game of this style"
8267,Fun game so far.
8268,FUN AS HELL SPECIALY with friends <3 <3
8269,Got it free early december 2019. It's a lot like clash royale but I find it to be more enjoyable interaction wise. It's way more satisfying to defeat enemy minions/destroy enemy masters because of the physics. It's an 11/10 for me.
8270,Great game !! :))))))
8271,Its fun
8272,free 2.0/10
8273,Because I enjoy the gameplay.  I'm not a fan of the pay to play however.
8274,"I haven't slept since I installed this game.

Help."
8275,"this is a very refreshing way to play a card game. its lively and a live battle, you can use what ever cards you want to use as long as you have the mana for it."
8276,"The game is just different from what I normally play. Not to hard, but still challenging at times."
8277,The Glorious Leaders will come down from his celestial throne and bless those who play this game.
8278,"this game is very fun. it is intense when you see your enemy summon large hordes and your like ""how am i gonna win this?"". the game seems balanced and every battle is a joy regardless of win or loss. i would highly recommend it!"
8279,Fun and addicting
8280,"I don't usually like card games, nor pvp games, but I love this one. The minions are fun. Even I have a chance to win being so inexperienced. Overall, I'm pleased!"
8281,really good and fun to play game
8282,good time waster
8283,sweet
8284,Scratches that Clash Royal itch.
8285,this game has the fastest matchmaking i have ever seen
8286,"Glad I didn't pay for this.This is (yet another) pay to win game. 

Not worth the time or effort you can't get to the rewards unless you pay into the game, and you can't win without the rewards. 

One more game created to rake in cash for the creators, while killing the strategy aspect by allowing players to buy their way to the top of the stack. 

Yawn. Do better."
8287,"its ok
"
8288,Nice game! <3
8289,Fast and good a little p2w
8290,"nice, funny and simple...easy to play....great to make something difrent"
8291,This game makes me feel as if it is like clash royale but on pc and is very balance (imo) Got the hang of the game straight away and some other may have to take more time to get used to it. Please do give some time to getting used to as this may be a great game for Esports play and so on... This has a great rewarding system and isn't over done by having 30 cards and so on... loot seems to be great when leveling up and so far all games have been won. When the game develops i will start to spot the improvements but as of now i really am enjoying this game. Thank you for making it free for this weekend
8292,fast and fun game

8300,Clash royale with better graphics xD
8301,"It's a simple concept:
1) Two - Four players depending on the game mode
2) summon minions depending on the amount of mana you have
3) kick someone's butt
But there's so much more to it than that, there's strategy and timing, and i think that makes this game worth the free price tag, maybe even the battle pass"
8302,addictive
8303,crash royales msgavsi
8304,goood game really
8305,Reminds me of Clash Royale
8306,Pretty fun game ^ ^ it gets better if u bring a friend along and can actually communicate.
8307,"great game, fun game to pass some time"
8308,"Nice free game!
I really like the idea of  using cards to summon creatures that block and use abilities by themselves. 
Maybe I would have enjoyed more variety in terms of single player experience. 
Nevertheless, it's a fresh original game.
Worth trying!"
8309,"Fun game, will probably play for a week then never again."
8310,Fun
8311,i don't know how much it speaks to the balance of the game but i won like 6 games in a row so far as a complete begginer
8312,game fun xD

8334,VERI GOOD<3
8335,"Awesome game, very beginner friendly."
8336,Fun and simple
8337,"so far games are faced paced, and the currency is drip-fed at a pretty acceptable rate. The animations/assest/art quality are pretty good.  I just unlocked the ""adventures"" feature, so this may answer one or two of my other questions.  Really digging the game so far, matches tend to be about 5min or less, and I will update this review once I play adventures for a little bit. 

i have zero clue what ""Glory"" is or how the heck it works."

8342,"Quite a fun game actually, but reeeeally overmonetized.
Get the boosterpacs!
Spin the wheel!
Buy the Battlepass!
Also the heroes!
The base gameplay is quite fun, but I can't recommend a game that is preying on it's userbase this hard to anyone."
8343,"there i played it, it's shit now go away literally no one likes you"
8344,I am enjoying it quite well.
8345,"Fun, worried about strategy scope after a number of hours.

So far really enjoying."
8346,"Joining this game because it's Free!!
Amazing 100% FREE
Sorry for the maker, HAHAHA
I think it's like chess and card game mix together, and it's fun (I've played for half hour)
i think after a week, i will know that is this really fun to play with"
8347,Love this. Great game.
8348,good so far
8349,"Everyone who loves card games, should try play this free game, even if you don't like real time games.

This game is very noob friendly, if lose, you have big chance play vs very bad player(most likely bot). This way you always have fun. Very important thing, you can't level up cards, like in pay to win ""clash royale"", so enemy cards in vacuum will have always same power as yours. 

This game have battle pass(tons of rewards), which you can buy with $$$  or rubies - hard earned in game currency, but if play every other day, get diamond rank on both queues, sometimes get 6 wins in mayhem(join discord for netdeck), you should have enough rubies for battle pass each time."
8350,IT'S SUPER FUN!! Solo or with a friend. GG to the game developers ^_^
8351,"Fun game that you don't need to be too invested in, with nice design and good mechanics."
8352,the only game i got for free and actually spent money in the shop
8353,very addictive can prob spend hours playing without getting bored
8354,"the game is amazing addictive smart and also gives you clash royale vibes witch is great i remember playing csgo and not really having fun until this game popped up and im instantlyhaving fun
"
8355,"After 3 hours i can tell that this game has definitely something to it. Games are fast and there is always some action. Reward system does it's job as it makes you to want more rewards! It is free to play also, I recommend it."
8356,.
8357,love this game so much
8358,Nice Nice
8359,It's free and it's fun. What is not to like?
8360,"I'm new into it but it seems fun. It's sort of like HotS, but instead of playing one character, you spawn 'cards' characters that fight for you."
8361,interesante
8362,"Easy to learn, not so hard to master. Relatively not p2w and very fun in the beginning, but can get boring quickly. Nice game though"
8363,nice game first time playing sth like this
8364,"Just started the game as I received it for free and so far it looks like a well polished PC version of the infamous mobile game Clash Royale. They are constantly throwing at me free rewards for everything do of course I am enjoying it, but so far I am having fun with it and it looks also less frustrating than CR, games like these feel so much better to play on pc than on the smartphone in my opinion.
Is it pay to win? Hmmmm, I don't know, but so far I am constantly beating people just with the starter deck! I do assume than stronger cards will be very important in a further point in the game, there is a lot of in-game purchase features, like the battle pass. But for playing casual at the start it is fun!"
8365,a intering  game
8366,you need to play it with ur friends
8367,its a deceptively simple yet complex game. you have to be able to read the field and know what minions to summon. also its light and snacky(play for 5mins or 5 hours) just remember to take breaks. lol  ;)
8368,This game is awsome
8369,"Great game, i hope this game go through E-sport tournament."
8370,"Great game
"
8371,Dogshit spamming game
8372,Fun Game
8373,"This game is gonna steal your time, nothing more: no skill, just RNG. Donating isn't obligatory but creator will do everything to get money from you. So be careful with this sh*t.
I would not recomend anybody to play this game."
8374,"Great game, easy to get into it."
8375,Yes
8376,"Lots of pew pew and slashy slash, not as much P2W as I thought it would be.

Many good much recommend."
8377,Game is freakin fun!
8378,"Following line sums it up:
-- If you have played either Teamfight Tactics or Dota Underlords then this game is very similar but much better and has very generous F2P --

I was never into the whole Auto Chess thing because besides of positioning you have no control over your army, hero upgrades are RNG, items have RNG and its just plain boring watching your team fight only the AI.

In Minion Masters you can spawn your minions any place you like, counter your enemy minions by spawning appropriate counters, even time your spawn in a place and time that predicting enemy minion auto attack to get first strike.

In other words you actually control the battle even if the creeps attack on their own.

Also.

It has ALOT of free stuff. Like, at the moment of writing a whole DLC is free and theres tons of code and free rewards.
"
8379,legit
8380,"Fun, nice balance of randomness/strategy/skill, low to no paywall."
8381,"New to this, but sweet fun game, like chess in real-time I guess :)"
8382,kinda repetitive but really fun
8383,"Hello Guys !!
This is a review on this game and i have to tell you this game IS GOooooooooooooooooood !!!.
 No srsly this game is absoulutely been with me since the beginning .."
8384,It's just clash royal but less pay to win with the season pass stuff every game has no to try to get you to pay money for stuff you can earn if you just grind it out. If you don't mind grinding and you like tug of war games like tides of war etc then you'll like it
8385,"Not too hard , not too easy, just right."
8386,This game is pretty lit fahm!
8387,"Cute game, and the matches are a bit fun. But all the rubies and gold and season tokens and treasure chests and whatnot are clearly designed to separate you from your money. A thumbs down on principle, there's too much ""casino"" here, and although I haven't spent a cent on the game, I fear young kids will unknowingly blow hundreds if they and their parents aren't careful. It's an unethical business model."
8388,"once this game gets some minor tweaks and cleaned up a bit, its going to get be awesome! it is still very fun right now"
8389,I like the way you can spin the chests for extra goodness.
8390,great game alota depth to the battles
8391,Pretty fun but as with all Card games you gotta have the best cards
8392,good game
8393,bad game
8394,"This is a surprisingly addictive game with a great free to play formula.  At first glance it seems too simple to be any fun, but I find it to be a fast paced game with a great deal of strategy involved.  Most importantly, it's fun - but I also don't feel like people who drop cash on this game are given much of an advantage, making it a viable game to just pick up and play.  If you subscribe to things like Amazon (Twitch) Prime, you get expansion starters for free all the time.  As I write this, there are 4 themed expansions out and I have received all of them for free through various steam promotions and Amazon Prime Promotions (I can't recall if I got one in a humble bundle or not).  I literally got all four expansions for free over the last year or so, which is just about a $60 value, so I had to try the game.  No regrets whatsoever, I'm having a lot of fun."
8395,The just ruined the game. I'm uninstalling.
8396,Nice.
8397,玩法很棒，体验极佳，这款游戏蛮有创意
8398,"Nice game, i realy enjoy the gameplay , i recomand to anyone that likes adventure games"
8399,i actually liked this.
8400,Very interesting game
8401," its a cool game, but If there was merch I would buy it. no cap"
8402,fun
8403,Great so far. Kinda like Clash Royale but with deeper system
8404,this game is like what we all wanted when we used to play yugioh its like a card game with living mobs and i really enjoy it so far
8405,"Great game, easy to learn and enjoy - hard to master. Absolute gold."
8406,cool stuff
8407,nice
8408,"Easy to catch on, fast rounds"
8409,interesting Card Game fun to play
8410,"its good fun, seeminlgy lots of strats."
8411,"fun, easy to start, seems beginner friendly"
8412,"I'm not really a fan of card style battles, but this one is cool! Super sound, great graphics, fun game play, and gets ya interested and hooked quite fast. And with team battles available, you feel less intimidated to play."
8413,its cool
8414,Çok sevdim ben
8415,"great game simple and fun, recommendation"
8416,Fun strategy game! Quick matches make it a nice casual game.
8417,"Great graphics and features, the battle only last about 5' which help it keep the interest"
8418,SPICY GAME
8419,"Great playability. It works way better on my older system then my brand new top of the range gaming system, so that is dissapointing. Would be great for a smooth running ray shader version that works on all RTX range of cards, otherwise the game will just stagnate."
8420,good game
8421,love it is like clash royle
8422,l
8423,"keeps disconnecting during matches. very frustrating
this is actually a very fun game but the the disconnects makes it a terrible experience

and some of the disconnect happens when you are in a match
i lost points and my rank went down
there was also one game on a team battle that we won
but the prompt showed that i was disconnected and when i clicked ok the game closed
i did not get credited for the win and i lost ranking experience

i have had this for almost a week and everyday i have the same problems
the constant disconnects ruined the game for me 
the loss of rank from a winning game just because of a disconnect is a sad experience

i am quitting this game"
8424,fast paced good game.
8425,Lots of free stuff. Nice game to compete and burn time. More strategy than anticipated. I am really enjoying myself so far.
8426,It's a stratigic game and good for gamers
8427,Fun to play ;) Also relly easy and not hard
8428,cool game... havent rllly played so i cant judge but so far its ok
8429,Great game!
8430,very fun currently addicted
8431,"Simple concept, fun to play"
8432,Easy and fun!
8433,Cool game!
8434,"I wasn't sure how fun this would really be, but I've gotten hooked on it. Lots of room for tactical gameplay!"
8435,"Simple to play, hard to master. Easy quick fun for killing times"
8436,is good
8437,"Add more characters PLZ THNX!!!

LIZARD MAN LEADER NOW!!"
8438,9/10
8439,Cool enough
8440,"It has a charm that brings me back, it's enough to keep me interested. The art style is good and the game play is solid."
8441,"A fun game with some cool team fighting mechanics. People say its a copy of clash royale, and I would disagree. The genre is the same, but the game is very different. I would reccommend!"
8442,"Honestly love this game and considering the game being free and the two card packs you get for free ( one from steam and one from twitch prime) this game is an excellent value. Reminds me of battleforge if it was a moba. The masters and their abilities are very similar to a moba but in a card battler setting. Very awesome compared to many other card games i have played and worth checking out. Looking forward to the future of this game and the many hours I am gonna dump into it. 

PS for anyone complaining about the pay to win its a card game and i have won every match playing with the cards that i got for free. GET GOOD SCRUBS :P"
8443,Very fun and super addictive!
8444,"fun for a free game, real time hearthstone with some cool twists, some depth here if you want to pay money, but vanilla is still ok
"
8445,"Is A very fun Game that does not involve any kind of neccesary transactions.
I would pay money for this
THIS GAME IS WORTH LIKE 20 DOLLARS, AND IT IS FREE!!!!
Seriously though, I am very much enjoying this."
8446,"I really like it, because I've just started and can say already got the idea so far I've a winning streak till bronze 2, but that's not so important- I enjoy the graphics, the gameplay, the matchmaking(very fast- amazing 5 seconds max). Literally have no major critic, it's a very fun and enjoyable game :-)"
8447,its fun
8448,Fun
8449,great chill game for those who just want to play and chill!
8450,i like it
8451,Its fun.
8452,Tons of fun!
8453,Pretty fun.  Seems like a deck-building MOBA.
8454,"Fast paced, no game balance, expect 20+ losses in a row for no reason"
8455,Very good and interesting
8456,"I was having fun until i hit level 5 and then suddenly every game seemed to lag weirdly until i lost even though i was previously winning,felt like cheating was going on even if it wasnt,felt like it!
So tbh i wont play it again and i cant recommend it even though its free."
8457,Excellent game very enjoyable strategical and well thoughout
8458,Pretty fun f2p game. Seems balanced enough.
8459,Quick easy fun game.
8460,Well designed game with a high degree of polish
8461,Interesting take on minion games + card collecting
8462,"Fun game and its free.
Definitely worth giving a try with friends"
8463,"Only just started playing, initial impressions are good, and I'll keep playing!"
8464,very cool
8465,easy to learn good deals going on right now can play solo or with a friend
8466,"Simple controls, fun gameplay with a lot of room for tactical choices, and overall a polished experience."
8467,like clash royal but axtualy fun
8468,Real fun game to play!
8469,"Card based tug of war game, takes grinding to get all the stuff you want and to make it up the ranks but it is a fun grind."
8470,"It's awesome!! very cool. I play  MTG, LOL, Starcraft 2 Etc"
8471,Awesome game super fun features
8472,Easy to play and fun not bad to pass some time
8473,Yes
8474,<loovely
8475,"The gameplay doesn't feel deep at all.  Other than presentation, I found no redeeming qualities in the brief time I spent in game.  Frankly, it feels like a cash grab."
8476,Great game
8477,always-online
8478,This game is super fun and there are a lot of synergys that you can create and use to your advantage.
8479,"It's a mobile game that's been revamped for PC, but that's not a bad thing at all. Its fun and the audio and art is all very well done. Fun gameplay. I'm only level 13 at the time of posting this but it seems like there's a lot of different decks to build."
8480,best game ever
8481,"It's just like the old magic game that was on the original xbox, but better.
"
8482,Its fun and simple. only been playing a few hours but enjoying it alot
8483,pretty fun game not gonna lie
8484,It's like a fancy mobile game. Full of micro transactions. If youre into this type of gameplay then its not that bad
8485,Interesting take on pvp
8486,Free game is fun i am sucker i pay £4 see you in 2 months and £400 later thank you bye.
8487,"been playing a few hours now, seems fun so far.

I have a little concerns about the tapering effect of a free play game but right now its been a blast"
8488,fun warhammer meets mtg
8489,"it is like clash of clans, basically. Probably extremely pay 2 win but the start is fun."
8490,this game is actually very fun : )
8491,fresh game with deckbuilding for me :)
8492,The biggest Chung
8493,Great game ;)
8494,good game
8495,i have played heartstone and this feels like a step up there is more possibilities for a more diverse out come and not just doing damage but when to take damage very nice
8496,"A lot of fun! Not played much yet, but so far, seems to heva depth."
8497,"Reminds me of a mixture of games like hearthstone and Wintermaul Wars(warz) from WC3 terrain editor. So far i am really enjoying the degree of strategy required, sadly it does seem slightly pay to win."
8498,yes
8499,this reminds me of clash royale super fun
8500,Pay to win!! If you are not willing to pay then forget winning matches and make your way to the top.
8501,It's bad
8502,This game is so fuun!
8503,"This game is calm and chill, very enjoyable!"
8504,I've been longing and searching for a good game where you build your own deck and your cards actually form onto the arena and fight one another. This is not only a high quality game but also has so much to offer now and in the future. Now obviously with any good game there are some early development bugs but aside from that i HIGHLY recommend you play this. Minion Masters has a lot of potential and i believe it deserves more attention than it currently has. P.S the battlepass is better than Fortnite's....
8505,Don't have to spend money on this game to get good cards. Fun easy to learn
8506,"I wasn't espesting to have fun :D
"
8507,"The game is a typical cash grab. You *can* get everything with grinding but after the initial flurry of levels it slows down considerably. Save whatever currency you get then around level 25 when things slow down you can try to build a functional deck. Good luck,

EDIT: Played it more and changed to would recommend. It's quick rounds, simple gameplay, makes a great time filler between rounds of other games. Still wouldn't spend money on it though."
8508,It's just fine for a game that's free.
8509,its a fun game
8510,It's good and has enough depth to allow skilled players to have an edge. A refreshing change from games like Underlords and their ilk.
8511,simple fun
8512,"Just started playing. Fairly intuitive game. I'm not sure about the different currencies. Pay to win for some folks, but it is a fun game anyway in my opinion. I don't have long wait times to get in games. <Posted Dec. 7 2019>"
8513,nice
8514,There was no fun to be found in this blatant money grab
8515,"Got drawn in when they advertised a roguelike mode. What a disappointment.

Right off the bat, annoyed that I first had to play a bunch of PvP before getting access to the mode. Then, when I finally gained access, it turned out to be a single hero I could play in a measly 5 matches against the same enemies each time, and after which you have to pay real money to keep going.

Also, for getting the game on a ""free weekend"", it didn't feel like I got anything. Instead I was bombarded by microtransactions on each screen, buy a battlepass, buy card packs, buy masters... none of it seemed very free to play."
8516,fun game
8517,Very fun and free <3
8518,glued to it. tooo good
8519,Really enjoying this game!
8520,Superb game! U all should try!
8521,"I love this game. It is quick and easy to learn. Hard to to master. This is the hearthstone i was looking for on steam, but better."
8522,"Fun Clash Royale or RWBY based game, but sideways, in a kind of 3d style. The mouse pointer is a bit laggy, and there should be an ""detect graphic performance"" thing, I had to tweak around for an hour to find a good setting, still not the best. But it is a nice game! Maybe when playing 2x2 more separate towers? lilke a square field instead of oval? Great game!"
8523,It's ok for a slot machine.
8524,Easy to pick up and looks beautiful
8525,"Like Clash Royale, but with hands-on masters"
8526,yes
8527,"Very fun and adictive game....try it, you will not be disapointed :)"
8528,Fun game so far. Easy to understand and lots to win.
8529,Feels like clash royale had an evolution. So far so good
8530,this game is so fun you will never be bored
8531,this is the best game ever you must play it
8532,"nice graphic !! 
beutiful minion and champions!!
 i love this game :3
"
8533,funny
8534,"Simple to pick up and play, but like all good games has the depth to take a long time to master.  Unlike MOBA type games does not require twitch reactions and accuracy but instead rewards calm thought and planning ahead to win.  Multiple game modes to play, but could do with some more offline options.  Graphics are rather cutesy and will not tax lower-end systems.  Very good range of unit types with a clear distinction between factions.

Gripes:   Would like to be able to filter units by faction or attack type (melee/flyer/buildings)"
8535,The game is fun because you have to survive and the best thing is you dont know what the enemy got
8536,good clean fun love it
8537,This game is a peice of sh*t i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a game to be serious about a game stupid content spaghetti code and not to mention the HUGE DISAPOINTMENTS OF EACH NEW EXPANSION and delays I'm saying this as a person who played this horse sh*t for 200 hrs.
8538,Good game
8539,Yes
8540,"Its so addicted i dont know why, it feels the gap of 2020 games"
8541,Feel like copying the Clash Royale?
8542,Good!
8543,"The game disconnects during matches far too often. Ruined the fun I was trying to have in PVP. Sure I can play challenges and adventure but I should not be experiencing these ""time out, error you have left the game"" messages. I have a 600mbps connection and my PC is hooked directly into the router, no wifi. I don't have these issues with my regular games. 

Maybe I'll try again another time."
8544,clash royale but upgraded.
8545,ye its pretty good
8546,hh
8547,Very addictive!!!
8548,Chill
8549,Awesome game. Doesnt feel like you need to purchase stuff. Cool game for a game or 2 every now and then
8550,have fun!~
8551,"I made an in-game purchase but found the item received wasn't what I thought it would be. I immediately stopped playing the game and contacted support for a refund.

They pretty much said, we don't give refunds for any reason. Not a good way for a F2P game to treat someone that's willing to spend money on their game.

They just lost a paying customer who will now blacklist the company."
8552,This game is waaaay better than Ski Free.  Not even comparable!
8553,A very fun and addicting strategic game.
8554,Great bit of fun
8555,is good
8556,"game is going fantastic, it has a lot of mechanics and variations on all matches, great game guys !"
8557,good
8558,If you played Clash Royale on android you need to play this. Very addicting and rewarding game (at least at the beggining)
8559,Eh...
8560,0/10
8561,Nah.
8562,Good to kill some time
8563,is fun so far
8564,This is a fun game. Its very easy to figure out if you have played other moba royale games.
8565,"This is a fun little game. But then you get rap-d buy guys that are 20-30 lvl's higher then you. Your beating a guy you have 80% life and e has 10-20% life left and he wins F_N BS. Play vs machine more fun. PAY to WIN PAY TO WIN weeeeeeeee. lot's of BS in this game like your at 2000 hp's and the bad guys is at 400 he he wins with 3 guys
"
8566,"Very good graphic, easy to learn to play and fun!"
8567,Fun and easy game even for a casual gamer like me
8568,"Great game. Doesn't feel like a grind at all. Great challanges, very fair."
8569,J
8570,"mix of clash royal and southpark phone destroyer except you wont be destroyed cause the opponent's cards are higher rank than yours. your deck strength determines how much exp you get towards your battle pass but your units are the same strength as someone who's put more money in.
 that said there's lots of card packs/heroes/skins/battle pass bonuses to buy with money and the 3 in game currencies.

if you dont like f2p mechanics you'll probly hate this. if you like things like clash royal or phone destroyers try this out.
"
8571,Good game thus far nice time killer. Gets addicting might start streaming this when i get back on that or maybe some game play videos.
8572,its fun game
8573,"I'm lazy to write one, so I'mma say it's fun."
8574,Get it for free yo
8575,Not bad at all
8576,I like the fact that most battles is short so one can fit many in a 30 min play span.
8577,"its a fun game to play !
"
8578,It's pretty good as far as the genre is concerned.
8579,"Another mobile game on steam, need I really say more. Glad I didnt pay for it, for sure, kinda boring and slow. Oh and thats when you can actually login."
8580,This game is so fun! I might just keep playing for hours!
8581,<3 Fun
8582,"Short rounds make losing more of an annoyance than anything truly frustrating, and it's a lot of fun to play!"
8583,"fun, free, enjoyable!"
8584,"A pretty solid strategy game.  1v1, 2v2 matches.   The whole matchmaking system is based around ranked,  every game counts towards your rank.  Seems like a pretty solid system."
8585,A great alternative to Clash Royale! I'd even say it's better!
8586,very fun
8587,"It's not too hard to get all the cards since you get a lot of them for free. Though, not hard still means you need to play a lot. The problem with it is that there are some imbalanced stuffs."
8588,"A solid fresh new take on an old concept, gameplay is a fast and frantic but very fun experience"
8589,"I tho i need money to get good at this game.

not even spending a dime and already at top 3 tier..
this game is fun, well ballanced, you dont need money to be good, just make a good deck and combine with the skill of your hero.

5/5"
8590,coll game
8591,i liked card shuffle from WC3 custom games and this is its advanced version very well done
8592,Very fun
8593,This game is sick.
8594,"I like the flow of this game.  It has a neat composition.  It plays well.  The ""GIVE US MONEY 6 DAYS LEFT"" stuff is annoying, but sure they gotta make their money.  Seems like a quality game to me.  I will see how long it takes for me to get tired of it.  It's fun."
8595,It good.
8596,Good
8597,yes
8598,"decent game, fun to play when you want to zone out and listen to a podcast. I will probably put it down in a while but i will come back to it when im bored or something."
8599,This game has been a lot of fun. Playing with friends and working together is awesome. A strategic standpoint helps a lot!
8600,Inoffensive. Plenty of money sinks make it feel like a mobile game.
8601,"I'm enjoying it, I love Magic, and this is kinda like a dorky less cool video game version, would tell a friend :)"
8602,Cool Monsters Mostly the Stone Monsters
8603,Just fun with some depth to strategy.
8604,This is amozing!!! and yes I spelt that correctly... Amazing was to bad of a word to use
8605,really enjoyable
8606,Fun and easy battler
8607,This game is good and exceeds all expectations!
8608,interesting and fun!!
8609,"This is a very fun game. I highly suggest anyone who wants a game that's quick and fun to play, but also actually feels like a game instead of some mobile ripoff, play this."
8610,nice
8611,"jeu super rafraîchissant et amusant, en plus parties rapides donc pas de lassitude. Bravo."
8612,Great fun to play with a friend if you enjoy these type of games
8613,"poooooooooooooooooooooooop /:( :)
"
8614,I like it ~ its fun~
8615,witam bardzo pozytywna gra warta zakupu zakupiłem ją za namową streamera o nicku demonzz1 który grał w nią na swoim stream gra ma bardzo ciekawą oprawę graficzną jak i  dźwiękową nie brakuje również świetnej mechaniki każdemu polecam zaopatrzyć się w dlc pozdrawiam
8616,godd games
8617,Fun Game - very addictive
8618,"Simpler than other deck-building games with fewer cards per deck  but with the inclusion of time/speed of your spells and the cycling cards  it becomes  much more complex in other ways.
"
8619,NICE GAME
8620,Fast gameplay with countless deck combinations
8621,jogo tops
8622,Easy to learn fun fun fun i really enjoy this game i know i 'll be playing lots of this thanks steam and devs for the free version but to be honest had i payed for this game def worth every penny i highly recommend you won't regret it so much fun!
8623,Randomly take away content that I paid for and cant reach a single person on the team
8624,"This game sucks! It's a pay to win a card game, nothing interesting I found here. And, once u open it, you'll see no 'exit' option to close this stupid game. They know you will never open again, that's why they removed that 'exit' option I guess :P"
8625,"good game 
"
8626,"Yeah, this game sucks as F2P. Flat out."
8627,OK NOT BAD GAME
8628,tower defence feel and match are fast.
8629,"this is a prety good tower defence , fast pace game !!!"
8630,nice to have a good game that doesn't take forever to play!!
8631,Quick and easy to pick up and quite fun.
8632,the numbers go up
8633,"I can't stop playing, help."
8634,"Pretty fun for now, will update later"
8635,"A concept with combat that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Ever-evolving gameplay with new strategies and new cards. - not ptw at all

it's free - give it a try!"
8636,"Its not bad, and fair as in cost and that's rare these days"
8637,"Its really fun with a good card selection, the only thing i wish was that there could be more Hero's without buying the pass. dont get me wrong i will buy it , but come on guys."
8638,"RNG game just like any other, win some, loose more or pay....no thanks !"
8639,I cast Fireball!
8640,Fun game
8641,Great game i like it.
8642,Really nice game :)
8643,"Fast paced strategy with great visuals. Also have you heard this announcer, Priceless! Fun game I can see myself dumping a ton of time into."
8644,"Smooth gameplay, slick visuals, 2v2 team fights seem fun."
8645,Fun game so far.
8646,"Awesome game, it just keeps me playing!"
8647,It's fun
8648,Very impressed with game play. Smooth and works on my laptop no problems. Physics and charecter movements are as you would expect and easy to pick up. I'm very new to it but i guess things will get much more complicated later in the game and look forward to playing some more :) Huge thumbs up guys great game!
8649,Neat
8650,I like dismantling other player decks.

8652,"If anyone says this game is ""pay to win"" check their play time. The game is meant to have cards earned through play, however, you can also buy lots of gems to buy rolls at cards if you want. I've never wanted/needed to do that and have almost every card in the game through very casual play. One of the very few free to play games that is loyal to customers above microtransactions.  I've been playing this game for a little over 2 years I believe.  While I did purchase the premium upgrade initially ($20), I've never needed or wanted to purchase anything else unless it was funny/cool skins. I've been inclined to spend money on skins to support the devs because of how great this dev team has been to this game and the players. There have some mistakes here and there along the way but I've always seen them attempt to fix them in a way that I think they truly believe will make the players happy and have a better experience."
8653,pretty fun and i feels rewarding when you level and win games and doesnt feel too overwhelming for free players
8654,pretty good Tower Defense type game
8655,"Feel Battle Royale on phone but better
\"
8656,"Very good, addictive game. Power cards are not the unique but the common ones - P2W not a thing.. Ranking system needs to be redone other than that no complaints. Get it, it's free.
"
8657,Great fun game and free. You can't beat that.
8658,Great fun. The game has enough depth for casual and extensive gaming.
8659,I don't really know what I went into the game expecting but I did notice that it has some pretty positive reviews. I'm still not entirely sure what I'm doing and I'm also pretty sure I could be doing better but even with the losses I'm taking I'm finding that I don't much mind. The gameplay is fun and just the added mechanics of card placement and required aiming make the game very unique. It's a very fun experience so far!
8660,"Just starting out you can see that this game involves quite an extensive amount of strategy ,and in team battles... you really need a cooperative mate for it.
The game at first glance peppers you with free stuff ,but the real meat of the cards you will either grind shards, or simply throw money, etc. You get the idea.
Now am i saying the games pay to win. No
If you want to win mindlessly and not care about strategy. Sure pay to win.
Learning to utilize what you have and pull some seriously hilarious matches. Priceless.
The team ranking could use a little work.
This review will change as time goes and I get to see more of what it has to offer, but will recommend for now."
8661,Fun game so far
8662,"Only been playing for a little bit, not sure how pay to win end game is but it's very fun leveling up."
8663,Good
8664,this game is soo good give it a try
8665,I'm addicted to this game I love it.
8666,"O  jogo é bem divertido até quando você pega platina, depois disso os adversários só tem cards roubadas e deixa a desejar um pouco em função de ser p2w nesse quesito."
8667,"Interesting game.Just started playing today. Didn't expect it to be as graphically demanding but regardless it is an enjoyable experience if you just want to cool down and take a break from open world games, fps , rpg and so on."
8668,ok
8669,"Really great game. Deep gameplay. Minutes to learn, months to master. Free to play friendly!"
8670,Funny game
8671,nice
8672,very good
8673,"Very funny game, its not so random as many cards game i played, and at first look it's not so p2w as others."
8674,Great!
8675,A combination of battle chess and tower defence. Very creative!
8676,"nice game -_-
"
8677,Actually surprisingly fun. Would definitely give it a shot if you like these sorts of games.
8678,"It looks like a mobile game on steam, but don't let that fool you. The game has the same pay model as Heartstone. So you can get an edge with paying for it, but you can get everything without paying. You will just have to play the game a lot.

Anyway, it's pretty fun. Especially in co-op it's a fun game. You make a deck and you can actually focus your deck on the endgame while your mate takes on the early game. Stuff like that. 

Also the matches are pretty fast. All in all a fun, fast and good working lane battle game. Recommended!"
8679,"its a cool little tower defence game with competitive aspects.  gj and gg
"
8680,"I've recently been creating a ""Lane defense"" resource-management game and Minion Masters has inspired me to keep it up. My game is in no shape, way or form the same as Minion Masters, but it is what I would one day hope to accomplish and produce!

Incredibly smooth, fluid, fun and not least: enjoyable!

Very beginner-friendly game with a good introduction to the game. The cards are easy to read and understand and I can very quickly build decks with cards that complement each other!"
8681,"Awesome gameplay, no lagging and every button works like it should and that is a 10/10 in my book"
8682,Really enjoyable game
8683,"nice game
"
8684,"Game starts out interesting but quickly devolves into a mindless grindy game with no real purpose or goal other that winning more battles to go up in rankings to win more battles etc.  None of the minions are particularly memorable and I can't even remember the name of a single one. Almost all the ""Masters"" are locked behind a paywall which is kind of poo. 

The gameplay itself is fun at the start but gets boring fast. There is no real voice acting in the game apart from the ""narrator"" at the start of the game which makes the game seem more interesting that it really is. Even the ""Adventure"" mode has no real story apart from 2 lines of exposition followed by a battle and the nest stage where it is repeated again.

Almost everything in the game is behind  a paywall including avatars, masters, the red crystal things that I assume are used to draw more minions and even AREA MAPS. With the measly amount of red crystals I earned playing for free, I assume it would take weeks to get this items by grinding which I'm obviously not going to do.

Overall, 1/10. A complete waste of time."
8685,"Great game, lots of fun. I love playing it after a long day of work, it's not physically demanding or straining and I'm able to relax while having some light-hearted fun, preferably playing together with a friend.

Oh, and can totally be played without paying. It's the fairest free-to-play game I have found so far in that regard!"
8686,"Really fun game, lots of different cards and strategies you can implement. Really loving the 2v2 mode as my friends and I have a great time trying out all these crazy tactics. Great fun, simple, and free! Definitely worth the download."
8687,waw
8688,game rapido e divertido muito bom
8689,Not pay to win. Do not spend money. I like to play bad games.
8690,good game
8691,.
8692,FUCK THIS GAME PAY TO WIN BITCH
8693,fun game
8694,"A lot of good fun to be had. I only spent 5 dollars.I made top 20 for 2v2 random teams and top 40 for solo in my first season. Not Pay to win, more practice to win."
8695,"BSOD caused by memory leaks. Other than that, game is so-so"
8696,este jogo e muito bom  mesno
8697,Just no
8698,...................................................................
8699,"I haven't hit the Pay-2-Win wall yet, i'm having fun."
8700,Very addictive
8701,I'm gonna make minion masters 2
8702,This game makes so much funnnnnn :). Thank you for the game.
8703,"its a fun game and veary competitive
"
8704,very fun
8705,is gut
8706,Awesome game !!! Totally love it !
8707,"Kazuma and Megumin ""more than friends"" ..."
8708,great leisure game
8709,Brilliant addictive game.
8710,It's a fun take on a card game. The matches are fairly short so it's easy to experiment and losing feels a lot less punishing.
8711,It's a fun game and easy to learn
8712,Clash Royale for PC with PvM modes.
8713,Clash Royale-ish but infinitley better and not pay to win
8714,fun
8715,"I really enjoy card games and i love ones that have a unique twist on it. Having your cards summon actual units that walk across the board is a nice touch making it have a nice strategy to it making you think which cards you want to play at that moment and what 10 cards do you want to bring to the table before the game. The selection of cards is rather big and having unique factions among the cards is a nice touch too. My only problem with this game is the further you go in the ranks the more likely you will get annoyed with fighting similar deck builds and eventually fighting cheese decks that work so horribly well that you wonder why you should play any other build of cards. Overall though, its a fun game and the developers have been awesome with giving away their DLC's and their new adventure mode is a nice addon to the game that i hope they expand upon."
8716,"I never really loved MOBAs. Nor did I ever really love the all the card-based games like Hearthstone and all that followed.
Minion Masters, however, is great. It's fast-paced, innovative, fun, and requires both skill and knowledge."
8717,nice game and epic battle
8718,cool
8719,"Basic mobile port to milk users from money, game is not bad, but whenever i see micro transactions in this numbers and grindy game design, i know ""i m in a*s"", game runs alright, but all we see is this casual-style gameplay and micro transactions/grinding systems, since game is free2try you might like it, i didn't."
8720,"So far it's fun and fast paced.
EDIT: At 7 hours played I don't want to give negative review,  i can say it's a good game in my opinion but it's not my thing. It take a lot of grind to get new cards and collect gold or rubies but that is the same with every ""free"" game."
8721,good
8722,this game is sick
8723,good for killing time
8724,Neat game and idea. enjoying it so far.
8725,Fun. Different. Fast pace. Innovative.
8726,goof
8727,"Bad to no support, read following comment."
8728,supppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
8729,"Really fun, especially with a friend!"
8730,awesome game and I really do enjoy it although I can't lower down the graphic because it'll crash the game and I have to restart my laptop to play it again but its still in the same graphics so pls fix this and thx
8731,A lot of fun. I'm enjoying it.
8732,Most my matches last me ~2-3 minutes. Once in a while I will have a 7 minute-ish match. The frequency of matches and their short term nature makes this game viable for my need to spread my attention around and not ignore people that care about me.
8733,"The people that are reviewing this game... look at their hours played.  If it's less than 10 hours, they haven't got the scope of the game and don't realize what they're saying when they say pay to win.  It's definitely *not* pay to win because although you can spend real loonies or dollars to get better cards faster, you have to learn how to use the cards with a solid deck that supports them.  You have to learn what the bridges do and also what the other masters do.  You also have to learn how to best utilize your master with a supporting deck to truly be successful.  Don't listen to the haters.  Listen to your heart.

Plus, you can get everything in the game that anyone else who pays anything all the time.  You just have to grind it... and how could a game be ""pay to win"" when it's free to begin with?  What a silly post by those people making the ""pay to win"" claim.  Just think about it.  Anyway, what do you have to lose aside from time playing this game?  Try it, don't like it?  Cry about it, then try it again.  It's what I do with every game.  Except the original Mario... In that game I used to punch myself when I died.

Anyway, my point is... this game, by its very nature, is not pay to win.  It's PLAY TO WIN.  Oh and another thing.  Each match you play is intense when you're into the game and they can last anywhere from 1 minute to about 10 minutes.  So you can play a lot in a short amount of time - or play a short amount of time in the short amount of time you have.  It really is a delicious blend of real time strategy and RDM that's cooked to perfection.  You can change up your recipe and spice things up or stick with mum's ol blend and bake it beautifully.  Play with a friend, or by yourself - just like mash potato'ing, you're gonna have a great time."
8734,kinda epic style
8735,Kinda nice game
8736,"Great strategy game, fun for all ages!"
8737,cool heroes
8738,nice game
8739,"love it so far
"
8740,"Solid to start: haven't hit endgame yet though
Interesting mechanics: deep enough to warrant some thinking but simple enough to enjoy without sweating too hard in the early game. May come back to update depending on how it goes

Recommend for now, but we'll see"
8741,Really good game I truly recommend it :D
8742,I came into this expecting another 'free game' and have been thoroughly impressed. Looking forward to spending more time on this game.
8743,"Forget this game much better ways to spend your 80 bucks, cause 80 bucks is just to start. When this game is done with you you will spend 400-700 bucks and then you might start winning. Here is a better idea, take half  your starting 80 bucks ...Then go down on Main st in any big city, Or the Amtrack / bus station. Get a 40 dollar 1/8 sack of weed. Then go take your other 40 dollars, whistle to that girl standing on the corner. Let her in your car, have her blow you or what ever your fancy is for the other 40. hell maybe even smoke a joint /blunt with her, she may just give you two for the price of one....Then when your all cleaned up and both nuts are good and drained... drop her off at the next corner, and home go home crash gleefully,  and know you spent that 80 bucks correctly. and have been properly fucked without the feeling of being ripped off.:)"
8744,Best implementation of this genre
8745,"It's a good game. It's kind of a cross between a card game and a mini-moba. Matches are quick, ranging from 1 minute (it's a landslide) and maybe 10 minutes (back and forth until someone gets lucky/makes a mistake). Most games last a few minutes so it's easy to get in if you want to play casually or progress higher in the ranks playing nonstop.

There are a large variety of cards, each with strengths and weaknesses. Some cards play a pack of mobs that are ground melee mobs, for example. They could be strong against a single, bigger mob who attacks slowly, but are weak/defenseless against air mobs. Each type of card comes with pros and cons, but for the most part, each card is useful in SOME situations.

That being said, there are some cards that are just blatantly better than others (usually the ones everyone is using), which can get frustrating. The game isn't P2W, you can definitely use strategy and move up in rank without spending any money...and just playing the game does get you gold/other currencies that you can use to gamble for rarer cards or purchase directly after playing for a bit, so it's not really P2W.

Still, it gets frustrating when you play someone the same rank as you who has all the really good cards that work well with other cards and in multiple situations.

Other than that type of complaint, it's a good game. I highly recommend it. Quick games that give a satisfying feeling when you counter someone's card with one of yours, or win a game/rank up. It's enjoyable."
8746,great game awsome learning curve hope that as you progress it stays this fun. great balance of free to play and pay for extra content not nesisarily advantage
8747,mana strategy counter game xD
8748,Good game. Could be hard for Evan.
8749,"smooth gameplay, content is good, please add more cards to make it better"
8750,First review ever. I didn't expect much from this game but it is very interesting and unique. I will be playing this for a good while.
8751,Very good game not PTW !! If you like card game with real time action this is the game.
8752,"Addictive, fast-paced fun."
8753,"i have given this game a good crack..I still will play on and off . as i have opened my wallet. Like a dumb a""£. Things is guys i was thinking work you nuts off grind for the guild. save them rubies. erm not much point now.
new season new ways to make you open your wallet agin. No No No . you have ruined it. i enjoyed this . So dissapointed and from humble begining too. Give it the stealth tax attitude.  Those with and those without! Statement for the damn world. 
 You#ll enjoy it and you gotta pay through the nose."
8754,Fast paced gameplay mixed with a card game sort of aspect. Its rather enjoyable.
8755,"Great Free Tug Of War game. Geared for kids, fun for adults.  Better Review to follow later...  playing."
8756,"It's a waste of time unless you sink a ton of cash or grind for months to go a baby step forward. They've got the ""slot machine"" concept down pat. WOW BLAM BING POW all this stuff (but none of it is what you actually need)."
8757,"very fun to play, easy to learn"
8758,"It's an enjoyable game, especially when you want to play something relaxing, but still competitive along with very short matches."
8759,good game
8760,"Fun, Simple, Easy. Cool feature would be to save a deck after edit, and not just save automatically. Well done with the game, its a must try"
8761,This game is amazing! 10/10 will play again and again and again...
8762,game hay vãi chuởng :)))))))))))
8763,starting deck is very strong and balanced
8764,"Standard throw-the-free-players-to-the-whales micro ridden trash. No interesting gameplay demonstrated in tutorial. Looks boring, safe, and ugly. Audio design limp and lifeless. Throws piles of meaningless ""chests"" at you to scratch the skinner box itch right at the start of the game. 

Avoid."
8765,fun game its like clash royal
8766,"I've been playing Minion Masters for a few months now and it's a lot of fun. Minion Masters is a strategy-brawler mostly online game where you defeat in-game opponents and/or other players to increase your strength and level up not only your character but also your cards.You also have the option of signing up for emails which give you codes to use to redeem gifts, I was a bit against the ideas of signing up due to the fact I know some games will spam you with an excessive amount of emails BUT this game isn't like that at all, you'll get a few emails a month(maybe one a week at most) but each one almost always has a code for free gifts.I highly recommend this game for people that enjoy 1vs1 and 2vs2 battles against other players."
8767,"Pretty sick game, wonder why it isn't more popular than it is really."
8768,yess it's entertaining and fun
8769,Fun. Lost its luster after a good 10 hours. Probably the best game of its genre.
8770,10
8771,"I really enjoy this game. At first I was sceptical because of the ""childish"" graphics but the mechanics and regular updates made me love it after only 10 hours. Yes you may have to invest some time to fully understand the abilites of each card but don´t worry you´ll get it in no time^^"
8772,This game is one of the best.  You think it is simple... but it is like a complex mobile phone game.  It is really fun... and gives options on how to play.
8773,Great fun!
8774,"I can't believe how many hours I've logged into this game. I'm updating this review in 2022 and have been playing on and off for years at this point.

It's a sickness, really. It's super addictive -- too addictive, honestly, as my hours log shows --  once you understand the mechanics of gameplay and most of the cards. For better or worse, there is really nothing else I know of quite like MM. It's tactical and fun. You'll feel like you've mastered the basics and have a massive win streak, then get absolutely demolished five times in a row, and realize you're not as good as you thought. It's hard not to just play ""one more match."" 

The community is ... not great. Never has been. I include myself in that statement. Something about this game brings out the pettiest in people. The chat is usually nonsensical or toxic, though people will answer basic questions you may have. There are a set of emoticons and ""pings"" you can send to your teammate during a battle, and more often than not, these are used to mock ineffective teammates, or to taunt the other team. Fortunately there is a ""mute"" button, which I usually hit at the start of every match. It really does save you from needless distractions. 

The game is free to play and it is not pay to win. If you're just starting out, I think the ""All Masters"" pass might be worth buying, if they still have that, as it gives you immediate access to all the Masters, which are fun to experiment with. But it's not necessary to do so, and that's the only paid content I'd recommend right out the gate. 

The game is fairly well balanced after years of updates, so while you'll have a limited number of cards at first, what cards you do or don't have doesn't actually matter all *that* much. You'll collect and be able to craft new cards at a reasonable pace without spending money, unless you want to. For a long time I didn't spend anything on MM -- these days I usually shell out about $5 for a Season Pass each season, which is what it tends to cost if you play regularly and collect a lot of free updates,. It feels like a more than fair price to me, but you don't really need the Season Pass for anything that important -- there will just be two new cards that you won't be able to craft on your own until the season transitions. My advice with card crafting would be to focus on the cards you feel like you're eager to play -- whether they're ""common,"" ""rare,"" ""supreme,"" ""legendary,"" or whether they're new cards or old ones, doesn't actually matter all that much with regards to how effective they are in play. Not to mention that the devs have a tendency to fiddle with the balance pretty regularly, so a card you love this season may not be so great next, or vice versa. Which gets annoying at times, but at this point there are enough options that you can usually find something fun and feasible to concentrate on in terms of deck-building. 

You can join a guild and guilds have access to some specialized ""rewards"" like custom emotes and costumes, but they're ... really not a very big deal, generally. 

Overall: Too addictive for its own good, sort of a snotty community, but fun and unique, for sure."
8775,Fun
8776,It's very similar to Clash Royale. If you like this kind of games. I think you might like this.
8777,its fun especialy with new card aded caled elec wizrard and gint are fun cards but cost too much eliscer
8778,Seems like a pretty great game so far.
8779,ye boi!
8780,lit af
8781,Great game i really enjoy it and i usually dont enjoy games like this but this one has made my day i would recommend trying it and post a review of how you think this game is...
8782,Its lit
8783,"Once the game breaks down, forget about getting support from the developers. It takes an eternity to get a reply and only to not getting any sort of help. Disappointing."
8784,"EDIT 1: I have now spent an amount of time in this game equivalent to watching Blade Runner 2049 twice. While Blade Runner 2049 certainly raises some important philosophical questions to consider in an age of technological development on course to change the very definition of humanity itself, Minion Masters manages to evoke some real-life emotional experiences where modern sci-fi/film-noir pretense fails. In particular, the dreadful fear of pending doom that results in seeing one of the ""85% off"" one-time-special-offers expiry timers reveals the paradoxical and ultimately absurd nature behind the pursuit of meaning. Considering how little money I've spent on having stared in the eyes of my own existential insecurities, I would say it was money well spent.

In summary, Minion Masters will give you a good bang for your buck if you're not concerned about whether or not machines can have a soul, otherwise you might be better off going to the cinema.

EDIT 2: In fairness my edit from yesterday says precisely nothing so here is my honest answer that I gave to a friend spontaneously

FRIEND: how is the game though? I like the totally non-copyright infringing ""Sand Wars"" font
 
MufuggahToday at 7:51 AM
It's pretty generic
but my friends play it, which makes for good chill sesh's
they essentially tried to do to games what I've always been trying to do with music
they deconstructed the entirety of the strategy ubergenre and reconstructed it in one game so it's got elements from all of the subgenres
then did the same thing to loot boxes
combined the two and voala"
8785,Very nice game.Thanks loltiesel for this game.Perfect :) .
8786,"The game is good to lose 2,3 hours per day with it , not p2w etc"
8787,.
8788,"Amazing game with a strong playerbase, at least give it a try, you might get hooked."
8789,"I played this far more than Steam's recorded time on Discord's gaming platform. It's an enjoyable game, and still my go to for quick games between various things."
8790,das as sad sasd dgsa as ca fa
8791,Very fun its like clash of clans built better and for pc! reccomended!
8792,Absoult clash royale auf steam.. für leute die absolut kein leben haben
8793,Simple to get into but quite the experience to play once you realize just how surprisingly deep it is.
8794,"Its for free and you will have your fun.
In a high level its better to have some special cards and you need time to get it.
Free rubies are not enough to get every season pass."
8795,Reminds me of Warcraft III Frozen Throne mods.
8796,Game is fun. Its like clash royale but more complicated
8797,Run of the mill.
8798,Fun game
8799,Most fun in dual battle mode
8800,Ok
8801,"After over 2000 hours of playing this game, I would not now recommend MM. Over the time I have been playing, the developers have systematically destroyed what used to be a great game. With their lack of dealing with the real issues of the game, and focussing on money grabbing, they have now a very broken game. Constant disconnects, a useless reconnect feature, horrible matchmaking and a toxic community. Betadwarf stated that they wanted to go down the ""friendship game route"", but with MM they have failed.

The card selection is to vast and only a few cards decide a game, ones that get spammed over and over, and a far to OP (Nyvirs breath for instance.) This highlights a very unbalanced game with the vast number of cards, just useless. 

If you want a game of endless hours of frustration and feeling like you are getting nowhere, this is the game for you! If you want a real game with great community and balanced, then try League of legends, by far outstrips MM.

Original Rreview:

A very interesting twist on a combat card game. I really like the representation of card play as characters (minions).  Its fairly fast paced game, with most matches ranging from 1-7 minutes. Great for getting a few matches in, whilst on a coffee break.  The graphics are outstanding and i think the dev's have done a good job with the sound, voice overs (which are a good giggle) and ambient music/sounds.  There are a coupla drawbacks with crashes and network timeouts (annoyingly during an epic ""we are winning this"" games). But the dev's are always working to improve things under the hood, and have regular content updates to keep ya coming back for more."
8802,Good game
8803,good.
8804,"Free2Play. 
Pay2Win not detected.
Easy to learn and not too hard to master.
Quick matches. 
Worth to Try!"
8805,Pretty much the best when it comes to this type of game
8806,this game it crash every time after one match is finish and this thing has not been fix since the game was launched
8807,e bun daca vrei sa iti bagi ungia-n vene
8808,Sweet
8809,"Ez to learn, ez to play, and co-op is the best of this game."
8810,Way better than Clash Royal. Fairly balanced game!
8811,"love it
"
8812,For a game like clash royale this game is really balanced
8813,Honestly pretty fun. Very much like clash royal but kinda less pay to win.
8814,"Great free to play game with a neat progression system, tutorial and interface. And it's a pretty unique game to boot! Overall one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had. I can see myself hopping on this game pretty frequently due to the replayability and reward system."
8815,Amazing experience for F2P game.
8816,A fun and surprisingly generous game. Great way to kill a few minutes. Devs are fairly good about making sensible balance changes and introducing new mechanics.
8817,good game
8818,"The RTS genre has been officially dead for nearly a decade. You'll have to take what you can get, be thankful the devs didn't turn this into a moba or battle royal (rip End of Nations, 2012-2014)"
8819,great time passer
8820,"so far so good, fun, action packed"
8821,fun with a friend
8822,Amazing FTP game that isn't pay to win
8823,"Dis right here, isa good game"
8824,moba game 2020
8825,"Fun and creative, for small sessions between of work."
8826,"If you like Clash Royale this is defenitely for you. Similar gameplay, lots of fun!"
8827,If you like card games where you are fighting with some characters what are on a card play it!
8828,it free
8829,Nice game
8830,"gut game, nice and short"
8831,Really nice game to play with friends
8832,"Very solid and addicting. One thing I'd highly recommend is to sign up for their newsletter. I didn't actually play this game too much for the longest time, but they give out free stuff fairly often.

"
8833,Not that great when playing alone but great if you get a friend to play with.
8834,Nice game. I like it very much
8835,Its fun
8836,fun and easy to play
8837,"'Tis a silly game. It takes money or patience to do well. Enjoy. Got it free during a ""get this free day"""
8838,good game
8839,"Simple, tactical gameplay. Everything you pay to unlock you can unlock through gameplay (although it may take a while). But fun gameplay, regular content updates and daily quests keep me coming back for more."
8840,"This is a fun, unique card game where when you play you cards, they come to life and battle it out against your opponent as you watch and calculate what to play next and when. This game is very free to play because you can earn many cards just by passively playing and there's multiple game modes to try out as well. This game is a classic easy to learn, hard to minion master!"
8841,"An excellent game, which I prefer in Co-Op. If you like collecting decks and testing out new strategies it's worth your time!"
8842,a rip of Clash royale but ok
8843,"Fun strategic game, which doesn't require you to invest too much time. Easy to get into, but hard to master."
8844,A very hands on game involving strategic thinking and fast paced 1v1 battles
8845,Surprisingly Addictive
8846,Great game
8847,A great example of how a free to play game should be
8848,This is way BETTER THEN League Of Legends in my opinion!
8849,its good game
8850,"Great game, comedy, action, strat... endless fun!!!"
8851,Grinding required.
8852,"It's a very good game. Easy to play in low rank... But it does require skill at high rank to win.

Edited on November 27, 2020.

Used to be great, now developers are abandoning ship. This was a game that every time you see an update you pray for it not to go wrong, and compared to last year this was a better game not greedy. they decided to do this thing called an economy re-balance and the game has now became pay to win. stay away from this game, the devs have became toxic :steamsad: ."
8853,fun to play with friends
8854,Simple yet fun.
8855,"I thought this game had interesting mechanics.  The Reddit forums can help you get much better at the game.  Mostly I want to upgrade my lame ass Autumn Sale badge, so here is my blah-blah-blah."
8856,I think that this game combines principles of many other games and make it fun even is loss. Good game
8857,Great game to progress and work you way up into higher leauges wish the matching was more balanced though
8858,fun enough to play casually
8859,Fun so far + 2 hours in
8860,like it it free free is good
8861,minion masters is a fantastic game filled with fun moments with friends
8862,"It's worth trying. The matches are short. 3-7 minutes is the most common. 5 is about my avg. The game is at it's best when you have more cards and more champions, because then you can figure out what cards and what champions combine best with your play style.

In the same ways, this can lead to one of the biggest issues. The game can be pay-to-win at times if your opponent just has more options than you. This doesn't guarantee they will win, but it certainly makes going against someone with nice skins, nice arena, and cards you havent tried yet feel very hopeless.

"
8863,Noice!
8864,"This game is really something else. I've never been much into these card-based strategy games or whatever you call them, but Minion Masters has really hooked me.

From the little gift codes the developers send in their newsletters, to the multitude of new cards, features, and gamemodes being added at a decent rate, there's a lot of content to enjoy.

I think it's one of those games that's easy to pick up, but there's some fun challenge to it, especially since most of the time you're playing against other people. Overall, I don't have much negative to say about Minion Masters - I always seem to enjoy a good round (or five - it's addictive in a fun way because every duel feels rewarding)."
8865,"my name jeff

game good play it fuck you"
8866,"Funny, interesting game"
8867,Nice casual player versus player experience 8)

8869,"Very nice game! 
It's pretty cool based and the gameplay is awesome."
8870,Clean gameplay
8871,its fun just not that fun
8872,Very tactical and also id very time entreaging.
8873,Game has a battlepass. 10/10 would pay again!
8874,"This game is similar to Clash Royale if anybody has played that style of game. It's fun and very animated. You get good by understanding the strengths of each card and knowing when to use what you have to gain an advantage over your opponent. It's nice that it's free to play as well but with all free to play games, in my opinion, you can only go so far or get so good until someone who plays you that has spent lots of money on this game ends up beating you with their ""better cards aka paid to play"". All in all I'll give this game a solid 4 stars. Try it out for yourself and see if it's your style of game. Can't beat free!"
8875,1
8876,give it a try
8877,"Solid, Solid Game"
8878,"I hate and love this game. It's fun, tactical, balanced. 

But omfg is it buggy and crashy. Please for the love of all things holy fix the damn memory leak issues, or whatever the fuck the problem is. It crashes on start-up, it crashes after a game, it crashes when you click on a reward, it crashes when you click on chat, or anything. 

I cannot give this game a thumbs-up in it's current state, but I recommend it completely, it's fun as hell.
I'll keep playing this crashy game, but I'm not happy about it >:)

Update to 16 hours later. I am close to gm on most game modes. I love the game, I could take it seriously if it did so for itself. It has a lot of potential, people who play it are addicts, I am too. It has that quality to it. The community rocks. The rewards system is fair. However, spending 70% of the time either loading or crashing has forced me to stop altogether. I'll miss you. Hope you get fixed and the love you deserve.

09/03/2020 After patch update. It's still a crashy piece of shit."
8879,"A little reminiscent of custom Warcraft 3 maps, in a sense. Different, but fills the niche.

Decent balance. No P2W, fast progression. Easy to find games at any time, for any mode and rank.

Continues to get support and new content.

Can be played with one hand ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)."
8880,"Shallow in content but is a quick and simple game to play. If you can tolarate the loot box 'free to play model' and childish design, is worth an evening or two."
8881,"Write a review for Minion Masters
Please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others.
Please remember to be polite and follow the Rules and Guidelines."
8882,Nice game!
8883,xdd game
8884,A great free card game. The devs. always have new updates for it. Even more fun when you play with friends.
8885,"A good game with cards to pass your time.  You can play alone or with friends, and compete in the arena against others."
8886,It worths playing :)
8887,"This game has a lot of conditions that can influence your strategy. from the distance were you put the troops on the map up to the order and power combination, all integrated with your master type.
Try this game, in the beginning could appear that is a pay to win game but is not, there is no combination that can beat all the others. So don't try to beat everything and just enjoy win or defeat:))))
Update after 130h+ and is still the best of this game type family:)))))
Update after one year of play and I can say is the best game in this category, has no rival. seasons are fun and is always a new beginning, new cards, new strategy. The Devs are there and changing all the time some aspects of the game which make it batter and better. Go for it you will not regret."
8888,it is just awesomeness
8889,"Good game, will play again."
8890,nice game
8891,cool game
8892,"Basically a better version of Clash Royale.
Very recommended!"
8893,Very fun with friends
8894,"First hour into this game, having lots of fun!"
8895,Enjoyable.
8896,Boom!
8897,fun to play with friends and an awesome concept
8898,A fun game to play with a friend.
8899,Simple tower defend with lots of unique units to play.
8900,yes
8901,"Great game, enjoyable to play solo, even better with friends!"
8902,Really fun and really suprised that its free!! :)
8903,"worth checking out, decent time waster"
8904,"good game, like CR, but when you want to claim the reward it mostly you've to click another screen and then click the reward again, it's like your cursor isn't at right place to claim/click it."
8905,"2k hours, can safely say the devs ruined this game with terrible updates. 

 xp gain is too fast, and now it just became a bridge spam/stall by getting mana frenzy in 2v2. Very seldom do matches end in the old classic way of destroying your enemy masters tower, now it's just stall and grab bridges til you get mana frenzy and then spam cards. Absolute trash experience in 2v2.  1v1 is better in that regard but still not as good as it used to be.

Spell costs are too high now and the tempo of the game feels slower even though they increased the rate of which mana is gained. It used to feel tactical, now it feels like a spamfest of just spawning cheap cost minions.

This is what happens when you create a game and then no one in the dev team actually spends enough time to master it, they end up not knowing how to tweak it properly."
8906,It is good
8907,This is suck gamr
8908,Not bad...
8909,clash royal 4k ultra graphics
8910,Nice minigame
8911,I like the troop variation and combo it creates. Fun game that is pretty casual.
8912,"This game is a sweet mix of card battle and MOBA mechanics. The DLC are like starter decks, each has a good mix of strong cards from their faction and one legendary.

PROS:
+ Free to play
+ Fun
+ Solid graphics
+ Well paced gameplay with timely updates
+ Even more fun if you bring a friend

CONS:
- Only 2 lanes possible with a max of 2v2 PVP, but makes the matches go faster than MOBA"
8913,Game is like a uprgaded version of Clash royale and its really fun to play it .
8914,Szerintem jó  kis játék
8915,Good stuff. Free 2 play. Makes even more fun when playing with a friend.
8916,one of the best card game updated in 2019
8917,It's free. Why aren't you already trying it out? Best free game from Steam ever.
8918,Very fun to play with friends
8919,One of the best card game i ever played!
8920,Great Game!
8921,good game
8922,Its ok
8923,"F2P friendly games, recommended for tower defense gamer."
8924,Game takes deck builders and makes them actually fun. You can be competitive with very basic decks as long as your game play is up to snuff.
8925,Repetitive
8926,As far as free repetitive games go this one was rather fun. I am not really into competitive games anymore but casually playing this was OK.

8942,epic gamer moment
8943,Nice and cool game
8944,"This game is better than it has any right to be, especially in 2v2 mode."
8945,"Great game, nice artstyle, good with friends, fun atmosphere, it's also free so you have nothing to lose."
8946,"Entirely F2P not P2W.
However it has a stagnate meta and the devs have no clue on how to balance the game nerfing okay deck builds while leaving op builds alone to dominate the majority."
8947,This game being available to most operating systems and how it's played. it's a fun game to play with other people for hours.
8948,"Good game, matches are fun and go by fast"
8949,Honestly been through this game in early when it came out. Lately it completely catered to new players who don't understand the game at all so they nerf the meta to much to the point the game garbage. Guess what i have posted on countless people who didn't learn the way to play and failed they fixed the for the failures instead helping the current community done with them giving in so easy.
8950,"This is one of the best games for people with short attention span. Easy to learn, hard to master, it stands out because of its ambition to bring a mobile genre on pc. It's frequently updated, bringing new things to do and mechanics here and there."
8951,great game
8952,FUN
8953,Excelent game
8954,"This game has severe connection issues.  It is not uncommon for either you to drop from the game, or an opponent.  In 1v1 dropping will count as an automatic loss so due to this issue 1v1 simply isn't worth playing.  You can play Team games which is 2v2 and you can play this with a random teammate or as a pre-made team.  Dropping during a Team Battle can be a loss, depending on what point in the game you drop.  A drop can take up to 30 seconds, just to kick you from the game.  You will be returned to the Main Menu, where you will have to rejoin the game.

This is not an uncommon event.  A drop results in a loss the vast majority of the time.  This stops your win streaks and just causes a lot of frustration.  You can win the game, see the ""Victory"" across the screen and still drop.  This drop is still counted as a loss even though the game already ended and you won.

The developer refuses to do anything about it or even comment on this issue.  The developer only makes random changes to the game and adds more skins, or changes unit skins.

Disregarding the connection issues, the game has Seasons where they release new cards.  In order to get these cards during the season you must pay Rubies which cost real money.  The cards given in these season rewards are often overpowered thus giving the people that have paid an advantage.  These cards are almost universally nerfed when they rotate out so that they are actually fair and don't mess with the games balance."
8955,great game
8956,"Fun & Free. It's not P2W. The gameplay is also quite simple. 
Recommended card game even for people who don't like card games."
8957,"A refreshing game after a long day's work, Minion Masters is entertaining. There is no pressure to spend your money, yet you can get a bit further along early on if you do. You can also get some other fun stuff to spruce things up, but again totally optional, and not pressed. It takes a little time to really grasp the mechanics and figure out how to be strategic with your deck, but still relatively easy to pick up. Best yet, the solution to defeat daunting opponents requires tactics, not money. I am totally comfortable losing to someone with better tactics over one with a deeper wallet. Graphics and animations keep getting better and adjustments are made to better balance anything overpowered or exploitable. Very fun, I can't recommend Minion Masters enough!"
8958,Please make more easier to find  GOOD friend
8959,thump up
8960,wow

[x] Nice devs.

100% recommended."
8962,"I can't tell you how much I love this game and the community that has grown around it.  I've had so much fun and met so many awesome people playing and streaming this game. Nearly 2,000 hours and still going strong.  I can't wait for the new expansion on the 5th of December. (Disclaimer: Minion Masters Partner)"
8963,for a free game its certainly kept me entertained
8964,Basically Clash Royale without the dumb leveling mechanics.
8965,Get HYPE!
8966,Not bad !=)
8967,"I play this with my brother pretty frequently. They update the meta and switch things up but its still easy enough to play that making a deck under a basic theme like ""cheap critters and a couple explosions"" can still get you enough wins to want to keep playing. 

It's free and the daily quest ""bank"" allows you to skip 3 days before you ""lose"" value. 

Another ""huge"" point is that many times when an expansion drops they do a celebration sale where the DLC is free for 2 days. So, I haven't paid money into this game since I decided to buy the welcome pack of gems and that was out of a sense of obligation since I've been playing it a ton and I've paid more for fewer hours of actual gameplay."
8968,"dI'm 37 now and most vidz deHUGEify my wang, but this one is on that popular castle and minions theme, W magic medivale  nonesense...Live action Battle CHess!...'member that?!?. RyGuyOttawa"
8969,Cool game
8970,"Minion Masters is a simple premise with short games.  Feeling a bit like a phone game brought to the computer screen it non-the-less manages to keep bringing me back to play it.  While not a game that lends itself to long play sessions the deck building, quick access to games and continuously evolving card base makes this a great game to dip into each day.  The devs are diligent about keeping the game balanced.  They are continuesly reviewing cards to make sure each has its own useful niche in the game and to ensure there is a reason to use ever card they have released.  Similarly they work to make each of the games characters or ""masters"" are able to support a variety of deck strategies so that none of them become a one deck wonder.

TLDR:  This probably won't be a game you spend marathon sessions on but it is fun to dip into each day and keep theory crafting decks and improving your in game deck management with."
8971,Very Entretenido
8972,-
8973,GG
8974,Reminds me of clash royale
8975,It's a good game
8976,"Grab a friend, build a Deck, have some fun. 
Not much you can do wrong with a free title like that.
Devs update on a regular base"
8977,It's a fun little strategy-lite game. There's limited power scaling unlike in similar mobile titles.
8978,Good game.
8979,awesome game
8980,its cool
8981,A fun 1v1 or 2v2 MoBA that combines drafting and minion management. Has a great sense of humor and is definitely worth the time!
8982,"A casual game to spend your free time but the problem is the developers' attitude.
Some months before, they changed the season pass so the game can be more competitive, they said. Suddenly, after the first season they just started to put some new cards only on the season pass and not on both free and season pass like before. I don't know how that makes the game more competitve for those who don't like to spend their money on a game.
And now, they just deleted pretty much every source of rubies so players have to pay every month for a season pass.
It's clear that after the fanbase got bigger, the developers care only about money."
8983,+
8984,"It's a pretty chill and fun game with ""Card based"" gameplay where you collect and upgrade cards to get better Minions. It is not the most challengeing and intense game there is, but if you want something more casual and chill to play I would recommend this."
8985,it was good 2 years ago trust me
8986,Not bad
8987,.
8988,awesome game played since it was in the beta stage
8989,Like Clash Royale except I don't need to spend my whole paycheck every week to play it
8990,Fun and simple game to play
8991,"A good game! [strike]""Why is this review ""Friends Only"" though?"" Excellent question – it's because it's a poor excuse of a review![/strike]

[b]Minion Masters[/b] is a fun free-to-play multiplayer battle arena card game. The most notable comparison would be to a game like Clash Royale, except Minion Masters has more involved mechanics due to being developed for PC. At the time of review, a mobile version is in development.

The developers have a hard time admitting it, but they don't know how to sustainably monetize their game. The game is fun, but until they have something clearly figured out it's hard to determine the continued lifespan of the game. They are working on other game projects at the same time however, and have continued to regularly bring free updates to Minion Masters."
8992,Very similar to Clash Royale
8993,Fun little game
8994,"great F2P game, you can earn all if you grind. Deeper and NO P2W like this other similar popular game on mobile! Go for MM!"

9024,nice game
9025,"I'm pretty bad at CCGs and Deck-building games, I just don't have the patience to spend so much time fussing over decks and choosing cards, so while I've tried numerous such games and played them from time to time, I haven't stuck with any of them for any meaningful length of time.

All that said, I really enjoy Minion Masters, after stealing some decks from players I've played with/against, sometimes touching them up a tiny bit for my liking.
I'm no expert, surely, but I'm pretty ok and enjoy the game, the aspect of microtransactions and all the economy system is very free-to-play friendly, new cards and mechanics are being added every 2-3 months and I have very close to all of them without forking over a cent.

All in all, recommend giving the game a try of a few hours."
9026,Good
9027,Its pretty fun
9028,One of the best game I have ever played and after more than year of playing still motivation to play and improving playing style and skill. All the masters and cards are very good balanced and game is fully free to play without handicaps (power of card is not possible to improve). Common cards are as powerfull as legendary and since first day you can play competitive deck and have a lot of fun in several game modes.
9029,cool

9055,fun easy  and fast
9056,"One of the better Free to play games out there. While it might seem like you need to pay money to get better cards, playing it for a bit will start giving you enough in game currency to buy crates which hold different minions you can play."
9057,"Pretty fun game, duo'ing with a buddy makes the experience all the more fun as you rampage through ranked crackin' jokes and takin' dubs."
9058,Really fun casual quick game
9059,fun game.

9074,"Minion Masters is the potato chips of multiplayer gaming experiences. The art design is a complete mishmash of colorful characters without any disciplinary themes binding them together cohesively. The building and spellcasting strategies aren't very broad, but the ones that do exist feel very different from one another - not unlike barbecue versus sour cream and onion. The microtransactions are always there and always mildly annoying, limiting the gameplay with currency gating and keeping it from being a fully-fulfilling, self-contained gaming experience.
But, you know, it's still fun and enjoyable as long as you're only expecting something shallow. In the long term, it's had problems coming up with meaningful progression mechanics that aren't obnoxious or out of left field like the bizarre inclusion of a single player pseudo-campaign. There's not really much reason to keep playing once you get a few decks you like the feel of, other than for the sake of the gameplay itself. On the other hand, that is, after all, the purest reward. Come to it when you want a little snack, ignore it the rest of the time, but don't subsist on it for weeks at a time, whatever you do. That's like eating a diet of potato chips."
9075,Just such a chill game i can always open when i dont wanna concentrate on much and yet have enough brain capacity to think a little bit strategic!

9089,"1) Easy to learn gameplay
2) Beautiful visual
3) 2v2 Mode (where I had most fun playing with my friend)
4) It's FREE -_-"
9090,Game itself is amazing
9091,..
9092,"This game is somewhere between a card game and tower defense. The combinations of hands, synergies between cards all help to create a diverse game.
The devs are generous with the rewards, especially if you sign up to their discord etc.
Its fun to have a card game where you take some action and responsibility for combat.
Overall an enjoyable game and one which has an interesting backstory and sensible devs."
9093,this is a really fun game that I play with my son... it is a lot of fun to just chill at ..
9094,"Minion Masters is fast-paced fun. Overwhelm your opponents in different game modes, single player or team play. Collect cards and build strong decks in this tactical duel. The shop offers plenty of cosmetics as well as cards which you can also obtain by playing.
300 hours after writing the initial review: It still is amazing :hee:"
9095,I think that this game better each update. pretty much a good card game.
9096,Cool time killer
9097,"This is an awesome game and YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND ANY MONEY to play and have fun. 
You can play with your friends (or randoms) and by yourself. 
It works on Mac and Windows (and you can play with friends when you are on Windows or Mac no matter if they have Mac or Windows system). 
There are a lot of different cards and charcters to play with, so everyone could play with whatever they want."
9098,good
9099,Good game
9100,"Totally unexpected joy coming from the famous mobile game, lot better, lot more fun, lot more love put into it.

I cant recommend this game more, definitely not a P2W, you can win games with wellcrafted decks/strategies with easy to obtain cards. 

One of the few games i dont get mad when I lose, and thats a big thing coming from a rager like me :)"
9101,very good game!
9102,it s a very cool game! enjoy playing!!
9103,good game

9107,"A very good game that is better than Clash Royale ;)
"
9108,ok baby
9109,Was never very good at games like these until this one came out! Absolutely love the different mini-game types and that you actually have to put some thought into the decks.
9110,Very playable until you hit the inevitable starved-of-progression-and-fun cutoff point where they expect you to start microtransacting for more. But well worth 'free' up to that point.

9122,This game is phenomenal! I love it with all my heart and I recommend it to everybody
9123,"Fun game. Have any spare time and bored without anything to do? play this game. It doesnt take crazy amount of focus and strategy, but there are elements of it in there. Hard enough to make you think and plan out stuff if you want, easy enough to play casually if you want to. Fun lil time sink"
9124,"Great Game love it all free got almost all the cards! =]

Getting better with version 2.0!"
9125,The arena is great fun with lots of engagement and excitement.....the battle will be hard fought but worth it!!
9126,"Great game. It's like Clash Royale but more delicate. The master system also makes multiple tactics. The most important thing is, it is not a pay to win game. All the cards keep fixed power once you draw them. No power up anymore!"
9127,Very fun while playing with other players on a team
9128,Great game and very fun to play with friends.
9129,"Good strategy game, better when played with friends."

9139,"Fun but buggy as hell and completely luck-based,  Bug report is useless/Doesn't work.  I'd give it a pass, unless you have a friend."
9140,I love this game so much
9141,"Very straightforward game.

You fight on a symmetrical board with 2 bridges, upper and lower. Each player starts with 3000 hp and you summon minions who travel (depending on where you place them) towards the enemy hero to attack them. Your opponent does the same. Heroes are not entirely helpless however, as they actively attack enemy minions as well, and add special ""Hero Cards"" to your deck as you gain levels during the match.

Heroes are fairly unique, encouraging different playstyles. Ratbo is a New York Rat with a Minigun that passively spawns Scrats - weak alone, but dangerous and quick to amass in numbers - whenever you summon a Scrat unit. Mordar is a Skeleton who has the ability to revive fallen units using Tombstones. Settsu is a Soldier who can jump into the battle herself.

Bought this game a very long time ago (when it was in the beta) and BetaDwarf has worked continuously to update their game and their love for their product shows.

It's a game that's easy to learn, hard to master. Great time killer when I'm shamming."

9161,"fun game, reminds me a little of Warcraft 3 Castle Wars."
9162,.
9163,.
9164,"Part card game, part tower defense, and part rts; you know the saying (at least how I word it), 'it's easy to learn, but you can also master it given the time'; by no means do I claim myself a master of this game, far from it, but I do win enough in which I find it quite enjoyable (haven't had to buy anything with real cash yet); battles can range usually from 2-8 minutes; meaning this game is really quite accessible in terms of time, money, and convenience. Artwork is great - the design and lore reminds my of one my favorite franchises - Warcraft & Starcraft [only Settsu]; although most of FTP games in the fantasy realm here seem to be inspired by Warcraft and other Blizzard ips. Sound and music, even though are hardly used, are used quite well - it matches the situation, the characters, and the impacts. But, the gameplay is where this game closes the deal. As I mentioned it's both simple and can be mastered with patience. For me, I have not seen anything like it before where it combines several genres of gaming. I admit that I have found it addicting at times bypassing sleep and food."
9165,"Kinda reminds me of clash royale but more entertaining
"
9166,Good game when played with friends. You also have to be a sadistic creature to enjoy it.

9180,"Minion masters is a decent tower defense game with deck building.

+ A large pool of different minions to choose
+ Beautiful art style
+ Not pay to win, you can have a great experience without paying a penny, doesn't require that much grind to unlock stuff
+ A lot of different game modes and new stuff added often by devs

Nothing bad to say about it seriously.. maybe the matchmaking system could be improved to match similar players.
Go try it out, it's free!"
9181,"In a nutshell, Clash of clans for PC."

9190,"I kinda like it. It has somewhat unique gameplay and devs are constantly looking after it (adding new units, balancing the gameplay). It doesn't really feel like play to win."
9191,"Fun to play, challenging, beautiful, with devs listening to the community and releasing new content monthly... what more could you ask for, if you like the mix of collectible cards and tactical combat?"
9192,"nice game, lots of giveaway. if you stream this game you will get additional rewards. overall awesome game. similar to clash royale !"
9193,"Gamę is quite good, great to play ranked games with your friends"

9199,...
9200,yassss
9201,"Initially this game was great, then they started nerfing all the cards, adding way too many new cards, making so many changes and altering the cards so frequently, giving unfair matchups i can see why this is a dying game now. I was in platinum league, they give me a person in masters leagues several times because there aren't enough people playing. Sucks to see this game go downhill so quick after all the changes in less than 2 years. Previous versions were way better, game shouldn't have added diplomancer."
9202,ggg
9203,Good game. Thumbs up.
9204,Fun and fast
9205,Cool chil game.Its like card games but we have a actual battleground of what we put on the table and we can watch what is goin on .. pretty cool
9206,"""PaY tO wIn!11!!"" - No not really. just l2p."
9207,Pretty intersting game and pretty cool
9208,To much AI and lowskilled idiots in this game.
9209,"Pros:
Funny narrator and card descriptions
Innovative gameplay
Good visuals
Rewarding game time

Cons:
A little grindy as all card games are
Some matchups are a little bit unbalanced"
9210,e
9211,nice game
9212,Fun to play with friends
9213,"Old review from Q3 2019:
[strike]One of the best examples of Free-to-play done right. It's motivating and at times challenging and it leaves the choice of spending money completly to you. It has a good community and is great fun to play for everyone who doesn't have or need multiple hours for a gaming session.[/strike]

I had to uninstall the game, because i just couldn't take it anymore. They made changes to the monetisation model of the game that range from suboptimal to questionable. The baseline of the changes for me was: if you want to play this game often you have to spend money to make it worth your while.
I was ok with the changes in general. I understand they needed a change in the monetisation although i think there may have been batter ways.
I thought well i just play it every other day then as a gap filler. But the last straw for me was when they changed the behaviour of the Esc button in the main screen recently. Before you opened up a menu and could exit the game as is normal for videogames.
NOW, when you press Esc you open up the current season/battle pass and are asked to buy it.
No... just no. That's one step to far right there. I had much fun with the game in the past. Sorry to let it go for something shady like that."
9214,like the game espcially if not playing too serious
9215,A lot of bots here. 80% of my loses vs smurfs of abusers. Have crap like this. No balance in this game.
9216,Nice free game.
9217,a lot of fun to play
9218,Tried it but it is not a fps.
9219,Had great fun with this game on LAN.
9220,"About 2Hrs of fun. After that its just boring, every match is the same."
9221,"Great little game, real fun in 2vs2 with a friend."
9222,Nice little game.
9223,"This game is just great.
The Content keeps getting added and its fun even without friends,
Ofcourse the game is much more fun with friends.

The game although has its flaws, some cards are very unbalanced and a team of friends with good cards can get constant wins.

Even with the flaws i highly recommend this game"
9224,Love
9225,A guilty pleasure
9226,I'll just gonna use 1 word to describe this game : AWESOME
9227,yes i
9228,Thanks Chrono
9229,chill game
9230,"I always come back to this game. I do't know why. Usually at least once a month for a couple of hours. Pretty good gameplay with interesting cards and heroes. Doesn't feel p2w, but it has the same problem that heartstone has. If you pay real money you have more cards and more in game gold which in turn gives you even more cards. Overall it's pretty cool game if you don't take it too seriously."
9231,chill n fun game to play
9232,"This is a fun, casual, tower defense / card game that used to be pretty generous for F2P.  It has kept me interested enough to keep playing for 2 years.  However:

- It is very poorly optimized.  Crashes on ""older"" hardware and stutters in some situations even on a high end gaming desktop despite looking like a 10 year old game.  Just trying to search through your card library (a grid of 2D sprites) locks up the game for a few seconds at a time.

- Reasonably paced progression depends on win streaks, so leavers and AFKers make climbing the 2v2 ladder take a lot longer than it should.  There seems to be no interest in addressing this.

- Season pass rewards only ever get worse, but they are now the only way to access the overpowered new cards each patch before they're nerfed the following season.  Overall I wouldn't call the game P2W, but this aspect makes it debatable.

- The upcoming ""remaster"" is so far just a bad mobile UI with much worse performance."
9233,This is a good PvP fast pace game everyone should try.
9234,lol 2016 and 2019
9235,wtf
9236,"Game is awesome! Keeps being updated often! I'd recommend to play it with friends as the experience is better! Also, it's not pay to win because you can unlock everything just by playing the game regularly. I'm always excited and happy for the next battle pass!"
9237,cool and fast game
9238,"It's a really good game to chill or take it serious, you can do whatever you want. You can improve yourself to be able to play on a competetive level or just play sometimes like i do. ^^ 
This game is a bit similar to the mobile game, called Clash Royale, but there are way much potential in it than CR.
If you haven't tried it out, you should, i mean the game is free and who knows, maybe it will become to one of your favourite games. ^^"
9239,:P
9240,lots of nice colours and flashes and lots of fun.
9241,good game i love it
9242,Fun.
9243,"Its a fun game, you can play with friends against other people in 2v2."
9244,Pretty fun game. Never thought I could play a card game and like it a lot. The only thing I am hoping they fix is the multiplayer version. My friend cannot seem to join my party for some error.
9245,Interesting and fun game
9246,Just awesome!
9247,.
9248,"My quick and honest review

Pro's
-Easy to play
-Fun with friends
-Good waste of time when nothing else to do
-FREE!
Con's
-Nothing wrong so far

Note: Playing this game is worth it, it can be played seriously or for fun either way you'll enjoy it
"
9249,pretty good eh'
9250,"Very creative game style combining card game elements with RTS.
2v2 added more fun in overall game play.
Great for having fun with spare time.

Not available on other platform which is kind sad."
9251,Awesome game and doesn't suffer from the pay to win scenario that other games do.
9252,is ok
9253,"A compact and fun strategy game about counters.

Even if it may look like it, it is not pay to win.
Paying money doesnt give you anything you wont have access to by just playing.
While ""rare"" or ""legendary"" cards may be strong, they are situational and lose to common cards in the right situation."
9254,+1
9255,Good strategy game
9256,yes
9257,"La La La ,yea it's good!Thanks 9/10!"
9258,good game
9259,"Definitely a different game on it's own, for being free to play, it's pretty hard to say no to this one. Give it a try!"
9260,"Probably a fun game, but for me it suffers from the same problem as TCGs/CCGs. You've gotta keep playing/paying to keep up with any meta that develops. It has quite a few different events and game modes, to keep you busy. It's worth trying to see if it's fun for you."
9261,Not to big of a fan of this style games
9262,"It's a cute little game that's easy to start but difficult to master, just the right level."
9263,Be careful.... should come with an addiction warning.
9264,Very fun but its even better when you play it with friends. you can talk and help each other much more
9265,I would love having some LA servers to avoid high lags. Cheers !
9266,This game is fun in the beginning. Then it gets real boring and repetitive. Enjoy it while it lasts.
9267,Relaxing game
9268,Simple and yet fun game to play
9269,"I love this free game!, It's so nice and not at all pay to win"
9270,no
9271,Surprisingly addictive! Quick rounds of gameplay coupled with regular content updates makes this an easy go-to for a short gaming break. A huge plus that the developers are community-centric as well!
9272,"Quite fun and easy to play, great for passing time"
9273,"good fun but with some real strategy thrown in if you want to go deeper
you don't have to play everyday which is a definite bonus as that gets tedious fast.
you don't have to pay to  win and things are unlockable just by completing some stored daily tasks etc and playing the game.
mostly a smooth gaming experience"
9274,Good strategy and card game.
9275,"Осталось добавить FPS-режим, как в Sanctum :)"
9276,It's fun!
9277,"Spent $200 for 11 hours worth of gameplay. game's unoriginal and gets old pretty quick, I regret every penny spent. Still recommend it tho. Grat game."

9284,Pretty fun for a free game.
9285,"This game is so good, i absolutely love this game. play it and give it a chance."
9286,Great for few hours of fun if you have a friend to play with. Matchmaking is the only downside; if it takes a while to work up the pyramid to your actual skill level. I guess this is fine if you like winning ever game for the first 30 or so. I'ts an interesting new concept and fun to play!
9287,Fun game to play on the side
9288,"I thought it was going to feel like a mobile game, but it doesn't. 

Solid tactics. Quick games. Decent monetization (have most of the DLC and most/95% of the cards, without spending anything)."
9289,great fun game.

9338,Very fun gameplay. It's like many phone games but far more appealing.
9339,Really fun Arena style game. Recommended.
9340,Its honestly pretty fun and can make you seriously think your next minion to play. The masters are nicely varied with their skills and the minion types give you many options on what strategies you want to try and see whats best for you.
9341,"Minion Masters is a fun cross between real time strategy and collectible card game. It's easy and inexpensive to get into. What sets it apart from similar games, is it's 2v2 mode."
9342,Pretty chill and fun game if you're bored or too lazy to play anything else.

9344,Good game
9345,yes

9372,"Pretty good, essentially just Clash Royale but for PC. However, from my memory, I remember Clash Royale games could drag on for a good while where as in Minion Masters it is rare for me to have games go past 8 minutes or more."

9398,"A surprisingly fun little game based round the kind of gameplay as Clash Royale or other ""Lane Pusher"" games and a nice surprise to see such a title PC where it's far better and less fiddly than a touchscreen phone."
9399,This is an awesome and addictive game from Danish publishers!
9400,This is a very fun tug-of-war game with great deck building and card collecting elements. The devs are constantly adding content. It's got a 2v2 mode you can play with a friend that is really fun. It's also got single player modes you can play for special timed rewards.

9408,"almost the same style as clash royale(mobile game ) with better elements like sound, animatoins, ui,minions and its use a mouse as controler XD."
9409,"Minion masters is an dueling CCG where you drop the units on the battlefield. Quick fun.

Play a few min, or a few hour. 

Free to play, so as with all free to play games, be conscientious about your spending if any."
9410,"Minion Masters has the single most generous monetization method I've seen in a free-to-play title, paired with solid gameplay, comfortably short matches that don't have you kicking yourself when you lose, a welcoming and supportive community, and a pile of mechanics that keep every new update interesting."
9411,Very good game XD.
9412,ye

9416,"Simple, fast and fun!"
9417,for Some game of strategy it is entertaining.
9418,Nice.
9419,I love the style and the strategy of it with the different play styles you can go for depending on your master and your deck. It's tons of fun to ensue chaos on the battlefield with hordes after hordes of minions. Easily a 5 star game.
9420,okish game
9421,The game isnt that bad but really annoying that every time I reinstall it all my decks are gone.
9422,"Game died two or three updates ago. They slaughtered 1 mana cards with a major nerf, and that sucked but whatever we dealt with it. Then this expansion was a total flop and came with it nerfs for anything not in the standard meta and new meta that you would have to pay to get. 

So basically all you had to play was meta or you're stuck in master league or below. Then they decided to ruin all functionality from those of us that don't play meta decks and gutted the wild card position. I literally spent the last hour going through 15 different decks of mine and all but three were completely useless now. All because I don't play meta cards and don't buy packs to get more rolls at new meta.

This was a great f2p game with balance. Now it's a game where you have to buy expansions and other packs to try and get the new meta cards. I spent money on this game to support the devs in the past, but this latest batch isn't worth supporting anymore. I'm, frankly, very upset as this game had been fun up until the last few months. They unilaterally decided to gut the current game, not look for anyone's feedback when they were deciding the, and then ruining the gameplay. 

I can't stand how people do this to their games. Just hit the wall and let it run out on it's own or innovate. Don't gut your game and change a fundamental aspect of the gameplay a few years into production. Minion Masters joins the ranks with games like Star Wars Galaxies and more recently Robocraft by having crappy devs who destroy their core gameplay in an effort to ""improve"" it.

This last ""improvement""  was the final nail in the coffin. Uninstalled, permanently."
9423,i love
9424,"I've played minion masters for a bit, it was pretty good. However, I had to stop since I didn't have time for games.

I do recommend it if you've played games like Clash Royale or want to try strategical games or like strategical games."

9457,"PAY TO WIN. Masters and minions are hidden behind paywalls. Pay or grind endless hours..

With every update they bring a new overpowered pay to win minion. There are so many problems they should work on. Read the forums where other players with hundreds or thousand of hours complain about crashes, unbalanced cards and so on.. Especially the [b]pay to win[/b] and the game crashes. As long as the list of cons is so long Im afraid that you will get frustrated when you see that almost everything is locked behind a paywall of rubies and gold. You will have to pay lots of money or grind endless hours to make a little step. You can grind all day long but you will earn close to nothing.
I got 34 gold for a win. A power token contains a random card and is 1000 gold which means you have to win about 29 times to earn enough gold for a random card. Instead of a new card with every token they just give you the same cards over and over.

After a team battles other players sent me pm and told me to use other cards. Funny.. I don't even have any other cards because they are locked behind paywalls. How should I get legendary cards as a new player when you have to buy them in the cash shop with real money or grind endless hours?

In the cash shop you can just spend your real money to buy legendary cards, booster packs, account upgrades, exp and gold booster and other unfair pay to win advantages towards free to play players. Sometimes they let you even buy a specific legendary card instead of a random one. I don't see how this can be called fair.

The pay to win players will always be better than you. Its not skill based when they beqat you with legendary cards you don't have access to. Where is the skill when the credit card warriors have access to better cards while you have play with the basic starter cards and free rotating cards? They can build their perfect deck and you have to play with a crippled deck of free available cards. The players who tell you otherwise are the ones who spent lots of money or endless hours in this game and want to keep their unfair advantage over the new players.

Instead of making this a fair game where you can buy only cometic stuff they add more and more legendary cards and boosters for their credit card warriors. If you are willing to pay for cards and other advantages you will have lots of fun here. Else you will have to grind lots of hours to get a few cards. I spent over 70 hours on this game and didn't even unlock many cards and unlock only 2 masters.


[u]Pros:[/u]
- A fun to play game
- Short game rounds


[u]Cons:[/u]
- CRASHES!!! SO MANY CRASHES!! You can could name this game CRASHMASTERS. It doesn't even matter what you do. You start the game or a duel and it crashes. There is no day without a crash. It usually crashes every few rounds. Sometimes it crashes even when you are not in a duel, load the game or whateever. I don't know why it crashes so often, every other game doesn't crash. Battlefield, Hearthstone, Overwatch.. everything works fine without problems. Other games like Hearthstone never crash on my computer. You can't tell me it is not caused by this game. When it crashes you will lose the game and get ranked down.
https://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/1/1640927348825709520/

- Teammates who crash or leave the matches so many times. Good luck in a 1vs2 match, you will get the lose.

Griefers like this loser just decide to stop playing and start spamming emotes or go afk:
https://youtu.be/UyMa-gX3lNk

- Bots and cheaters. Google for it and you will see what I mean.

- Pay to win. They let pay to win clowns and credit card warriors stomp the free to play players. It is a good way to encourage them to spend more money on their cash shop. With every new update they add overpowered cards too make the pay to win players buy it. Later they ""balance"" it. Oh look who thought this new card in the cash shop is so overpowered. Well it happens with every update.... Add a overpowered card to the cash shop, milk some money of the pay to win clowns, ""balance it"" and bring a new overpowered card to the cash shop to milk them again, repeat this with every update to milk more money of the pay to win clowns...
- Unbalanced matchmaking where new players have to face credit card warriors and their pay to win advantages. Just check the cards of your opponent at the end of the battle. You will see their decks are full or rare legendary cards. No idea how they call this fair.
- The drop rate of the keys is way too low. Playing the whole month but can't manage to get all keys in time.

- They charge you money for parts of the game. You will have to buy adventures and can't play mayhem without money. You are only able to play the basic free to play duels. No idea why they limit their own game behind a paywall. The players who bought the adventures said it is not worth it and looks like a cashgrab.

[u]The pay to win:[/u]
It comes with a cash shop where you can buy rubies for real money and spend it on account upgrades, masters, better cards and so on. You can even directly buy the legendary cards when they are in the featured offers. The game is full of unfair pay to win advantages and free to play players who didn't sink endless hours in this game will get stomped by pay to win credit card warriors here.

- Masters are locked behind paywall. You can buy them with rubies or shards.
- Daily shop offers where you can buy better cards, masters and other stuff for rubies and sometimes gold.
- Featured shop offers where you can packs of masters, cards and other upgrades for lots of rubies.
- People with better cards have an advantage (pay to win). You either grind or pay.
- Has a problem with matchmaking. New players versus better ones or credit card warriors with better cards (p2w).
- Every few days you can play with conquest cards to contribute points to your guild. If you lose 3 times you can not get points anymore and have to wait another few days. Well you can also pay 100 rubies which you have to buy for real cash to reset it. This is another unfair pay to win advantage.

You have to buy rubies for real money or grind ingame. Grind for shards and gold.)


Free pass and battle pass:
You get a reward for each level up (free pass). When you pay money you will also get the rewards of the battle pass which gives you much better rewards for each level up. This is called pay to win.

For example:
Level 6 free pass: A new avatar image
Level 6 battle pass (p2w): Legendary card

Level 11 free pass: Nothing
Level 11 battle pass (p2w): 500000 profile exp

Level 13 free pass: Nothing
Level 11 battle pass (p2w): rare card x3

You see.. when you pay money you will get many advantages in this game.


[u]Unbalanced:[/u]
- Some masters are overpowered. You can choose of the free rotation masters. Good luck because you can't play all when you didn't pay real money to unlock them. Here we go again with the pay to win in this game.
- Unbalanced matches. Sometimes the match ends under 2 minutes. Oh look another pay to win where players with rare cards stomp new players.
- When it is a prize fight the enemys are suddenly much stronger than usual. They let you fight versus way better players but only when it is a prize fight.


Edit:
It is a pay to win game where you can spent money to get unfair advantages. Pay to win clowns play with their full deck of new cards right after the update. You can't tell us they earned those cards by playing the game. Cash is king in this game. The more you spent the stronger your deck is. If you don't spend money you will play with basic cards or grind endless hours to get good cards. I got 187.9 hrs on record and still don't have all cards. Don't even want to start with the new cards which are added from time to time. I even miss the old rare and legendary cards. Almost 200 hours of playtime and still don't have access to all cards by playing the game without paying money. This is where you see how pay to win works!"
9458,Good game. Its most attractive quality is the quick match time. Most games resolve in 3 min. or less; longest game I have had was 8 min. and it was back when a very slow deck was meta.
9459,"Not bad for a FTP, quick fun games. Everything is easy to understand and fun to look at :)"
9460,yes
9461,"TLDR: This is my first review after playing many years and wasting many hours with steam, its not even that long so just read it .

I installed this game around noon today , thinking ""eh , it may kill a few hours"" .  I started up the tutorial and right before i finished the first game i had an urge to uninstall.

but i instead decided to give it another round,  then finish the tutorial .  then follow the quests - then 10 hours later im sitting here at midnight wondering what in the 9 circles of hell happened to my day.

im a full grown adult, i had stuff to do man .   
O woe is me and woe is to the ones who get lost in the trap of this heroin laced game.

you are the gingerbread house in which i stumble and get lost in its sweet treats - i become fat in your delights and become eaten by your hosts.  Back demons ! I will not not allow you to take hold!

I realize now that the urge earlier was a sign sent from above and this game is some sort of hellspawn sent to distract and torment us with false pleasures.


10/10 would experience again."

9469,"Easy gameplay, but you gotta put some effort into deck-building. Quick 3-7 minutes games. Easy to find online opponents or team matches. Overall solid game."
9470,it feels complex but its so fun to play
9471,Pretty fun game.
9472,cuz its good
9473,Good mechanics but hope to expand more about the creature like clan etc.
9474,"Good tactical game, qick rounds
learning curve is slow, since so many cards for new players, but in low ranks u will win often anyway (u fight bots)
once u learn how to play and reach higher rank, u will face players

There is not ""perfect build"". Each build has strength and weaknesses. Many top leader board player play balanced builds

- Not pay to win, even though it can give u a boost at the beginning
- search online for lots of free codes for cards/currency
- expensive cards are not always the best choice. How cards work together is key

9482,Very fun
9483,"Fun mix of cards and RTS, rather like it. Has a lot of free extras as well so worth keeping an eye on your mail if you sign up."
9484,"easy, casual game after a long days work."
9485,"Pros: Free to play for real, mostly fun to play, and updated fairly regularly. In general, I'd say this game is actually pretty fun. The balance is OKAY, over-tuned cards are given their chance to be ""countered"" by the meta, but also regularly nerfed if they get out of hand (e.g. servitude). The devs mostly balance around the majority of the playerbase (e.g. nerfing moreilla over and over, despite her having little tournament presence).
Cons: The nature of wildcards make it so that certain combos are just absolutely broken and mindless to play and play against (e.g. blood imps and azali, servitude) - hence why no minion masters tournaments allow wildcards. This issue I expect never to change so long as the player base remains small for minion masters, as I don't think the game can afford splitting the queues into two. 

Just as an example to explain why I think wildcards hurt the game... When I still played at the top of the ladder, if I knew someone was queueing with blood imps and azali, I was forced to toss aside strong, tournament ready decks to play Volco/ (decks with defenso chopper) only because I didn't want to lose to that particular deck - which, by the way, is the most binary deck I've played against in card games (either you have the counters, or you don't). For some time, to counter both servitude spammers and azali players, I could only play a couple of decks that could actually HANDLE both those decks, while also being a strong deck in general. I maintained about a 80-90% winrate doing so, but I still got regularly cheesed by worse players who simply wildcard'd cards I could handle normally, but not when wildcarded. And that, that's not a good look.  

The second biggest con is that the ranking system is ridiculously inflated and the top of the ladder is a complete mess. Player rankings are primarily determined by play-time rather than skill (but a more skilled player will win more often thereby reducing the amount of play-time needed to maintain rank 1). I have no idea why I get 40-50 points for beating some Masters 1 player (like 95% winrate) at RANK ONE when me beating the rank 2 player  (like <70% winrate) would only give me like 70-80 points (despite the rank 2 player being a FAR better player). Essentially, playing in off-hours where I dominate crappy players to farm them for points is by far the most efficient way to earn points and push my rank higher - which makes no sense."
9486,good.
9487,Its a well made game based on card games but with animated battles and interesting mechanics it starts off simple and you will find a lot of people complain about the game being imbalanced but those people are not very good at the game and at the higher levels of play the game is actually quite well balanced in my opinion.
9488,good game
9489,Great game

9511,suuuuper fun
9512,uhh... its goood
9513,"[u]Note: This game runs great on Void Linux with Proton.[/u]

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

This game is really fun, like a more action-packed Hearthstone and a 3D Clash Royale hybrid. I can easily spend a lot of time in this game. It's great to play with friends too, especially because your premade 2v2 rank is different from your 1v1 or 2v2 rank, so you can play with newbie friends and higher ranked players don't have to worry about losing rank. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

You unlock cards and construct a deck which you primarily play against other players online (although there are some singleplayer/AI modes) in the form of 1v1 or 2v2. In game, you slowly generate 1 mana every every few seconds and each card costs a certain amount of mana. When you play the card, you don't control the minions, but they slowly make their way to your opponent (unless you play a building or spell card) and either attack your opponent's minions, and then their base to win.

At your base, you control a Master, of which there are 11 different ones to unlock, and they each have a set of special abilities called ""perks."" You don't control them unless they have a special ability requiring an action on your behalf.

Games are typically pretty short, often lasting between 1.5-3.5 minutes, but can be more or less depending on the match-up.

The queue times are astounding, it usually only takes me 1-30 seconds to find a game, averaging at about 7 seconds. There are also different game modes like Draft mode, Ranked 1v1/2v2, Premade 2v2 Ranked, Friendly Duels, Friendly Team/Guild Duels, Mayhem and Expedition. Most people tend to play Ranked 1v1, followed by Ranked 2v2, however I think some game modes like the unranked ones share the matchmaking queue to reduce queue times.

[h1]Stability & Graphics[/h1]

It's pretty stable too, which is comforting since I'm playing a Windows game on Linux using Proton. In the span of 20 hours I've had 2 or 3 crashes/freezes which I suspect to be a slow memory leak. I find restarting the game (or my PC if I'm using a lot of RAM) every 10 rounds. The graphics are pleasing too, nothing spectacular but definitely worthy, with some really great models and animations. I can run on maximum settings with my GTX 980/16GB RAM/i7-4790k however a cheaper, older setup could run it perfectly fine too.

[h1]Streamer-friendly[/h1]

The game is also very streamer-friendly, I don't typically watch streamers, but recently started again and it's a blast. As a viewer, you can get gold and other rewards (like keys) for watching Minion Master streamers by linking your Twitch or Mixer account. You also have a little cute character in-game that watches your streamer, and you can see your character on stream and interact - it's nothing major but a welcoming immersion. Streamers are, in turn, not only rewarded with higher viewer numbers, but receive a number of other rewards like in-game currency, emotes, game packs and more. The popular streamers also get featured in the in-game menu in the offers section. This initiative, I think, paves the way for future games in creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem.

[h1]Pay-to-Win?[/h1]

Furthermore the game is [b]not[/b] pay-to-win. It does have multiple in-game currencies which is often the bane of my existence, yet spending money isn't required to keep up with the meta as the game is fairly balanced bar one or two strategies which last only until the next patch. You also have multiple methods of farming currency, which I remind you is not required to play effectively, via playing a match, watching streams, winning rounds in Draft-mode, doing achievements and daily quests, signing up to their email list and more.

[h1]Final Notes[/h1]

I usually only play games that are native on Linux, and although I encourage developers to build for Linux natively, but on this occasion I make an exception because it runs so well and the game is so fun. The community is great (almost like a less spammy Barrens chat) the graphics are sweet, the gameplay is addicting and the ideas are fresh."
9514,"First: Pay to win is NOT a thing in this game. Every card, every master and cardpacks are all buyable with ingame currency. Because of daily quests you can at least buy 1 or 2 one-card-packs a day that give you a random card and some shards than can be used to craft a specific card or new masters. However, you can of course buy card packs for money and the 20€ for the premium upgrade really has a lot of value if you like the game and want to support the very open developers. 

Speaking of developer, this one is a blessing! always communicating openly with the community, actively supporting participation at it by gifting currency and card packs for joining mailing lists and discord servers or watch twitch streamers. They are also asking for ideas on the game and even took some cards the community wanted and put them into the game!

Coming to the gameplay already. Games have a typical length of about 3-7 minutes, rarely over 10. Love that! You can dig hundereds of hours into it and still figure out new strategies. Updates and expensions come regularely and it feels like the game is still evolving to its full potential. When in game it is all about countering the enemy deck and play cards at the right time at the right place. Just spaming cards works until silver league. The real challenge for me began at diamond.

Here we have one frustrating aspect: The winner of the game at a similar skill level is most likely the one that counters the opponents deck more and does not make stupid mistakes. And until there is no ranked mode where you pick cards rotatively (like you pick heroes in MOBAs) the skill and game knowledge does not matter as much as the cards you play. But that also has an upside: there is no ""best"" deck, even if there are some cards that are strong because they cover a lot of other cards on the enemy side.

So to what kind of people I would recommend this game? Everyone, it is free and pretty small on the disk! Besides that, if you like strategy games that are fast and short per round. if you like small developers and a game that is still evolving. No matter if you dig deep into strategies or you just want to play casually for an hour per day or so, it will be a lot of fun, even more with friends. On the other hand you first need to unlock some cards before you can seriously begin to evolve specific strategies and that can take a while if you don't want to put any money into it. But that also means you have a lot to collect which is something some people enjoy. So try it but don't get bored as until bronze league you only get to play against bots. As a side note: there are league resets at regular intervals and in the first and secound week after it most of the good players are at a much lower rank so the matchmaking is pretty random, so don't get frustrated by that."
9515,it reminds me of a combination between hertstone and clash royale
9516,its right

9518,"Overall Good.
Not enough quest though, not enough motivation to play"

9520,Very fun!

9526,really great game c:

9528,"This game is fun!
"
9529,"This game is free, simple, strategic, and fun.

The simplest MOBA game I've ever played, full of units to play strategically and creatively, and so fun I keep coming back."
9530,"Solid f2p, can do well even without spending money. Here's how it goes:

- There's two lanes, and a bridge at the center of each one. Holding these bridges gives you exp. This exp is everything. It eventually gives you ""mana frenzy"" - near unlimited summoning resources.
- It's ok to take core damage (as long as you don't take [b]too much[/b] core damage) as long as you controls the bridges. You can spawn minions behind the enemy to take the bridges while fighting off a push.
- You do not want to get into a long, protracted fight without holding the bridges.
- Pushing is fine as a distraction or if your enemy is weak. But the enemy overcommitting on pushes is probably the #1 source of my wins. Don't feel like you have to get a core kill early if your opponent is good.
- If you can hold the bridges at the same time, try to fight the enemy within range of your core's commander. This gives you an advantage and lets you build resources more easily. If you can't, hold those bridges, they are still #1 priority.

Have I mentioned how important bridges are? Learning unit synergies and counters and so on is also very important as a means to this end, but keep this goal in mind and you'll win a lot.

Good luck, commander."
9531,its a pretty interesting thought out game.
9532,not bad

9534,"Fun odd little game. If you enjoy clash Royal you will probably like this game it is very similar in mechanics, but very visiually different."
9535,so far so good :)
9536,"amazing game with no ping issue's
100/100"
9537,Fun little game that allows for lots of different strategies but also is very simple to play and learn.  Everything can be earned through playing and if you sign up for the newsletter they send you codes for free stuff everyday.  Most games of this type are pay to win but this one is not.
9538,good game but after a while you're over it
9539,I love the style and the strategy of it with the different play styles you can go for depending on your master and your deck. It's tons of fun to ensue chaos on the battlefield with hordes after hordes of minions. Easily a 5 star game.
9540,Very epic better than CR i will say very poggers weirdchamp but also pogchamp
9541,Awesome
9542,GOod
9543,Came from Clash Royale so I have a abit knowledge to play this game. It actually is more fun than Clash Royale because some cards have condition to benefits other cards (like Yugioh). Not really a p2w because the card's glory does not increase the damage of your minions. Definitely recommend if you like Clash Royale but that game is money hungry.
9544,"It's a good game. I can tell they care about their community somewhat, considering they release free DLC that you can purchase if you don't catch it. Really good F2P game that isn't P2W. You can build decks of minions. Upgrade those minions and so much more to do."
9545,FANTASTIC GAME
9546,"This game is similar to clash royale, but more. Very fun and playing duos is amazing. I like the different synergies and ways to build your decks."
9547,"It is a good game and not bugy.
"
9548,"Fun game, addictive, and great to play with friends"
9549,Mix of tower defense and card game. Very interesting and very new. Good work for developers.
9550,"So far, it's very fun. Low barrier of starting and satisfying fights. Really fast-paced game - definiyely a good shot for people that don't have the possibility to sit down and start longer sessions. 

The game is also very funny - long time I did not saw such a savvy copywriting!

Definitely give it a try!"
9551,"Fix your awful matchmaking. People in team fights stays afk, it is annoying, this is not normal! if he have 10 mana, than force him to spam random spell at least."
9552,"Pay to win, if you don't pay you don't get access to all the gold, exp, card tokens, rubies, crystals, etc., etc., etc. in order to buy all the heroes with top tier abilities and all the cards. It's no different than any other ""Card"" game. Just like Magic the Gathering, if you don't spend tons of money you will never have a competitive deck. If you don't pay you do nothing but feed other people wins who have paid. Free to play means ""Frustrating to Players"" unless you pay, and pay, and pay, and pay.  $80.00+ for the heroes and card packs on a pay-to-win free-to-play game?

It's a good thing I haven't paid one cent because I would be really upset right now if I had. Instead I get to dodge this bullet and give my money to another company that actually gives you a ""game"", not a tiered payment reward system designed to milk users. 

Remember when games were made to be fun? I do.

I am so very thankful for games like Minion Masters because they let me see all the frustration and headaches up front without me spending a dime. It is games like these that make me appreciate other real games all the more.

9553,ok
9554,"How can I recommend this PTW mobile game on PC money grab? The only recommendation I can make if you play this, don't waste any money buying their currency for minions, etc. There will always be another that you don't have. And expect alot of crashes and bugs."
9555,"They're good minions, Brent"
9556,super fun
9557,Nice game!
9558,"fun free game, not spent much time with it yet but enjoying it so far. Just build decks and use a little strategy to deploy your minions!"

ELMOS RAMBLING REVIEWS 

So i've owned this game since it was officially released on steam... i still have a giftable version in my steam inventory. but i never got around to playing it till last month.  

Now this game has honest to god one of the best free to play systems i have ever see this game is so free to play friendly its unreal. Ive bought rubies twice simply to support betadwarf. you can play this game for thousands of hours without having to spend a penny and not feel restricted. 

Gameplay: Its another one of those easy to learn hard to master games. You can get the jist of how to play and the concept very quickly, but mastering it is going to take a while and im not just talking about making a deck no no no. Placement of your units, when to place them are just as important.

Amazing streamer incentive to encourage people to check out MM streamers. But this in turn causes issues of people dead viewing streams ( being there in the chat not talking andn ot being picked up as a viewer) andi t also promotes harsh lurking, which they have the stream open but they mute it and do something else for the key drops. which in turn negativly effects the streamer as it inflates there viewcount above what it should be and can make it much harder for them to try and go for twitch partnership. Honestly as much as i love this game theres a lot that needs to be done about it. like increasing the player base, sorting out the issues of bots in the lower ELO which causes a false difficulty. imagine playing Bot games on LoL never played with other people and you get to gold 1 and then suddenly playing ranked games with human players its a bit like that. 
 That said the community with the MM streamers is outstanding and the friendlyiest i have ever seen in ANY game. every MM streamer ive checked out have been happy to answer questions, other people in the chat are happy to answer, hell some of them will even take the time to fully explain what they are doing why they are doing it and show you stuff. 


if you read this whole review.... why ? im not that special
"
9560,"Easy to learn, fun to play and its free. Micro transactions are not in your face either!"
9561,GOOD GAME LOTS OF FUN
9562,"interesting take on card games, action is high. i also like the coop mode. the amount of different currencies and reward systems is confusing at first glance. its fun though."
9563,"This RTS/CCG hybrid game allows for a lot of playmodes and has a solid balance structure for each. While depending on the mode certain cards are stronger than others, you can acquire things relatively quickly even as a F2P player. I'd recommend trying the game even if you're not usually a fan; matches are short but very strategic and enjoyable."
9564,good but nerf the dragon please
9565,KEKW
9566,cool game with cool mechanics. for the one that needs a break for hardcore gaming
9567,very fun and addicting
9568,ok
9569,"fun free to play game
easy progress"
9570,"A simple to learn, enjoyable ""card battle"" game with minions. Quite user friendly, VERY VERY friendly to streamers as well with in game integration. Try Minion Masters out, gamers, its free to play!"
9571,It's good
9572,"I've spent many hours playing this game and frankly can't recommend it to anyone who wants to get creative making different strategies and decks. The devs don't seem to know how to balance cards and everytime they release a new expansion, the new cards powercreep the rest for a few weeks before being ""adjusted"". This is so the people who like to get the new cards fast spend their money, even though later most of these cards will be ""balanced"" in order to avoid breaking the game too much.

Right now if you want to advance past master, you need to copy or make a variation deck between 3 types of meta decks. 1 of these uses one of the recently released and later ""balanced"" cards that let you summon units in your deck at discount. Not using this card while not playing the other meta decks is basically being at a disadvantage from the start on most matches. Worst of all, this card has a legendary rarity so it's very difficult to get by grinding or from gacha. The other 2 meta decks consist of spamming low cost units to control areas that give you xp and using several copies of op cards to hit the enemy base (they share the same strategy but using different units).

You can still easily win with more varied decks up to diamond 3, but after that, you kinda lose interest because every match feels the same. Your card draw order can then screw you up or let you gain an advantage using the same tactic over and over. In regards to the community many (if not most) will defend overpowered cards until they get ""balanced"" and then they stop using it, move on to the next op card and start defending this one, and so the cycle continues."
9573,"It's not a bad game. It's a bit of a sequel to Magic The gatherings original Xbox Battlegrounds game. But I can't recommended it due to the micro transactions. Because they use a horrid method of hey for $10 you get x but... if you want to get say a season pass you need to spend $20! even though the actual price is around 12ish maybe 15? I despise the mechanic making us pay more then we need to inorder to get what we want. So that hopefully in the future we will do it again. Just let me buy what I want to buy at a normal $ amount. I'll do that more often. Daybreak games, Payday and hell real MTG is proof of how that works. God I don't even want to think of how much I've spent on magic... ugh."
9574,Fun PvP with 2v2 and a great balance
9575,"Simple, catching, balanced, interesting!"
9576,Great graphics and gameplay :) !!!
9577,It's fun
9578,"fun game
"
9579,"easy to play, hard to master game"
9580,"Fun, uncomplicated easy to learn whilst still being challenging game"
9581,Fun game.  Download it!
9582,This is a nice little idle clicker game. It is very fun to have this running in the background and be able to take a break with this game from time to time.
9583,"The DEVs need to seriously rebalance alot of cards.
really great game, best card game out at the moment in my opinion,
but there are no many unbalanced legendary cards that make the game Pay to win when you get to higher ranks causing the game to be borderline unenjoyable when you dont want to waste $20-$40 a week on rubies. 
great game still but i cant stand playing at higher ranks when every deck has 4-5 legendary cards"
9584,woot
9585,"Until now, nice strat game. Dunno if it's p2w yet"
9586,"Pay to win, feels like a mobile game if you're into that but i quit playing pretty quick. no real strategy to it either just drop your guys and hopefully you have a balance of mana cost and unit strength thats about it.
i tried it because i got a free code for an expansion for slithers or something but i dont even think looking at the price of that expansion i wouldve been happy with what i got so i'm glad it was free.
if you like pay to win or for that matter mobile games you'll probably like it but i dont get all the positive reviews for a game like this"
9587,iF YOU WANT to know then take a second and understarners that i have been doing this since it came out
9588,Great game so far . Only played for about 30 minutes but no complains.
9589,One of the best and fairest free to play games I have played. Give it a try!
9590,
9591,fast pace enough to be fun and to hold interest but not so fast that it kills the strategy
9592,Awesome game! It should be top 1 on Twitch!!!
9593,Buggy shitty
9594,Love playing this game.  Its one of the best RTS lane battle game.
9595,"Great game, definitely going to be spending more time on it."
9596,fun game! lots of action. easy to play
9597,"+first interesting
-later boring
-it want to make you addicted with rewards psychology trick"
9598,"a great lil moba, think league of legends and yugioh put together!!"
9599,fun so far
9600,Like this one :)
9601,w
9602,Really addicting and fun game simular to Clash Royale but seems to have a more free to play basis. Hopefully this becomes cross platform to mobile because that would be insane!
9603,"[h1]Unbalanced AF[/h1]

There are too many overpower combos/decks that people exploit and never get nerfed/balanced that kills all the fun.
Devs are more focused on lure people with them than actually fix the problem."
9604,its fun
9605,Awesome PvP game to play either alone or with a friend in team battle :D
9606,"solid game, loved all the rank gameplay"
9607,Good Game
9608,"Great game, even SOLO!"
9609,"More strategic than most games I've played recently, not spam2win or p2w, basic cards are very powerful. No pay2win. Each card is extremely balanced. Basic cards can get you to high ranks. This is a highly skill-based game. At the same time, there are a lot of very cool cards to try and interesting strategies to pursue. I have not seen any other game that packs as much strategy into 2v2 5-10 min games as this one does. A very unique and compelling game with a depth of teamwork and strategy."
9610,"Truthfully, this reminds me of the old star-craft-2 custom maps, where you would use gold to spawn minions, the concept is very similar to income war, only its got mana instead of money. Its really not the cards you use, as much as where you place them and why. It is slightly play-to-win as long time players like myself have more cards and thus more options,  starting again is hard and harsh. Its less luck based than alot of games around today, its fairly easy to get into master in ranked with a brain and abit of common sense. Recommend it to people, it is free after all. Cant believe i put so many hours into it so far, god damn."
9611,"
ok
"
9612,"It's free, it's fun. If you can get a friend to play with for team battles, it's even better."
9613,An excellent free to play title. Plenty of variety in units and the heroes feel varied and reasonably balanced.
9614,"Inspiring game ot play when your heros ar emoving and have certian race abliitys , very out of the box creativity here!"
9615,Great game!!!
9616,have not had any new redeem codes
9617,EASY AND FUN
9618,i like
9619,Quick matches reminiscent of Battle Net Custom game but much better.
9620,great game. easy and fun to play - enjoy
9621,This very good!!!!!!!!! 10/10
9622,"This game is like Clash Royale on PC, just far more epic and alot more fun. Best of all it's free, and a great way to have some fun without needing to spend any cash. Awesome stuff."
9623,"Great for Killing time, not something Id play for endless hours but its always fun to play a match or 2 everyday"
9624,"I stopped playing because of the random crashes. I recently picked this game up again since the newest expansion, and the crashes are even worse now. I love the concept of the game. The quick simple game play is great, but the random crashes mid game have caused me to lose all interest again."
9625,Very fun game with unique battles each game

Some SERIOUS balancing issues
A frustrating matchmaking system (u'll often get bad teammates in 2v2)
1v1 is pretty bad and frustrating -> 2v2 is where the fun is when u get a good teammate.
The Meta decks are soulless and everyone copy them -> annoying cards will make u have a bad experience.
The 2v2 at Master is just the worse thing that can happen to you, absolutely enraging."
9627,
9628,"Fast paced,FUNtastic,enjoyable"
9629,16-0
9630,This Game Is so Fun You can play with friends you get ranked and you get to make your own deck. It is also highly addictive and funQ
9631,nice quick gameplay
9632,Liked: Graphics. Playability. Nice change of pace!
9633,Very fun fast paced games that can be played in a couple of minutes.  w/o a huge investment of  time to learn and play. Thanks for putting this out. :-)
9634,"i like this game. its worth trying it out.
"
9635,basically a different format of clash royale. Good fun!!
9636,yes
9637,addictive
9638,The game is available for free and even at that level you are competing against other players of your skill and ranking so you can still win.
9639,"fun game unique in its own way which makes it very fun and addictive to play solo and with friends 
~ Stormsy is still the best card......."
9640,"Pretty fun MOBA/Card battler hybrid, if you can manage not DROWNING in loot boxes. Because oh my god, the loot box spam is SUFFOCATING. Play it with a friend!"
9641,"First impressions of this game is that its a well designed ptw trap, first few hours are interesting and simple as each step of the tutorial hands out cards and items complete with sound effects and flashing lights and the early games feel like you're up against bots with user names.

Unfortunately this quickly devolves into a tedious grind made worse as more and more often you start to 'randomly' go against paying players that quickly stomp you into the ground, it is only so many games pitted against a deck of legendary and supreme cards before it just becomes ridiculous.

Team matches are also a matter of hit-or-miss as either by choice or wilful ignorance at least half of the matches will have an AFK player on one side and considering most of my matches are found within ten to thirty seconds I can only assume that they are therefore purposely losing as to lower their rank and play easier matches which brings me to my final grievance with the game.

Reporting a player, after a match if you end up with the frankly numerous displeasure of your teammate spending the entire match with a full mana-bar and both their thumps trapped inside their sphincter then your only option is clicking a tiny button next to the results of the match and reporting them for griefing, thats it nothing else, no 'what did he/she do to throw the match or even any type of feedback or queries just a 'click this button to feel better about yourself now go back to the pits and its endless grind'

"
9642,Amazing game. well balanced and addictive  ! fairly competitive as well
9643,this game is great and beautiful grafics i am in love this game just one this i miss chat option is old and not work it pleas try to easy chat option ..thanks
9644,Fun game. Quick matches.
9645,"I didn't have high expectations for a F2P card based game, but its surprisingly fun."
9646,"At the current stage of the game it has mounting serious issues within the balance department and what used to be a fun, strategic game with a ""P2W2 factor that wasn't mandatory is deviously becoming an enforced thing for players to be able to actually progress past the amassing unbalanced elements (building, units, spells, Minions Master's and their respective perks) that are being left behind wihtout truly being addressed in the so called ""BALANCE PATCHES"".
I'm not doing this review with an eased heart while writing it becuase I've been a player since late 2018 Sept' (i.e., shortly before it also went F2P in that platfform), but in those days the dev's actually played some attention to player's base suggestions made upon Steam forums to balance the game. And I can even present 2 examples of suggestions of mine that were actually incorporated a a later on stage of the game while the Dev' team wre performing balance tweaks towards the game. And those, that were done through Steam's forums threads so far were:
   - Archers range true issue was 12 range and not exactly the 5 Constructs that provided 2 mana that allowed an eased spamming behind those. The Construct was 1st addressed and later on the Archers when after some insistance they've finally came to the conclusion that 2 5 units with 10 range (Blastmancer or Spiritmancer) couldn't beat those;
   - 4 (mana costing) Worlf amongst Sheep during the Werewolves season at which time Dioan also came out, in which the actual problem wasn't the card per se, but rather the Licanthropy effect granting immunity to the shape shifting unit while it transformed into an Werewolf coupled with the said unit(s) decent stat's both in DPS and HP's;
   - At the Empyrean vs. Voidborne battle for whatever season the main issue was ShieldGuard at 6 mana cost coupled with 5 D.Ball spell. That combo was too darned good mainly due to teh SG's stats and skillset, mainly its moving speed that allowed an easy combo with the later. It's cost was raised into a 7 and his stats were addressed. Still a good, effective unit, but now way more into the balanced fold than it used to be.

Alas, from that point onwards the Dev' team apparently got focused in realising the game into as many different platforms as they could to increase their revenue and the actual balance being formerly done plumetted like it if was crashing plane struggling for semi-decent crash landing.
It was the time at which the ""P2W"" milking machine more oriented strategy was placed into action with Stormy being released shortly before it's 'Zen Chi Crap' season actuially starting. The Chain Lightning spell which also served as a base to that unit's attack has it's stun period increased from 0,5 secs into full 2 secs and that has started what we know until current day and age the ""Stun lock into oblivion"" decks with Zap Shrine, Shen, Stormy, the Zen-Chi spells tri-fecta (H.Ball, Lightning and Chain') alongiside with a few other cards from that season that truly never were balance addressed by the Dev' team. And I said that the former ""P2w"" factor was deviously enforced because until every recent weeks players used to see Zen-Chi Crap related pack containing any of the 3 above mentioned ubnits from those days week in week out being sold at the Shop. And the Dev's team ""balance into that Stormy issue was to simply screw Crystal Guardian by changing it's functions rather than addressing the stun period time for both the unit and the accoprding base attack spell.
From that point onwards with the next rising issue coming from the 'Bugs & BS"" season with Nyvir's Breath still remaining the same unbalanced crap and not working in a more similar manner to Magma Storm (even after suggestions), Nyvir's stats not being trully balanced although tweak improved and also the MM's Morellia perks still remaining to be addressed even past that season's over it strongly made me stop supporting the game even from spreading the word between friends and acquaintances.
And now that same policy continue within the 'S**t Wars' season in which the Poison and the Slitherminions poison effect reamins to be addressed, coupled with 8 Whipbringer that can deal with both a Defenso' + Succubus specifically lined up trying to kill it. And if that hasn't served so far to present that this game is LACKING any true balance efforts being made towards it and was turned into more geared ""P2W"" milking machine than it formerly was a non-mandatory factor.

So, thus to all of the presented above, which is rather detailed and to some it'll may seems a Wall of Text, I stopped any actual money and marketing ""spread the word"" support efforts spent into the game iteself and DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Especially anyone willing to SPEND a dime in it while it isn't properly balanced (Ergo: de-gearing from the ""P2W"" milking machine back into a ""P2W"" non-mandatory factor).
And if that changes, I'd be more than willing to change this review into a more favourable one, obviously according to the changes that would be made in the mid time."
9647,"Pretty similar to clash royale, but imo much better! I'm really enjoying Minion Masters, and if you haven't tried it yet I highly suggest this!"
9648,"I just think the game needs less ""robotic"" animations. It looks a bit cheap at certain points"
9649,"It would be a nice game, but some points make this game impossible to enjoy. I'll give this game 4/10, if they fix it, than maybe 6/10.

First of all - this game is VERY laggy, every 3rd match your board just freezes, client doesn't attempt to reconnect, you can't quit to main menu and reconnect manually. What's funny is that 2 to 3 games you play without any issues, but next one is impossible to win. I don't know, maybe their servers are overload or something else.
Seconds - bugs... they are everywhere, in the main menu, in the game, e.t.c. They should fix it, but they aren't fixing. 
Third- as i said you can't surrender, there is no such options, also very poor menu design, not convenient interface, deck builder is terrible e.t.c.
Fourth - RNG, yeah all card games have RNG, but still...

Anyway it's my opinion. GL and HF!"
9650,Great casual PvP game. Very fun
9651,just fun
9652,"greatest strategic game ever, it has its balance issues, but every patch they are adding new stuff and balancing, so it is worth the try, if you want a game that is better than chess try this 100% recommended, also this game is not pay to win, everything can be unlocked by playing the game long enough"
9653,Good game
9654,Good tower-defense game with a good balance in regards to deck building. Some may compare this game to a well known tower defense game however Minion Masters is nothing less than unique.
9655,The games are quick and it is easy to catch on to.
9656,GOOD VERY NICE :)
9657,Simple and oddly addicting
9658,"I played it a little bit.

Seems fun."
9659,"I wanted to recommend this game but their matches need work bad, multiple times I have lost team battles with full health and the other team about to die, I have no idea if this is a glitch or if its hackers but its so dam annoying I am unistalling. combined with a seasons pass bullshit best just to move bast this game."
9660,"Fun quick game, its like a advance clash game with some interesting commander mechanics."
9661,"Its pretty good considering it's free.

wish the ui was a bit easier to manage but apart from that it's gud"
9662,"""Nice for casual play""

I have never made this review up there or given this game a positive note!  I don´t know where it comes from, but not from me. So now there is a negative review and wrote this down,"
9663,Lots of strategy in a matter of minutes
9664,Simple fun game. Just hit lvl 10 and still in the hand holding phase. Might update later with how progression and grind are. Seems about average so far.
9665,if you love clash royal or other strategy sims definitely try this game. not like its an exceptional one nevertheless fun and not p2w game
9666,"Cool game, fun groove, quick rounds some super quick. I wish for more masters and a little bit more depth but other then that great game!"
9667,"An amazing card collecter/strategy game. It's easy to get into, but has very deep gameplay."
9668,"The Premise is fun, more than i expected i started playing cause of a revie i saw on Youtube and thought why not? gave it a shot next thing i know hours had gone by. havent played more cause i am having issues loading hoping to get it working again so i can play more!"
9669,"I like the card aspect. Neat graphics, rotating free playable champions.
It's fun."
9670,its a neat rts card game (think hearthsone but with 2 seperate boards and real time)
9671,"Fun game to play for a few rounds once and while, bit p2w though since legendary cards make a big difference, you can still get them without paying, it just takes a whole lot longer"
9672,"Is it good?   well i am not too sure on that,  But i don't hate it."
9673,I don't overly like CCGs and I don't like MOBAs at all. So the fact that I like this game - which is a hybrid of those two genres - kind of annoys me.
9674,"Fun, easy to pick up, quick enjoyable games, great developer engagement through the newsletter."
9675,"On the store page it looks like a mobile game but controls much more snappy as it's made for mouse/keyboard and it's actually pretty deep mechanically once you get into it.
What isn't apparent from the store is that unlike similar games it can even be played with a friend or a random team mate in a 2vs2 format.

The only downside is the business model - you get tokens containing random cards and those can contain duplicates. This makes it very hard to advance your collection past a certain point as it ultimately hinges on being lucky to get a certain card. Though I have to point out that the game is fairly generous with tokens (card packs) so you aren't exactly starved on rewards - be they useful or not."
9676,good
9677,nice game
9678,"its instantly addicting. very fun, fast paced, simple and the reward mecanic is very satisfying. 10 out of 10 so far."
9679,Fun game that only gets better over time.
9680,finally a card game that doesn't suck
9681,great game to pass the time
9682,A concept with combat that is easy to start but difficult to master. Ever-evolving gameplay strategies mean no deck can beat everyone.
9683,No loot?
9684,Clash royale but better
9685,"Great game, you should enjoy it."
9686,gud gem
9687,"Very fun, nice"
9688,good game
9689,Fun af
9690,"Great little pick up and play game, can boot MM and be in a match within 1min!"
9691,Pretty good
9692,Great fast paced game with cards.
9693,its fun to play. and finaly a game to relax
9694,"It's just as any other online card game, but with a twist. I started watching people stream Minion Masters over Twitch and Mixer and it was then I got hooked on playing it myself. Don't believe me? Try it for yourself and tell me how you like it."
9695,"2019 REVIEW:
""easy to learn
fun and addictive to play
plenty of different game types and events
sub 10min game times (10m+ is very rare)
doesn't take long to build a deck that will rank up quickly

I do wish mayhem was active for longer rather than having down time between the new rules
expeditions are probably the most grind-y part of the game, but are a good place to test new deck ideas

lastly I think random games would benefit from players decks becoming locked from making any changes once you reach a certain rank, or you lose some rank points for each card removed so that games are more consistent between games with players that have solid decks vs players that are testing a new idea""

2022 UPDATED REVIEW:
there are now way too many different combinations possible in the game, with the balance of each card too hard to quantify between 1-10 mana where 1 mana difference makes the card either too overpowered or too expensive to play; while constantly releasing new cards making the new meta the most viable thing and patching out the old meta that you may have enjoyed playing.

combination or themed decks are less and less of a thing, the synergies designed into a type of card usually have an upside and a downside and they are not worth playing anymore- the only thing at on the leaderboard is a random mix of card types usually low cost, high value, again showing the devs lack of understanding how to balance the game-  because there is no baseline value for what 1 mana should do for every card, meaning the game is now impossible to balance and this comes out more and more in tournaments, where they allow you to ban most recent patch, and like 2 cards, thats it, out of like 200 cards.

they have alienated their original players by destroying the viability of old combinations and the unique gameplay that you would boot up the game to enjoy. this is the same thing big games suffer from such as dota/league of legends where the frequent updates actually are actively eroding away the initial success rather than polishing the core game mechanics and synergies originally proposed. overall very disappointed with the updates as a whole."
9696,This is the first game in awhile to keep my interest. I dig it
9697,"Easy to learn. Fun. Everyday missions with rewords, so you can collect cards and upgrade them for free. 
Of course, if you are not so patient type, spend your money - there is a shop for that purpose.
Downside of this game is that if you don't  play it frequently, you will have a lot of cards to catch up."
9698,"Fun, challenging, no pay to win, strategic game. With friendly players, if you need spare 30 min to reboot your brain -  you can do it here )"
9699,"just a fun game to not focus on
"
9700,"What to say, easy to play, get the hang of it very fast, you can play with mates its just perfect game for working people."
9701,very relaxing and ill recommend it
9702,Pretty good game overall. And its free!
9703,"I like the game, but I don't feel I am playing against real players, but against their decks, It's so easy, I haven't lose the first time, hope it gets fixed"
9704,"Love this game! You can play for 5 minutes or 2 hrs. The daily quests add some incentive and the different mode options, team, co op, single, give you some variety. Also always nice to support a smaller studio with that does really great work. :)"
9705,awesome game
9706,"greeat]
"
9707,Well executed game.  It is what it says on box.
9708,"fast paced, fun, friendly!"
9709,"A buddy of mine and I picked this game up on a lark a couple of  years back.  We were looking for a simple time waster while we waited on a group of friends playing some other game we didn't care for.  I've been hooked every since and have spread the love to many others.

The basic concept of the game is fairly simple, build a deck of cards that you instantiate into the arena.  Those cards (minions/spells/etc) then autonomously follow their developer coded instructions in eliminating other minions or making their way to attack the opposing master(s).  The deck construction mechanic is fairly straightforward where you attempt build a deck that takes advantage of synergies between the cards and your master's powers.  It won't take you long to realize just  how easy it is to steal decks from other players.  When a strong meta emerges, fully two-thirds of the decks you face will be so similar as to be identical.  Most of the remainder will be decks setup to counter the meta.

For me, the best part is taking a deck and becoming comfortable enough with it that you can counter strong meta decks or even decks that take advantage of the weaknesses of your deck.  Achieving victory from an underdog position through superior play is a blast."
9710,This game is awesome and tons of fun. it doesnt require you to purchase the battle pass and you can still unlockl everything threw just playing the game daily. although if ya do buy the battle pass its worth every penny. i highly recomend this game.
9711,I'm supposed to pay money for this?
9712,"It's low-key and great for someone who wants to play a game with a friend. 

It is the one game where the ""progression"" system rewards the player a lot, which is a plus and something that will make you happy while playing (most likely)."
9713,"Only a few games in, but seems polished with lots of things to unlock, and simple (so far) but satisfying gameplay."
9714,It´s fun!
9715,"Devs got greedy.

Not a fan of the changes made to currency earned.
You now NEED to buy the battle-pas with real money to get access to the latest new and often overpowered season cards. The cards are behind a pay wall.

You can't craft them with the currency's you can earn in game during that season.

Before if you played allot, you could earn enough to buy a battle pass. Maybe spend a few bucks to make up the difference if you didn't have enough time that season. 
This has been made impossible and you will need to spend money if you want to the latest and newest cards each season. 

Would have been nice if we could at least spend minerals to craft the season cards. But the fact you can't and they force you to pay for the BP if you want to use the newest cards sucks."
9716,Nice and cute game. Easy to play ^^
9717,"It is nice game, but the admins and game makers are cheating and make you lose! So it is not recommended game. They can turn a winning style game in second into a losing game... very pathetic... in conclusion good graphics but results are fake a lot of times!!! So I do not recommend this game for anyone. It is a not a good game at all ... if the staff would not cheat... it could be a good game... but... no! And full of lags all rounds so you will lose always because of unexpected errors... unexpected disconnects... unexpected quit other player... unexpected whatever... pathetic game... and admins also know there are bots in game... pathetic!"
9718,"Great game, great time killer even if u have only 5 minutes. Amazing keep good work up"
9719,it's fun to play
9720,"Quite a mixed experience for me, can have a brilliant day playing the game on some days, then others you could have people throwing, bringing decks worth less than tissue paper , the game exploding and disconnecting you mid game or maybe you'll just grow frustrated by bad luck at being matched up against people that possibly forked out more cash so they'll roll you with supreme and legendary cards that you'd need RNGesus rolls for (or grind just a few couple dozen hours for a single legendary). 
The bugs and playerbase aside the gameplay itself is quite great imo and will have a rollercoaster of different experience for you if you play long enough. Though I must say you'll likely have to grind hard to get the best cards for your deck as there's none in high leagues that haven't, you can make it rather far with skill alone, but not too far."
9721,Great game!!!
9722,Sweet game. Fast play. Engaging and fun.
9723,I've had some fun.
9724,Incredible game. I highly recommend playing with friends tho.
9725,"1) Pay to Win
2) Filled with bots made to look like real people
3) Mostly Children
4) Gets old quick
5) Horrible matchmaking
I also got chat banned, for no reason other then having a conservative opinion. Bashing conservatives and being vulgar and insulting in the process is perfectly fine and allowed. If you share a different opinion even in a completly respectful way.... you get an instant chat ban. TOS states no political discussion, but that only applies to people the mods disagree with, the people they agree with are allowed to go on hate filled and vulgar rants with no concequence whatsoever. No thanks, only thing worse then censorship, is one sided censorship that only targets on side."
9726,Yes
9727,A very fast paced game that is lots of fun. I am a total noob though playing in the lower leagues. I bet that some upper tier players use extremely cancerous decks to get sneaky wins and I have not faced any of those decks yet up to gold tier (both in single and team battles).
9728,"Great game, a little grindy but well worth it. I highly recommend this one."
9729,Great game to build a small stream community!
9730,"A casual fast paced card game
This game really understands what is ""casual"". The game rewards you with a lot of free stuff as long as you login,a steady learning curve with a friendly tutoiral, little time devotion, always trying to came up with fun stuff, casual guilds where you can just chat, or just chat in the world chat where everybody is friendly, each game only last around 5 mins, not more than 15 minutes. 
So, if you are looking for something casual, requires little time devotion and it is online, this is the best fit for you."
9731,:]
9732,Nice time-spender.
9733,Fun game
9734,"Fair game, not pay to win
"
9735,nice graphics and nice game because its free to play :)
9736,"I've been too busy playing this game to write a review!

I'm not going to write a review except a TL-DR:
This game is fun, you should play it."
9737,Great fun. Hadn't realised I had spent 200 hours on it until today. Girlfriend hasn't left which is a bonus.
9738,This game is trash.  Rip-off of Clash Royale but it's trash compared to it.  The mod's are cancerous and the game is boring.  All the positive reviews are from people who simply haven't played Clash Royale.
9739,"Just pretty cool, got a little time to play , this game gives the max felling of enjoying of a game ;]"
9740,good mechanics
9741,It's a nice game with fast matches.
9742,game hay
9743,Pretty fun to play.
9744,"awesome game
"
9745,Awesome!
9746,"Fun concept -- poor execution. The game is incredibly buggy. Disconnects coupled with instant defeats if that happens make it nearly unplayable. After 2 hours of gameplay, I couldn't continue... I just kept getting defeated while I was winning because if disconnects."
9747,They really need to give better Draft Rewards out for get 12 wins!! but that is about all i could say that needs to be done the game is good besides that part.
9748,"Clash of Clans for the computer, good graphics, good game to run with friends."
9749,Pretty good game easy to learn
9750,decent fsho.
9751,.
9752,Great game to kill time
9753,Great
9754,"Super fun and challenging, especially once you get to the higher levels - I'm addicted!"
9755,fun
9756,"Pretty enjoyable trading card/RTS hybrid style game. Free to play...check. Easy to build decks....check. Loot chest galore....check. Matches usually only last 4-10 mins so you can grind matches pretty quickly. The only thing I can say is a slight negative is the seemingly endless amount of different currencies that you are awarded. There are so many that they almost all start to feel worthless and confusing on what you actually need them for.

The flow of matches feel pretty smooth, animations of units also look great. Lots of room to customize your deck to cater to your play style and with a little practice you can really put some nice combos out on the battlefield. Queue times are usually VERY short (less then 1 min) which is also a huge plus for me. Definitely worth a try, no need to buy anything to fully enjoy this title."
9757,fun so far
9758,"Have enjoyed many hours of fun battles, really great animations and get to play new free masters weekly.  Once you get to gold status it's pretty hard to hang in there since you have to pretty much pay to get best cards.  This game is good enough that I might pay to unlock masters get all the fat lootz."
9759,great game needs more characters though
9760,Fun and free to play if you don't mind playing without upgrades.
9761,good
9762,werry fun game
9763,amazing
9764,"My previous review was this: ""A game what developers care about, through patches, updates, community aka discord, steam, betadwarf.
For people who have doubts, this is really a free game, but you can by things makes no big difference.
Crack on people! Mash it!""

My review after almost 1600 hours in the game now:

Do not play the game people if you willing any support or solution for dealing with cheaters.
They clearly willing people to copy your save file, share it, and than give them timestamps to prove what you saying, and even if you did, they will not change anything but will tell you, it's your misunderstanding, and on their discord server, they allow any people to comment on support and ignore every word you try to tell them. Theese guys changed in the bad sense.
You not going to get my money anymore, nor my kids will play this game anymore and my friends and community will know about you from now on, and will encourage them to avoid such headache for they own sake, cause noone cares cheaters. They said theres no cheaters in this game. Well, maybe this is true and this game is the first in history like that, but i highly doubt. Yes you people at betadwarf talks very sophisticated to people, but thats not an excuse to ignore issues being adressed. Most people wont even take the effort to tell you all that i did, they just quit and never come back. Care better for your business!"
9765,"Very easy to learn, fast paced and really fun casual game"
9766,addictive and subtle
9767,heck yah.
9768,"The Tutorial is super corny but if you get through it the game is fun. There really are strats and you have to pay attention. Attack or defend, wait for the right renforcements or rush your soldiers.... Mainly though, the price is right."
9769,"Has a great draft mode and gives lots of free stuff. But the microtransactions are extremely expensive. Either be ok with not having a full collection, enjoy playing draft, or spend a lot of money."
9770,iz alright
9771,<3
9772,"One thing I really like about this game is that I never feel like I'm punished for playing it. You know what I mean. These other free-to-play games insist that you not play too much or they'll start asking for money. In-game currency is ample to play the different modes, like draft or mayhem, without feeling like you're wasting your gold if things don't work out. In fact, draft mode was a great way for me to learn the different cards and masters, while building my collection.

It's free and fun, so give it a try. Jump into ranked mode - the lowest ranks are all bots, so you win a lot and level up fast."
9773,its pretty fun
9774,"Good fun game, with unique mechanics. still figuring some of it out, but hey that's 1/2 the fun
"
9775,Well-executed deck-building Moba-alike.
9776,"Fun, quick matches, I like that you can knock out a match in less than 4 minutes most of the time, makes for just some fast paced games and requires more interaction and on your feet thinking than auto-battlers in my opinion."
9777,Cool card game
9778,Very fun if you like card games
9779,took 10 minutes to get through tutorials now enjoying some drinks with a friend while playing co-op battles. Dont really understand game mechanics but at least at this level that doesn't seem important :D
9780,"Fast pass, good balance and interesting deck building. Enjoying it so far."
9781,"easy to start, fun to keep going"
9782,"Very addictive game, I definitely recommend it!"
9783,Very fun game. It may look like it's P2W but it's really not. I've never spent any money on it and I have most cards and do good.
9784,"Good game, much more to the game then originally meets the eye in regards to strategies etc... Also not pay to win which is nice."
9785,"veRY FUN CREATIVE AND FLUId , i really enjoy it , hope it develops even further
"
9786,"to read so many people say this is a pay to win game is a joke.  The Dev's offer codes for free cards and coins and even ruby's.  there are free ways to unlock masters but its a grind yes.  they offer a free rotation of each master each week.  Think of Clash Royal.  two lanes with a focus of controling each to gain exp.  this game is best played with friends but offers a lot of content for solo players to.   

Can you spend money to get to end game cards faster.  of course.  but there is a way to grind it to.  dev's are very active and the best part is most games dont last longer then 2 to 4 mins per match.  so for someone looking to play as they go and not the overall life soak this is a nice place to stop."
9787,"Very strategic game, people might say its P2W but it's really not. Great community with alot of people who are willing to help new players. No need to pay anything if you spent enough time, i haven't spent a dime on this game but im only missing around 6 or 7 cards which you can get in different ways. Either you spent money (obviously), get enough shards to craft it or get lucky with power / season tokens. Every 4th spin with power tokens and free tokens grants you at least a supreme card / supreme bonus (gold or ruby's)"
9788,Fun game so far. the matches are fast pased and short.
9789,"Never thought I'd get hooked on  game like this, yet here I am 2k+ hours later. Loving it."
9790,Clash Royale on roids
9791,4 player paper rock scissors with animations and facepalms.
9792,"Very fun and addicting. Strategy is the key, learn from your mistakes and other people's decks and you'll go far."
9793,"I love this game, especially the Exploration mode with Team Battles."
9794,An accessible and fun to play strategic arena battle game that led to me losing 3 days straight when I recently decided to play it for the first time.
9795,ive been playing for 2 days and im already hooked. its like the better version of clash royal. as for suggestions i have none. keep making and adding on to a good game
9796,"A better version of similar games found on mobile.  Mixes RTS with CCG deck building strategies.  A favorite is team battles, as they allow interesting combinations of cards impossible in solo."
9797,"I just hate that the devs steal player decks and Steam IDs to trick you into thinking you're not playing against bots. Most of the time, especially in the lower ranks, you're playing against bots. But they've done a bunch of tricks and gimmicks to try and make look like you're playing against humans. I wish they would just be honest about it and not try to hide it. That feels really sleazy.

But other than that, this game is damn-near perfect."
9798,Great.
9799,Very nice and balanced game. Not pay to win at all as you get plentyfull awards.
9800,Great for Mastubation
9801,"This is an easy and free game, quick turnaround game 2min - 8min a game. Ideal for killing some time and lot's of fun. There is a bit of luck, and a bit of strategy (using combos) needed, but anyone could play. It is nice that one person will not always be guaranteed a win as it (pun intended) is the luck of the draw.. I'm having so much fun with this!"
9802,"Fun little F2P game.  No ridiculous monetary commitment like HS needed. Sadly, the game gets boring pretty fast."
9803,fun
9804,"For like 5 days without stop, I played this game. It's a fantastic and fun game  butttttttt, It's obvious how new it is. Waiting for them to add a lot more content before I come back."
9805,Lovely game to play with friends :)
9806,"Great game, lots of depth"
9807,"9/10

If Card Games and Auto-Chess had a baby, this would be it.
For what it does, it does it pretty well. 

Pros:
- Free to Play
- Has integrated streaming and promo option
- All games are archived and can be watched at any time
- Good Graphics and Audio
- A lot of possible strategies and combos
- Can be played 2v2 ( fun with friends )
- Easy to get into, doesn't require money investments in order to build competitive decks
- Balanced gameplay and very active development
- Nice community, discord channels and clans 
- Some vanity and decor items in microtransactions to add flavour

Cons:
- No consequence for leaving a 2v2 match, except for losing the game and some rating
- Some high-end graphics settings may crash the game under heavy loads"
9808,great game
9809,"Update: 7/30/2020
Developer's greed is showing as they repeatedly tweak the game. Players can no longer earn the next battle pass by playing often, you must pay monthly now. There are other changes they have made as well, but this was the slap in the face for me.

Still best of breed, no other game like it even compares, BUT after a year of greedy, if not just bad choices by the devs, I am on the fence with whether I recommend this title anymore. My issue is that there is still no alternative for this type of gameplay. Though the game will empty very fast when one arrives, if the devs haven't made better choices by then.


Previous Review:
Easily best of breed for this type of game.  When it first arrived, I never thought it would surpass Clash Royale, but it did and by a wide margin. If you enjoy this type of gameplay you just can't go wrong with this one..."
9810,"very cool, is not only a cards game, so funny. best of the year.
still very good 2021"
9811,VEGAN POWER!!!
9812,Great fun game !!!
9813,"By far the best free to play game to date. Normally if a game is free it will be loaded with micro transactions to make your character better. In this game the only benefit off of micro transactions is a larger variety of cards, all of which are pretty damn well balanced. The only downside is that if your a newer player or you don't play too much or you don't spend any money on the game, your smaller variety of cards means less ways to play the game, and the start can be perceived to be less interesting. But you gain cards very fast at the start so there are always new decks to try out. 
Also, each card has 1 of 4 rarities, common(silver), rare(green), supreme(purple), and legendary(orange), each tier does NOT represent how good a card is but rather how unique/interesting the card may be, as well as how many shards it cost to purchase that card (regular currency.) 
At the time of this review I have 142 hours, all but 2 supreme cards, and only have the account upgrade (faster xp/gold gains) since around 100 hours played, so overall you don't need microtransactions or that much playtime in order to have a lot of cards / more available playstyles.

Overall this is by far the best and most balanced free-to-play game EVER."
9814,"easy to learn and fast matches, 2 vs 2 option is great"
9815,i can smash people ez
9816,"Tower defence meets minion MANAgement, kinda cute game, a bit grindy at times, but fun nonetheless."
9817,A nice game... for free!
9818,Very addictive!. Makes time go by very fast.
9819,Good game dudes
9820,"Edit of review. I was chat banned by brisbe for no reason, I asked him why hes giving me a warning, I said what did I say? Than he outright banned me for asking. Wtf is this nazi crap. Do they not believe in free speech or what? These people are huge babies if they ban people for normal talk. I took a screen shot too btw. DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY IN THIS GAME. Just play it if you like it.

After all these hours I have the just of the game. I am level 50 in master league. So far the climb has been alright but there is a big grind and it feels like even when you win matches the rewards are not really interesting or feel rewarding. 

There are different events you can do also which were also a big unrewarding grind. It took me 3 days to get all the keys for one event.. 
I like that you can craft cards, however anything above common tier is really expensive considering the rate or lack there of, you get the ingredients to craft them. On average a win nets you around 20 to 25 ish gold. 

You need 1000 gold to buy one token to roll for some cards. Its common to get a common card, and rarer as the names imply to get other cards.  When you roll and get a common card you get like 15 shards or around there, to craft a common card you need 50 shards, to craft the next tier you need I think 150, to craft the next it continues the multiply how many shards you need, going to legendary it costs 2000 shards. 

Doing the math, this is a HUGE grind. To get the cheapest master hero to use as your summoner you need 500 shards, to get the mid range its 1000 and increases from there. So there are currency sinks in game to sink your hard earned currency into. There's no need to make it very expensive and grindy. I understand they want to slow progression because the game does not have much content yet, but I hope this grind gets lessened overtime because id say thats the most off putting thing about this game. Now this review doesn't mean the game is bad, its just really grindy. 

I for example do not like grinds. Yes you can pay so you avoid the grind but a game shouldn't be made in a way to encourage that by grieving you with low yield rewards per play time spent. Also in regards to mayhem, you get a few free losses in that event, than after that you have to pay gold to battle in it. This is another HUGE sink. One that should be avoided if you are a new player as gold is extremely hard to come by and it costs 750 to try your luck in that event again. Same thing with draft, never pay to do the event. Just do the free ones. Never spend your red gems. Save your blue gems for masters."
9821,"Good game, short rounds that last about 5 minutes each, And well-balanced. While there is some degree of monetization, it isn't pay to win. Pretty much everything short of a few skins is available through a long enough grind."
9822,Think of it as Clash Royale
9823,"It's got the boom booms and the pew pews. A+
"
9824,I really like the mechanics and accessibility of this game. Sometimes you are matched against weird unbeatable decks though and the frustration can be quite high in those cases. But most of the time you can have fun and try sweet combinations.
9825,Amazing game and the developers are constantly working on it
9826,I just started playing this game but I needed a simple RTS style game on the FTP market and this filled a void. So far so good.
9827,"Just started the game and Im seeing so many possibilities for gameplay advancement. Easu to build decks, creative solutions to strategies, multiplayer, and the opportunity to grow a deck without buying anything. Great game!"
9828,ringan2
9829,whydoistillplaythisgame
9830,great tower defense game highly recommended for anyone who enjoys tower defense games
9831,Game is fun for relaxing time and play it very often
9832,"Short games, good if you've got 5 minutes but can also play for hours. Not hard to get into and very fun."
9833,its just really fun with a friend :)
9834,Hours played should speak for my opinion.
9835,This game is absolute shit. DO NOT PLAY. Just download clash royale on your phone.
9836,"I really like this game, both in random 2v2 and premade 2v2.  There's a surprisingly deep level of skill and finesse to how you play, it very rarely feels ""random"", games are a reasonable and short length (2-8 mins), the community is great, and climbing the ladder is fun."
9837,A better version of Clash Royale.
9838,fun game reasonably balanced tower defense. updated semi regularly
9839,fun and interesting concept. you need the experience. some will like it some won't. some want to rule them all and some don't. it's free. should I say anymore.
9840,Good time filler.  Quick and easy to learn and play.
9841,addicting game
9842,"Hands down the best Tug of War game out there. Quick rounds and high skill cap. Extremely well balanced game and caring developers. Cheap battle passes if you want to collect cards faster. That doesn't mean it's a pay to win game. It's a diamond in the rough. Check it out!! ""I Ain't Scared Of No Ghost."" Play it! It's incredible! This is a game worthy of your time! They just recently had a major update that improved the graphics of the game. It's looking great and is running amazing! A must play! Don't be afraid! Download it now!"
9843,"I love this game. And this guy who looks like Jesus, keeps sending me free codes for new cards. God I just love that Jesus guy."
9844,verry nice game with great minions xd
9845,Best Card Game out there^^ and FREE^^
9846,Great game to sit down and play a few quick rounds.
9847,"A friend and I usually come back to this game every few weeks when a new content drop comes out. We play through until we get all the new cards, then stop playing so much until we stop altogether, and then pick the game up again at the next update. This is, to me, the optimal way to play the game, as your ranks will go down when you don't play for a few seasons in a row. This lets you smash your way through the lower ranks and get to Platinum without much difficulty, letting you try out as many weir, wacky and not-very-good-but-fun decks as you can think of. You can smash your way through to plat because anyone below that is a braindead moron. Then in plat the level of play goes up so you start getting some fun and intense matches, and Diamond and Master ranks go even further. 

Probably like a 9/10, given the frequent content drops, substantial card roster, fair in-game currency and lack of glitches (though there are some from time to time). The only real negative about this game as far as I can see is the occasional balance issues that arise. Nvir and Morellia for example were really broken when they came out and it took a while for any balance, and even then they are still some of the strongest things in the game. It's not too much of an issue though, as every card has a counter. 
Gameplay is fast and fun, most matches last between 1-4 minutes with the longest I've ever had being between 8 and 9. I find the longer matches to be the best as they require either a great strategy or a stupid-yet-situational build to win, and are therefore the most satisfying. That's just my opinion, though. 

But yeah, 9/10 defo recommend"
9848,"Really love this game , hours and hours of fun"
9849,its fun ans easy like your mother
9850,"Fun gameplay with very few unbalanced things in the game. The biggest issue you'll ever have in the game is when you play against a deck which happens to perfectly counter your deck however that's just the nature of card games.

The game allows for attempting to create really insane strategies that seem ""out there"" and very creative ideas with the format of the game. The game's new additions and dlc content is free if you own the game and download the dlc when an update happens. The free DLCs bring along free cards to experiment with, helping new and old players both experience the good parts of new season's cards. The netcode for this game is so solid I happen to get matched with players in other countries at times and the game STILL runs smooth as butter with no lag.
Minion masters DOES have a good number of problems though,
-Balancing actual Masters takes a while for devs
-Some Minions take a long time to get the right balancing down
-Some Minions could be entirely changed to an unrelated effect from what was done before. Ex: A card called ""disruptor puffs"" used to make it so that 2 cards in the opponent's hand costed 2 more mana.  Distruptor puffs spawned 2 of the minion type. If I had, let's just say 2 Disruptor puffs in the correct position, some of my opponent's cards could be costed up to 11 mana(the max mana you can get/spend is 10) therefore making the game unplayable for an opponent. This was changed to ""Disruptor puff"" whose effect is being 1 mana(previously was 2) and now teleports to capture bridges every 6 seconds. The effect is entirely different than before and this demonstrates that the developers could at any moment change a card's effects entirely, so be wary."
9851,"I've played a lot of Clash Royale and this game is like Clash Royale but 10 times better, It's not money hungry 
the graphics is great"
9852,i love the battles the wait time for matches is short controls are easy and the bonuses are wonderful don't change a thing keep that DLC coming
9853,"After playing for like an hour,I can say that the game seems fun and gameplay is really smooth.If u are fan of card/tower defense games make sure to check this game out! :)"
9854,"Excellent game. This is the best rock, paper, scissors game out there. Lots of different strategies to employ. Very satisfying."
9855,"Very addictive and balanced (no pay 2 win here) card battle/MOBA hybrid. Easy to learn, very hard to master."
9856,Very entertaining!
9857,pretty gud
9858,"This game is generally quite fun, it's a mix of lane pushing game and TCG. The devs seem pretty cool as they monetized the game fairly and give away some of their DLC packs every once in a while. Frankly the only DLC I'd spend money on is the masters pack, but it's nice that they give some away. 

My biggest gripe with the game is probably the Glory system, whereby cards in your deck generate more EXP gain per match based on how many duplicates of that card you have gotten. As it stands I feel my best decks are probably around 1300 glory, but it hurts giving up like 900 glory per match from using a weaker deck. This feels like a lose-lose situation, either I gain less exp per match or I have a lower chance to win any given match. It's not nearly as bad as systems that involve getting extra copies to statistically power up cards, but this doesn't feel so great either. Also stings to then look at a streamer and realize they get like 4k-5k exp per match while I'm over here wasting my time at less than half their progression speed. 

Please add controller sensitivity setting to options! Tracking is way too slow and it is very difficult to do something like play a defensive minion then quickly cast a spell across the map. Deckbuilding with a controller is also made awkward by the cursor snapping onto the next page when you wanted to change decks instead, might be better to rely exclusively on RB/LB to scroll pages and leave the cursor free to move at will. 

Please also make it clearer to newbies on the battle pass page that the first tier is a skin, and not the hero itself. There's more than enough empty screen space on a PC game to add the word ""skin"" to the landing page. 

Battle pass tier ups also seem weak in general, a full tier can take hours to grind and getting some junk like 25 season glory or 50 with the premium seems like a bad joke. These tiers at lvl 20ish already take like 40,000+ Glory to get one level, getting the ""reward"" of an extra 25 or 50 per match is almost insulting.

Also feels really cheap that when you join a guild you are taunted by all the rewards you can't claim, and apparently even if you join and help progress to the next reward you still can't claim the level you joined at..
I'm honestly not sure whether it's better to join a low level guild or high level one, as I've yet to see how much exp higher levels take to get and what kind of rewards they offer. From what I can see of levels 1-35, I'd recommend joining one at level 28 to 31 or so.

In general the game is hardly without fault, but it is fun enough, it's well polished, and it's free to play, so if you have any interest in deckbuilding or lane pushing games I would indeed recommend giving it a try."
9859,"This is the best game of it's genre.
It's NOT pay to win; Cards do not level up and get stronger. They only make you earn more rewards faster.
"
9860,"A fun, beginner-friendly casual game with one of the most entertaining global chats i have encountered so far."
9861,Good free to play game for a hour or more.
9862,"A fair free to play version of clash royale.
Nice frequent updates"
9863,Fun strategic quick blast for when you don't have much time to play...
9864,Pretty great free game. Decent business model. Fun as heck.
9865,Great game!
9866,"So balance issues aside, I have had a great time with this game playing casually just to relax and turn my brain off for a bit. The other fun thing is getting to play with card and deck configurations."
9867,"Wonderful game that you can pick up and play competitively after just a few hours. It's surprisingly addictive once you learn the mechanics of each card. Building decks and trying new things keeps the game fresh.

-- Update: I still feel the same way about this game and there's talks of a 2.0 rework coming that will involve crossplay with mobile along with a UI overhall! Would be a great time to get into the game before all the reworks and be ahead of the competition"
9868,"Fun, Quick, and great game play!"
9869,"The voice acting is terrible. Everything else is brilliantly carried off. As are DJ Strode's opponents, usually. Come on down and join the Endless Miss Guild. You don't have to talk to them - I never do. Buy a Starter Deck with a Colossus and a Succubus etc. The frantic battle royales that occur simultaneously in different parts of the arena are often  ridiculous, frequently hilarious. It's all free - no paywalls - buy a starter pack and pile in. The voice acting is terrible - did I mention? - just as I suspected!"
9870,Better than Clash Royale.
9871,"Edit... I really like it but my bank account doesn't. I wish it wasn't such a cash grab but it is. Love the idea of trying different styles and mixing that with skill but this is hard to do when it's 20$ a card after the basics I need to give it up and hope for something similar that isn't highway robbery. Still a lot of fun I hope it has a long life,  wish steam had a better rating system... Again but I have a big complaint with it and it's a 7 of 10 if I was to rate it, anyways here goes there is nothing to keep players on, they stop giving you gold and rewards after so many games, I noticed it's better to only play every 3 or 4 days. Let some of the rewards save up, I'm sure this is a attempt to get people to just spend money, but I spent 50$ so far that's as far as I go. So now I just don't play instead"
9872,"Picked this little gem up as a freebie and glad I did,.. Fun to pickup and play a few games each night. Overall I think its a very sold game and well worth the price of a download."
9873,
9874,Good Game
9875,"pretty low key minion battle game. The variance and balance changes are always interesting to see. It's been fun to see how the game has evolved over the past few months. If you like strategy but aren't really into card-battle games, definitely give Minion Masters a try!"
9876,"Discovered this game recently and can't stop playing. Great fun. 
A cross between DOTA and Hearthstone.
Great for playing a quick match whenever you got a few spare minutes (matches last from 1 to 7 min. most of the time).
Almost all cards are playable. Only a few cards and 1 Master are overpowered and they are a real pain that need a fix in my opinion.
As for the economy and p2w factor: I only paid for the 2 DLC's and even without those I reached master rank very quickly. Lots of free cards while levelling up.
Overall the most fun I had in a game and genre I never heard of before.
8/10"
9877,"Very quick and fun game to play, you don't need any super cards or special strategies to get up high in ranks. Since it's for free you should try it out, gave me more fun than some of the games I payed for."
9878,"good game, try it but it takes a few hours to learn what cards are op and what cards are not which on ranked you will see teams using the same cards and almost the same dragon spamming but i do recommend."
9879,Шикарная игра!!!!
9880,"Still very new to the game but I already love it. It reminds me of castle fight (wc3 mod). But mixed with individual deck building. The masters and their special abilities give this game a nice touch. Looking forward to play and enjoy it more. Recommended for people who just like casual fun combined with creative strategy. Not too easy, not too competitive."
9881,"Play a few match, basically is a nice game which similar to clash royale but it`s on PC."
9882,"Changing the wild cards was a bad move. won't be playing much now. 
guess I've save money on not buying the season passes. 
your loss."
9883,"real fun
edit: after a few updates that everyone but bitchboys and asshats liked its gone down a bit"
9884,Have only had the game for a hour or so but its fun and easy to play. really enjoy it. Will not be spending money on it tho
9885,"very easy game to play ,"
9886,"Havent played the game long enough for a proper review but, its really fun so far.

And I really like the edition of the xp and perk unlocking system mid game, adds some fun ways to play.

Generally this feels more in depth and fun than games similar to it. So far 10/10 would recommend"
9887,"its not like there are no other types of games out there, but this actually definitely is a type i believe will make it far, and ive played a lot of games..."
9888,great for spendin time
9889,"Very fun, free and not pay to win."
9890,"Nice and fun Card/strategy Game for free. nice visuals, regular updates by devoted devs.... Love it.
Been playing for a while now and it's doesn't get boring"
9891,I enjoy this game still it not get to pay to win.
9892,"Pretty well balanced, offers a 2v2 mode so you can actually play with your friends. 

It's like a better clash royale"
9893,"good game xD
"
9894,"Really an awesome game
"
9895,"Easy to get into, but, also easy to reach f2p time gates.
Overall good fun game, great time killer!"
9896,"I'm enjoying my time with this game, give it a try if you haven't already. It's really fun!"
9897,"Fun, simple, interesting and free. No reason not to try it"
9898,k
9899,This game is so fun! You can just jump right in and get the basics of it and it becomes really addictive. The game is basic so you will learn it quickly!
9900,seems interesting bc it's short and simple strategy yet advanced enough te become skilled over time
9901,"It's a simple game, easy to understand, and at the same time it have a pretty complete gameplay if you delve into it (timing, efficiency, decking, etc...).
The matches are pretty quick, usually longing from 3 to 5 minutes, so it's a good game even if you already play a lot of other stuff, or just don't have much spare time.

The in-game community is... well, it's a community, so you'll sure find a place you bellong, as much as the oposite xD

The game is for Free, and even know you're able to speed up your BULKINESS by purchassing some packs, you don't need to, and they even give you a lot of good stuff for free with every expansion."
9902,addicting
9903,good game i like it
9904,"The ""tutorial"" doesn't teach much about strategy (and little about the game) and then playing ends up feeling like the winner is random.  It may turn out that it just has a significant learning curve, but some hand holding (such as a tutorial which went like ""your opponent has played X and your best available counter is Y because _Z_"") would help greatly."
9905,Its fun and free!
9906,it give pp suc
9907,really fun good amount of battle
9908,"I've got tons of hours on this game via Xbox, it's a great game. I can't really think of any major faults."
9909,"Great Game! Always something new added to dynamic of game, keeping it entertaining and fun"
9910,"This game was good but as with any online card game they buff/nerf cards and you're sitting there with cards thinking wtf my deck doesnt work anymore. I kept playing but this issue produces top tier players that are all using the same decks its pretty much as bad as ""Artifact"". These games need to forget buff/nerfing cards and just leave the first iterations as is and release MORE cards."
9911,"Fun game, seems pretty balanced, doesn't seem pay to win."
9912,It's a fun time-consumer. Especially with friends
9913,"Easy to understand and fast paced while still not being overly hectic.

both teamfights and solo fights are fun and neither avatar seems overpowered"
9914,Addicting and easily playable without spending any money. You get free stuff every once in a while.
9915,great game!
9916,It is a better Clash Royale. You don't have to wait for the chests to unlock as you buy them with gold you earn by playing more and more matches.
9917,I wanna try 3v3!!!please...
9918,fun game! kind got me hooked.
9919,Awesum.
9920,"There's a bit of a wall that takes a bit of a grind to get over without paying, but it isn't egregious. I suggest saving up the rubies you earn to buy the battle pass or whatever."
9921,"Fun mechanics and gameplay. Haven't gotten super far yet, but thus far matches aren't obscenely impossible due to being matched with players with 500x more xp, which is rare for a PvP game."
9922,"Well made and maintained, balanced, and fun to play."
9923,Fun!
9924,"The game is fun. But the number of MTX in this game is comically huge. After every match there's some kind of popup of ""Buy rubies"" or ""Get the battle pass"" or ""Get this legendary card chest"" for whopping sums of money. Every menu is plagued by offers for you to buy rubies. There's three currency systems all of which are pay-to-win.

Good game, and I don't mind if others use microtransactions, but can we please have a way to disable all this bloat? It's disgusting."
9925,Simple and fun! You want to try it!!!!
9926,"This game used to be really phenomenal, but now I have to say that it has become desperate. It all came down to getting as much money out of the players as possible.
I am sincerely disappointed.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND !!! : ((("
9927,"fun to play , nice learning curve , great experience so far :D"
9928,Clash Royal + Hearthstone..... AWESOME
9929,Good game and really fun! Matches are fast and full of action.
9930,"At first it seems like some microtransaction-laden P2W hellhole, but in reality it is a very fun game to kill anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, with a fair monetization model."
9931,I love this game!
9932,"The game is fun, it's just like Clash Royale, with more cards, but...

85$ DLC
10$-20$ Legendary card bundles with ""66%"" discount
10$ Battle Pass
Rewards shards like a stingy Grandma

I can't afford this Free to play anymore..."
9933,Fun and easy to get into but also hard to master. No P2W so far.
9934,it is fun until you get to higher ranks and everyone is toxic :(
9935,The multiplayer is the Core thing.....but the battle pass is over this game head......make it 9.99$ at least
9936,very good game with minions and masters and masters of minions
9937,It's fun. Basically Clash Royale but with the twist that crossing bridges gives you xp which gives your main hero on the tower some perks.
9938,"its addicting
"
9939,Best of its type.
9940,Very addictive game but then you realise its just shallow and alot of people are toxic.
9941,i like it
9942,Fun deck builder so far. Gotta play more to make a definite oppinion.
9943,"Fun game, non-cancerous FTP mechanics."
9944,"Easy to get into but hard to master.  The games are quick, and there is enough variation among the masters and cards to make sure you never get bored.  The is not pay-to-win despite what some of the reviews say.  You are adequately rewarded if you invest the time and play a few games every day (which is like a 10-15 minute investment).  It gooood."
9945,Good game for entertainment
9946,noice venum approves
9947,Yes
9948,Fun game! Dynamic and easy to get into.
9949,"2a.m in the morning. Is that whole some enuf for you guys ?
"
9950,it is a good game!
9951,"The people operating this game [b]DO NOT BAN GRIEFERS[/b]

I have played with someone who has over 200 levels and leaves every game I match with them intentionally.

Do not waste your money on this game. f2p only if you have to play"
9952,nice
9953,"Simple, quick and fun."
9954,very nice
9955,"They put a gun to my head and said if I don't leave a good reveiw they'll murder me. So hear I am, Under my own will. shitting on other gamers wifes in game. 10 out of 10"
9956,"It's really diverse, haven't played tons yet, but seems fun"
9957,"its an Interesting game, the minions are well done I enjoy the Modeling for these units"
9958,"Super engaging and addictive game play. Easy to pick up and play without any real experience. Easy to set down and walk away if life gets busy. Wins feel good, loses are quick and relatively painless. Matches last around minutes each in my experience, maybe up to 10 with an opponent of equal skill. TONS of rewards and a rank up system that feels pretty good. I am still low on the ladder but so far doesn't seem to be P2W, I'm only using cards I have won in game and still winning most of my games. There appears to be a ton of content, with more coming, and an active player base. Looking forward to more!"
9959,Nice bite-sized fights that are quick with low devotion of time each match.
9960,So addicting!!
9961,Pretty addicting gameplay!
9962,"this is cool
"
9963,"Only played for about 30 minutes so far. Fun quick games, very easy to pick up and understand. The animations are great and the aesthetic is amazing. High quality for a free game. Keep it up!"
9964,Fun Time killer!
9965,yeah must admit aint half bad :)
9966,Absolutely fantastic game!
9967,"It's free, It's fun. I haven't played much, so it's downfall *may* be pay to win -- but for now, It's pretty fun.



**update
Get's a little boring and grind-y after unlocking most things like a maniac in just a few hours."
9968,love this game interesting concept worth a shot
9969,"excellent little strat game, I started playing it ass a bit of a meme and have absolutely loved it so far."
9970,Like a more balanced version of Smite Hand of the Gods. Fun Fun.
9971,"My friend and I played this game for about a day and a half until we realized that nearly every match we were playing was against computers/bots under the guise of playing against other humans/players. They mislead you into thinking that they're game is a PvP game where you play against others where in reality its just against a brainless computer that you just beat every time with ease. You can notice this by the same decks being played against you every match, as well as how the other players never are in guilds or interact with you in any way. Also if you try and message any player you recently played against, it will say that the username is not found. ABSOLUTE SCAM

The game is dead and they artificially try and generate new players through botting. Unethical and a waste of time for everyone. 0/10"
9972,good
9973,"Amazing, simple game. Fun and addictive, beginner friendly and intuitive.
If you liked clash games on phone, you will like this even more."
9974,Fun
9975,"Good game, really calms me down. Just having some fun time."
9976,Fun game so far if you enjoy the style
9977,Clash royale but on pc.
9978,"Its a really fun game. If you are bored and have nothing else to do, I recommend it."
9979,.........
9980,only played an hour or so but great fun so far!
9981,"Easy to pick up, well defined, non-gimmicky creatures. 
A good spin on the freemium card game formula."
9982,"Absolutely love the concept. The game feels quite accepting of P2W and gives enough strategies to counter it for casuals. As a relatively new player, I don't know of balancing issues but it is known that balancing is quite hard.

This pack gives one time bonuses to everything, thus if you enjoyed this game, the low price of this pack is quite reasonable. The game is quite new, it is evident by some visual / frontend errors, but I trust developers to solve those."
9983,Cool game but the shifts in card/playstyle/mechanics balance after every single update is purely infuriating and I can't recommend it to any person who wants to maintain their mental health.
9984,"Very fun game for when you in the mood for something casual, fast paced, and fun! Especially if you are into deck building games!"
9985,Simply Fun. Quick. Awesome.
9986,Excellent fast paced game with super-friendly ui and tutorial. Nice way to spend a few fun minutes.
9987,"It's like League of Legends, but you can play it hammered."
9988,I enjoyed the simple yet challenging game.
9989,great game !!!!!!
9990,more like minion masters xd
9991,its simple and fun.. so far i dont feal like im beeing bombarded with BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY msgs... its just trying to teach me how to play and have fun ...
9992,A fun and quick game. Its easy to play and this announcer voice is funny.
9993,"Every single update to this game brings despair. It's very clear that these developers do not know how to run the show. It's likely I will continue playing this game in the future, and also likely I will continue being furious each time I see what I can call nothing short of incompetence on the behalf of whoever vomits up the trash that we call balance changes. The most recent atrocity removed the ability to play as 2 of the same master in premade duos, because ONE specific master was too strong in that way, and they refuse to nerf her anymore because she's their newest pay to win trash. And also they ruined my favorite hero milloween, AGAIN, even though she has literally never been strong in any meta. This game's balance is a complete joke and the monetization format is not only directly intrusive to gameplay but directly intrusive to balance. If you have never played this game, please strongly avoid it for the foreseeable future."
9994,A great way of introducing new players to the game and lots of fun to play!
9995,....
9996,"Good Stuff , fun for friends"
9997,"never wrote a review after 45 mins, but this game is just great in the beginning. m
very fast paced, no tutorial and you dont need it. battles are like 1-5 mins (so far) and its all vs others players.
its free, just try it.
im now at 45 hours and still having fun"
9998,Very entertaining so far. The announcer is pretty enjoyable.
9999,Pretty good will update in time
10000,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Minion Masters is game that is simple on it's surface but has quite a lot of hidden depth. The game is a bit of a mix of a trading card game and a real-time strategy game. The combination works well and I highly recommend the game for those who enjoy either genre."
10001,Yet another addictive game
10002," This is like an evolved 3d PC version of Clash Royale (which I play often on the mobile) yet sprinkled with nice innovations.  So far these are the features that make it better than Clash for me:
- The characters and setting. I love the trippy dark fantasy style similar to the Key Forge card game.  
- Battle is smooth and fast paced and the animations are great. Being a strategy game it feels like an action game.
   
I see the potential that this game or maybe a sequel can further innovation and bring strategy/rpg to new levels of awesomeness.

 Thumbs up to the dev team, keep the great work!.

"
10003,"This game is a masterpiece, anyone who likes clash royale will be in awe of how many cards there are."
10004,A very new well thought-out game. Really enjoying the similar mechanics so far!!
10005,The game is awesome so far! It reminds me of hearthstone but on a new level. xD
10006,Awesome game fast gameplay
10007,Lots of fun so far. I don't know what the meta is yet but I'm sure once I find out the game will get more interesting.
10008,"very fun, easy to start, a lot to achieve...."
10009,"It just appeared in my inventory as a gift - tried it - loving it. Coming from Hearthstone , loving the cardgame type of games, i loved it almost instantly.

Tutorial is spot on
Unique minions
Unique heroes

most likely going to kill time on this game alot more, definetly reccomend"
10010,it an amazing game
10011,very nice game simple and so fun
10012,"+team battle
+fast pace
-limited deck"
10013,Fast pace and anything can happen in a game
10014,"Easy game, easy life card game but in real time.

Very easy to execute even in high ranks. Free wins. Pretty good filler multiplayer game incase you want a easy life but don't get me wrong you can still make stupid plays although with experience you know very fast which cards give you value for their mana and therefore can switch out after matches whatevers holding you back until the deck becomes consistent.

And a small amount of mind games. Yea good free to play game to fall back in incase you are getting destroyed in your favourite FPS or MOBA. Even the starter Deck Ive heard is viable at all ranks despite me not relying on it but I trust the expert's word that it is possible."
10015,Super fun I love it Moooooar
10016,Great selection of cards. along with strategy
10017,"I'm not normally into card games, But there's something charming about the way Minion Masters uses them that makes it feel so fun. When you get that one card you've been waiting for, and just let loose an army on your opponent, it feels amazing."
10018,"Hell yeah I recommend this game! Its f2p 1st of all, and its blast to play. Why wouldn't you at least try it?"
10019,"Fun game! Kinda short when needing a little pick me up or when short on time. 
"
10020,Enjoyfull game !! (:
10021,"This game is a fun, easy going game that's great for people just starting out. I rarely play games and this is my new favorite!"
10022,Great Game xD
10023,great progression in learning to play
10024,WHY NERF MILLOWEEN AND HER DECK AGAIN AND AGAIN???!!!
10025,this is great because so many options for strat builds!!!!
10026,"Honestly slept on this game for a long time because it just looked like a shitty mobile game. It's actually a lot of fun though. A good game to play while waiting for friends for other games. Matches dont take long and they're plenty engaging

EDIT: New update literally a day later that added a tower with aoe map wide shock, and apparently something that can one shot my big units. And everybodys runnning it. Went from 90% winrate in plat to 20% winrate in silver because I didnt pay money for all of these overpowered cards. Uninstalling"
10027,nice game kinda like clash royale
10028,"pretty easy UI, fast combat and excellent cartoon animation style combined with good voice acting"
10029,Hihi me likes.
10030,It's a fun game. Good strategy and fun
10031,Noice
10032,Game is sick!
10033,"Interesting concept, like the game"
10034,"For the low price of free, it's definitely a fun game to play 2v2 with a friend."
10035,"gg
"
10036,"EDIT: Recommended to Not Recommended

Relentless and shameless addiction pop-ups, a pretty limited set of cards, games feel too brief, and are usually one-sided. Music is repetitive and gets to be grating quickly, sound effects are generic. Tutorial bot is annoying and sarcastic. Needs a lot of streamlining redesign. I hate seeing the constant global chat full of meaningless back and forth between angry players. If there are guilds, why the need for a global chat? Uninstalled.

One word review? Hassle."
10037,"The hallmark of good game design is depth. This game remains simple while providing a banquet of options, thus it has great depth. It also improves upon the genre with a few interesting mechanics."
10038,"So far with the few hours that I've had on the game...... I'VE HAD A BLAST. Being able to co-op with a friend in  a game is amazingly fun. The graphics fit the game well. 
Will update once i get more hours in. And I'm sure those hours will come fast lol"
10039,Awesome game !
10040,"The Pros: This Game is so amazing and sooooo addicting building strategies and conquering the Arena is so fun very competitive yet fun and yet so exciting you never know what the other persons strategy is and what cards/Minions they have definitely recommended try it and see if you are not a MOBA player or a person who loves those type of gamed don't play you will not enjoy but even if you are not try it anyways It's an awesome game! Have fun Minion Master see you on the battlefield! Salute! :D

P.S
The Cons: They need to add more cards more Minions NEW MINIONS!!! :) NEW NEW!!"
10041,"I'm amazed to see that I've already clocked almost 10 hours on this game. It's fun, it's easy to learn if you've played Hearthstone or a tower-defense game, you can play for a long time without paying a dime, and it's fast-paced without requiring lightning reflexes or button-fu.

Sometime soon I'll buy 5 or 10 bucks of something in-game just to contribute. I've paid far more for lesser games.

There appear to be a lot of negative reviews complaining about weak AI or pay-to-win or nagware. I haven't really seen anything like that so far. And if I do, I'll probably just stop playing it and delete it. I mean, it's free, and to my mind, it's already earned my 5 or 10 bucks that I plan to pay soon.

I have gone up a couple of players I'd call twinkies with cards well beyond their (or my) skill level, so there must be pay-to-leg-day in the mix somewhere. I was able to beat one of the twinks anyway using pretty standard techniques and a low-level deck; money can buy lots of things, but it doesn't buy basic skills. Twinkies seem to be the exception rather than the rule, so you get through those battles and move on to the next ones.

Overall, it's a good deal (for free so far!) and entertaining."
10042,Quick and fun.
10043,fun game.
10044,A nice change from FPS
10045,"If you like doing the same thing over and over again to avoid having to think, this game is for you."
10046,Super fun!!
10047,Pretty fun
10048,"This game is awesome. very simple, free and the devs give away TONS of stuff. The packs are worth it and marketplace price is reasonable. The 2v2 mode is very fun. Support these devs."
10049,"Perfect mix of CCG Tower D and Strategy puzzle, fast paced and your sure to love it in minutes!"
10050,no gae
10051,good
10052,gud game yes!
10053,Weird mix of Plants V Zombies and Hearthstone. Anyone who knows me knows I am a sucker for TCG so when you're able to make it work with anything else I am usually interested but not enough to leave a review. That I am says how much I enjoy this game and I truly hope the devs continue to add to it. This is something special.
10054,Very nice to play with a friend
10055,Fun game so far.  Very easy to get into.  I'd recommend for a nice diversion sometimes.
10056,Good game so far... Let's see how it goes on the long run
10057,nice graphics and gameplay. simple and straightforward
10058,Good Game. Fun to Play. I am still not sure if i am only fighting bots or if i am actually good. ._.
10059,Great game! 10/10
10060,"Seriously fun and very engaging! 
I love the narrator too! Makes you feel good about playing."
10061,Reminds me of South Park Phone Destroyer but more fun!
10062,"Plays like crash royale but with heroes and experience points. You pick a hero, pick a deck of minions, then try to destroy your opponent's tower. There are also objectives in the middle of the map."
10063,im good at the game.
10064,"this game is easy to pick and a great way to pass the time. though i loose track of time so far lol great game, very intuitive, beginner friendly. i would recommend everyone try it out for a day and see for yourself."
10065,like  a Clash Royal and free !! nice
10066,"a nice, fun game. good for killing time."
10067,"this game has taken up hours of my time its so much fun im level 10 in a couple hours its SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
10068,Cool game.
10069,amazing game!! i cant wait to play with my friends jackie chans!!!!!!!
10070,Baaa
10071,fun and engaging
10072,"Its Clash royale, but. . better.."
10073,"Fun and Addicting. Satisfied my lust for laning and card games. And for the low price of Free Fiddy it can't be beat
"
10074,The rankings give it a competitive edge without detracting from the overall game experience
10075,Pretty chill
10076,"good system and the graphics are good too 
the most important is that the game is fun and not pay to win
"
10077,this game is pretty fun. much less expensive than Clash Royale. would recommend
10078,super fun looks a bit p2w but i have not lost any matches yet as a free player ^^
10079,"Just started, but enjoying this game so far!"
10080,fuck this is fun!  that is all....
10081,"pay to win, no good for competitive."
10082,"Its a trap and crap =_=
80% of the game you will play with AI that pretend that this game has a good online.
Other 20% of the game you will not play, you will search for button how to decline donations that they ask for every second button press.
Game has that good old mechanic when after some point you will stuck in your progress unless you will give them money.
After some purchases in game for real cash, they will remove loser team AI from you for some time.
Uninstall and forget..."
10083,I like this game because I saw a lot of friendly players and I love how fun is this game.
10084,Mad fun. Clash Royale but better.
10085,Good
10086,fun take on classic tower defense games. way more fun than typical tower defense games though imo
10087,Great game for all ages.
10088,"EDIT: I go to log into the game today, and it tells me the servers are down. When checking the status for the game, it states the servers are up. It seems that I have actually been banned from the game as a whole based on what has been stated on Steam! This is disgusting.

EDIT: Literally within 5 minutes of posting my last edit in this review, I log into the game and my chat was suddenly banned until the year 2047. So, I have been banned for 27 years based on what I've said in Steam, not even in the actual game itself (since I couldn't, considering I had a 10 day chat ban already). GOOD JOB!

EDIT: And again, chat banned for saying ""Thank you Brisby for the one day ban that lasted for a WEEK!"". Boom, suddenly banned for being toxic for two weeks supposedly. I expect they'll just not notice and it'll last for a month or so. This company is total crap with their banning policies and using ""volunteers"" to moderate their chat. EA and Blizzard were on my main radar as some of the worse gaming companies, but BetaDwarf is quickly rising here.

EDIT: And yet again chat banned by Brisby, the biggest turd of a chatmod there has ever been. The chatmods are volunteers. They are not paid. I suspect it's a bunch of teenagers who got beat up at school and are taking their frustrations out in the game over the dumbest crap. My chat ban was supposed to last for a day. It's been 4 days and I still have the ban, and they don't respond to emails about it.This trash company will never receive a penny from me with this crap. Oh! And they use an IRC server for their chat server and when you are banned it is IP based. My friend came over and tried to play on his account, but he got the same chat ban message even though he has never even talked one single time in their chat. GOOD JOB Betadwarf, you freaking morons.

EDIT: So this time I get banned for politics again, however get this. We were all talking about China/Hong Kong/Blizzard and what's going on politically. Chat mods were there because some of them were typing. Absolutely no word was said about no politics. Once you bring up Trump and impeachment however, their underwear gets in a wad and the warnings start going out. When I say that I am just expressing my right to free speech and make one more comment, boom, banned. Perhaps these companies should realize that banning over political beliefs is probably a really sore subject in the gaming industry currently. Not to mention politics is apparently alright as long as it doesn't involve Trump.

EDIT: Within one hour, I questioned chat mods. I used the word ""president"" and was told to keep politics out. I wasn't talking about politics in any way. I told the chat mod to stop being a care bear, and apparently that's enough to get you banned. Call them out for being care bears and they react by being care bears. 

EDIT: Within one hour of emailing them about this issue, I was not only unbanned, but gifted gold and tokens. A mod also messaged me in game to apologize. This is good customer service. Please just keep a check on your mods who ban for really stupid stuff. I'll change it to a recommended review based on this.

Very fun game. Quick matches so you don't have to wait 30 minutes to wait and go get something done. However, I am going to not recommend this game based on their chat moderators. I was chat banned after only two days when people were arguing about some stuff and a chat mod intervened and I merely suggested that he not be a care bear. Now, tonight, someone used the word ""kike"" and THREE people asked what the word meant. I simply said ""kike means jew"".  All I did was answer their questions, and within 5 seconds I was placed on a 4 day ban. I am not joking. This is the limit of what was said from me. I am thinking the care bear thing is pretty accurate at this point. This company has no control over what their chat mods do. Even other chat mods have stated openly that some mods are less lenient than others. Shouldn't there be some unified rules in place here."
10089,like tft but better for friends
10090,Great game so far!
10091,"they asked me to write a review, its fun."
10092,Unfortunately after the latest update i can no longer play due to the resolution of my screen being off and i cant even see the change resolution button....this has happened before you would think they would stop breaking it after a few years of this bug happening...
10093,Great fun!!!
10094,game is nice its really well balanced
10095,"Theres alot of counters in the game and if you play right just outa skill you can win 99% of the time
"
10096,"its an easy to play game 
good graphics smooth and fun 
"
10097,good game overall. Nice time waster that you can play with friends or by yourself. Would recommend to anyone.
10098,Sick so far
10099,It's really fun if you're into card battle cards coming to life on the battlefield. I love it and no p2w.
10100,"Very fun to play, but at the game's current state, it's easy to get burnt out. There's different game modes, but they're all the same thing right now, so it's literally the same type of match, over and over. Also a lack of champions to play at the moment."
10101,Having a great time playing and streaming at the same time. My twitch viewers got a nice prize too!
10102,This game is fun. Especially with a buddy. It's easy to learn and easy to dominate. I am the best.
10103,"Very fun game, a lot of different cards to use"
10104,"Free to play.....try it. or die at least, and download 

Some cards are broken, bad thing."
10105,"I have only played for a short time, but so far this is a nice game to sit back and play while talking to friends on discord. Think a slightly more advanced clash royale with heroes of the storm graphics and you've got Minion Masters. And although the jokes from the announcer never made me laugh, it has gotten quite a bit of air out of my nose. Highly recommend you giving it a shot."
10106,"Good job, clash of clans op, need tablet version"
10107,"This game v fun, makes me want to spend my monies o no"
10108,i am doctor.i like.i save humans
10109," Very fun because you can battle by yourself or as a team and you can collect new minions and get gold and all kinds of things.
I would definentley recomend this game."
10110,"Minion Masters is a fun, strategy game with card game elements mixed in. If that is your type of game then I would highly recommend this one. It's a good time and you can even team up with friends for 2v2."
10111,"[h1][u][b]Short Version[/b][/u][/h1]
Surprisingly alright!

[h1][u][b]Long Version - may or may not contain spoilers, you have been warned...[/b][/u][/h1][spoiler]
I was just casually trying out some unplayed backlog games in my library that I downloaded and installed like months or even years ago but haven't really touched them yet; this was one of them. I was honestly expecting a piece of crap game, - yes I was judging the book by its cover, but turned out to be the opposite. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
I don't even think there is a story...

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
Very clean, and has cartoony texture to it. I like it.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Basically Yu-Gi-Oh +  DOTA (or any other similar styled games to this). In case you don't know either mentioned games, Yu-Gi-Oh is a card based game where you dual each other for supremacy, well that's the goal anyways. In that game, you have various play cards and rules. One of which that Minion Masters borrows is the summoning technique where you throw down your card onto the field to summon your creature depicted on the card. However instead of summoning them willy nilly and instead of taking turns, you have to wait for your mana to regenerate enough to summon the card's monster. This also replaces the need to sacrifice monsters to summon a higher levelled monster. And of course the cards don't take up field space so you don't have to worry about cluttering your playmat or field with cards on there as they just simply disappear upon summoning.

The DOTA aspect, standing for Defense of the Ancients, is basically tower defense game where you try to stop your opponent from getting to your base with his minions. You do this with your summoned monsters. You can also use your avatar if he's got the ability to attack opponent's side.

The arena's pretty small, so it'd make for a quick casual game here and there. Maybe longer if you're up against someone who can counter all your attacks and vice versa...

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Not much to say here as I wasn't really paying much attention in this area.

[h1]Other notes (issues, complaints or otherwise)[/h1]
Nice thorough tutorial when you first jump into the game. All games should come with this when you first start no matter if it's a sequel to its predecessor and assumes you've played that to already know how to play the sequel fine; what if the sequel has new gameplay mechanics or buttons? You wouldn't know until you find out...and then when you do find out, you're like ""Oh, well this would have been handy to know when I started..."" Just some good old hand holding just to show you everything you need to know, at least once, and then after that, you're by yourself instead of constant hand holding that some games do or no hand holding at all and you basically have to research(or trial and error depending your play style or if you can't be arsed to read the instruction manual...) how to play the game first before being able to play properly....

I've only done like 2 hrs...so things might be different if I play longer....but so far I'm on the assumption it's just gonna be multiplayer here on out, duking it out with other people, unless you're doing the challenges which I think you're up against bots.

10113,fun fun fun
10114,VERY GOOD GAME
10115,Bridge gives a slightly but yet impactful difference among the other games that are alike
10116,Good Game
10117,Nice game
10118,"Easy to pick up, good competitive replayability, games dont drag on forever and you get just enough out of it to have fun and come back. Highly Recommend!! Also cool multiplayer
"
10119,this game is awesome
10120,"Thoroughly enjoyable.
Haven't paid for any heroes and still enjoying it a lot."
10121,"The game is a lot of fun and easy to play, nice graphics and mechanics, very solid gameplay"
10122,"Nice game to play with cards

10123,very nice
10124,"Good game, its fun, but its free like a demo, most content needs to be baught for money or grinded"
10125,its a very fast progress in the beginning its well balanced its giving me continiuesly stuff its overall very nice
10126, its amazing im realy enjoying it if you like clash of clans but want a better vertion install it
10127,hay thanks for the game its fairly easy to get a hang of. its fun no glitching or lag means a lot. i want coop missions vs ai for rewards maybe like a few missions to get to a boss fight
10128,Not bad
10129,THE BEST GAME EVER
10130,Fun simple and doesnt pressure you into paying for stuff. I like it
10131,It is a fun alternative to Clash Royale
10132,Nice time killer.
10133,Fun game.
10134,a really FUN game but oh boy nothing more devastating than disconnecting when you're so close from winning and counts as a loss due to some salty loser leaving the match before it ends. on and on for almost more than 50% of the matches....at this point it is still very hard to take it seriously sadly. let alone killing the joy overall.
10135,feels like a good arena tower defense
10136,this is a great free to play game you could spend hours on and still on be bored
10137,Super fun game. Very fair. Easy to learn.
10138,awesome game!!

10145,:) really enjoying this game and the community seems alot less displacing them most Combat oriented Competive games.
10146,"FUN GAME! good to pass the time with quick battles that dont leave you stuck to the comp 

"
10147,"Fast paced battles and diverse card combinations make this an incredible day to try, and there's no buyer's regret because it's free."
10148,i lIKE cARD gAME
10149,good game but need more event and masters and more monsters
10150,"This is the closest to being a dungeon master I can get without resorting to war for the overworld, which needs micromanagement but doesn't allow it. This neither needs nor allows it"
10151,"The games so good, it balancing and have many ways to play."
10152,"Good game 10/10, Basic Hero > Paid Heroes"
10153,really fun game
10154,This game is easy but satisfying. The comparisons to be drawn are a literal goldmine
10155,awesome love it so far
10156,"This game is really fun, the dev is constantly balancing the cards. IMO it is a very similar game to clash royale but BETTER. The mix of different masters and XP levels increase the dynamic of this game. I'd love to see the team to grow the number of players because I don't want this game to die out. I know this is mentioned in other comment, but maybe make a mobile version and make the platform syncs?"
10157,"Quick, easy to learn, tricky to master"
10158,"Fun, easy to learn and kinda addictive"
10159,So far seems pretty cool. Just like clash royale but on PC. We will see if it gets pay to win down the line. If it does i will update this review.
10160,5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10161,"G00d!
"
10162,"I have just downloaded the game, its great fun and already very addictive, with a 10 online win streak so far how can it not be fun right :)"

10167,nifty way to pass time
10168,Suprisingly fun 7/10
10169,It's a good game needs a story mode for solo and co op but its fun with what it does have.
10170,"Mods ban you for being ""toxic"" if you call out to players repeatly leaving games but does nothing to leavers."
10171,RREERERERERERERERERER
10172,Pretty fun so far
10173,"Very fun game but like most F2P games its just pay to win.    F2P = P2W
2hrs and cant progress without opening my wallet."
10174,Big fun.
10175,I've always loved card battle games.  I've had some matches on Minion Masters where both of us are down to our last 100 or so health and we've played so many cards that the bonus's have stacked and each card seems to negate the other until one player gains a second or so advantage and the right cards to over take his foe.  This game has me coming back everyday to play.  Thanks for the good entertainment.
10176,It's really fun!
10177,Love it!
10178,Good game.
10179,fun so far
10180,nice game i really like Nexus war. so this game is good !
10181,great game
10182,It's good
10183,great game. hybrid of battle chess/hearthstone that looks a lot like league of legends!
10184,Gets boring after 15 games
10185,Minion Masters is a fantastic game that is very much worth downloading.
10186,GGG EZ
10187,Epic game
10188,"The worst game I've ever wasted my time on.
Edit: The game is nearing a trash state. The devs do not really know what to do with it, so they just keep adding more cards, just to make it look like they're doing something. My last season."
10189,"Was introduced to this F2P (Free To Play) game through a Twitch Rewards's promotional loot. Never heard of this game before, and shocked me, as I love such games. They did very well with the game mechanics and effort they put into it. This game is like many games a fast paced, exciting, sorta RTS card games with a unique twist. Many things that work were inserted here. Players are both happy and excited to come back and play again, but not kept into a loop of endless grind. In-game daily achievements and goal rewards are a nice, but not mandatory on the player. Really enjoy team play! Best for those break session quick game play moments."
10190,Great game. I genuinely enjoy playing it. 4/5 stars.
10191,Fun game
10192,Fair game where mostly one skill matters and not how much money you invest in the game.
10193,"be careful, this game can be very addictive!"
10194,really nice game!
10195,I'm enjoying my small amount of time played as of yet.
10196,hey its good
10197,"fun game, easy to learn, and quick matchs"
10198,"pretty fun but every time i play one of these games they put me against people who are absolutely impossible for me to beat the only matches that i lose are against people who are an entire rank ahead of me, really annoying, other than that the game is fun.
I just really hate that when I just started like 3hrs ago they are making me fight people above silver."
10199,Very nice game!
10200,"I keep checking in to see if the game has been made playable yet, but it hasn't and I don't think it will ever be playable. It has a wannabe sneaky pay-to-win mechanic in which you can not progress into the higher ranks, but it's not sneaky because most players know that the matchmaking is corrupt, so they just insult the intelligence of their Customers. As soon as you start getting some wins the matchmaking sets you up with either someone (or a duo) who have the exact counter deck(s) or an unstoppable bot, not sure which, either way it isn't a game of skill as it should be. 
Like most games of this era, it's PTW trash, basically a good game ruined by a bad business model that was obviously developed by an extremely stupid person."
10201,This game is easyfun and can be played with or against known friends and players. It also matches you up to similar opponents. Well it has so far. enjoyable.
10202,not my type . copy of clash of clans version card game
10203,"Your game, is an incredible, magical journey. Hand in Hand with David Bowie, but like, not the old sorta haggard Bowie, but the one with the bulge in his tight...tight.........tight pants."
10204,"havent gotten into the game too far but it just seems really fun, i imagine it might have balance issues at higher levels of play but at this stage it just seems like a really fun game, i would recommend it"
10205,"Starts off fun, but becomes very stale and boring.  The progression is almost nonexistant, you basically upgrade cards to get more score, and the score unlocks more cards and gold and rubies etc.  But the kicker is you have to purchase the Season Pass to unlock most of the rewards, but you will still get some free rewards, but they're not even near as good.  And that's really it, you upgrade cards to get more points to...upgrade cards so you can...get more points...It's very repetitive in this regard.

The gameplay can be pretty fun though.  Balancing is certainly an issue, there are maybe 60-70 cards in total, so there are obvious favorites among those.

My verdict: Give it a shot, you can get 10-15 good hours of fun out of this free game, but it really hits a brick wall--there simply is nowhere to go unless you really, really enjoy the actual gameplay."
10206,Game is really fun but they will sometimes use bots to dictate wins and losses. Unacceptable.
10207,"My husband and I have been looking for a game that we both enjoy. This is perfect. We kick ass.
"
10208,"I played this for forty hours before I realised what was going on. It's good, if you ignore global chat. Surprisingly solid strategic depth, nice balance of twitch reflexes, timing and placement nuance, and deck building metagaming. Very generous F2P model as well."
10209,It's free and fun.
10210,because it has a variety of different things you can use and play with but it also allowed me to play with my friends.
10211,"Its a well made game that's something fun to do, to pass the time"
10212,Fun game!
10213,"Buen juego, es adictivo, free to play y lo mas importante no pay 2 win"
10214,was looking for another game to play while watching  a movie saw total biscuit review and had his recommendation
10215,"Lol, I really enjoyed this game. Very nice to kill time."
10216,The game is way too broken and buggy to get up to a proper rank.
10217,"First impression is good,  then game asked me to write a review."
10218,The game is not as unbalanced as it used to be so the devs listen to an extent.
10219,quite nice card based battle game. Enjoy it.
10220,Fresh game with nice mechanics.
10221,"Great for quick games, might try it on stream sometime!"
10222,"This game is pretty amazing for free.

You can waste money on microtransactions if you like, but it's not going to help you much. You can unlock all the content by playing. You'll just get it a little faster if you pay. The game eases you into multiplayer by matching you against bots at lower levels, which is nice. At higher levels you play mostly, and then eventually all, humans.

The cards are pretty balanced, with quite a few different deck builds working well. Every build is weak against some other build, and every card can be countered. If you both have decent decks at a higher level of play, either one will just be a good matchup and crush the other, or it will be a tense game coming down to split second decisions and precise positioning.

I highly recommend you try it. It's free, after all."
10223,"Looking great, epic sound and very nice combination cards.
"
10224,"This game is a fun and fast paced lane defender. It is incredibly satisfying to win and even a loss just makes you want to improve. It does get slightly stale though, but other than that 8/10"
10225,Surprisingly fun for what I'd assumed it'd offer.
10226,Really fun and very easy to learn and get into so far.
10227,It's a bloody rippa.
10228,Im winning
10229,used to play a lot of magic the gathering this feels kinda similar so its pretty easy and fun to get into
10230,good
10231,"good
"
10232,Fun New type of game i like it bro for an for an hour maybe a day
10233,güzel
10234,pretty fun game. similar to clash royale
10235,"Relaxing to play, and you are eased into the gameplay very pleasantly. It's a wonderfully charming universe."
10236,everything bad about mobile games comes to steam.
10237,Fun :)
10238,"Minion Masters was added to my steam library on December 2, 2016. I don’t know how or why but I never actually touched it until yesterday night when I saw in my Steam store’s recently updated section. I decided to give it a try and damn, it’s addictingly addictively fun.

Minion Masters is a PVP battle card game that’s both easy to pick up and hard to master and for me at least feels like a more fun version of Hearthstone.

In Minion Masters, you build a deck of 8 cards and select an avatar who is basically a combination of a hero and the ancient in a MOBA. The goal of the game is using your minion army by playing the cards to destroy the enemy minions in order to attack and kill the enemy avatar. There’s a ton of cards and I honestly don’t know much about them at this point, I’ve only used the basic starting cards, but I’ve dueled all night and went from Wood to Silver. The ranks being Wood, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold… etc.

These minion battles only last around 1-5 minutes, but every second of the game is intense as heck as you calculate how to place your minions, where to place them, and how to counter your opponent’s minions on the battlefield, which is basically a mini MOBA map with two lanes. The resource in this game is mana, which is used to play cards, and regenerate slowly but can also be boosted by various minions and stats. The avatars themselves also have three abilities and an auto-attack ability, which levels up with XP gained passively and also from controlling the two bridges in the middle of the map.

I’m still a complete noob, but I’ve hadn’t had this much fun with a MOBA or card game since I started playing League in 2010.

10239,"Very cute game! Started playing 'cause some friends told me I'd like it but I was like ehhh, idk. It's kinda like Hearthstone if Hearthstone were a RTS"
10240,I get to summon little things with my best friend and it's killer <3
10241,(Y)
10242,"This is not just a card game it is much more then that! It's fun, plays quick and it is always interesting to keep playing. Definitely check it out!"
10243,"Lots of fun! Very easy to learn
"
10244,"- Are ya winning son?
- Yes"
10245,"fun so far, kinda like clash with a bit more flavor
"
10246,This game is really fun an addicting. I haven't played it long but it gives me the craving that a longer MOBA would only be able to fulfill without having to kill myself playing things like League or Dota.
10247,Fun Game
10248,Game iz gud
10249,"Surprisingly good game to be honest. Hopefully, they won't overdo it"
10250,Amazing...
10251,"Cool, fun, beginner friendly game!"
10252,It's good so far. I love it.
10253,"A fun relaxing game, great graphic"
10254,well so far its good and for me a better alt for Clash Royale for PC and the gameplay is smooth and fun.
10255,"Game is a blast. I'm usually not a MOBA player, but this close tight arena format just ROCKS! :)

FUN, with a capital F*&^ YEAH! 

"
10256,"Excellent 1v1 game that doesn't take itself too seriously. My teenage daughter loves it, and we trade back and forth, see who the better player is. The games are engaging but short, so it's easy to get a few games in. Haven't played much 2v2 but will soon. Gorgeous graphics, excellent humor, and a great competitive ladder, make this a huge win in a crowded format."
10257,great game!
10258,"Fun game! I've played systems like this before, and this one is smooth, colorful, and reasonably quick to advance. Haven't felt pressured to pay to win yet."
10259,"Its really fun and competitive, and this is my first day havn't been playing it for at least 3 hours and its fun"
10260,A fun game with interesting cards and amusing narration! I would highly recommend this game is you want a PC experience of a game similar to Clash Royale but with greater diversity.
10261,"If you you ever played clash royale is like that type of a game, you spawn minions and wait for the other player to do the same, simple and fun."
10262,Awesome game :)
10263,"Just started playing the FTP version. Loving it so far as it is simple to grasp.

In addition it is fun for others that are watching you play, unlike FPS's."
10264,Interesting little game with some interesting concepts. It's too early for me to know how the late game balance is but as things stand now I'm having fun with this.
10265,"Hello,

I'm 37yrs old, i have computer since my 7yrs (1989) and i've grown up playing all sorts of games, i don't like only a genre (of course i prefer a genre but not closed to one) i like all games and i like to play a lot, nowadays with 2 children, work, wife, house, other hobbies, is impossible to play as i used to play almost at a professional level - life is really fu£ing short...

I just wanted to state a review to this game to all that say this is not a P2W, sorry to disapoint you guys but this is a P2W game, and what you win is by far the most important thing you have in your life, Time... not status, not ranking, not ladder placement, etc... 

People tend to forget that a P2W is not only a game that makes you have better stats, it is also a game that shortcuts you or saves you precious time.

And this is Minion Masters, a very adictive game (nothing new, just as an Old example, you can have a game like this and even more addictive playing Starcraft 2 in Desert Strike Arcade mode), a well balanced game that promise hundreds of hours to get to the top Ladder - spending money or not -

What i would like to say to someone that is thinking on playing the game is that, if you want all ""cards"" ""arenas"" ""masters"", etc, you will have to play a LOT, but really a LOT, if you want to spend some money you have to play +/- the same hours i have played. But keep in mind if you spend money but you don't know how to play, if you don't know the cards, if you don't have experience, you will loose, a lot, and youll not get to the Master tiers...

So Minion Masters is a P2W game, BUT, one of the best P2W where Time is the ""only"" factor you really Win - Paying or not clearly it deserve some of your time. Go for it."
10266,I was enjoying this until I battled with some players who had obviously put money into the game.
10267,Its a super fun game and you should for sure give it a go
10268,Awesome game 10/10
10269,"Hearthstone + RTS = Minion Masters
A bit more casual, a bit more forgiving and just as fun!"
10270,clash royale knock off
10271,perfect combo of lane defense/card game madness to instantly be easy to learn and easier to love
10272,so far game is brilliant awesome creatures and deep strategies!
10273,Fun free game :D Good remake of line wars / tug of war.
10274,"MOBA's have overrun the gaming community. Great replay value, the ability to tell your mom your playing with your friends, even if you're alone, and this one is pretty good. If you have nothing better to do. 3/5. Could be better. Titties. Needs more titties. Where's a good MOBA with titties?"
10275,"It is pretty good to wast time :D but you know the drill. It feel kinda like Clash Royale, but less pay to win. Think when you can not lvl up your cards so they get stronger."
10276,Very Gud game. Get Rekt
10277,"I initially gave this game a great review.

After playing for ~10 hours, I have to change my review.

It should be noted the game encourages you to review it at about 2-3 hours in when it is really fun, so I think that leads to all the overwhelming positive reviews. 

Good:
- Really fun concept, hearthstone meets tower defense in a pvp mode.
- Fun to play with someone in 2v2 or the game is fun solo too 
- Super simple to pick up and understand
- Very in depth strategies

Bad:
- It hits a hard pay to win wall while you rank up. You will get smashed by people with decks that cost them lots of money to get for sure. The amount of rewards you get slows down drastically, it's the mobile game model. Bait you in, get you to review it before the paywall hits, then boom, you aren't doing anything unless you pay. 
- Paying is okay, I approve of supporting developers. What isn't okay is games like this when you pay to build your deck, but 1 patch later the cards you bought suck and you need to get new ones and the only way to do that is to PAY
- Bots! The bots are very real. These aren't cheating bots, but bots to fill in queue times. It is quite easy to spot when you are playing a bot, they insta spawn perfect counters. My theory is they let you play bots after you lose a few to keep you playing. Its definitely a good tactic to keep people playing, let the user win after a loss or two and keep queue times short. It feels slimy though since they tried masquerading the bots as real people."
10278,plenty of rewards and things spinning.. uuuuuhhh
10279,Really nice animations and enjoying it so far.
10280,"I recommend this game but with some caveats.  

Firstly this game feels like it should be a performance breeze the graphics are not insane or anything but for reasons unknown it has serious fps drops, frame stuttering and so on.  For reference I'm in an RTX2080 and a 2700X cpu, it should be absolutely smashing this game but its not.  Yet even with those fps issues its not a huge deal breaker because ultimately its a strategy game that doesn't need serious APM or anything like Starcraft.  

While not P2W in my eyes, this game will encourage you into the microtransaction lifestyle.  It has a few solid purchases sorta of like the Smite God Pack where you get all the masters currently out or that will ever be out for $20 which is nice and I like seeing that as a purchase option but at the same time much like say hearthstone while you technically can ""grind it out"" realistically dropping some dollars on ""packs"" just makes way too much sense you don't need to and its not even ""pay 2 not grind"" since most of the core cards you'll be using you get relatively easily through giveaway codes, just playing and unlocking some stuff and have  a very cheap crafting cost.  

All said though its a decent game.  Its a fun little strategy game/auto battler/whatever the hell genre this is and it does well enough.  It has surprising performance issues but they arn't really a deal breaker."
10281,Pretty cool game.
10282,great way to enjoy the oiod tower defense
10283,Gud Game. Fun
10284,Very easy game to pick up and play. Pretty decent fun!
10285,is a very fun game!
10286,This is a very fast paced and fun tower defense/card collecting style game!
10287,its a very good game with nice graphics
10288,"The game is amazing, could have a little more in depth cards but it is fast past and easy to get into as a starter. Tons of variety everyone should play it!"
10289,Engaging game play and interesting mechanics so far... My son introduced me to this.
10290,"Soooo much fun, like I needed another game to spend money on......
10/10"

10294,nice game
10295,"Have played since beta . Although there are some premium contents , the game features heroes and skills you might not see on these MOBA tower-defense deckbuilder battle."
10296,Only played the game for a about an hr and so far it is pretty fun.  Watched some streams ahead of time so I would know a little more of what to do before starting.  The tutorial seems pretty decent though.
10297,"good dynamics
"
10298,Its a good laid back game def recommend for people to get
10299,not a bad idea this game. But needs lots of optimisation and context upgrades. It will have it in time
10300,"funny game, a way to relax!"
10301,its so amazing and addictive game keep the good work
10302,clash royale but not pay to win

literally just that"
10307,"It's a fun, enjoyable little gem"
10308,"Real fun and engaging. The commentator is pretty fun to listen to. ""Clash Royale, but better"""
10309,"- Easy to pick up and learn
- Can play for 5 minutes or for 5 hours
- Allows for very creative strategies
- Cards feel balanced except for a handful of outliers
- Great visuals and presentation
- Strong ""one more match"" feeling
- Doesn't feel P2W despite the microtransactions
- Very generous and transparent developers"
10310,fun fun fun fun
10311,Bug reporting is bugged. Fucking amazing.
10312,gg
10313,"Not a bad game if you like the game loop, which is effectively play games, early rewards through gold/shards/ingame currencies.etc, buy new heroes/cards.etc. and then move on.

The biggest concern I have is the possible pay-to-win situation here, which I'm never really a fan of. Were it not for that, I'd happily recommend."
10314,im enjoying the game :)
10315,nice game
10316,"Interesting turn based card playing melee game, not a TD game, but fun."
10317,mantep slurrr
10318,straight forward and a great game to pass the time
10319,kinda fun

10321,Yes
10322,Fast paced and fun!
10323,Nice
10324,"This game is so fun!
"
10325,It's a fun game overall.
10326,"Thus far the game is super fun and i like it a lot, you level up pretty fast and it seems to actually be super rewarding. Would recomend to anyone who like games like Hearthstone."
10327,"Dont judge it by the looks, its way more fun then it looks give it a try."
10328,AUTO CHESS BUT BETTER
10329,"Keeps you wake at night ,"

10333,Great fun for a free game. Goofy graphics and easy to pick up game play.
10334,"This game was way more fun then I expected ! 
Looking forward to play it more!"
10335,Remove Queen's Dragon --> Nyrvir the Fallen <-- and the game will be good
10336,GOOD GAMR SO FAR
10337,Very nice.
10338,"This is fresh game if you are tired at Stone or Royal .
Characters is not so much adorable but other things are sophsticating and funny.
I assure it.
"
10339,the game it nice ...i play a lot ...
10340,"It is fast and fun just what i needed, but i only started so i dont know how it will go later but for sure nice game to pass some time"
10341,"Pros:
- Tons of free stuff.
- Fun base game.
- Humor!

Cons:
- Not as complex and deep as CCGs for example.
- Strong incentive to spend real money if you want to become competitive and creative.
- Unresolved game-breaking game freezes since January many players complain about.


Would only recommend if you only plan to play very casually and don't care much about getting an edge."
10342, nice
10343,"I think this is a very simple awesome game.  Try it and see
"
10344,Game is really fun with friends
10345,Ez win streaks.
10346,It's Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!! Fun game to chill out with.
10347,is fun
10348,cool
10349,"Great game, easy to play"
10350,Its really fun and better than most other games like this
10351,great game
10352,EInfaches aber cooles Prinzip. Lohnt sich zum reinschauen!
10353,"Fun and actual free to play game, would recommend"
10354,FUN
10355,good game
10356,"     I started to play this game 1.5 years ago and back then it was a great game. Not because it was balanced, no, but because it was TRUE Free to Play. No joke. I enjoyed it a lot. Many times i was top 20 Legends in Ranked. Lots of fun. So what has happened? Many things. 

1. Since first expansion they made new cards cost 3 times more expensive until next expansion hits, it is like 80 days period. But when new expansion comes, cards from previos expansion become useless/nerfed/less impactful. So you want to play and win? Not a problem! Just grind it 15 hours a day or... ta-da!!! pay a lot of $$.

2. As if it was not enough they removed disenchant option from a game. Forever. So those 10 useless legendaries i was just about to dust will stay with me forever.

3. By the way, power level of legendaries become stronger with every expansion. And a single copy of each legendary card is 6000 dust! It was 2000 dust in good old times.

So i told u things you need to know first. Now it is your choice to play or not to play.     
"
10357,ITS JUST AN ALL AROUND STRATEGIC/FUN GAME
10358,Auto chess with no waiting and less RNG.
10359,it's good
10360,Minimally P2W. Fun time with a bud ;)
10361,"I enjoy it so far, You guys are doing great. =]
"
10362,"If you like Clash Royale, initially you will really enjoy this game. However, until someone drops 'Nyvir The Fallen', the game becomes far too unbalanced and not fun at all. NO amount of magma cannons will save you. I don't care what people think. It's just too OP for someone who is barely starting the game. Sorry."
10363,"Great visuals and easy to learn, but definitely gonna be difficult to master."
10364,not bad
10365,funny
10366,fun to play with friends
10367,"Great game, feels like a sideways version of Clash of Clans!"
10368,another pay to win. i'm out
10369,Nice tactics game :like: keep us guys
10370,"I Just played a few games but I can see how good the game it is, highily recommended!"
10371,good
10372,"Reminds me of Castle Fight from WC3 custom games... was the best ever, 4v4"
10373,its realy fun to play!
10374,easy to pick up hard to put down!
10375,pretty damn fun
10376,"It's difficult to try and review this unique and tragically (at this point) underheard game. This is the best tower defense game I have ever played. By far. I''ve always appreciated the genre, but this game has made me see the potential of just how engaging tower defense can be.

The cards/minions are great. Some cards are most assuredly better than others, but it's flexible in regards to how much time the user wants to spend. Particularly with the help of redemption codes, which can be found through a quick Google search. And that's all that it rally takes to move up in the game. TIME. Which still irks some people apparently (seriously, a major complaint people have towards this game is the amount of time it can ""demand"" from you. That's because it's an amazing game, which could arguably be defined as addicting. But there's NO PAYWALL. I can't tell you how much I respect BetaDwarf  for going this route, So much so, that I dropped 10 bucks their way because I want to support them..I love my deck, and I didn't have to spend any money at all to get the cards I wanted. Mainly,l spending money will significantly boost how quickly one receives  rewards. Such as skins and emojis, etc.

All the cards (and masters for that matter) have very distinctive qualities and tactics, so there's almost a chess like atmosphere burrowed in the real-time chaos which inevitably ensues. And said chaos is the primary thing you will experience as you try to keep an avid eye on all that is happening 

The game is overall kind of a cross between Plants VS Zombies (except not in a grid system), and Magic! The Gathering.
I'm frankly surprised there isn't more recognition for this one. And luckily for me, it's available on mac. 

The community is overall damn solid (every gaming community has trolls, and spammers. One does have the ability to mute annoying Master's. Also, the median age seems to be around 30 or so, maybe mildly younger. But I was surprised at the depths of conversation at times. Much higher quality per capita than most games.

Overall, I can't express how excited I am to have discovered this, and it's even hard not to think about when you aren't playing. It's free, so there really is no reason not to give it a whirl. 9.5/10 and improving (which they update quite frequently)."
10377,Really like this game.
10378,"easy to play, relaxed"
10379,"I like the tongue-in-cheek Shrek style to the game quite a bit.

Its quick for a round, incorporates strategy well, with a card-like / unit style, and is pretty. The variety needed is there and will only grow I'm sure. Its another moba-like styled game that you can get into quickly but takes practice to get better with.

You can play it for free and see a lot of it. Invest time to unlock things or pay cash outright if you don't want to sink the time into it. There seems to be a good balance there too."
10380,its fun
10381,It has the GEP gun
10382,Easy and fun none toxic game!
10383,Love the game so far. Looks nice and the game is fast paced and easy to learn. 3-5 minute matches is great!
10384,"not as much pay to win. but the legendary cards are abserdly strong.

overall its just a very boring game to play."
10385,"Apparently, this game forces you to play until level 7 to give you the quit button, which is monumentally stupid decision on the part of developers. Yeah, that will make me think, ""oh my, what a fresh approach!!! Forcing me to play to be able to quit the game, such a genius move!"" FU with your stupid game. Uninstall immediately."
10386,"Honestly, i didn't think i was going to like this game. Then i just gave it a shot and it is really fun. I never was really into the deck card genre but this game is awesome 10 out of 10 for me. Well balanced and fun as hell man ... Try it so we can keep player base up .. You wont regret giving it a try. Trust me"
10387,It is so easy to learn!! Pretty fun too!!
10388,yiiiiiiii
10389,"Draft mode is bullshit, they let us play with their bots and their staff :))"
10390,"Very fun game, the developers fix imbalance issues and add new content all the time, and there is a small but active community of Twitchers that really help you learn how to play as you rise up the ranks. Initial play is fu, advanced play gets challenging and trying the different game modes keeps things interesting. Following players who are high in the ranks is interesting, as there are so many different strategies to winning.

I have had tons of hours of fun in this game, and I highly encourage you to pay for some of the add-ons so the developers can continue to update and expand the game."
10391,Its... GggggggggggggggggReat!
10392,great satisfying game play love it ;D
10393,So far not a bad game.  I like the battles the way there set up.
10394,"Super easy to play and visually very pleasing. Click then watch the counter fill and then repeat.
"
10395,"Good time waster. If you are waiting on something with a friend, just queue up and defeat the enemy since it is the easiest thing to do.

10396,"I have only just started playing the game and it is awesome and free to play. fast paced, lots of tactics and superb card design and abilities. I'm a huge fan :)"
10397,Relaxing game. Like a cross between Hearthstone and Dota. Beautiful graphics and fun game mechanic. Lots of ladders and achievements to unlock. Customize your deck by swapping out cards or boosting your current cards. Expect many hours to go by with this one. Great game!
10398,Becuse youre Awesome !
10399,Excellent graphics nice combat action really easy to learn how to play even as a new starter keeps you addicted into the battle scenes as a free game one of the better card game combats that ive come accross a nice thumbs up from me
10400,nice game
10401,good one!
10402,Good game with fair game play
10403,"not a new concept, purchases are tempting, but not needed as of lvl 10. easy to pick up and intuitive. fun fun"
10404,"I love this game, it's super simple and still really really good. I just wish the DLC wasn't spread out so much and the cost of the content wasn't so expensive."
10405,very fun
10406,great game for stragity and co-op  5 stars the way
10407,Good
10408,Good.
10409,i loved this game for years but i feel scammed and i hope im wrong...i seen on steamcharts the game have +/- 1k players but on every rank i play the battles start instantly (high ranks too) at all hours...the question is...these are all bots or real people?( i tried minion master remastered too and i seen how bots fights and looks identical how the people fight in normal game version...indeed sometimes if you see there are a lot of people with strange names with only numbers or ????????...i hope to know an answer and the truth and after i will turn again this comment in positive...
10410,Is a relaxing casual game with a fun strategy element that doesn't take too long to play. Quite enjoyable.
10411,its just so much fun
10412,great fun
10413,"i enjoy double spamming harbingers on low rank people....that is all
"
10414,"nice
"
10415,"Thus far the experience has been quite fullfilling. The battles are fast paced and the thought placed into every move seems to hinge on speed and dexterity of your cards. Kinda like a real life Yu-Gi-Oh with less thought to the moves and more so on placement of each creature, turrent, and skill spell."
10416,One of the best f2p games i've ever played reminds me of a more refined and enjoyable clash royal but it has things that make it different i personally didn't enjoy clash royal but i love this
10417,clash royale but pc version
10418,"Idk, 2 hours in and its dope

10419,good game
10420,Why this game is not allow to steam on linux system?
10421,awesome!!!
10422,enterteining
10423,Just started but this seems like a very chill game. Matchmaking is okay so far.
10424,"Seems great so far, seems to have pretty good balance and is relaxing to play."
10425,This game rocks!
10426,"For a free game you get a lot of content.
Plus, the game has a good level of strategy mixed with RNG. And the matches are mostly short so you can play many games in a short period of time."
10427,"really good game, hope for more"
10428,Just a fun relaxing game
10429,"every new update is just another nail in the coffin of this most stinking pile of sh♠t ever created

10439,Finaly something in this Playstyle that has short and addicting rounds with a tactical component
10440,its funs
10441,"Seemed really fun to play both alone and with a friend. 


There seems to be a balanced meta overall with a few strategies being a little op (certain heroes can spam powerful minions as their ability and those are overtuned). 

There's like some decision making and it needs to be done fast so that's fun and fun in a way that there isn't time to mastermind the whole thing like in some slower summoning games like card games.

Basically I hope this game does well. :)"
10442,one of few games i can actually play with a graphics/pen tablet
10443,So far so good. Friendly to new players i guess
10444,Fun game so far.

10449,"I don’t do many reviews on steam which is a petty because I love gaming and I should help people that likes n don’t like, things I do in the games to help with decision if there on the fence. But on that being said iv really took a shining to this game and I love it and support it all the time by buying skins and giving the devs some money to help (This is a free game) no money is needed at all. No pay to win guys! I’m just talking about for character skins and stuff like that. This game has about the right amount of everything guys, match times, added content, graphics, fun, challenging, but most of all soul!! Every time I play this game it feel brilliant and exciting trying to be the best. Thank yous so much devs and please don’t change to much as I love it and the work yous put into it!!"
10450,great game its like a better thought out version of clash of clans even though there is a bit of pay to win
10451,its a fun game to play with a friend
10452,Refreshing and enjoyable...
10453,"Today I got my 1000th WIN!
Its NOT pay to win!
Very well balanced.

Played it with my bro. We had the best time!
Now he has a gf.
Game makes fun, even without him.
So.... 11/10"
10454,pretty good so far
10455,"Minion Master has talent to be on recommending's section on Steam. It has to pulish some features, but besides that, the gameplay is fast and quite fun!"
10456,"Short fast paced gameplay, feels like the auto-battlers that are popular now. Would like to see a mobile version"
10457,Fun gun easy concept
10458,Pretty good few crashes but for free game cant complain micro transaction ant bad reward you for being good is well done too
10459,"Unbalanced, garbage game. I didn't enjoy it what-so-ever. That's saying a lot for a game. Games are supposed to be enjoyable. Just go play Nexus Wars on StarCraft II arcade and get a MUCH better version of the exact same idea.


Update: Played more after patches. THIS GAME SUFFERS FROM MASSIVE MEMORY LEAKS AS YOU PLAY CAUSING BAD LAG! YOU HAVE TO RESTART THEIR CLIENT TO GET SMOOTH PLAY FOR 3-5 MATCHES AND THEN IT LAGS AGAIN!!!


THEY HAVEN'T FIXED THIS IN YEARS!!!!"
10460,"Great game, loving it so far :D"
10461,Good Game so far.
10462,game play is easy and fun.
10463,"I usually dont review things at all, but so far i love this game.Sure i just started, but i haven't enjoyed games like this in this genre of cards... But i enjoy this a lot"
10464,"Outstanding game. Fast paced, well though tactical gameplay!"
10465,Very nais gaem mai frends
10466,"My review in a nutshell.  It's addictive.  Difficult to turn off. Easy to learn. Game play is quick and loads of fun. Gives you lots to do. Has a good mix of long term and short term goals. Achievements are easily attainable.  Doing well doesn't require money.  In comparison to other games like it, you can feel the developers respect for the players.  Finally what I would do, as a game developer, to add to this game.

After roughly 12 hours playing this game, I can safely say that this game is addictive enough that it will find a way to pull you back in.  They do this by rewarding you for everything. This is done with login, daily quest, each win and prize matches.  They give you gold for each of these awards, which leads you to buying either Free tokens, Power tokens or Seasonal tokens.  These tokens lead the player to be entered into a spinning game that results in them getting a chance to win a common, rare, supreme or legendary card.  Each token results into only one card per token used and the card is predetermined.  Any attempt to select the card you want will instantly skip the spin process and go straight to the card the game chose you to have for the spent token.

Be prepared for fast games and lots of awards that help create a gaming atmosphere is that tough to turn off.  The shortest match I played was just over a minute and the longest was seven and a half minutes long.  Most great games out there that have battle arena or strategy-based mechanics usually end quickly at seven minutes.  So a match ending after 2-3 minutes average easily coaxes players into playing massive amounts of matches over the same spans that other games would allow the player to only play one or two matches.

The tutorial give players a very quick and easy way into learning the game.  They provide you with a base deck comprised of a few powerful spells and decent minions and they teach you everything you need to know about minion placement, spell use, bridge occupation and the very intricate paper-rock-scissors element each minion brings to the game.  The whole tutorial can be blasted through within ten minutes.  All tutorial bosses are very easy to beat and they reward you massively every step of the way.  The rest of your training gets taken up by the daily quests, and oh baby do they give you a lot of them to do.  They get you to join guilds, add emotes, change masters and use every play mode available.  By the end of all of these quests and tutorials, I had such a solid grasp of the game, I didn't lose a game until I was in gold ranks on solo.

If you have Amazon Prime, ranking up becomes easier because they just gave out a huge promotion that ended up giving me a legendary minion called ""Colossus"" and he just wrecks everything on the ground.  He was so much fun to use, especially early on when nobody knows how to counter him properly, that the second you summon him you almost always win.

They also have a 3 house tournament going on for players with long term goals with the game.  They give out a legendary card to those who win ""Price Fights"".  These are randomly chosen matches that result in the winner earning a key that unlocks one of fifteen locks.  It's possible to do this, but it takes a lot of matches to unlock.  Still if you enjoy playing this game, then this juice may be worth the squeeze for you.

One thing I also really liked about this game is how easy it is to get all of the achievements and that the game 'hides' them enough so you don't exactly know how to get them all.

I also really liked how you don't need money to kick butt at this game.  It helps you get all the cards, but all the best cards don't equal wins.  In fact you have to blend your common cards with your legendary cards in order to get a fully fleshed out strategy going for you.  I was watching a streamer playing earlier this week, he was highly ranked and using pretty much the same cards I was using.  When I saw that I thought, man...this game does not have a huge buy in at all.  You just have to have a very solid idea of what you want your units to do when the battle begins.  That's really cool and most games don't take advantage of that kind of mechanic when it comes to respecting the wallets of your player base.

Finally if I could change something, as a maker of games myself, there are few things that stood out to me.  The cosmetic micro-transactions seem very steep and I don't feel give the players a very good-value-for-dollar when it comes down to basic customization of your side of the arena and your character.  Some of the skins cost about 5 dollars per change and all you get is a re-coloured look of the Master's base armour set.  When I noticed that, it kind of lost me on why on earth would I stop playing for free if that's all you get for paying money.  Perhaps giving the characters a completely different look would help in this regard because there wasn't a single time that I looked over at my opponent's master and thought to myself, ""Oh that's cool! I wish I had that.""

Finally the first menu board when you enter the game shouldn't show so many promotions.  I find at times, yes it's good to advertise promotions, however, if you have 6-8 promotions going on all at once it gives the player the feeling that he's entering the game through the gift shop.  

Other than that, I don't feel the game pressures the player to make purchases and the game gives the feeling that money isn't required to enjoy the game.  All-in-all I have had a very difficult time uninstalling this game because I enjoyed it so much.  I will very much return to playing this game again, just to see what else has changed.

Hope you enjoyed my review.

70% PAY TO WIN

10% SKILL, STRATEGY

20% brain 
80% Pay to Win

Legendary cards are abusive pay and ultra unbalance, nothing you can do against it. For example: HIPNOSIS, THE CLOUD, STUNS, and many more but I don't know the name in english.

I hit master 3 and can't go any furter for the ""spin to win"" experience.

The game could be better, just remove legendary and supreme cards and add more skins for the masters and the minions.
Get money from the skins not from the stupid pay to win method.

If you don't care the P2W experience, is a good game. Just prepare for leave at least 15 bucks in a game of minions."
10504,Fun
10505,Best Card Game I was interested in Playing and really enjoy it overall with it being easy to learn and play.
10506,TEAM? XD
10507,"Quick to pick up, simple to play. turn brain off watch a show on another monitor and chill"
10508,"Quick rounds, easy to pick up and play and set back down without having to get too far into it. Relaxing experience (so far)."

10510,"Nice casual action, which combines mechanics of a trading card game with a 2D board game tactics."
10511,Like
10512,fun to play
10513,A lot more fun than you would think. Tactics and combination plays thrive really well here. I personally like the team battle feature.
10514,pretty simple easy to get a hang of. Really fun with friends
10515,Just play it.
10516,good and fun to play with friends
10517,Pretty good. Real time card game without turn-by-turn. You can do 2v2s with a friend. Neat idea. Has some performance problems tho.4/5
10518,"EDIT: (since steam asks me if I want to edit my review after I played for so many hours.Sure I will edit it) Now the Bot AI that the game gives you for a team-mate has Guild too, so it looks like a real player. But it plays so horrible that its like you are playing 1vs3. As I say below when the game wants you to lose it cheats in matchmaking + finds you Bots for team-mates.
------------------
In my old review (Positive) bellow, I was saying that Minion Masters is the only ""card game"" I played that doesnt cheat the player (mostly because there is no actual RNG).

After playing alot I have to change my review to negative because it actually cheats and alot. In Matchmaking! When the game wants you to lose it will find opponets that have the perfect ""anti-decks"" for your deck and for a teammate it will find the worst posible combination that it can find. 
(when the game wants you to lose) and you have a deck with many small minions it will find enemies with a lot AoE. The moment you change to a different deck and you have big minions, immediately on the first match it will match you with opponents that have Harbinger etc. 
So, rigged matchmaking means that Minion Masters cheats too, like the rest of the card games. And since it happens every single day (very easy to tell when the matchmaking has changed against you) I have to change my review to negative.

(all this happens vs real players. If it happened only vs bots(AI) I wouldnt mind at all)

===================Old review (Positive)
Im not sure if its a good reason or no but every card game I have ever tried has rigged RNG. Every single one. Im not sure if even Minion Masters is 100% fair (first hand/some 50%-50% cards etc). 

BUT FOR SURE ITS THE MOST FAIR GAME IN THE MARKET. (less rigged than others....maybe even not rigged at all)

ps: for people that dont believe that the rest of the card games are rigged, consider this, I played so many hours Minion Masters and still Im not sure if it has some fake RNG, thats how thorough I test games before I say its rigged or not. Of course I could tell Heartstone was rigged from the first day, you just need a working brain to figure out that , I didnt have to do any testing for that."
10519,so far so good
10520,very coolio
10521,Great casual game to play with friends.

10530,Simple and Fun
10531,Big fan of clash royale and this is refreshing take on the genre.
10532,Overly grindy with pay to win aspects
10533,"+ It was fun for a few days, but...

- Becomes boring once you climb up to Master rank. Meta for premade teams currently revolves around heals and spirit with no real counter than to mirror it. If you wanna mirror it and play the same boring game each time, welp either grind or pay up.

- Graphics are mediocre and the game is severely in need of optimization. For what I am seeing on screen I would expect to get 100+ constantly, instead I see dips bellow 60.
"
10534,love the game its a well refined card battler for the pc dev responsive gave away a free dlc
10535,It had physics. That's a + from me.
10536,It's an amazing strategy game. Love it!
10537,"It's pretty great. I'm not a big fan of the random loot box mechanics, but the gameplay itself is very fun and addictive; big points for occasionally offering $15 content packs for free. Recommend!"
10538,"Great Fun.
Loads of Freebies to get new players started, just look in the right places for the codes.
Quick Games for people like me who have lots of little bits of time to enjoy a game rather than hour long sessions.
Easy to play, hard to master.

Go for it, try it, you'll love it."
10539,"right from the beginning you aren't limited to what strategies and units you can use and craft allowing a lot of freedom from when your starting so as you play you can evolve your strategy and play style. The games aren't too fast to the point where it is chaotic but isn't like other games of this genre where you have to un-actively wait for your mana store up so you can release a unit who then gets killed almost instantly, the rather rapid mana build-up allows you too not only start your attack but not be left helpless if the enemies hits you with a surprise strategy. I found this game bored and wasn't expecting too much and i've still only experienced only a few hours of this game at this point but it hasn't got repetitive or boring as everyone seems too use different masters and minions every game I have played so far. There are a few minor bugs such as when you click cancel on matchmaking it continues to find a game and the click can sometimes be irresponsive. But all around the only wishes i hope to see is that this game evolves graphically as currently they are lacking but fortunately this does not take away from the fun and experience of this game and to see they further expand this unique take on the Unit Based PvP mode with new minions, spells, masters and such. 

Overall, i rlly enjoy the game and i would advice to give a go and try out some of your own strategies as the large but not overwhelming roster of minions makes for a unique experience each game you play."
10540,"Alright motherfuckers, your game is easy to learn and addictive, you've adopted the model of free to play and it doesn't appear to be pay to win so far So I can get into the game and get good before deciding to spend money. Just like league of legends I can choose to spend on aesthetic options instead of powerful shit, always a good idea for an online game.

The strategy is comprehensive and games don't go on too long.

Where to improve: I'd like to be able to chat to my allies and enemies in game (obviously with a mute option as well).

Altogether, I'll give it a first impression 7/10 (which is very high) but only because I haven't played long enough to see why your game is shit."
10541,"This game is awesome. Fast paced, strategic, and super fun."
10542,"50/50 good and bad. its okay for a free game. Too many nerf's after buying things. Although you don't have to purchase things. OP spells is killing the game imo. Its playable if you don't take it too serious.

Reinstalled and then Uninstalled. If you like playing and talking to a toxic community by all means go for it. i have better things to do with my time. Later Minion Masters!"
10543,Fun quick game to play that is surprisingly deep.
10544,One the best card game available. Also the devs are generous with the F2P model.
10545,"Simple, easy to pick up, with lots of depth. Good shit lads, give it a spin"
10546,Plays like clash royale but has much more depth with card synergies keywords and summoners
10547,my brother mentioned this game to me and it feels natural and easy to play but still allows me to think on a deep level how to counter the enemy.
10548,"About two years ago I fell in love with an obscure Star Wars phone game called Force Arena. It was a card based game where you could PVP other players. RNG played a role but you had to use some strategy to win as well. I thought that phone game had so much potential it could have became a great PC game. It never made it to PC.

This game is the closest thing to that experience that I've found on PC. I already have four hours in the game so for me it's worth telling people to check it out. It's free to play and you should get several hours of free entertainment out of the game. We'll see how the game progresses, but I enjoy the overall style of the game and the progression."
10549,Minion Masters is a great way to escape the mundane tasks of life!
10550,"Minion Masters is fun at first, but once you hit around silver 1 during battles it becomes pay to win. If you do not eventually want to sink money into buying chests/tokens/shards for better cards DO NOT download this game."
10551,pay to win. its fun but only in a private match with friends.
10552,fun and fast paced
10553,"fast paced, excellent graphics, novel story line"
10554,"Dear plebs, 

   I have currently got 5.1 hours in the game so far and may I just say it is pretty darn good! I currently have possession of three games. All of which are free because of a couple reasons, but I'd rather not talk about that right now. Let's save that for another writing, shall we? That said - this game is better than both of them, including CSGO! I got introduced to it by a man on Discord. When I first installed it, I did not believe that it would be good and it would be very similar to clash royale (which i never played). Boy was I wrong. Just get in the game, partake in a 5 - 9 minute battle (if you're soloing) and boom! That's it! Of course the game is a little more complex than that, but you'll learn as you'll play! TRUST ME, this game will help you bust all kinds of nuts!

   From, Professional Stone Player Behemoth"
10555,Cool game bro
10556,"Muy buen juego, adictivo, entretenido; ademas que muy fácil comprender las mecánicas de juego."

10561,"awesome
"
10562,Nice game to just relax.
10563,"Much like Clash of Kings, but I like the aesthetic much much more!"
10564,"If you're interested in a low stress, easily-accessible game that's fun with some cutesy graphics and isn't filled with team mates telling you how bad you are at the game, this might be the game for you."
10565,"Super good game. Has tons of depths and great graphics, highly recommend."
10566,"Ridiculously addictive and fun.  Some of my best decks are with free cards.  Nothing is perfect, but the balance is pretty damn good in this game.  As soon as I realized I didn't have to pay money to be competitive, I felt better about spending a little on some fun extras.   Great game, great fun, very easy to learn.  Matchmaking is spot on too.  

Combining card combat with where you play it in a realtime battlefield is totally brilliant and real blast to play.   10 people could have the same deck and all play it a little different depending on where and when they play cards.   I love this game and highly recommend it!!

9/10   only taking off 1 because if your teammate quits mid-match, you actually lose points as if you lost the match.  It is infrequent, but really irritating that no one thought to fix it.    Everything else is amazing."
10567,она заебись. мне нравится
10568,"Très bon jeux compétitif a la clash royal. L'équilibrage est bien réalisé et on se retrouve souvent face a des adversaires a notre niveau. Large choix de cartes et les devs continuent d'agrémenter leur jeux toujours avec plus de contenus que ce sois des cartes, unités ou de nouveau systèmes. Il est également possible de jouer au jeux avec un amis ce qui rend l'expérience complètement différente car il faut entièrement repenser sa stratégie et les combats deviennent bien plus dynamique. Vraiment un très bon jeux que je recommande à tout les amateurs du genre !"
10569,real fun to play
10570,A game that gives you just enough to make it feel like you have a chance. There is clear manipulation of what cards you draw. Not worth it unless you like ingame purchases.
10571,"it clash royal but like 10 times better
"
10572,shits lit
10573,i like this game a lot. but it needs more content.
10574,ez
10575,"This game has to be the BEST free game ever! So good I even bought the starter pack to support the game. I've played for endless hours and not once got bored. Always new things to learn about the game. Get it and play it, that simple!"
10576,"Good game,
To many broken and unblanced Masters/Minions. 
If you dont have RNG, and cant get these, you will not win(at least get higher rank). And seeing they give you the IDEA that you may get a good card, they dont tell you the chance you have in getting that card.

The game seems to want to bleed you dry of money, even if you buy the exp packs, you dont get all the cards, you get some. and them telling you you get 40 of them, doesnt mean anything. as you can only use 1 type of that minion, (unless you use a wildcard).

The content of this game should be free, for what it offers. the expansions are basically free, as you can still get the cards ingame. They clearly dont have enough confidence in their game to sell you Skins like other games. and if they want to sell you cards, they need to sell you ALL the cards. and stop making this game a gamble slot machine. which in honestly they should be sued for.

The game is good. it is fun. it can be worth your time. but they clearly dont know how to balance, and they want OP cards so you will spend money gambling.

im not going to play this game much more. maybe ill look at it again when they are no longer greed happy."
10577,Awesome Game
10578,This has been one of the most fun unique games ive played in awhile
10579,"Very entertaining and like the game style.
nice going."
10580,its fun
10581,"Just wanted to say that there are a lack of game modes which is fine for a beginner although I wanted more, it's not pay to win until about bronze two where the person playing had an extremely good card that cost 4 mana to use (low) did a ton of damage to me and was very hard to kill for another level 4 card. A level 4 vs 4 card is about even unless one is flying and one is ground which in this case they were both ground. Then after the match I took a look at one of their cards that they used and it was level 2 card  that gave allies +50% DAMAGE, can you believe that? imagine your strength on that first card that I mentioned being level 4 but feeling as strong as a level 5 card then you give that very same card +50% damage? and you got yourself an easy win. Not to mention that they had another pay to win card that cost 3 mana to use and had 2 ABILITES the 1st one was ""Walks along peacefully until killed, then Summons a random 4 mana minion card!"" the 2nd was ""All nearby enemies will target this unit"" so basically you get a level 4 card for the cost of 3 and not to mention everything near that card summoned minion will attack it making it a very good diversion/strength to have on your team. The game is pay to win. Thank you and I spent 5$ on it today and i won my first 15 matches until this happened. And before finishing this review I went back to finish looking at all their cards and LOL GUESS WHAT THEY'RE ALL PAY TO WIN. Another ""Summons a level 5 card for the cost of 4"" and ""If the card you last summoned was level 5 THIS CARD will automatically summon you ANOTHER level 5 card but will also summon you a level 7 card regardless of  the last that you summoned."" And last but not least another card that ""slows/damages enemies for 20 damage per second and can only be destroyed by area attacks"" So if you don't have an area counter card to counter this you will have to suffer the consequences."
10582,"Great game, well designed, fast paced."
10583,I'm not too into competitive multiplayer games but Minion Masters combines collectible card games and tactics in a way that I find very entertaining. The game is F2P with reasonable in store purchases that do not translate to having a noticeable edge over those who do not pay. Definitely recommend.
10584,Easy to understand the game mechanic. A lot Gacha
10585,"First, something good. I love how responsive the devs are to resolving any issues you may have. You don't see that in many games, but it's not enough to save it. Where do I begin! Well, for starters, If you're not in a premade, you most likely will lose half your team games since you'll most likely not have synergy with a random teammate's strategy or deck, especially ones that make the dumbest moves possible that will cost you both the game OFTEN, especially against premades. Oh, and because of said premades, don't bother trying to make it to the highest tiers in team queue because this game heavily favors these premades who can build decks around each other, collaborate on strategies and pubstomp to their hearts desires. Let's not forget about the constant DC's that are recorded as losses for YOU, and it seems to always happen when the enemy team is losing. Last but not least, they also release masters in almost the most broken state possible to build up hype so people will rush to buy them right before they nerf them a month or two later, so unless you buy them and join the meta, expect to be at a huge disadvantage for at least a month, Oh, and don't even think about beating a premade that both pick the broken master AND double stack an OP deck to further make the game unwinnable no matter what you do or how well your deck is built. I love this game for the good times, but it needs a TON of work. I can't recommend it in this state and it makes me extremely sad."
10586,Really nice game. If you want to have a good time and with low effort take it :)
10587,Awesome game. Started it a while ago and it gets better and better with updates :)
10588,"Easy game to learn, fun to play in your spare time."
10589,Surprisingly Enjoyable.
10590,"Surprisingly fun game! Didn't really understand the concept when I dl'd, but enjoying the ride so far."
10591,"Great game so far, I'm enjoying the early level stuff.  I'm sure once I start playing more skilled opponents I won't have an easy time of it.  I can't say a lot more till I've spent more time in the game, so for now I'd easily recommend it for anyone who likes to take on other gamers."
10592,Interesting and fast paced!
10593,"Anouther scam to get you to part with cash.
Guys dont buy into this business model.
This is not gaming or fun.

"
10594,just a great and fun game not money hunger like most games like it
10595,"Very bad business practices by this game, their employees threatened people with their rules, which they claimed you had to log onto their discord to see the rules, as they are not posted in the actual game anywhere. When asked what the punishment would be, the employee banned us saying we threatened them. REALLY? Chat banned for simply asking what the punishment would be? So now I have to take time off work and go to my local bank and chargeback my debit card just to get the money back I've spent on this game. One of the top worst game companies that ever came about."
10596,Kinda fun
10597,"fun to play while eating
"
10598,ok
10599,"Honestly, i thought it was gonna be one of those boring minions battling games. BUT ITS FUN! i actually am having fun. The card building reminds me of Hearthstone, and the fighting reminds of me league of legends xD. Would suggest at least trying."
10600,Die game djas leka bratte
10601,YES
10602,fun easy to learn game. it is good for casual gaming and for those that want a hardcore game.
10603,Pretty good so far
10604,"All-in-all. Great game! Could use a tweak here and there, but clearly its not just a money grab! GG bois"
10605,Didn't like it
10606,"Nice and easy-to-start game. Even can pay to get new cards, for beginner is not a problem to try default interesting card."
10607,"this game is so interesting that i can stop to play it!
"
10608,"Reminds me of Torchlight with the render style, the premise is easy enough to pick up and play real fast and to kill a few minutes while playing  a couple of matches here and there."
10609,pretty fun way to waste time
10610,"Awful game; don't be tricked into wasting your money.  Solo is pay to win, you will fight decks that just have better cards than yours.  Team is a joke, they will match 2 random players against players who have teamed together and made decks that complement each other leaving you no viable option to win.  Soon to be a dead game, with matchmaking like this don't waste your money, no wonder they are giving away expansion packs for free on Twitch!!

PLEASE READ REVISED:  After putting more hours into the game this is probably the most balanced multiplayer card game I've ever played.  The cards have a rock, paper, scissor effect and its more important when and how you place the card.  A huge number of the most effective cards are commons and the game is very generous in giving new cards for free-to-play.  They do sometimes have paired teams playing random teams but with more experience at the game these match-ups are exceedingly rare and generally only when playing odd hours.  I highly recommend the game and it is definitely possible to play at the highest levels without ever having to spend any money (although it would be nice to support the game so it hangs around!)  The development team is very responsive to the players and has a very personal feel like they are really invested in the game which is all too rare these days.  Please give it a try, you won't be sorry!"
10611,gostei
10612,The game is smooth in its transition from tutorial matches to player vs. player. It was easy to understand the flow of battle but not boring. This is a very nice little game and I hope to have many hours spent playing it in the future.
10613,gosto!
10614,"This game is NOT garbage!

Minion Masters is one of those games that surprise the hell out of you, only to then disappoint the living fuck out of you.

I have created the worlds BEST strategy. It currently has an 85% win-rate in duo queue. 

Basically, spawn a large minion, and then stack your deck with 6 healing cards. After the large minion is in play, you keep him alive for all of eternity and watch while your enemies cry. ""Well that sounds like a stupid strategy..."" Well you keep telling yourself that you 50% win-rate noobs. Meanwhile I am going to keep burying you with my trash strategy in this NOT garbage game.

I have tried many trolling techniques and this one is by far the best. Trust me...

With all that being said, let me tell you why you are going to love to hate this game. By hating this game, you will save yourself lots of money and countless hours of grinding for cards. By hating this game, you will avoid the disappointment of spending hard-earned cash, and not getting the cards you need to complete your strategy of epic proportion. By hating this game, you will avoid countless other encounters with rich assholes who came here to take you to the dry-cleaners and impregnate your brain with the cold hard truth, which is that you a broke bitch who can't even afford your bills, so why are you playing and spending money on this game?

However, if you look past the fact that your wallet is being used as a direct connection to your victory chances, you will love this game. You will spend so much money that you will get an 85% win-rate like me, and then you will continue to spend money for bragging rights, and then after 30 days your wife will see your bank statement and wonder what the hell is wrong with you and threaten to leave you. Then you will quit this game to prove that the game never mattered, because it IS trash, and bills and family are more important.

At that point, you win the game.

This game is awesome"
10615,"Reminds me so much of ""Brawl Stars"" for mobile phones. Best game ever, r.i.p. <3"
10616,"awesome game, good job devs"
10617,this game is just easy and enjoyable for me atleast! reminds me alot of elders scorll legends for some reason
10618,Grrrreat game!
10619,"I put this in the category of Rocket League, I can pick up and play any time for any amount of time and feel productive. Really enjoy it."
10620,Pay to win cards like the 10 point Dragon. No way to win against it and you have to spend a fortune to get it!
10621,"At its heart its a CCG with fun positional elements. Who doesn't like to see their cards come to life as monsters, spells and men at arms walking down the battlefield to get zapped? It is a romp. Too bad the deck builder is very basic which makes deck building a bit of a chore, and being f2p its economy, although generous (for casual play) is a bit overwhelming with stuff. Oh and the announcer voice is annoying as hell.

Verdict: if you are into CCG it is, as far as game play, one of the more enjoyable ones I have played. If you are a competitive player I have NO IDEA if the game is any good (balanced, affordable, etc)."
10622,easy to play and reminds me of magic the gather for playstation 1
10623,"Its a good game, theres a lot of feature or unit in tis game so ur not bored easily"
10624,captures all of the fun of a battle royale with really nicely streamlined card system
10625,Game Is Pretty Fun
10626,its a very fun quick game easy to play..good game to take a break from league of legends
10627,happy fun but this is games is actually p2w :)
10628,"i like this game because it is fun
"
10629,Fun game easy to play/learn.
10630,Simple but addicting.
10631,wp game
10632,Very fun and fast little game. I really enjoy it so far.
10633,simple fun game
10634,"Very good. Deserves more players.

Edit:
Still good. Waiting for more content."
10635,"Best board game on steam. 9/10

But not enough cards, no variety in decks.
Also need to nerf global aoe cards for to revive rush decks."
10636,Lots of fun!
10637,"While not entirely original, it is however unique. The game play is exciting and methodical. The deck building and customization leaves players with countless hours of replayability. Depth like this can be hard to find in the indie market. Great game all around."
10638,Good
10639,Good
10640,"Had no idea what this game was, just kinda happened to be on my wishlist. I expected it to be some pay to win type dealio but ive been mowing down online peeps with the defualt stuff. i dont even think i changed my deck at all yet. Good game to play when you dont reeeeally wanna focus on anything."
10641,Great game..
10642,"This game is awsome it s like Clash Royale but better and not pay to win. I like things like masters or cards :).
"
10643,very good game
10644,"This game is amazing. It is incredibly fun, visually beautiful, and highly addicting. If you haven't given it try yet, you NEED to. 10/10 will play again (and as soon as humanly possible...)"
10645,"It's a fun little game. Simple, but I like it. They did a good job at making the matches, quick, fun, exciting, cringy and entertaining."
10646,adult player its pretty fun too be honest keep it up guys
10647,"The game... is surprisingly fun (and funny). I did get a head start with the game using free offers though so that actually helped me get started and get a bit ahead of any grind I guess. You do get free rewards though and their not that bad I guess. Anyway, if you like tower defense and you like card games then I think you will like this :)"
10648,a good game
10649,"Fun to start, fun to get better at. Nice and simple with strategic depth"
10650,This game is simply amazing. It's like Clash Royale but much better and the art design is bomb! Would Reccomend very much!
10651,"A card placing game with a nice twist, it is very easy to pick up and try out new things. I'm enjoying the early game so far."
10652,"Fun game you can pick up quickly, ended up playing for hours without even realizing it."
10653,"fun and simple.

edit: a full two weeks after i wrote this review, and another 12-13 hours into the game, i can state that this is my prefered game to pick up right now when i have less than 10 min to do anything. the built decks i have made i can log into the game in less than a min, pick up a game in another 10-15 seconds most often and be done the round in normally under 3 min, sometimes 6 min. 

fast and furious, no need for sound, but the sound is not obnoxious like other games, rather actually funny. 

my biggest gripe is that the matches are mainly vs other players... i dont like people and would love to have a single player campaign type version available. but understand why it wont happen."
10654,I love this game and is now one of my favorite games.
10655,"Simple to pick up and play, takes time to master. I've been looking for a game similar to Clash Royale and this is it. They play similarly so I feel right at home."
10656,nice free game
10657,cool game sis
10658,its a fun game to play i would like to see more elf cards but if you have time to play but not hours this is a great game oh i also got this game free
10659,Great game that's not to difficult
10660,best card game
10661,Really dont understand why there is no more people here ! This game is ten time above anything else of its kind.
10662,funny
10663,Wish we had more cards to play with in matches.. the limit of using 4 cards is so bad...
10664,Fun f4p game.
10665,"it ez game
lmao"
10666,"Is gud, addicting
"
10667,Fun to pick up and easy to learn. 100% would recommend!
10668,Awesome game so far.  20 min in!
10669,This game is the funnest game ever
10670,Great game I love the concept of the game !
10671,Im hooked this game is great!!!!!
10672,"really great game, kind of a cross over from card games, really enjoy the gameplay after a hour. easy to pick up and quirky style makes it a fun time user."
10673,very good
10674,THIS GAME IS HELLA GOOD
10675,this game is pretty fun and easy to learn
10676,10/10 What Clash Royale should have been.
10677,turns out its alot more FUn then i had thought it was going to be. Very fun indeed.
10678,Cool game
10679,"Fun game. If you are looking for something to do while you have some downtime, this is a decently paced game to help pass the time. Matches are not long or overly complicated, if you have played games like Clash Royale & enjoyed it, then you will more than likely enjoy what this game has to offer. Solo & Team Battles bring an interesting dynamic to this game & depending on how you play your cards or build your deck(s) you can either win or lose a match. But it's all about having fun & improving as you learn your cards & what they can do against other types of cards."
10680,"Minion masters is a free game that will appeal to any age group.
Its simplistic presentation, menu and guides greatly lower the learning curve and will have anyone up and running with little effort quickly for what is an easy to grip pace.
Additionally the game drops in many advantages both free and paid for and only recently sort to give away many DLCs for free.
While i couldnt possibly put it above more hugely popular online free to play games its definitely not one to avoid.
Give it a try."
10681,Game has a pretty great curve without having to spend a ton of money. Good romp with great art style and some addictive gameplay.
10682,"Here's the deal, this game is good clean fun. There is absolutely ZERO Pay2Win in this game. You can spend as much money as you want but it will only make you LOOK cooler. If you like Clash Royale you'll LOVE Minion Masters. This game has entirely replaced Clash for me since I was getting tired of the Pay2Win model. Just download it and try it out, its free and fun."
10683,"Great game to play with friends, awesome job"
10684,"great game, very funny. It's like MTG!"
10685,fun
10686,Easy to learn & amusing.
10687,"Yeah at first I thought this was just a shitty copy of equally bad mobile games, but this honestly is pretty fun, playing with friends makes It even better. It's free, give it a try. The only thing I dispise is the BP but other than that, you can outsmart players with better stuff than you and make the perfect deck for defense and attack."
10688,Pretty fun game and addicting. Im still at a relatively low level and have been demolishing everything. My biggest complaint is that the arena should run from top to bottom. Other than that its solid. I am putting my RTX 2080 TI FTW3 to good use.
10689,ehh its ok
10690,A very addictive game that is very good I would recommend this game to all people who like to do strategies and like to play challenging games
10691,Worth.
10692,chill fun game
10693,Good game keeps me interested and pretty decent card game
10694,Positive
10695,Sweet
10696,Is a funny game and is better than Clash Royal!
10697,sweet
10698,"This game is pretty cool..its like clash of clans for steam PC, its actually fun!"
10699,Clash royale but without the bullshit and better
10700,"The recent change is enough for me. The devs turned a good chill game into a big cheese fest. No need for strategy. Its who plays the best cheese. 4 to 6 minute games sometimes more have been turned into 2 to 3  cheesefest.
"
10701,"Quick and easy free to play, enjoying it so far."
10702,"it is easy to start and not to complacated
"
10703,seems ok so far
10704,Just good stuff
10705,"Fun, but really could use a Non-Ranked playlist so players can try different card combinations without consequence."
10706,"Fun casual game. The PTW mechanics are more of a way to speed the unlock process up for new minions, but you can unlock everything by just playing the game. I've enjoyed it by not taking it too seriously(which the game kind of encourages with it's over the top announcer)."
10707,gtood game
10708,clash royale but on pc
10709,Man I`m really really trying to like this game... but there are just to many issues. Game crashes or losses connection or its getting stuck in loading screen. And because you lose connection or the game crashes you also lose your rank and your points... yeah and you have to play again and again and again from zero...its... just blows big time.
10710,"Ha! 
I don't like card games, don't have use for Moba, and only slightly interested in tower defense. Yet this game push's all my buttons! Really like the new shiny spin on the old classic boring. Bet you will like it too."
10711,"Hero: Morellia
Cards: Xia Long, Priestess, Stormy, Caeleth, Nyrvir, Colossus

That's it. You can play shitty now, you'll steamroll everything that doesn't have a similar setup and knows how to play. Unfortunately you'll probably play for 2 years every day to get those cards. Or .... you pay. 

And that's the problem with the game. It's actually super expensive. High prices for everything, but if you don't get the good stuff, you're pretty much done for after you went some up in the ranks. 

The cards and ways to get them are unbalanced. Frustratingly unbalanced. So sure, play. But don't dish out money. It's to expensive, and I'm sure new cards will top the old ones to animate for more buying."
10712,"cute fun game. got it when it was free, definitely worth it"
10713,nice game
10714,its nice for whenever i have a burnout from League of Legends
10715,V good
10716,"Really good free to play game, reminds me of the old base vs base browser games were you'd spawn troops to defeat the other AI base but this has players and has massively upgraded graphics along with 1v1, 2v2 and other mini games."
10717,"Funny game, nice and light. Short rounds 2v2 ranked."
10718,"Fun, Card-ish game. Easy to Learn."
10719,"Clash Royale with flashier graphics.
You'll need money (Like Clash Royale)
And alot of stuff is locked behind the £7 Battle Pass, which you'll pay for every few months.
Unless you LOVE Clash Royale; miss it."
10720,ns

10722,It is fun!

10742,Once your into the game you relise you are op just one day in and only one los i have had
10743,I like how they have a quote from Total Biscuit even though he died in 2018 and this game was released in 2019 :)
10744,"Disclaimer: Marked this review with a Game Recommended because I do, in the end, think this game is worth checking out.
Disclaimer 2: I have less than 10-hours played at the time of writing this review, and have simply made it into Bronze in Battle and Team Battle; please check condescension at the door.

Firstly, I'll start off by saying that this game was developed with heart and soul. Without even realizing who developed Minion Masters, this game immediately grabbed my attention through its clean design, welcoming tutorial system, and quick-and-easy gameplay. The sense of humor and overall vibe of this game is lighthearted and comfortable. There are very few noticeable game-to-game bugs or glitches, and everything tends to work as intended. Minion Masters delivers a quick gameplay experience, with games ranging from 45-seconds to 10-minutes (take this timeframe with a grain of salt, I haven't sank hours upon hours into the game, and there's a reason for that). Requiring quick mental reaction and many-steps-ahead of strategizing, the gameplay feels akin to the recent boom of Auto Chess games, except quicker-paced, functionally involved, and simply 1v1 or 2v2 matches. They allow you to unlock all three currencies (I won't get into my gripe with this whole business model here) through just playing the game, which is quite nice compared to most other microtransaction shops in the current gaming industry.

Unfortunately, after just 8-hours of gameplay, I don't see myself putting much more time into Minion Masters. Once I began to feel as if I had a grasp on the game, I realized there was a lot left to be understood, with very little in-game assistance. As a laid-back competitive gamer, I don't tend to get tilted in even the most competitive games, from Rocket League to Counter-Strike to League of Legends to Magic: The Gathering — this game is different. At first, I couldn't understand why losing in Minion Masters had been so tilting; obviously I made a mistake .. or the opponent was better .. or I got worse draws .. or he got better draws .. or my deck was worse .. or his deck was better, or ...... yep, herein is my point: every other even semi-competitive game I've played, there's a given reason for victories and losses, I'm able to learn and improve. This is missing for me in Minion Masters.

Matches I felt like I was dominating would suddenly flip on me, seemingly out of nowhere, with no visual or audio indication as to why it was able to happen. On the flip side, I've come back from sure-losses by doing bare minimum summons. Certain minions seem stronger than others with no indication as to their strengths or weaknesses beyond basic descriptions, leading to some summons just walking through seemingly-tougher minions with ease and wreaking havoc on the opposing master. On that note, certain masters also seem to be on the stronger end, with certain level-up rewards being incredibly strong in most situations. It's difficult to know what plays are being made to turn the tides of battles for someone who doesn't understand much of the strategy of the game beyond ""hold the bridges and summon things strategically.""

Beyond that, the frustration has lead to lack of gameplay investment - lack of gameplay investment has lead to a lack of interest in looking up guides or tips or tutorials - lack of interest in researching strategies leads to not winning - not winning leads to lack of interest in gameplay -- rinse, repeat. I want to learn more and improve at this game, but I want to feel like it's worth it in the long-run; because as it stands, I have very little desire to continue playing long-term.

All said and done, this was written with frustration because I really think this is a diamond in the rough. There's so much incredible potential for growth and development, both from the dev team and the community. There's so much heart and passion behind this title - from the visual and audio design, to the voice acting and scripting, to the animating and the programming. I want to love this game, I do, and I really hope there comes a time where I /personally/ do. I think Minion Masters may be a great, top-tier, phenomenal game for many people (if you don't mind the frustration that may come with the aforementioned issues) which is why I'm recommending this game overall. Just -- maybe first spend 8-hours watching gameplay and tutorial videos before you install just to make sure you know what's going on."
10745,shit fire
10746,"Finally, a game of this style that doesn't focus on twicthing"
10747,"Nice clash royale adaptation to PC, but far  wider range of things to mix up"
10748,simple but immersive stratagy
10749,seems fine
10750,"So far I can't believe it's free!  It's a lot of fun.  Haven't spent a dollar; tons of content.  Easy to learn, hard to master.   Get it, it's free."
10751,"Fun for a while. Easy to get into with quick games and doesn't have a big money sink to start, but doesn't have half the depth of Magic or many of the myriad other collectible card games this is based on. Easily better than Hearthstone but still repetitive and overly simple. Wears out quickly. If you're looking for this type of game, go for the OG: Magic The Gathering or pick an IP you love (like Star Wars) and dive in to a much deeper experience."
10752,"Game seems great so far.  I play CR, this is fun for PC.  I would like to try out more cards, see what kind of decks are out there."
10753,fun to play thats i ave to say
10754,"Yeah, it's fun. It's deckbuilding and RTS, pretty easy to learn and the competition is always there."
10755,"Really fun game, been playing a whole bunch since I got it"
10756,neat
10757,interesting new concept i feel like mana gain could be a little higher to provide faster action
10758,its a nice game!
10759,good time killler if you are bored
10760,Good game very fun even has team play... highly recommend... and im chinese player GANNIMABI
10761,This game so good!!! come and play
10762,Love it.
10763,its very fun and addictive
10764,Awesome game can grind it for hours without getting bored.. and brilliant for streaming
10765,very clash royale-esque but with a more fleshed out game structure and (imo) a better art style
10766,like a better version of clash royal!
10767,"Its a good game.  Got me hooked.  However, it continuously crashes almost every other match."
10768,"Это реально прикольно
Похоже на учебу в Мед унивре"
10769,"Fun game to kill time. No pay to play involved, only pay to collect the in-game cards faster ( and other game items like master skins) and support the developers. The game seems well balanced. Keep in mind, you can't win them all and there is no ""perfect"" deck in this game. I bought the ""starter pack"" for about 5$ to support the developers for making the fun, little time-killer game. Thanks Devs!"
10770,good game.
10771,"Muito divertido, até agora não tem nada de pay2win."
10772,"good game, easy to learn!"
10773,Very fun. Well made. Did I mention very fun? LOVE IT.
10774,Fun game
10775,Minion Masters is sick AF!!!
10776,GOOD GAME
10777,can't play on linux :c
10778,Great game
10779,"This is like Clash royle, but in PC so good, better than it!
"
10780,I'm not so into card games but I like RTS games so this game actually blends those two together quite well. So far I have played it just a little bit but it's interesting how much new stuff just keeps coming when you play this game. Not necessarily something I would play competitively but it's good for relaxing pastime. I recommend.
10781,Very fun game
10782,"Im just starting to play, will update my review as i  go on.. so far its been entertaining...
Balance wise, cant say much, need to play more."
10783,It pretty addictive besides the micro-transactions
10784,"Mothertrucking game starts an update mid-fight, crashes, still counts as a loss. Lost three 10+ win streaks, pathetic."
10785,diverting game with superb combination possibilities
10786,ty for this game so enjoyable
10787,Quick. Entertaining. Enjoyable.
10788,So far so good. Very easy to get into
10789,i actually like this game great combat i like the rag dolls aswell seeing a mob fly across the arena is too funny. good tactics keeps fight new and fresh :)
10790,more puffer themes minions please
10791,fun rewards feel nice so far
10792,fast and fun
10793,GOOD GAME
10794,Fun Game just like clash version  just better OwO
10795,Very short battles = you can try a tactic and see how it works without a lot of complicated fiddly bits.
10796,Fun game to play when you have limited time. Its got some p2w items but so far im enjoying it.
10797,"Idk about a review and I'm not sure what I'm doing, but I'm enjoying how chill this game is
"
10798,It's cool
10799,Great way to relax and enjoy some war !!!
10800,"Took advantage of a promotion a while back just to see and I found it to be pretty fun.  They keep adding new stuff, update often and communication is great.  All things one should consider before supporting a game and these guys do it very very well."
10801,A super fun game! Very easy to catch on and super addicting!
10802,"The game is good, simple but yet possible to skillgap mechanics, an anti-cheat will be a good next feature or region lock China"
10803,"I thought this game was going to be another terrible ""ftp"" but it's actually really fun so far, give it a chance. That's it."
10804,Clash Royale v2 .
10805,An Enjoyable game when I'm getting bored
10806,SO Fun~
10807,"Just started to play the game so far it seems to be enjoyable, would like to see more about the game to make a better review. :) Still i have a guess later on it could be a bit monoton if you don't like arena games."
10808,"Fast play, very addictive."
10809,"Good intro, catching mechanics, easy to understand, fun,  no cancer decks so far, nice price, quest, spins."
10810,Best Game ever
10811,"WAS  awesome....now most games are AI filled, to automatically break your streak and have more cards, than human players. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, until they figure the matchmaking out. just disappointed as it had potential"
10812,ggwp
10813,I like it.
10814,Great game. Forget clash of clans! or whatever that shits called!
10815,like clash royale but less grinding
10816,"Extremely easy to pick up game, short matches (~3 min), minimal rng. Not a fan of the echo'd announcer, but minor complaint. Love the fact that you can do team battles (2v2)."
10817,"Brand new to the game, but they're effort and model seems rock solid. Smart call on the review while leaving tutorial notification. I'll bite. I'll change this if it sucks, so if my hours break 10....I'd say it's legit."
10818,So far a really fun fast passed game that I'm winning in
10819,Very charming game that's easy to pick up and a fun time waster.
10820,"Fun free to play game , not very pay-to-win
UI leaves a little to be desired but that's normal  for a free game
"
10821,good
10822,dont play. rigged by having ai resemble a human player. then get outdone by the flawless ai. stupid system.
10823,Fun so far.  Pretty much a copy of Clash Royale in terms of gameplay but with unique elements.  Will have to update with whether playing without paying is feasible.
10824,fun
10825,Pretty fun game
10826,tutorial really easy an found it quite addicting early on.
10827,"I bought this game when it was on sale and now it's free and I feel cheated, But it's a cute and a nice game and it was worth the money."
10828,"Very repetitive pay-to-win deck building pseudo MOBA game.  Could have potential with more variety, less pay-to-win.  Games generally feel very one-sided.  I either win easily, or lose quickly.  Once in a while I have a close match, but generally once the momentum shifts to one side or the other, that's it.  It's over.  I do like the fact that certain cards counter others.  Light damage AOE spells can smash wimpy minions.  Wimpy minions in large groups can take down high damage, slow attack speed enemies that can only target one thing at a time.  Flying minions easily counter melee minions.  They're on the right track because where you summon or cast spells, and when, can make a big difference.  Sadly some minions and some masters are unbalanced and it seems that certain combinations always win no matter how you try to counter them.  If they handle the game balance and add some variety to the game, such as not playing on the same exact map 100% of the time, then I could maybe recommend it.  Right now, it's a no."
10829,"I LOVE THE STRAT! its amazing
"
10830,So far so good.
10831,It's easy to get into. The tutorial is short and concrete.
10832,"It was fun, for about 2 mins when it just crashed when I was winning in a match even though I totally meet the req specs."
10833,Awesome game with many interesting elements!
10834,super fun and addictive if u like strategy games
10835,Top
10836,good
10837,"Its simple,face pace and can actually reward more tank oriented decks"
10838,"The game is a hell lot of fun. The issues with unresponsive UI were fixed lately - so I am correcting my review to ""recommended""."
10839,good game
10840,"great fun with friends and a better clash royale
"
10841,"Fun game, would recommend to anyone who has played clash royale, if you havent, still check it out! :)"
10842,The gameplay is addictive and the creatures and minions are quite innovative and new. Like the game so far and will recommend to atleast play once before making any perception.
10843,I like Clash Royale type games.. But I like the fact this is on pc and adds new dimensions too !
10844,i just started this game and i fell for it ... if not because of my computer limitation i will stream this. hahahaa
10845,just love the game i find its better then clash
10846,I like this game
10847,love it
10848,It is fun. I like the fact there is Team Mode!
10849,very nice
10850,"It's pretty easy to pick up, doesn't seem that microtransaction heavy, and it's a lot of fun!"
10851,Fun game. You throw down cards real fast to summon creatures to destroy your opponents base.
10852,Never write reviews...but this game rocks. I was looking for another game to get into besides overwatch and league because they can get boring. THIS IS IT.
10853,"g00d game
"
10854,"Its actually a pretty fun game- its a mix between tower defence and hearthstone. You need to play ""cards"" to summon minions to defend your tower. Unlike hearthstone its not a pay to win game. Already plat elo and I havent spent a single cent ...yet. 

and if you sign up to their newsletter they give you codes for free stuff every now and then. 


"
10855,"Pretty fun tempo based card unit game. It has lots of cards and units to learn and master. And the biggest draw for me, a two headed giant mode.

A  few things could use a bit more polish but overall its an enjoyable card game that gives you enough reward to keep playing."
10856,"It seems pretty fun, I like the tower defense kind of play, so far so good."
10857,"Yes I do like the game so far (maybe a few hours in). the graphics are great, the narrator is a flambouyant gay guy with a robot filter on, and it's free. Solid. If you like BattleBlock Theatre commentary, Clash Royale style gameplay, catchy soundtracks, and unique cards then this is the game for you."
10858,"Game is fun, free and action is great"
10859,good
10860,"I love the game itself, but I found that when red has a mana rush, it doesn't play the audio to tell you that red is having a mana rush. I would like to be prepared for things like mana rushes but I was unaware he had one. Please fix."
10861,it's preddy gud
10862,"Fun easy, to earn."
10863,"Fun and easy to get into, not a cash grab like a lot of F2P games."
10864,"Minion Masters has three things I enjoy ,ost in my games.
1| Humor. Play it you will see what I mean.
2| Lots of options.  A lot of different cards. differnt ways to create decks and more. PLay it you will see what I mean.
3) Games last a short time.   That gives you the option to leat\rn from you mistakes. change cards out. try something new and not have to wait a long time be feeling like you you a chance to win."
10865,Relaxing Cool game. reminds me of a funny version of Clash Royale
10866,Simple quick and fun
10867,"Quite a good time. I generally don't get too into card games or mobas, but this is more my speed, a sort of sweet spot in the middle."
10868,"Nice game, better than i remember"
10869,Fun and easy gameplay made epic by playing with friends!
10870,"A very good game that is better than Clash Royale
:yolo:

obtain bridge control (which is how you generate exp and level your Master for upgrades/power ups) and overwhelm your opponent's base (their Master).

love this game, but for almost 1 year now i cant enter codes i have won on streams they support. and im running out of currency to buy a pass. would like the big and small pack bug fixed."
10871,"Really good game.It has some mechanics similar to clash royale,but when you start playing competitive,you can already see the difference.
Also,newsletter are cool,giving you free codes for new cards,gold and tokens."
10872,it is very good ye man
10873,Fun couch party game
10874,Cool Game Would Play Again
10875,IM enjoying it so far xD
10876,"Great game, scrappy core fun. Very similar to popular mobile games, but built for PC and smarmy attitude gives it it's own edge."
10877,Minions do your bidding and then die.  10/10
10878,It doesnt really tell you how to build a deck or explain a lot of the systems before throwing you into pvp where the matches are usually pretty one sided. I think maybe the crafting system might provide an avenue to customize your deck but so far I've only acquired cards randomly. Maybe after a couple years of polish this game will be worth trying again but in its current state im just going to uninstall.
10879,"Let's start by saying I am enjoying the game. It's got colourful graphics, fun gameplay mechanics and plenty of rewards and deckbuilding.

Why then do I not recommend it? Well, because I don't like smoke and mirrors.

You see, the vast majority of the game does not take have you face off against human opponents, but against bots posing as humans.

There are a few things that give away that your opponent is a bot:
[list]
[*] In team games, the opposing team always consists of two players with the exact same rank, despite you and your team mate regularly be a few sub-leagues apart
[*] Same defensive strategies; The AI always puts cards to the far-back of the tower when pressed
[*] Same kinds of decks: Always very low-rarity decks with the same themes returning: I've seen cleaver-golem-beam-fireball a lot as well as double flying scrats in combination with double shooty bots (forgot the name)
[*] Pin-point accuracy when it comes to spells; No missed fireballs here!
[*] Easy to beat when you get the hang of the game, no matter the rank
[/list]

To be clear, I don't MIND playing against bots, it's just that I really dislike the game not telling me that bots are part of ranked play. It makes me not trust the developer when they create the illusion that ranked play is against humans, while this is mostly not the case."
10880,Really easy to pick up and play.
10881,always been a fan of line defense games this one is no exception. Shoutouts to OG winning TI9 back to back champs #DREAMOG PogU
10882,Simples de Jogar bom para passar o tempo
10883,"For me this is a VERY BIG NO!!   Right from the start it was obvious that the game presented itself in a fraudulent way by providing painfully easy opponents and then as early as level 5, I came up against a player that had clearly pumped a lot of money into his characters as he replenished his mana in an unbelievable quick time and before I could get my mana to eight he had caused me 92% damage with just two characters, whereas my two epic characters (won in a loot box drop) lasted all of 5-6 seconds before exploding??!!  Then he playfully exhausted all my characters and mana and sent a FULL SET of cards at me when just one of them would have easily laid waste to my pathetic defences!

This game is WITHOUT DOUBT the most obvious PAY TO PLAY & WIN ever seen on the Steam platform; Instantly uninstalled & removed from my games list!"
10884,"good game, pls add new card dev team !!"
10885,"Fun game, been enjoying it so far."
10886,"Did not think it would bee this much fun!!!!!
Great Game 
"
10887,"Ok, very fun and fast! Really enjoy playing it. Nice gameplay, work and characters!"
10888,"magic the gathering on the original Xbox was much better, that said its kinda close to this game but its a cash grab like any other game these days, random crap loot boxes, cards that get used against you that are locked behind a pay wall, all around vanilla pudding or hospital jello, youd be better off building a magic the gathering deck and making real friends to play the game with."
10889,"Good game, but it uses dark patterns to encourage buying its battle pass. Instant uninstall."
10890,"This game is alright for casual players.

But it has also stolen quite a bit from Warhammer 40K, like the Scrats are just Grots and the ""More Dakka"" level up for the Rambo scrat. Even in the loading screen the big red robot is just an Ork Deff Dread and an Morkanaut mixed into one. A bunch of knock-off Tau cards also appear, including the drones. 

Sometimes it can be a long grind, but i do like how its not pay to win.

This game also tries too hard to be funny, such as the card descriptions and especially the announcer.



Overall, the game is super casual and dont expect high tier-gamepaly and if you're a WH40K fan, do not get this

"
10891,Better Clash Royale
10892,"Awesome F2P game not ruined by ""LOL"" community/infinite grind/pay2win!

Pros:
Super fun
Easy to pick up but needs tactics and strategy to master
Lots of modes to play (Solo/duo, draft, mayhem & expedition)
Achivs
Lots os free stuff to help everyone (specially newcomers have something to play with against others - with skill easy climb to gold - I got to plat on duo without 2 much trouble)

Cons:
Every now and then game might crash or u might find a leaver (really rare)
Draft can be totally unbalanced since u get random cards and build a deck but its still awesome mode
Solo/Duo is always ranked (For me this is not a con but for some ppl it might be if they wanna play ""normals"")

Conclusion:
Worth a try! If you like it awesome enjoy the game like I do and if you dislike it np u wasted 2h of your life and didn't spend anything!"
10893,Has a few fun mechanics. Too many unbalanced cards combined with pay to win. Hard Pass.
10894,"better than Battle for Azeroth, but I guess everything is"
10895,"Good game
"
10896,Really splendid game! great just for friends and for a little dawdling time
10897,I actually enjoy this battle card game the mediator makes it humorous and exciting
10898,Cool action dynamics and interesting learning curve.
10899,"The first thing I want to say is that this is a legitimately Free to Play game.  I have put some money into it, just because I felt I owed the creators, but it didn't really get me much.  And I say that in the most complimentary way.  There is nothing you can get that effects game-play that you can't earn through just playing.  The bonuses you can buy are, more often than not, cosmetic.  Which means that you won't get trounced by someone who just dumped a bunch of cash into the game.

Instead, you'll get trounced by someone who really knows what they're doing. ;)  It's much more satisfying that way, especially once you finally beat some of them.

I've described this to people as ""Magic: The Gathering"" with all the slow, annoying things boiled out of it.  It is a fast game, with an average match of about three minutes, and an epic one at 8+.  Much of the strategy seems to revolve around timing and placement.  I've seen decks with Common cards beat much more ""expensive"" decks because the player with the average cards used them better.  That's also bonus points for the creators.

Additional kudos to the the developers for creating a match-making system that always seems to provide about the right level of challenge.  In all my matches, I've had very few that were a blowout for one side or the other.

If it sounds like something you might like...  It's free, download it and give it a try!

More Specific Note Regarding Some of the Reviews:

The latest Master added, Morelia, is a good example of the designers commitment to game balance.  Yes, she broke some things for a week or so, but they tweaked stats, people learned how to deal with the new abilities, and she's now a unique Master who is comparable to the others, all with their own interesting perks.  (It's not like you can get Nyvir out quickly, no matter what you do.)

Update 12/06/2019:

The cost for the new single player adventures seems a bit high in comparison to what else you can get with the in-game currency, but it's optional, so I can't really complain.  The main PvP is still going strong, though, and the new batch of cards has some pretty neat additions to the game.  They've also added a (mostly) new faction called the ""Stoutheart"" that injects some interesting new mechanics."
10900,good game
10901,Azali is broken!
10902,This game is addicting
10903,nice
10904,yes
10905,"fun game, feels fair and easy to pick up"
10906,"I t   g o o d





ya"
10907,"Fun game to waste time; battles are quick. Game seems well made and polished. Has a certain ""charm"""
10908,"different and noone is swearing
"
10909,Awsome Game!
10910,"Great game thus far, but I am not even sure I am playing against real people at this point.  Really merges the tower defense and card strategy elements found in other popular games.  Worth the try if you are even somewhat interested in mobas or card games."
10911,pretty decent time killer. so far no pay walls
10912,"Usually not a big fan of these types of games, but this has been fun the entire time I've played. It's worth it!"
10913,"Seems like a very interesting game, I'm enjoying the style and strategy of it."
10914,DIS GAME FUN I PLAY IT WIF MY HUSBAND
10915,"Fun, Easy to understand, quick games"
10916,great game all around
10917,Its new and fresh
10918,"I have a pal I play with, and having a team together makes the game so fun. If you like TD games, give it a try."
10919,Very fun game that is great to play with friends. Would recommend to play short games when your low on time.
10920,"This is really quick fun, the tactics and stratagy is really easy but seems to have a layer of complexity that only becomes apprent when you have a skilled enemy."
10921,"Fun addictive gameplay, Only played a few matches solo, but have been duo queue with a friend and have had a lot of fun. The game is easy to understand and pick up. Free to play as well."
10922,Nice vidya :)
10923,fun for basically a free mobile game. Hoping builds later are very interesting.
10924,Its just super fun!
10925,Great game. addictive and fun.
10926,"Recommended by friends - very enjoyable, easy to play hard to master type of game. Perfect diversity for different target groups of all ages. ;))"
10927,"bery cool
"
10928,"It's easy enough to start off and seems pretty fair so far. You can earn cards without paying but obviously there are some pretty inexpensive options if you can afford it. There are battle passes that last months and you don't really need to spent a lot. Compared to playing a tabletop TCG or CCG it's fast and easy to pick up as your deck is very small so the deckbuilding hurdle that most of these games have can be much easier for those, like myself, who just can't seem to build ""meta"" decks."
10929,.
10930,"real fun! i like how as soon as the game is downloaded you go straight into gameplay. Seriously, like there is not a second of menu/intro/storyline etc. You get to learn how to play immediately, so that's one reason to download the game if you're curious. also after only playing for a bit i was rewarded with lots of fun new cards, letting me customize my deck easily and relatively quickly. great artwork and aesthetic, great voice work with some funny dialogue, and a seemingly simple game with lots of room to grow and improve strategy. cheers!"
10931,Amazing
10932,like the game are some points those can be better but for so far a fun game
10933,"This game is very nice, you can combine your cards deck, and going for battle
You don't need to buy many cards with money
And also you can feel the emotion :D"
10934,very nice concept
10935,"First 30 mins, real fun game."
10936,"Normally I dislike games such as these to a extreme length. This one however I am enjoying thus far. While there is a great degree of microtransactions I have yet to gauge if this game requires you to scale a paywall just yet, so far it does not seem so, in fact I was not even aware most of the matches I was doing have been ranked."
10937,GOOD GAME!
10938,Dope
10939,"While being fun and having some cool features like playing 2 v 2 this game is fundamentally a pay to win endless cash pit pc version of the shadiest of mobile games, they are hoping to find a few whales and anyone playing who isnt one of them will hit a cash ceiling. quite dissapointed to see this style of game on steam and working with twitch shady af

Constant advertisements and pop ups to buy limited times special deals and when asked to give feedback clicking no also takes you to the area to give feedback"
10940,so far it's pretty fun :D i am enjoying this game.
10941,Its fun gameplay and really funny tutorial guy
10942,awesome gameplay
10943,cool games
10944,nice idea
10945,its a nice one
10946,This game is very well done
10947,It's Good
10948,it is very nice
10949,"Games Broke AF. Mostly Morellia, if you dont finish the game before she reaches level 3 your boned. Edit: The further you get in the game the more p2w it becomes. Avoid unless you plan on putting a good 60$ into the game to win pass gold.

After putting more time into this game i have come to the conclusion that the devs have no idea how to balance anything. This game is a complete waste of time. Go play something thats a little more balanced."
10950,[h1] This Game Extremely Fun .. i Loved It .. i Recommend You All To Try it Out [/h1]
10951,"Minion Masters

At first, I was hesitant to try this game, so it was a wonderful surprise when I found myself hooked after the first few games. The deck-building aspects of this game is fantastic. I found myself trying out different types of monsters. 

Then different champions and spells, the game had me spoilt for choice. 
There are microtransactions in this game, but I do not feel the need to purchase them to feel like I am progressing. 
The matches tend to be fast-paced my longest match lasting for eight minutes.

I was pleasantly surprised to find myself coming across different game modes and the game only became better, especially after I realized I could team up with a friend and their deck.  
In the end, I ended up nicknaming my minions very silly names and shouting “Fly my pretties” whenever I summoned a swarm of bats. 

Card Arch types work well together, but it also helps to have a mix of cards in your deck. This encouraging players to get creative. Myself preferring to mix the Voidlings Arch types and with the Accursed Arch types.

The masters themselves have unique abilities that unlock as the match goes on some being defensive some being offensive and some being rather supportive. 

The bright and colourful art style is easy on the eyes, I find myself wanting to know more about the characters and the minions. While also staring at my deck trying to figure out new combinations. 

It feels like a lot of love has gone into the game and the competitive side of it is something I know I love already, so at the end of the day I recommend this to any gamer who is a fan of Cards and Moba games.

10952,"its a great game
"
10953,"It's fun, has a few balance issues but which card game doesn't?! you should try it!"
10954,this game first impression its really good and fun
10955,nice game two play
10956,"only just started this but a lot of fun and seems like endless options for deck building, has a nice reward system for a F2P game, no complaints here, teaming up is excellent fun."
10957,"fast, dynamic, easy to get into!
"
10958,huyee
10959,"very game, haha cool"

10964,"pretty neat game.

"
10965,decent
10966,"So fun & Fantastic game 
many minion you can play and upgrade its"
10967,"This game is really addictive and fun to play. There is a surprising amount of depth to the strategy and deck building as well. This is also one of the best free to play card games I've ever played in terms of earning content without spending money. If you just do basic stuff like join the discord and go on reddit to get a bunch of codes, you can easily earn about half the cards in the game after a couple hours of play. Very free to play friendly. 

My only complaint about the game is for the first couple ranks, up until about high gold, you will mostly be playing against bots, but the game will not tell you this. While this was upsetting when I learned about it, playing against bots is actually still fun and is a good intro to the game."
10968,fun game great form
10969,Hearthstone and chess?
10970,mashing my keyboard and winning
10971,"Reminds me of that Clash game. But faster, and less frustrating. Fun game!"
10972,"This game is good i play 2 hour later..., also this similar 'Clash Royale' by 'Supercell', my league are 'Wood' only 'Single Battle' and 'Bronze' only 'Team Battle'


[spoiler] SUPERCELL!!!!! YOU DON'T KNOW THIS GAME SIMILAR 'CLASH ROYALE'


just prank xD"
10973,Very good
10974,"Super fun right away, we shall see if the free rewards continue"
10975,"Honestly, Im not 100% sure how to review this. But I have to say its a much more in control and refreshing way for an auto chess like game. ESPECIALLY the coop. Gotta admit thats fun as hell. Its free too, really theres nothing to complain about!"
10976,its nice
10977,"Fun game, sorta of a mix of many things."
10978,"It's kind of like Magic meets a Dungeon Defender. I dig it so far,"
10979,"fun, quick easy to learn"

10991,played for 10min not bad keep up to good work!
10992,it fun and so far I like it.....seems like it will be a good game to have a friend play with you
10993,Just started playing the game. Plays well and is a ton of fun!
10994,Great game
10995,"Not only is this a unbalanced steaming mess of a game, the greedy cash driven not balance driven dev's update this game on a constant basis but it's done with what seems little thought, more just updates for the sake of looking active, couple that with a toxic community and a bot infested player base ( I assume they are bots, because honestly there can't be that many utterly stupid people in one game ).  All in all this games an utter waste of time. Avoid it and play literally anything else."
10996,Great little game ! Graphics are crisp. Game play is a fun. Team battles are fun. Worth getting into.
10997,"The game takes your attention inmediatly,and it gives one of those vibes of ''Yea i can play this for awhile'' like you know youll enjoy it,and then you start to see the potential for strategy,also the voice actor for most fo the things is amazing so that definetly helped,the music is also really good for when you start makign a desk and think,it really gives you the tactician vibe,just a really good game overall."
10998,its alright
10999,This game is fun and its free
11000,Fun game.
11001,Good game. Fast games. Funny.
11002,If you like tower defense games and card collecting games and would like both of those things in one game then this is the game for you.
11003,Muito divertido
11004,If you like clash royale this might be the game for you this game is realy fun
11005,"Awesome game so far, enjoying it very much"
11006,nice 1
11007,YEE
11008,"Sort of a mixture of card based strategy and real time strategy. Summon your monsters, let them fight. Defeat your enemies and take the spoils of war for your own, onward to victory!

11009,great game
11010,nice game~
11011,"Can't believe I've put in so many hours now and forgot to write a review. Put simply, this is what Clash Royale would look like if the developers weren't asking for your life savings to play the game.

As a result, the game doesn't really feel P2W at all (some of the best legendaries can be countered by common cards if played right), and the strategy of play gets pretty deep (i.e. timing the swing of a minion's attack to catch it offguard, bluffing with 'decoy' minions to bait your opponent's counters, etc).

I'm not going to say the game is perfectly, 100% balanced, as that's basically impossible with the breadth of cards/masters involved, but the devs have done a really good job keeping it balanced overall and addressing any cheesy/broken strategies that arise.

To top it all off, it has a really fun 2v2 mode where there's even more back-and-forth gameplay if 1v1 ever gets too stressful (I actually spend the majority of my time there for a more casual/relaxing match). You can have fun even while losing, not much more to say about it.

Edit: There's no stars here, but I'd definitely have to ding the game at least 1 or 2 stars for general bugginess. Some very inconveniencing bugs go ignored for months at a time. The dev team doesn't seem large enough to address those issues, so it's something any new player should at least be aware of."
11012,Really cool. Still need a little balancing for greater esports opportunities but still pretty good.
11013,yes ! very good
11014,"Great game, one of the best moba's i've ever played atm."
11015,"The game gets old fast. Matches are way way too short. 

P2W when you use the definition concerning excessive grinding and tedium unless you spend money."
11016,"This game is like Clash royale, but better. In sooooooo many ways.
Graphics is amazing
Monsters look awesome AF
Even better when you have friends to play with."
11017,"please please, please remove or nerf infiltrations. Because you can spawn them right next to the the enemy tower. I have deranked from platinum 2 to bronze 3"
11018,great set up love the game play
11019,"PRETTY GOOD
"
11020,"cul 
"
11021,At first i thouth its gonna suck but to be honest its quite fun to play
11022,A nice game to play without worries. Just relax and play. Nice!
11023,because I like card games and theres one that the cards come to life its heaven
11024,is good
11025,Best game
11026,"basically clash royale for the pc , but regular updates and isnt impossably hard ( also no waiting for chest opens xD )
but yeah , you could try and build a themed deck for example , like having only low mana swarm - units , a spell and 2 counters

if you have some time and some space on your pc , try it"
11027,Its neat.
11028,I enjoy the MOBA x RTS X TCG gameplay. Simple to learn hard to master also there is no pay to win element.
11029,"this is game is so fun. the creativity and excitment is off the charts.
"
11030,More fun than I thought.
11031,"ITS FUN
TRY IT 
"
11032,It's ok at all. But Nyrvir the Fallen is over-powered. It's almost impossible to kill this. PLease delete this or make more expensive(there is legendary card that weaker than this and it costs 6000 shards but the dragon is only 2000)
11033,Its really easy to play. Im having fun ^_^
11034,Easy to learn but with enough depth to keep it interesting.
11035,"cool!
"
11036,Awesome Game! Better then Clash Royal!
11037,"Fun, similar to clash of clans only with a very diverse troop select. Has some great commentary and very cool troop models."
11038,"10/10 it's like a really addictive phone game you don't have to ruin your hands, posture, and battery to play"
11039,"fun
"
11040,this game is more fun than it has any right to be
11041,Yes
11042,nice
11043,"great game glad i found it!!
"
11044,"Great game. Simple rules, thousand possibilities. An average match will take between 2 and 7 minutes; great for casual gaming with awesome strategy."
11045,Thought I would give this game a go and well I'm not dissapointed by any means! lots of rewards and fast paced quick games. I recommend It for sure!
11046,Not a bad game. Feels like you can lose time in this pretty quickly
11047,"I don't like being a punching bag so I'm quitting the game.

Minion master wants people to give good reviews before you become fodder for the veteran players. Day after day its getting destroyed by veterans and their many combos. You might say that's just the new player experience, but . . . If you don't pony up the cash to add ""Glory"" to your cards then new players are stuck with bad decks while trying to farm glory for rewards.

Glory. What is it? Its a little number by all the cards and it goes up for every copy of that card you get. When you win a match the total ""Glory"" of the deck fills a bar for rewards.

"
11048,Great game to kill time playing when you have no other games that catch your interest
11049,"[h1] Would very much recommend! [/h1]
A lot of fun alone or with friends, and there's someone for everyone to play.
[i] Runs reALLY high fps in the menu though and could overheat your computer- so just don't leave it in the menu for too long if that would be an issue. [/i]
:)"
11050,So far so good!
11051,Quick and easy to learn gameplay. Matches don't drag on like other mobas
11052,"It's not overly complicated, but not easy enough for me to dislike.  I like pretty much everything about this game so far."
11053,Pretty fun so far
11054,Really fun change of pace to just chill and play
11055,"Installed this game and had a blast!  

Decided to support the developers and spend money on micro-transactions.  I purchased ""Rubies"" on Discord and it did not transfer to my account.  After discussing this with the Discord support team, they said I would need to get in contact with the developers.  The developers refused to refund me my Discord purchase and told me to just play my Discord account after weeks of playing my Steam account.  

""Issue was resolved and i'm really enjoying the game!"""
11056,"Looks lovely, playgame is cool. Coop is awesome."
11057,"Awesomee game
"
11058,Very nice. Very chill and straightforward. Also challenging.
11059,Good fun with a friend!
11060,"I'm not a big card game fan, but this one is pretty fun and addicting!"
11061,This must be the mother of free to pay games. A constant flow of triggers making you happy for gaining points. Constant gratification of in game currencies! Everything in this game revolves around giving you just the right amount of fun to keep playing. Then there is the balance where good units/cards/masters have a zero drop chance and are the most expensive to buy.
11062,fun game not to serious kinda like clash royal
11063,"the game is simple and smooth. it looks good and you can have hours of fun in this game. another benefit of this game is that you are not obligated to alwats play alone, you can also play with friends"
11064,it good
11065,So far I love this game!
11066,Fun Game!
11067,"1v1 is all about Cheeses.

2v2's are fun."
11068,"muy buen juego entretenido sobre todo facil de jugar y divertido 100% recomendable! 
"
11069,"I definitely recommend this game. Fun, intuitive, great design, great graphics, plenty of variety on cards and masters, great gameplay mechanics. Hope for the devs will adding more and more content in the future."
11070,I just started to play the game and its really interesting.. i cant stop playing it hehe :D
11071,"Minion Masters is Free and comes with a decent amount of content. Its colourful, plenty of people play it and there's new content added pretty regularly. 

Not too keen on it myself. The little battles are pretty boring and although you've got options it doesn't really feel like they matter. To be fair maybe if you play a lot then you know the cards, how to play them and can plan a battle several turns deep. Yeah not that interested. 

Have played for four hours, am not getting a deeper understanding of the game and am not hooked on it. 

Other people like the game, my plan is to delete it and forget about it. 

Game free, nothing to stop you loading it and giving it a try if you like the look of it. 

"
11072,"Clash Royale but with more going on.
Seems pretty good so far."
11073,good
11074,Greatest Game of its kind.  Its 100% free and while some say its pay to win I disagree.  There is nothing you can't earn through being active that can be bought.  That said having the most powerful cards does not guarantee victory as I have noticed a well crafted low level deck can take down a Legendary deck due to the mana cost to summon each during the battles.  Take a little thought if you want to win all the time but casually you can play and 50/50 your wins :)
11075,fun game
11076,Fun game
11077,Nhân phẩm thôi :v
11078,Seems pretty balanced so far. I'm a little worried that unit upgrades may ruin the game for me really soon.
11079,"Really enjoyed playing this game, the skill sets, the card, the graphics, everything 10/10. Keep it up!"
11080,"A fun 1v1/2v2 game where you place cards that transform into minions with various stats and abilities. Those minions venture forth to the enemy base and try to deplete their health. Lots of combinations, some humor, no problems connecting with other players, a decent ranking system, lots of updates.

Oh! And it's Free-to-Play!"
11081,w
11082,Pretty cool game!
11083,Nice addictive low pace game. The one I just looked for
11084,"Pretty Fun game, very easy to get into. I would like to see more as game-play progresses."
11085,little game very fun!
11086,this game cured my depression :)
11087,"Pls buff dragon, ez kill for me"
11088,"Fun, different take on a card game:)"
11089,"Very interesting a game,easy to use,many mechanisms do well,matching is also fair entertainment necessary"
11090,Pretty good one
11091,"game in general is great but the unbalancing of that retard hoe who can summond a dragon is just fking OP and need a nerf in general

as long as devs doesnt get this, negative review for obvious unbalancing."
11092,"NOT A GOOD GAME
"
11093,"Fun, fast paced battler. A bit of CCG but short battles makes for a nice game when you're not wanting to get into anything major."
11094,"I got this for free so , thumbs up!"
11095,Pretty cool game. The only thing that has me upset is signing up for a newsletter for free stuff and not getting it.
11096,"Good
"
11097,"Game seems well made, announcer is funny, gameplay is quick and intuitive. Reminds me a lot of the Force Arena mobile game that died not long ago, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Keep at it, there's definitely room in the space for this genre and this seems like as good a version as i've played."
11098,Pretty fun game.
11099,"Pretty fun and easy to get into, lots of rewards early into the game to get that sweet sweet dopamine. Hopefully that doesnt change too much as you progress and the microtransactions might become pay to win as you advance but i havent seen it in the first 10 levels."
11100,"It has balancing issues. You either get rolled, or you are doing the rolling. No middle ground. I find it a waste of time."
11101,after playing 5 games it is cool but idk if i have to pay for them to became a good player thats what i hate in free games but will see
11102,fun game
11103,ya
11104,very nice game..worth to play ..easy and fast :D..recommended
11105,"The game's pretty good. Vast variety of units as well as fluid gameplay, with different maps & good art style. It's highly addicting. My only complaint would be the visual/graphics optimization for MacOS- even on a latest Macbook Pro it can struggle on medium setting."
11106,It's excellent
11107,GREAT GAME!!
11108,"It's fun, addictive, easy to learn, but hard to master. Each match doesn't take too much time, so if you are having a bad match, then you can quickly move to the next one and forget about previous one. Also this game is free to play, so you can at least try it, which I strongly suggest. And development team behind the game is supportive and kind as well. Final verdict - 10 out of 10 stars."
11109,It's a fun game. It's free. It's very easy to build competitive decks. Give it a try.
11110,Fun as game :)
11111,"cum on guys, enough with the gay jokes"
11112,Krappa123
11113,Not bad..Awesome
11114,Its interesting its sorta like other games ive played its easy but it also has allot of dynamics
11115,enjoying this game so far
11116,cool game so far
11117,"pretty fun game, gonna be playing for a while"
11118,"Hi

I got this game as present from a friend of mine. Because it is not the type of game that I usually play I was reluctant to even try.
Man! biggest mistake ever. I love this game. I`m hooked.
Highly recommended."
11119,"TL/DR (TL/DR should be at the beginning of a comment)
Really fun and cool game design BUT - Bad connection issues and loot boxes mean I can't recommend it.




Now, I got this game for free, and I like it. I've only played 5 hours of it, but I've quite enjoyed those five hours.

Concept is great, design is fun and cool, game play makes sense and is tactfully engaging.  For the most part, it's pretty great.

However, I cannot recommend this game unless you get it for free, due to two primary reasons.

Firstly: Connection issues are atrocious. I frequently play video games with my brother in England, and I'm west coast USA, and we never have connection issues.  But on this game, I'm disconnected from the servers, mid duel and everything, almost every 5-10 minutes. I have no idea why, but it's game breaking.

Secondly:  Loot boxes.  I can never recommend a game, on principle, if it has any form of loot boxes.  You can grind up resources to craft new cards, or spend in game gold to get an assortment of cards which you spin and get a random one or, of course, you can just buy the loot boxes or straight up buy the better stuff in game."
11120,fun and amazing
11121,good game
11122,Good and addicting
11123,"Amazing game, kept me going on. Will recommend."
11124,super fun simple but still complex
11125,I like that it keeps your interest and is free as a fart
11126,"I love these kinds of games and the fact that it's free with twitch integration  is genius
"
11127,Fun! Very good!
11128,"It's a pretty and fun game. Get's you right in the action. Select the right card, know when to play your card and you'll have a blast playing this fun free game!"
11129,Mwah
11130,it is easy and fun to learn.
11131,"Warcraft 3's Castle Wars turned into an actual game. 

Really fun, super addictive."
11132,COMPLETELY BADASS!!
11133,"For a free to play game, this is too good."
11134,"It's a solid game, but nothing special. Played for 5 hours and i don't have the feeling i'm going to play again."
11135,great game
11136,Excellent Game... I didnt think I would like this type of game but it hooked me very fast. Everyone who's reading this please try it
11137,basically clash royale (in a good way)
11138,"The game is going down quick and the devs are masking bots to lower que times.  Not working, pretty easy to tell a bot from a human.  And the chat mods are the worst ever, they ban you with no warning on a whim.  Not recommended."
11139,"Pretty fun game, would recommend"
11140,Dope game. Give it a go!
11141,"Fantastic game so far, been really fun and honestly well designed. I look forward to seeing what else they implement but so far there's a decent amount. I feel like the only thing that i would like to see an improvement of is more synergy with cards."
11142,Pretty gamer
11143,the best game ever
11144,its just fun to jump in and have a game fast. easy to pick up and cool graphics
11145,It's great!
11146,"what can i say, pc clash royale but its actually pretyy good?"
11147,epic
11148,Minimal skill for strategy required drop your minions and have fun!
11149,"GG
7/10"
11150,"Its a fun card based game 
"
11151,"fuzão de clash royale com hearthstone bem bolada, e otimizada"
11152,yes
11153,i love CCG and this is the same very fun =D
11154,Awesome game!!! I didn't expect to like it so much though. Hope you guys keep up the good work!
11155,decent game not far enough to know wether its pay to win. very similar layout to alot of mobile games basically feels like an expanded mobile game.
11156,gg
11157,hey thats pretty good
11158,Well thought and fast. Need to invest a bit more time to understand the game fully.
11159,"it is fun and i can play with my friends and it is free to play
"
11160,"EDIT: I have literally uninstalled and re-installed this game 15 times over the years hoping it would be better. Same game. Same experience. The layers of RNG make it impossible to feel any sense of accomplishment even when you win. You either go on winning streak or a losing streak and it all seems like luck.

EDIT: 5th reinstall. Yes I have uninstalled and re-installed this game FIVE times now. Still the same feeling of random luck (good or bad). I can not suggest this. BUT it is free, so try and see if you agree or disagree.

EDIT: 4th reinstall. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 4 times now to make sure I wasn't missing something. At 50ish hours of gameplay I can say the feeling that something is not right with this game persists. The overall feeling it leaves is frustration. I like games that I can figure out and 'master' and stay consistent, so I know what game experience I am going to have. With this game I may have a 15 game win streak or a 15 game losing streak and either one feels like luck. That is the worst part of it. It feels like so much randomness and luck is going on. My feeling after a 1 hour session on this game is FRUSTRATION and absence of fun. I can not suggest this.  

First Review: First ten hours or so is ok. But after you reach gold rank the game starts to feel like either pure luck or pay to win. The lack of a sense of balance combined with heavy sense of pay to win or luck(RNG) robs the game of all fun. But it is free and the dev is generous with free items and codes. Just don't expect a lot from this game. Sorry.

EDIT Second Review: I played another 10 hours, and it is as I suspected. Get Morellia if nothing else and you will win many more games. When 1 master makes that much difference, then the game feels pay to win, even if the devs did not intend it.

EDIT Third Review: I uninstalled this game twice before, but decided to try again to give a very fair review. I  feel I have enough hours and experience to give a fair review. There is a strong feeling of three things going on at the same time...unbalanced gameplay, RNG, and Pay to Win. Sorry, this is my honest experience. I bought Morellia with rubies and won a ton more games, but the sense of randomness and lack of balance along with a pay to win vibe really makes me have a sense of 'no joy or accomplishment' with this game. Look at the steam charts. Thousands and thousands of people come in on these 'free weekends' and they do not stay."
11161,"Honestly, I only played this game since they gave free DLC out for a couple of days and then some more with Twitch prime.

But so far I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit, it feels like autochess meets hearthstone."
11162,"fun for casual & pro players; both solo & team play. DLC not to costly; easy to learn, hard to master type of game"
11163,"Good amount of strategy, but still simple enough to pick up and go. Excellent pay model."
11164,"This game is hella dope. Super fast match making, quick paced games, super cool characters, and awesome spells. 10/10 would recommend."
11165,nice game.
11166,Beside a little poor optimization(rtx goes to 79C) the game looks and feel good
11167,not bad realy not bad
11168,OP!
11169,"I really enjoy this game, it feels like clash royale but way better."
11170,"I recommend as it seems pretty fun when you start playing it... then it halts to the point that either you spend money or you just wait, and playing a lot of games does not help at all and will only irritate you because there comes a time that all players you encounter spent a lot of money to have the best cards and masters (like the Morellia OP).

In overall if free I recommend it, if you are paying for it just go play something that really keeps you there without having to spend more and more."
11171,Fun game.
11172,"A nice twist on the whole ""card game"" genre, just wish there was more diversity."
11173,Clash Royale on the PC with better graphics. The F2P aspect of it does not seem to be P2W... at least not yet.
11174,"balanced so far from what i can tell
"
11175,It's a fun little game and it's easy to learn.
11176,"Pretty fun so far
"
11177,"Very cute game similar to clash royale, easy to learn and tons of free rewards!"
11178,"Interesting game, it's very similar to clash royale on mobile devices. The difference is that this is much more in depth, and the card unlocking seems more controlled in this game. So you don't have to just hope that you get a certain card based upon luck. There's lots of cool mechanics, including fighting at the bridge to keep the game interesting."
11179,:)
11180,Fun and quick matches with lot of different cards.
11181,just started so far quite enjoyable... :)
11182,"This game is great, but if your ally doesn't connect, you lose MMR and winstreak.
Until this is fixed, can't recommend because that is very irritating"
11183,Great Game!!
11184,Excellent and wonderful game......thanks Steam
11185,a good clash royale style game so far!
11186,Gut
11187,COOL AND FREE :D
11188,i love this game. so much fun.
11189,good game!!
11190,"If you like pay to win deck building games, this is for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and stay away. It is too imbalanced without paying money."
11191,"Yeah, fuck this pay2win BS."
11192,Great and unique game. The game is quite hard to grasp at first as there's much going on. but the game as a concept isn't something complex and somehow reminds me of TFT.
11193,"the better clash royale 
"
11194,"Very simple and easy to play, yet very fun! Great game to enjoy with your friends or just solo. Love it thus far, I can assure you´ll have the same opinion."
11195,Like card game 'hearthstone' but the minion actually move.
11196,"If you like Clash Royale and are looking for a PC equal this will not disappoint. From the makers of Forced, another game I love, I was happy to jump in and try this. Well, it's a ton of fun. Not Pay to Win but pay for convenience, even less so than Clash because there are not really card lvls. You just have to unlock a card and you can use it as an equal to a top player."
11197,"Good action, best parts of deck builders and competitive arena games"
11198,"Great game

Edit:for my achievement"
11199,Awesome game. It has lots of rewards and lots of stuff to do. It's not just mainstream 1v1 which makes it super fun.
11200,trash
11201,"Simple fun, even better with a friend!"
11202,REALLY FUN! EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!
11203,"I enjoy this game, it is great that they offer it free and I have not felt overly pressured to pay for the content which is a major turn off with many free to play games. However, I am only level 10 thus far. I feel it is a fun little game definitely worth a try."
11204,FAST PACED AND FUN. sO FAR SO GOOD
11205,nice game but it looks a little bit like clash royale
11206,This is some gang shit
11207,cool
11208,yes
11209,easy moba to jump into games arent too long and character designs are awesome
11210,"Nice game to waste some time playing. 

Fair F2P model, at 30 hours I got most of the stuff that I wanted to get without paying at all. The game has Draft mode and free weekly characters so you can test cards and characters to see if you want to get them with your resources. 

Starting a match takes very little time (queue time around 15 seconds)
"
11211,buggy game
11212,"there is no minions.
2/10"
11213,"Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click Click 

YES! That was intense.

*Find new match*

11214,"Awesome game, i got it for free & was not expecting it to be this darn good!! Love the concept reminds me of Clash Royale on mobile portal. Download now it's free. Early day's for the game, there is some balancing issue's but not a game breaker at all. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT"
11215,It's a surprisingly addicting game to  be honest. 9/10 Highly recommend it.
11216,"Easy to understand, hard to master. Very fun game!"
11217,This game is like a better version of Clash Royal and can be pretty quick depending on what mode you play.
11218,"At the beggining game is p2w. You can get minions faster with money, BUT you can still get all of them by just playing contionusly. After some playin I have come to some conclusions.

There is that ravager. At 3rd stage it gives that big daddy TERROR BRUTUS 2k hp helper. HP should be decreased, if both of masters are ravagers. It is kinda hard to push them back. Against your team comes basicly a 4k hp moving wall. 

Scrat minions are unbalanced. Can swarm wayyy too much. Good thing that there is area damage minions, but mana cost of them are a bit too high. Soo it is hard to counter those scrat swarms. Specialy in team battles.

Elf minions. Most useless minions in game. They need 6 or more mana to get attack speed. If it would be decreased to 4, it would make Elfs more usefull. 

In SOLO mode it is hard to get balanced game, cause or you keep swarming those scrats and low mana minions or you try to keep your base protected with more mana expensive minions. In the end still wins player with swarming.

I like that idea of big ammount of expiernce. Cause of psychology. It make players feel more addictive, when they see big numbers coming in.

Like a use of gold you get - can buy tokens or some random stuff in shop. From tokens can sometimes get some decent minion."
11219,"Good Game, it's on my top 5 games to play right now."
11220,"I would only play the game if you have no intention of spending money on it. I played for free for quite awhile and decided to throw 25 bucks at the game because I appreciate{d} the developers and wanted to see what the return would be. What I saw was HORRIFIC. Of the literally 30+spins I got in return from $25, every single one was a common or uncommon card. 20+ season tokens and not a single rare. Either I have the worst luck ever known, or the developers are greedy as all hell. Not even Clash of clans was this bad. After seeing how terrible the draws can be with no real gaurntee of getting anything decent even in suck a large amount of tries, I would never put money towards the game again until the odds have been balanced.
Still going to reccomend because the game is fun but this needs to be fixed badly."
11221,Fun game
11222,its good
11223,Fun chill
11224,Unadulaterated fun!
11225,.
11226,love the game
11227,"Total scam, tried getting the DLC WHEN it was free and still tried to make me pay. Bad practice for a good game. Not going to support devs that think it is ok to false advertise.

UPDATE: Thought to gave game another chance. fot the ""FREE"" DLC on steam. logged onto game after updating a few days later and it took the DLC away from me.  I am sadly not surprised. This game does everything it can to attract players and doesn't even care if it keeps its promises."
11228,I love this game :) keep wooping on me please lol
11229,fun addicting and easy
11230,"I have never liked this genre, now i do like it.

I think that means something... 

Search codes online to get a ton of free content.

Devs seems cool, gameplay is original in PC."
11231,"Great look and feel. Fun and easy to learn. I was looking for something new and really lucked out trying this game. I would recommend others to at least give it a try. 
"
11232,variety and multiple strategies to win. also team play is enjoyable
11233,It's simple and fun. The reward system so far has been satisfying and I like the various card monsters and style designs. I haven't gotten much into crafting or leveling up cards but that seems like an interesting element that seems worth investing some time into.
11234,"If it doesn't look fun...it is. If it does look fun, it really is."
11235,issa goodsa game
11236,cool beans
11237,so far  its a bunch of fun. a lot like clash royal just a lot cooler sense its on the computer and a bunch more options :)
11238,ye
11239,"Game is a little bit copying fortnite with the battle pass and shop, but other than that its great!"
11240,Decently fun
11241,"Neat game, I like it"
11242,I started playing this in Beta. Just came back to it and it is a lot of fun. It's like if MTG and Hearthstone had a fast-paced baby.
11243,nicenice fun free game :)
11244,Great game so far cant wait to see where it goes
11245,"Deck-building Tower defense with minions on a half-court.  Relatively balanced gameplay that makes you want to amass a themed army, put your own twist on it, and Destroy your opponent!"
11246,Great game reminds me of Clash Royal
11247,The game is like clash royal but better
11248,"Fun, quick games. Enjoying it so far."
11249,"fun game, quickly games. I like it."
11250,pretty good game. low hard drive usage but good resolution. pretty much an upgrade to ALL magic/hearthstone card games out there. solo and (random) co-op battles are fast time find 5-10 seconds. can play with only the mouse which is nice while baby sits on my lap.
11251,extremely fun with friends and challenging while rewarding all at the same time :)
11252,I like it for its holographic style
11253,FUN GAME
11254,"Cool game I like the non pay to play, the cards art is well done and is really fun. Keep it up :)
"
11255,Super Fun!
11256,This Game Rocks!!!!!!
11257,awesome game. taking the best idea from various different genre.
11258,this game sucks
11259,Fun free game.  Quick queues and also has npc challenges too.
11260,nice
11261,Clash Royale but better and more complex
11262,"Fun gameplay, especially in 2v2. If you've played Clash Royale, you'll know how to stomp noobs. As an added bonus, the developers do not treat you like an a$$-hat."
11263,It's pretty good!
11264,Simple yet engaging and fun
11265,Guud stuff
11266,Fun game!
11267,"great game, i recommend!"
11268,I enjoy the team battles the most it is a fun and entertaining game.
11269,Great and interesting game.
11270,great game. got addicted after playing for 20 minutes
11271,brooooo. epic
11272,awesome graphics & fun 2 play so far. i hope it gets more popular. (been playing for 5 hours straight)
11273,Quick fun matches with room to flesh out neat builds.
11274,ncie
11275,"Has problems with bots and hackers.
There are bots with urls as names,
which are very boring fights,
which you usually win.

And games with hackers,
where your match suddenly starts lagging,
when you are winning and only on this match.
The ones before and after are perfectly fine."
11276,I LIKE WINNNING
11277,great game so far plenty fun
11278,An animated card game that has great rewards.
11279,"the game is alot of fun, with tons of different cards. recommend you to play this :D"
11280,i like it
11281,a good game with easy learning but hard to master
11282,:D
11283,"pretty interesting game, the skrats look awful but everything else looks pretty good. I'm enjoying the 2v2 way more than the 1v1, because 1v1 feels as though it has too much variance"
11284,"
Very fun"
11285,chill game and fun to play
11286,"Game's pretty solid, so far! Been playing for a brief amount of time and it's sucked me in. Already dropped $20 on the game. Though, I'm not quite sure what the benefit was.. but eh, whatever. I'm sure that I'll figure that out later. Games have been fun, except I just lost my first game because my teammate decided to disconnect right as the match began. Pretty disappointing. :/"
11287,"Good game.

Easy to learn,fun to play, i think its worth a try given its free."
11288,IM SICK OF trying to fix this shit why i can not play the game from Iran even with VPN or DNS its just painful
11289,good game
11290,"Fun so far, just need to judge how P2W it is. Give it a try,"
11291,nice
11292,"First steam game to ask me to review it, like a phone app.

That being said, played for less than an hour so far so good.

I like the point of the exp, so the enemy cant stall out when you hit the mana storm, eventually you can just spam enough senselessly you will win if you have had the upper-hand all game."
11293,"Take Clash Royale and Hearthstone without PAY TO WIN and you get this masterpiece. Beautiful graphics, music, and card design. Seriously a game I feel I could binge for a long time, but also play casually when I have a spare moment."
11294,Excelente juego casual. Para pasarla bien y usar un poco la cabeza
11295,Fun AF! And rewarding too for pure F2P player like me!
11296,i iove thes game
11297,AMAZING GAME
11298,"This is a tower wars CCG where you duel other players with the goal of reducing the enemy master's HP to zero before the same thing happens to yours. Mana slowly regenerates and you play cards from your hand to summon minions to attack the enemy master and his minions, all in real time leading to pretty hectic gameplay where most of the time you'll just end up randomly playing whatever cards become available without strategizing. You start with one free master and either pay or grind a ridiculously long time to unlock the rest, as usual with any free-to-play game with microtransactions. The cast of playable characters are pretty uninteresting, there are only 2 ladies of moderate sexiness so don't expect any fanservice here.

There is a decent variety of cards but most of the powerful cards are locked behind gacha RNG or have to be crafted for huge amounts of materials. There are a couple of AI challenges but this game is focused mainly on PvP, which leads to all the usual nastiness such as unbalanced cards, pay-to-win OP masters, leavers and trolls.

Update: With the release of The Quest for Mountainshaper DLC, there is a singleplayer campaign included. Unfortunately, to actually access the singleplayer campaign, you first have to reach player level 11 and that requires winning lots of PvP matches which is pretty much impossible unless you spend ridiculous amounts of cash to be on equal footing with whales."
11299,Clash Royale for PC.
11300,fun
11301,fun game work to build up your army
11302,"Only played it for a bit at the time of this review. Pretty impressed with it so far. A nice balance of strategy and for a free to play game, no strong ""pay to win"" feeling. Every studio needs to make money, but it is a nice change not having micro transactions shoved in your face every 5 minutes. Recommend checking this game out if you are interested in a relatively simple, easy to learn strategy game."
11303,"Good tutorial, easy to understand game mechanics and fast game quene."
11304,"As someone who is typically not into card games or MOBAs, there is a strange satisfaction in Minion Masters. Simple, easy to understand, and immediately gratifying. Be sure to check out https://www.reddit.com/r/MinionMasters/comments/cf5elw/codes_for_new_and_old_players_to_gain_a_massive/  for rewarrds."
11305,Intreresting.
11306,Fun so far
11307,Fun game. Love to play <3
11308,Nice quick action and strategy
11309,nice !!
11310,nice
11311,good
11312,LIKE CLASH ROYALE ITS FUN THO
11313,"pretty nice, friendly UI, friendly play mode, hope that I can play longer than other games."
11314,"Minion Masters has a really slick design, active creator engagement, and showers of rewards. The matches last somewhere between 2 and 7 minutes and focus on tactics in a unique way. Definitely worth trying out to see for yourself if you have the $0 to spare."
11315,awesome game its to much fun
11316,good game
11317,"Smooth pace, interesting monsters, well balanced powers and a simple UI!"
11318,So far so good!
11319,Damn what agreat game.
11320,really good game - a bit like clash royal but way more advanced and fun to play.
11321,"only at level 10 but it has been so far and would be fun to play against friends.
"
11322,Its really fun to play if you are looking for some good time off CSGO or anything with a lot of concentration
11323,"The gameplay is very fun and addicting but constant bugs kill the thrill
Random crashes
Random server disconnection

Still im giving a good review because I have hope for this game"
11324,amazing free game
11325,Great game
11326,fun
11327,Shits fun yo
11328,"this game is so fun
"
11329,Game looks great but i only played it once because every time i try to play a match 1v1 or 2v2 it just lags sometimes my enemy doesnt do anything so i win even tho im lagging but when i try playing other games connection is fine.
11330,gg
11331,<3 Still good 100 hours later
11332,YEET Minion
11333,"Great experience, maybe a little bit kiddish, but still really fun and I would definitely recommend this game if you like strategy games and a game that keeps you wanting to play it."
11334,"One of the worst games I have ever come across. I have played mobile games made by Konami that were less pay to win than this.

 EA, Ubisoft, Activision...here is were you can learn bad game design. Unbalanced cards, unfair matchmaking against the same five opponents 20 times in a row, full with bots, nonsensical gamemodes, undoable goals, bad community management, horrible performance...and if you think it gets better? I was Master3...it doesn´t."
11335,VERY FUN INOVATIVE GAME
11336,"It's fast, it's fun, it's clash royale but without the p2w."
11337,Fun FTP tower defense MOBA team play goodness!
11338,enjoying the game so far
11339,"Super addicting, loads of fun."
11340,Gg
11341,"If anyone has ever wished for hearthstone to become a board-like game, it would look like Minion Masters. Even though it's quite raw in terms of characters, and the number of minion cards. The game is still very much enjoyable and is definitely very addicting."
11342,"Fun :D 
"
11343,Game is light and fast paced. Variety of minions that ensures interesting combination for every game
11344,"interesting and simple game, also isn't too complicated which it simplifies starting and most of all its pretty fun"
11345,"I am actually shocked, how much I enjoy this one."
11346,"It's been a fun tug of war game, where it's fairly easy, and it has enough stratagy to be fun"
11347,GAME IS super dope!
11348,"this game is great, really easy to get into, UI is very user friendly, and best of all i can play with a friend"
11349,ok
11350,"its a moderate game, has the vibes of clash royale"
11351,"Well I liked LoL for a bit, but I actually like this a lot better, I find it very awesome."
11352,fun game
11353,Playing together with my husband and he's teaching me the value of each card and how to understand them. We are putting our strategies together in battle
11354,Better than Hearthstone
11355,This is so much fun.  I've played similar games but the graphics and game play on this PC game is fantastic.  5 Stars.
11356,"Fun, easy game to understand and quick to play."
11357,"This game integrates Hearthstones like cards with Clash Royale like gameplay. If you enjoy those two games like I do, then this will be a great game for you."
11358,"its good
"
11359,very good game
11360,"Good game, hope more people to play it =D"
11361,"Really fun. Matches are typically quite short, around 3-5 minutes long, with the longer ones reaching 7-8 minutes at most, so far. Makes for a great game to play when you only have a little time, or if you may frequently need to AFK. Has some fun additional modes."
11362,puff cute
11363,i like it ^_^
11364,solid game
11365,"Fun overall... I love the concept of deck-building with MOBA/RTS style game mechanics. An interesting mix I haven't seen explored in other games.

The game is f2p but definitely not p2w. More like ""pay to unlock things faster"". Everything can be unlocked through grinding. However, the devs are pretty generous with giving out freebie codes for cards, tokens, gold, etc. A quick google search or two and you will find plenty of codes to use.

Definitely worth checking out considering the game is free and each match only lasts 2-3 minutes."
11366,"This game is front for something shady.  It crashed on my first online match.  When it finally died, Alt F4 did nothing Ctrl Alt Del did nothing, I had 7 new Windows file browsing windows open as well as a message that it tried to install a chrome plugin. Uninstalled immediately.  -1/10 WTH."
11367,"For only playing the game for maybe an hour, the game is easy to grasp! Friendly tutorial, great VO for assistance, colorful characters, the game is easy to flow into."
11368,good
11369,"Somebody spent time on this game, it looks cool and feels cool. Thank you!"
11370,so far so good
11371,"I like this one over games like TFT, since, well, first of all it's not borderline slave trading and purely automated combat. You don't buy someone, send them to fight to their death, and the sell them when they're no longer useful to you anymore. You get units, and keep them. You can choose where to place them on the battlefield, and also upgrade them (although I'm not sure how impactful it is since I just started playing).
Matchmaking is quick and smooth, no lags or delay in it. I can't argue when something f2p is good like this game is!"
11372,"<3
"
11373,Great game to play with friends. No complaints so far.
11374,fun
11375,"this is a nice quick game I can play multiple instances of, and it's centered around a unique concept. The art is also very well done."
11376,"this reminds me of WC3 custom games, i believe Tower line wars or something it was called but it's fun to upgrade units and build a deck of your own army and test and play it out."
11377,Awesome game!
11378,"Decent vs game, similiar to hearthstone with animated minions instead of cards"
11379,Cool game.I got it yesterday and i'm already liking it
11380,Addicting and fun game.
11381,Cool game
11382,"I like this game, very comfortable."
11383,"awesome fun game, game looks good , good way of introducing features, good for quick games"
11384,"Very fun, More for people that has good stratgey. I recommend."
11385,Immediate and fun! Great free to play game.
11386,Is good
11387,"This game is so much fun, it's even better with a friend :)"
11388,"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel, normal game.. cant say is perfect becouse, on platinum 1-2 its starts to be pay to win... or just ruin ur life to farm cards, you will see some enemies... wich will currupt ur 8 mana hero, or even ur Dragon... with just one cheap spell, why? becouse they can, or some monsters you just CANT easy defeat them... you will put all ur mana to stop them... while enemie spare mana... adn will send more of powerfull monsters... doesnt matter ur tatctic..... they just HAVE THEM, cheap strong cards... that you cant have as player who just playing 8-10 games per day... yes is not alot one match is like a 4-6 minutes. but Still you cant go higher then Platinum 1-2 just if u want to play to lose... do it, becouse here... fun is only untill platinum 1-2, only till that rank you have 50% 50% to win.. with enemies with same rank of cards like you. I was wondering why so nice game... is not poppular.... , now i see why."
11389,"so far, so good"
11390,"Is it a cards game? A MOBA? Tactics? Tower defense?

Honestly it`s  a bit of all , pretty addictive, fast paced action (Unlike HS) .

As with all F2P , there is a lot of in game currency, but it does not feel necessary to get all the best cards or heroes to win 

Give it a try, it is free after all."
11391,Nie te kak nie
11392,"nice game happy to play
"
11393,"Simply loving it! It's just an overall great experience. The ingame purchases are very cheap and I'm just flashed by the sheer quality of the game. 10/9

edit: the constant emails are annoying af. best unsub to the newsletter"
11394,"This game is great, i'm 2 hours deep and i do not want to stop.

100% great.
"
11395,Fun so far!
11396,"I've only got about an hour into the game so far, but I'm finding this quite fun. Quick easy battles, nice matchups, decent graphics. Seems to be a good card game so far!"
11397,"well its like these old days browser games but pvp and with $ lootboxes 

if you liked these kind of ""unit send base attack"" games in your browser you prob will like this too

+++for the trailer and artwork and style - its funny"
11398,Its well done.. It would be nice to know if DLC's also works for mac version.
11399,"Addictive game i never play these style of games but it most certainly is a good game i recived it for free and now i wont regret it love it
"
11400,"I am so glad i found this game...I have literaly had no idea what is this i just saw it free and whoala it is super amazing ad fun...Animations are so pleasing,and the best thing about the game is simplicity...Summoning minions and enjoy the scenes on battlefield,and you canrelax with it also...lay down with mouse and nothing else...GREAT GAME...Please Add more cards and heroes in future make it even better :D"
11401,"enjoying the game so far, its more fun that I first expected."
11402,Its just good clean quick fun!
11403,"fun to play!
easy to learn!
i am just enjoying this"
11404,If you play anything like Clash Royale on mobile youll really enjoy this game.
11405,its clash for PC. its actually really fun and well made. got it while it was free
11406,"Played for 10 hours, won most of my matches, say around 75%. However, I only acquired a few hundred shards. It takes 1500 shards just for me to buy a Master (stuck with one of the free ones that are on rotation). You can't deconstruct your unused cards in this game either, which makes it take even longer to build what you want. This makes every single loss feel like it's because I'm not willing to spend, regardless if true or not."
11407,Very good game
11408,"Just downloaded it for the strategy. But then found myself giggling at the descriptions of the cards. Then I kinda enjoyed the team battles, and the new cards and on and on. 
The game in quite easy to visually process, not complicated to figure out, plus it's lovely how it combined some cuteness with a little blood and gore. So yea, thumbs up."
11409,good game
11410,Nice
11411,"I am a huge Magic the Gathering fan, and I know there are 3d games like it, but not as fun. Minion Masters gets addicting fast. The live combat, multiple minions to choose from, and upgradable units Ive seen before on a card game which sadly closed. This system is great and nice to enjoy to see again, but with the added perk of 3D interface. The only thing I did not like was the narration guy- but I think I can overlook that for the fun element. :)     Great game- try it out!"
11412,"Lots of fun and a somewhat casual aspect to the game really makes me wanna play more, while still having strategy to the game so it doesn't get boring"
11413,Its easy and fun
11414,The game is pretty easy to learn and play.  It is really enjoyable for people who like deck building games.
11415,"It is basically the normal Clash Royale most people enjoy (not much myself, to be honest), but better and much more unique than Clash Royale, in my opinion. Definitely would recommend to anyone."
11416,Fun little game!
11417,pretty good
11418,"so many chests, pc version of clash royale"
11419,"I think this is one of the new fresh game mode, other side of RPG, Moba and etc. Im enjoy this game so far, because its new and I think you should try it too!"
11420,so fun and easy to learn
11421,"1. Looks simple but there is a learning curve
2. No play to win so win or lose, no sadness, always fun.
3. Looks good, cute, awesome!

When I just want to relax and play from my laptop, this is a good option."
11422,It's great!
11423,Great game besides the stupid connection issues and the issue where some error appears saying something about unowned cards (team battle) so you lose the match before it starts and lose points for no reason or because of some other fucktwit.

11473,"Allot of fun, the heroes and units are very unique and varied"
11474,"Had a ton of fun playing this games, as you can see I spent 10+ hours in two days as soon as I downloaded this game. Though as always they will always be pros and cons since they're is no perfect game.

So the pros for this game is the fact that it is very simple. Easy to learn but hard to master. Fun. Challenging (To some extent). Cool looking characters and cards. Quick for a match to finish.

Cons? Well first of all the connection, I'm literally in front of my router and it just says that I disconnected from the match which basically frick up my rank. The unbalance especially those annoying Arrow Dude Guild.

That's all for me honestly. Give this gave a chance and review bout it so the devs can polish this rough diamond to a near perfect one."
11475,Really fun game ;)
11476,"Great game, thanks"

11484,"Minion Masters is a streamlined card game that has some autochess elements in that your monsters are 3D creatures that actually fight. 

[b]Gameplay[/b]
You always have 4 cards in your hands, restricted only by their mana costs. That's 4 cards out of a 10 cards but you don't run our of cards. You gain mana automatically, faster as the match progresses. That means playing high cost cards early is a risky strategy since it will leave you mana-less, if your opponent can counter your high cost card with a much lower cost card they'll have more mana than you thus will be able to play more cards than you. The game ends when one side's master tower's health is reduced to zero. Towers are defended by hero characters called masters, each have different attack styles and abilities. Every one of them gets 3 abilities that unlock throughout the match by gaining experience. Experience is gained passively but you can gain it faster by capturing the bridges seperating the two fields. These abilities are usually game changers, 98% of the time the side with the better bridge control wins the match.

[b]The Good[/b]
Games are paced just right for this kind o streamlined approach. Matches last 4-8 minutes, it's non-stop action all the way. The 3d monster fighting element gives an extra layer of strategy to a card game since better positioning can overcome statistical disadvantages. It's also just more fun to see your cards come to life as opposed to just float and hit the other cards like in Hearthstone. The 2v2 mode is really fun. Masters and their abilities make the game more insteresting. Even though this is a game where you have to unlock cards using in game currency, I found the system to be very generous towards free players in that I've unlocked all the cards and masters I wanted using nothing but the currency I earned from playing the game. The DLCs seems to be cheap and they also give them away for free at release if you grab it then. Consdering this is a free to play competitive card game and how bad they can get with being money vampires, I was pleasently suprised by this games fair attitude.

[b]The Bad[/b]
Like all competitive games the balance is really skewed towards somethings over the others. There are some cards and masters in this game that are utter trash and some that are clearly essential. You will see the same cards over and over again. This limits the number of vaible strategies a bit. There are balance changes every once in a while but to be perfectly honest I haven't seen any changes that made a significant difference.

[b]The Ugly[/b]
This game has framerate and lag issues, disconnects and crashes. This is a fast paced game with short matches to even if you lose only 30 seconds to a disconnects that might just be it, you won't recover from that. The player count is low, the developers are focused on increasing that, this might explain why this game is so generous with everything, but the fundemental tecnical problems need to be addressed too.

[b]The Takeaway[/b]
You just at least try out Minion Masters. This is a fun and unique game. It cuts out the bullshit and just gives you the fun parts. Also, there are like a thousand card battles out there but how many of them do the your cards are alive Yu-Gi-Oh! thing. Not even Yu-Gi-Oh! games do that. Come on, make more of this stuff game developers."
11485,Is fun. Like Minions. Many kill stuff.
11486,fun casual game

game is fun, no toxicity - emoticons only.
1-6 min per fight, 1-20 seconds queue, 
11 heroes with their deck. 10 cards per deck.

11502,Fucking great game!!! it feel like some brain use but funny
11503,It's fun.
11504,It's a very easy and fun game! the graphics are nice and the gameplay is awesome!
11505,Elf hoes surrounding me 10/10. Needs more elf booty.
11506,"Всё супер, я уже почти мастер всех миньёнов"
11507,Same base game as Clash Royale but they put a spin on it. Heroes that change your playstyle your deck. Seems to have a bit more content then other similiar games. My problem is balance. Some of the units just seem way too overpowered. Legendarys are my biggest problem some of them just do way too much for the cost and can counter so much stuff but you cant really counter that unit except you have a deck to counter that one specific unit. All in all i would say give it a try its stilll good to play but i need more balance changes
11508,"So far very fun. Pleasing to the eye, quite funny . Seems very strategic while rng seem to play minimal role, so already better than HS.I only hope that they wont go full greed like HS did. High hopes for this one. So far its a blast."

11515,This game is awesome. same concept like Clash Royale on iOS and android but better
11516,"CLASH ROYALE FOR PC!?!?, ew no.."
11517,challenging but not to challenging
11518,"Sadly, it is simply a clash royale copy with chests to unlock and many characters to play.. Just like in the mobile game from supercell. I am glad that I had a look at it when it was possible to get it for 100% off and keep forever as 12,50€ (at the time of writing) would just have been way to high. One can clearly see that the troops that can be placed in the game are just straight copies from clash royale and are just covered in higher textures and in a less ""cartoony way"". Bad copy of an existing game sold for an exorbitant price. Try it for free if you can to make your own oppinion but do not buy it if the promotion is over. It is just a scam in my eyes.."

11541,"Similar to the mobile game called Clash Royale. The art style is more interesting and better looking though. And most importantly the amount of different cards is significantly bigger than compared to the mobile game. There are endless amounts of possible decks and strategies, so looks like you won't get bored easily. Also not p2w at all. After first moments of playing, I'm now totally hooked."
11542,Play this game. It fun!

11565,SEEMS LIKE A GREAT GAME SO FAR LEVELS UP QUICK AND VERY ENJOYABLE-STONEY
11566,"Fun at first, then the constant diconnects in fights makes you loose games, when your teammate disconnects in teambattles you instantly loose the game. The game quickly becomes grindy in a bad way and I also feel the businessmodel is way too greedy with lots of micropurchases. Btw, this thing that they call a ""free DLC"" it's more of a free micropurchase..."
11567,lots of fun!! love it
11568,Sucked me in right from the start. Very entertaining played about 4 hours my first go at it.
11569,"Lowkey super fun and not irritating, it asks you to still make a synergistic team but doesn't do it in such a demanding 3,000 IQ way. I'm glad I found this game."
11570,"Having a blast so far, reminds me of a few mods from the olden days of Warcraft 3"
11571,"Being a novice card game player I find the alliances and gameplay intuitive.  The hero abilities and xp gain are a exciting element when achieved.  Of course, rolling for new and more powerful cards is rewarding at times.  I prefer a simplistic and intuitive interface and I am enjoying the game so far."
11572,"This game is awesome appealing graphics, wide range of characters with a much needed new take on the ccg genre this game will be a new favorite on my list"
11573,"First of all i thank to steam and to the free program! This game is realy awesome and entertain, if you ever played TowerDefence or other games like clash royale etc , you will realy enjoy this game, every level CHESTS, money, upgrades , team battles , i recommend it! G G!"
11574,Love it!
11575,"Amazing online card game with fantastic art style and animations.

Only downside is that without putting any real money into it you'll be left behind on new cards coming out until you grind it, which can mean you'll lose more matches after big updates until you figure out new ways to counter the newer cards.

Still would definitely recommend this game for anyone who wants a simple to play and fast paced strategic card game.

Easy to play, hard to master."
11576,"The game is fun, but:

* The server is unstable.  The game crashes on occasion.
* Sometimes wins are counted as losses.
* Players fail to join the game resulting in a loss.
* Purchases are too expensive and have a distinct advantage in play.  It's a bit of a pay-to-win model in regards to obtaining cards.

For these reasons, I can't recommend the game.

Fun for day, after that due to the above people will stop playing."
11577,"very fun easy to play and learn fast paced
"
11578,"excellent game physics (rag doll, body parts getting lopped off). The fighting is great to watch."
11579,Pretty darn fun
11580,Tastes Great!
11581,very nice game similar to mobile game clash royale but grants much more features :)
11582,"This game is great, especially if received it for free.
Simple rules and gameplay but still fun and challenging sometimes.

The only downside is Morelia's dragon, way too OP."
11583,Nasi Uduk Is The Best

11587,Fun and super easy to learn and always fun to find good games you can play with a friend
11588,"Minion masters. Where to start talking about this game. This is a game that is both great, and full of problems. The game play is fairly good, and unique, and the strategy it offers, it pretty deep.  That said, once you know what you are doing, you will roll over pretty much everyone in this game. And I am not just talking about the bots.

Which brings me to the next point. Until you get to high silver, you won't even be facing real people for the most part, but you'll be facing bots. I would suggest avoiding team matches at all costs too. You will have some frustrating losses, from people being the worst players imaginable, to them leaving the match. And even if you could win that match without your teamate, it doesn't matter. It counts as an automatic loss.

To make things worse. You know how I said once you understand the game you'll just roll over everyone? Well, this is because, there are a few cards in this game, that are just so much more quality than they cost. You could say they have a ton of free value.  And once you start playing these cards, things quickly snow ball out of control. And if that wasn't bad, there are certain champions/heroes, that are just broken. Like, we are talking way more powerful than the other heroes by far. Thankfully, the champion with the bow that I believe everyone starts with, is actually one of the better heroes. Not the best, but a solid first choice.

To get an idea of how easy this game can be, a friend and I, made it to platinum in a single night, with premade teams. We maybe lost like... Twice, the entire night? Maybe.  And those that beat us, were more or less using straight counters.  Basically, a low cost deck, that spams a certain egg that explodes for massive global damage. A valid strategy, but a very annoying card.

And the game will feel like this at higher tiers of play. Just a ton of cheap tricks. You will feel as if you aren't being beat by any players skill, but more, whose cheap tricks work better? Thankfully, my trick works pretty well, but I won't be sharing it here. 

The game is still loads of fun, and more importantly, anyone can play. Just don't be surprised if you start getting upset. Just take a moment to cool off."
11589,its okay so far
11590,"could be u,r cup of tee"
11591,GOOD GAME
11592,"such a fun and creative game, really enjoy the cards as well as the spells 10/10 thank you"
11593,"good game kinda like live action magic the gathering
"
11594,"very fun and cant stop playing
"
11595,"Morellia Ruins the game, but assuming her lvl 3 gets nerfed its good."
11596,Good fun.
11597,Bad
11598,"ITs good, as soon as you can swap heros pick the red mech chick, op af"
11599,"feels pretty easy to learn, Liking it so far"
11600,It's Fun so Far but I want to see the player base after the free game wears off
11601,"simple,easy,fun"
11602,"The game isn't bad and it's not pay to win. That being said, it's VERY repetitive. I don't see the replay value in this as most matches end up being very short and identical. You can't mark it down though being free."
11603,good game
11604,"A very creative spin on the card MOBA genre! The masters all feel unique and useful in their own way for benefiting whatever deck you decide to build. The card giving (thus far) is very generous and it feels like even ""low-tier"" cards have good usage in battle. It's very easy to find matches and winning feels like it was genuinely earned with strategy, not necessarily just better cards. Even losing feels honorable in a way, like a duel and not just annihilation. The animations are all clean and the game itself just has a pleasant art style, not to mention the announcer puts an added kick of competitiveness between players as it taunts at them during stressful defends or pushes. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants something new to the generic MOBA formula, or to anyone who just wants some casual competitive card-play. This game is for everyone willing to play it, and is by far the most fun I've had in a while."
11605,Pretty good.
11606,Amazing Game!!!!
11607,Very fun quick action a real blast
11608,"Sunk a good chunk of time into the game over the last several months. Overall the game's design does more than enough to separate and elevate it from other titles in this genre, and the game's artstyle and visual splendor is all extremely satisfying and aesthetically pleasing, and really elevates the otherwise simple gameplay that comes with these types of games into something more exciting (though I'll address this later). 

There's also a variety of modes, between 1v1, 2v2, an Arena like mode similar to Hearthstone, and a few others to break up the monotony of climbing the ladder. Ranking up does feel very satisfying for the most part and can feel very rewarding. 

This game however is brought down by several things that I absolutely cannot stand in any game, ever, and I really hate that this trend is becoming more and more commonplace.

Like seemingly every other game nowadays, Minion Masters features a battle pass. I will give credit where credit is due; Minion Masters' BP is waaaaaay better than most other games. Progressing through it can be extremely quick depending on how much you've blinged out the cards in your deck (it got to the point where I'd get 3-4 ranks for every daily Battle Chest). Hell, I started the game more than halfway into Lights' Reach's run and I managed to finish the entire BP with days to spare. And from what it seems the cosmetic/vanity items are always going to show up in the shop again at some point, and the cards that come with each new BP/Season are just permanently part of the game, period. So there's no aggressive assault of FOMO being blasted in your face. 

... But it's still a fucking Battle Pass. And a Battle Pass turns what's supposed to be a recreational activity, ie; a videogame, into a fucking job, 'fair' or not. The game is still telling me to PAY IT so I can log in and play and be TOLD HOW to spend my time. On top of that is is very possible to not even be able to collect that season's cards reliably with the limited amount of Season Tokens you earn from that BP, meaning you'll have to wait til the next season for when they're added to the regular pool of Power Tokens if you're unlucky. Crafting the new cards isn't viable until you finish the BP, and those shards are better spent on blinging out your deck so you can progress the BP faster anyway. On top of that, these BPs seem to get more and more expensive with each iteration if the latest one is anything to go by. 

I genuinely hate this form of monetization. Hate it. I wish it'd stop infesting games. The game already has the 'lootbox'-y nature of Power Tokens as it is (basically a shittier version of a card pack) as well as a store with rotating stock every 24 hours, very pricey 'packs' and 'skins,' and all kinds of other shit. A Battle Pass on TOP of the frustrating storefront is just an egregious means of nickel-and-diming people to treat their game like its their fucking job. Enough already. 

Minion Masters also suffers from a lot of timegating, especially around its achievements. Daily quests are the only reliable way to earn gold in this game not counting some bigger Battle Pass tier rewards, as gold earnings from victories are actually pathetic even with the premium upgrade. However if you are offline daily quests will at least stack, and you can come back to 3 of them if you don't log in for 3 days. 

The daily 'Free Token' however does not stack while you're offline, for whatever reason. You only get the one and if you do not log in that day then it goes to waste. This wouldn't be that much of an issue however if they didn't tie a fucking achievement to Free Tokens. The highest of which requires you to open ONE HUNDRED of these. That means the earliest you can unlock this achievement is within 100 consecutive days of starting the game. This turns the game into a fucking chore for those interested in earning the cheevos, which I genuinely was at first. An achievement like this has nothing to do with doing something cool, or earning something neat, it's just straight up time gated lunacy. It's fucking stupid and it really wore down on me. My last few days with the game, having already grown so tired of it; were literally just logging in to claim my free token and then closing the game out.

Minion Masters' aesthetics can only carry it so far unfortunately. Gameplay does tend to get old very fast because of how simple it really is despite the visual excitement, and with each season it seems cards and by extension; masters (looking at you Lich Bitch) only become more and more frustrating to deal with. Balance also seems to be in a perpetual state of pure asinine fuckery. Some cards will be nerfed for seemingly no reason while other extremely problematic ones won't even be touched since day 1. The game's charm wanes very quickly. Do not expect this to be a long term PvP game to be invested in, there's just not enough going on here to warrant it. 

It's fun for a while but the negatives drag it down so hard. In my first month or so I would have recommended it, but now that I spent more time with it; absolutely not. I'm glad I waited to review this until I 100%'d it honestly."

11642,its a fun!

11650,fun game! picked it up for free and got hooked!
11651,"Like other chess battlers, but with a deck building component. Very interesting and quite fun!"
11652,Great Game
11653,"Addictive and has a level of tactics too it that goes deeper than I thought originally...

Though I do think the aggressive battle-pass system made popular by Fortnite is rammed down your throat some times."
11654,its better than clash royal at least
11655,Perfect
11656,Feels more full than the mobile games it looks like. Easy to pickup.
11657,"Not bad, like clash royale but with more personality."
11658,"Not bad, not bad at all,"
11659,"Feels like a better clash of clans
"
11660,Gud Shit
11661,Its fun and easy to enjoy.
11662,Fun.
11663,"It honestly reminds me of an old Magic the Gathering game on Xbox so the nostalgia drew me in and the similar gameplay with a focus on lane strategy has me still playing.  And its free to play
"
11664,Don't have to think too much which means I can dig it!
11665,SO FAR SO FUN!
11666,"It good for now,waiting to see what bumps I'm gonna come crashing into."
11667,Yeah
11668,Everything you wish Clash Royal was
11669,Super fun game. I didn't pay for it but after a demo I would have!
11670," I love this game, it is new and it is not bad at all. The has great graphics and great audio. It does have 1 problem, but a small one. It matches you with other players that have better cards sometimes. Overall this game is great and I have a ton of fun playing it. I hope you can try it out and see if you like it!!"
11671,Its fun:)
11672,Awesome 1v1 and 2v2 battles.
11673,This is Clash Royale without all the waiting for chests. Do like
11674,Fun game. Reminds me of a card game but you see the action.
11675,very fun!
11676,"pretty dope for a free game, relaxing and fun"
11677,This game is a blast. it does not seem like a pay to win game so far. i like all the heroes too
11678,Good quick game
11679,fun
11680,Loot box gambling garbage
11681,Great fun. Better than most of the other games that are the same.
11682,Reminds me of Clash Royal lol
11683,"im a minion master alright, imma a master of other things too if you know what i mean  ;)"
11684,"Simple but very complex, easy to be good difficult to master. Like the concept and execution."
11685,"Great humor, fun leveling, sufficient complexity."
11686,Quite a fun game but the occasional bugs are REALLY annoying. Even the in game bug reporting is broken and doesn't work.
11687,Simple and fun.
11688,This game is amazing guys I havent had this much fun in so long!
11689,Pretty fun easy to work with controls jump on it now while free
11690,Pretty FUn no issues herer
11691,zaebumba
11692,Awesome game with deck customization and easy to use features
11693,bis jetzt macht es wirklich spaß!
11694,Fun game. Not stressful. Good for relaxing if you like League of Legends but you don't like clicking 1 thousand times a minute.
11695,?Minion my grtandonson loves those little yellow bastards haha he always sleeps with his favorite miniton toys and he plays with them and t the dinner table. Wholesome game for tyoungsters devs stole lifestealer model from dota thank you
11696,"If you enjoy games like Clash Royale, you'll really enjoy this game. Makes me wonder why hi-rez cancelled Smite Arena, obviously this genre of game is doing well."
11697,hearthstone v2 if u will not pay u have to grind over 9k hours. gl
11698,This game is great in all aspects its has many units with unique ability and does not get old and repetitive
11699,"great game pay 2 win but not as bad as most pay 2 win games
"
11700,"This game is cool so far but I want to leave a more in depth review later
"
11701,"Got the game a long time ago (Closed beta I assume) and never played it as I did not expect a lot from it. Yet just recently have my friends told me about the game and that it's pretty fun, I was skeptical at first as I'm not a fan of the genre but to my suprise I've been enjoying it quite a lot."
11702,"Fun game. Fast paced, with good tutorials to bring you up to speed quickly.
"
11703,"fun fun fun more fun will keep you busy for a very long time every minute worth of my time playing 

recommend and fun game to play"
11704,fast paced action
11705,"The matches are always fun and strategic, cards are custom and the player vs player keeps up the competition. I'd say give it a try, it is fun!"
11706,"This game blew my expectations out of the water.

Great dev team, great business practices, great game."
11707,great gamejavascript:void(0)
11708,its cool for a no pressure quick game
11709,NICE GAME
11710,Having lot of fun so far.  I am not very familiar with deck building games so there is a learning curve for me personally.  I would recommend that you try it.
11711,awesome fast paced game
11712,"great strategy game, the 2v2 is really fun, they dont explain much about the currency and upgrading cards but its pretty straight forward"
11713,"The game isn't too bad, it's even kind of fun.  So why don't I recommend?  Because there are games that are too similar to this one that are much better.

The game leaves me with a constant feeling of wanting more, but not more of what it brings.  It feels like half a game, and I would like to have a full game.  It just feels hollow.  It lacks any kind of rewarding feeling from the amount of time one might put into it.

The host/narrator guy.  Whatever you call it.  It shouldn't be in this game.  It's cringe, it's annoying, and the worst part of the game is hearing that guy with his cheesy voice mod singing every time I get power tokens.

Expeditions seem pointless and are too similar to regular play.

The whole just gets boring so fast with no sense of reward.  Obtaining new cards is such a joke that you would have to commit long term just to be able to get a few diverse decks which, in my opinion, just isn't worth it."
11714,issa good game
11715,Its a very fun yet challenging game. A lot like Clash Royal but easier to get stuff that needs unlocked.
11716,Really Good game ! well done
11717,Very nice game so far!
11718,I like the gameplay (similar to other games) but has way better animation etc
11719,Pretty interesting combat system. I'd say its a fast paced dueling card game.Will play more and edit the review but as for right now. System is solid. Chest draws are good. Ive actually pulled some pretty good cards just from levling up. Team system is fantastic. Also matching system is either incredibly balanced or we all are just incredibly dumb equally.
11720,Good
11721,funnest game i played in ages
11722,Game is super fun. You should play it.
11723,"Good game, fun so far!"
11724,"honeslty just a fun game
and i dont like these type of games"
11725,f u n
11726,"Its a fun game,really nice design and it feels balanced. Such a great way to pass time and a blast to play with friends!"
11727,This is like the best version of Desert strike for SC2.  But with a couple of elements from card games and LoL
11728,Nice game
11729,This game was advertised to me when I started up Steam. It looked different and interesting. It is awesome! It is a different game and I am really enjoying the gameplay. I am still learning the game and still learning what everything is and I will defo say I will keep playing. Worth it too as this is FREE.
11730,Love it
11731,neat
11732,GET IT!
11733,"is gud game. good thing to do when i dont feel like playing anything else, just get to sit back and watch some carnage."
11734,I love being a summoner conjuring up minions. And I Love MINIONS!!
11735,"nice gameplay ! not so fun display at the menus but ok 
"
11736,Decent game not bad for free
11737,"I know this game has a lot of good reviews, and while it's fun in it's early stages, not long into it you'll encounter players who buy to win, as early as level 5 you can spend hundreds on monster powerups.

You can drop a few thousand dollars and be rank 1 in no time, you can also drop 60 dollars and not be any further than a free to play player."
11738,Fun so far
11739,"only played for an hour. so far im addicted
"
11740,"fun because of the stratagy eliments

"
11741,good intro to the game and early rewards to get started.
11742,Pretty good game... Although copies the whole concept of crash royale.. YET for a pc game and for free it's pretty good and much fun than crash royale :)
11743,"This game is everything I wanted from Clash Royale that it failed to deliver, it's not P2W, has Co-op and the deck structuring is so much more deep and interesting. So far, I have nothing bad to say except for the lack of ultra-wide support (Which you can ""Patch"" in with some launch options.) Really a solid, fun and easy to pick up game that you can't help but have some fun with. This game works great with laptops like the Surface Pro due to the touchscreen and no use of keyboard buttons. Totally recomended, now I just have to suck in all my friends."
11744,I've only been playing for about an hour but its an enjoyable game animations are fun lots of heroes and abilities cant wait to get more immersed.
11745,This is very fun game
11746,Very game like
11747,So far so good.
11748,"i hate clash of clans but when i discovered  this game i love the idea of game and then it's my doz 
<3"
11749,amazing
11750,a good joguiño manito
11751,Finaly a vers of this type of game there looks to be aws!
11752,"this game doesnt look like much, but its actually really fun and addicting, especially the team battle"
11753,This game is fun!
11754,its a neat game
11755,"The dev of this game is straight ass smart. First, they steal clash royale idea to steam, then they steal android app devs strategy of ""do you like this game? please rate us"" thing. absolute steal for a ftp game. 10/10"
11756,Very easy to get playing ... good action and strats right away.
11757,"I saw some friends playing this game and got hooked right away. It has everything that I like in a game: strategy, nice graphs, easy commands, great UI and the battles don't take 30-45 minutes to end, which is great for someone with short time like me.

I am enjoying the game so far - doing the challenges first before I go back to fight another real players."
11758,It ok.
11759,"Surprising, Im actually enjoying this. It's comical, the announcer voice over is hilarious and the cards you can play are actually really cool! 

So far I have nothing bad to say about this game"
11760,morellia all the way
11761,I love it
11762,Nice Game !!! :D
11763,fun game simple to pickup
11764,"Used to be a fun game, However, I am unsure if it's even properly optimized, get occassionally told it isn't. Not to mention there seems to be some cheating, leagues seem stupid, on your own in a 1v1 it's fine since it's you vs one other, however in no way is this the same in a 2v2, where you rely on a teammate who half the time, is incompetent, and will ruin your game. 

The leagues are bad, considering platinum is about 6 leagues from starting, and yet I feel like sometimes they're belonging in the bronze league, around 3 leagues down. Gaining leagues seems far too easy, and some people should never have got to where they were, just due to their skills which make the game poor in a 2v2...

Then some tactics are just ridiculously powerful, and you HAVE to have something to counter them, don't have curse to fight off Morellia's dragon or kill her before late you? you've lost! because her dragon will kill off any weak units you have in a line on a summon as well as turn them into her own skeletons. Sure, it's nice to build up a deck, and understand how to play it. But with some meta's being clearly better then others, it soon goes from fun, to just competitive abuse of certain masters and their capabilities with them being hard to counter, especially for new players, to potentially, people cheating with infinite mana, or more mana then they should have etc.

They need to fix things in this game, and definitely try sort out a way to balance this a bit more. I'm not asking for a full balance, because that makes it have less variety, but how are new players supposed to enjoy other masters when some are CLEARLY just ridiculously biased in terms of power? it leaves only a select few, limits the enjoyment and creativity of players, and overall kinda ruins the experience, at least for me.

Oh, as for 2v2's, premade teams is a thing so if you have friends, that's the only way to get around chancing an incompetent teammate, even in higher leagues. And if they disconnect you auto lose, regardless of if you were seconds away from winning."
11765,it fun
11766,"Picture Clash Royale in your mind.
Now imagine it's good.

Boom. Minion Masters."
11767,GOOD FUN
11768,LIKE CLASH ROYALE
11769,love it!
11770,Playing co op with friend have not payed any money on it. Feels really sweet to play!

"
11786,"Good game, fun so far!"
11787,"The game's good. If you like good games, this is it."
11788,Very easy to learn and with gameplay roughly 1-5 minutes this is hands down the most fun to time ratio I've ever had with a video game. It's also pretty easy to learn the basics but I can see it being a complex game to master.  This one is a gem!
11789,nice
11790,Fun game.
11791,NOT A BAD F2P IF YOU GET IT EARLY.
11792,"it's good game but i can't buy Ruby, is it Bug ? i already Enable Steam Overlay but still can't buy"
11793,"Definitely worth the try! I used to play Clash Royale and Tides of War, this will deliver or more with expectations! I enjoy it."
11794,Great game!
11795,"Just began, so far it seems like a simple and fun game! I realize there are a lot of microtransactions but I wanna see how much they effect they have when they come to gameplay, will update review soon, but until then its an good game for me"
11796,You like WC3 castle fights? (I DO!)
11797,This Game is awesome and is like clash royale for pc would reccomend this to anybody
11798,Just started this game but its looking very good i can see the depth already after just an hour
11799,fun game so far :)
11800,Fun game!
11801,"Pretty good onboarding. Enjoying the gameplay, a lot of promising systems. UI/UX could use some work. I see a lot of potential here, excited to see where the devs take it."
11802,its okay for a few hours!!
11803,"good fun and easy to pick up
"
11804,i like this game because it involve a lot of strategy decisions
11805,Nice
11806,"I used to play a game like this on my Ipod called Clash royal, basically the same thing apart from on there you earn 1 chest per win then must wait for it to open often takes about 5 hours if you play before the chest opens you don't get any rewards for winning and waste your chances getting a good chest, this game avoids all of that crap and lets you play and play until you pass out none of this ""wait for this chest to open first"" bullshit you can just play also all the cards that combo together make for great tactical deck building and having a bunch of different heroes to play as and they get a weekly rotation so you get to try them out to see if you like them first is a brilliant idea, only played this game for about 1 hour and i'm already hooked!"
11807,Loot simulator. Another pay to win game
11808,so so so fun
11809,Awesome game
11810,Good Game to kill time
11811,fun game
11812,super fun!
11813,eh is ok
11814,"Great game, fast paced battles and team battles with lots of different cards to collect and master. It can become repeditive but that goes with this type of genre. best part of this game to me is all cards so far are balanced and interesting."
11815,So Good
11816,great game
11817,kinda cool

11847,great game!
11848,fun
11849,Great Game!
11850,"My subjective opinion after playing a few times... I enjoyed this game more than I expected. It kinda hooked me back into playing CCG.

The closest game that I played resembling this would be Hearthstone - which from my point of view, went down the hill in the last few years and as I was a big fan of it when it launched."
11851,"This game is so fun and entertaning, whoever is thinking of playing this game i definitly reccoment you getting it, its awsome"
11852,"Addicting game great to do duos with a friend, however, the beginning loot is a problem for me, you seem to get lots of legendary items off the bat, but every person gets the same rewards... lots of grinding for good characters, but for me i like the grind. overall, great game and no bugs i have seen yet!!"
11853,"This is a visually impressive game, with regular clash royale mechanics. I like it, has a MTG feel."
11854,Some strategy required and a good pass time!
11855,ampas lur
11856,"Game is really fun and very easy to get into, I would very much recommend playing!"
11857,Fun and easy to play.
11858,"Very fun game, Love the team play."
11859,good game
11860,"It respects you, unlike HearthStone. Need I say more?"
11861,"
This game is really awesome!!"
11862,awsome!!
11863,pretty cool game that doesn't afraid of anything!
11864,Cool game.
11865,Fun deckbuilding with engaging aesthetic.
11866,This game is a great game it reminds me of Clash royale and Hearthstone.
11867,It's pretty good I guess
11868,review coming from a long time gamer: mm is the only game i keep up with
11869,simple and entertaining.. commentary from the announcer give the game a lil more intrigue.
11870,"Great time killer. Hope there is a way to play with friends, haven't found it yet, tho"
11871,"So far this game got me hooked from the start, love the card/MOBA aspect of it"
11872,Simple to get into but decisions on the fly can make or break a match. It is like Hearthstone and tower wards had a baby but with less rng. Actually surprised that I enjoy it. Some cash shop stuff but doesnt feel p2w atm. Nice that it has ranked and game modes
11873,"Muito divertido o jogo, uma ótima maneira de passar o tempo e se desestressar depois de jogar algum MOBA aushaushaus"
11874,https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/489520#
11875,"My name is Yoshikage Kira , I live in the northeast section at Morioh and I recommend this game"
11876,Very good gameplay and unique artstyle!Did I forget about how addicting this game is?Yes because it IS.
11877,Nice
11878,a deeper gameplay than clash royale. very good game.
11879,i love yugioh
11880,Hace luces y sonidos. 10/10.
11881,its a better version of clash royal ( the one on moble ) however the stuff is a bit over priced on this game some cards are way over powered ! so if you do spend money you will have an advantage ! but however its very good :)! its not neededto spend money cuz of all ways to earn cards but if you intend to play this in long run play this for a bit at least 20 games then buy something  because if you love the game its worth the money!
11882,"great game
"
11883,"Played for 2 days, on the 3rd day one of my CARDS has vanished. That's not good in a game about collecting CARDS, is it? Problem seems to be around since 2018. Other than that the game is fun at times."
11884,i lovethis game!!!!
11885,Having LOADS of fun in this game. Simple and easy to learn.
11886,FUN AND EASY!!
11887,nice one
11888,Awesome game!
11889,"Nice rolling into if you're into card games, just in first 20 minutes but so far so good."
11890,"I like the TD games and the fable graphics. This game have both. Easy to handle, beauty characters, varied skills... 100+ hours playtime :D"
11891,"A Quick, fast paced game. That you need to use strategy to win. Very Fun and easy to use."
11892,"If you combine the graphics of Heroes of the Storm, the game play of Clash Royale and an announcer that's a little bit on crack...you'll get this game.  Removing the nuisance of needing to level up your 'cards' like in Clash Royale, you can pretty much start legitimately competing from day one.  There is much more emphasis on skill in this game than on ""I spent a lot of MTX, therefore I have higher level stuff than you.""  There are A LOT more 'cards' to get in this game in comparison, which is where they get you instead, but for a F2P game and even just getting the premium upgrade is worth it in my opinion.  

TL;DR: If you love Clash Royale style games, you'll love this game even more because it's WAY more in-depth.  :)"
11893,Nice way to intertain
11894,"Fantastic, Fun and entertaining game. Love the soundtrack and the characters are really well designed.
Every turn you take is wonderful, there is a lot to like about this game. (@)_(@) 

:)"
11895,its pretty fun and has a style very inspired by clash while still retaining originality. this is from the perspective of a new comer

11908,Better than expected at first glance.
11909,ez game so far
11910,Nice game to waste some time ;-D
11911,Really not worth the money! Rather play Clash Royale on my phone. Not one thing is better.
11912,surprisingly fun.
11913,"An obvious cash grab p2w

the cards are unbalanced in ways where there are many hard counters to cards you are most likely to use and get
the more lootboxes (including the known psychological effects that come with the traditional lootbox system) you get the more likely you are to succeed in your battles, constant rewards in the beginning reinforce the believe that you can/will win constantly and gain rare and powerful rewards by using lootboxes causes psychological effect for you to stay.

id avoid this game unless you have the patience to grind for useful cards or have a fat wallet."

11926,Great fun little game that anyone can enjoy.
11927,"So much fun this game! So addicting.
"
11928,grind grind grind
11929,Good shit
11930,"Pretty good game, it reminds me of Clash Royale because of how the game works which is based on Deck Strategy and positioning of your units in order to take the advantage, so far I don't see many flaws on it. What I do recommend is try it out while its a free game"
11931,This game is something different to me. Its like playing hearthstone except its fun.
11932,epic
11933,greast game
11934,"To be completely honest, I have no idea what I'm doing but I am enjoying it."
11935,This game is fun. I dont play long but i enyojing
11936,cool
11937,Fun and easy to start and looks that it will be harder as you engage more and more
11938,"it´s a pretty nice game, especially with a friend"
11939,Stays entertaining in the long run :)
11940,super addicting game
11941,I am having fun playing Minion Masters. It is cinematically nice to watch and keeps me involved with the many options for deck building and hero use.
11942,good game!!
11943,great
11944,nice game
11945,Its fun to play something else then CS GO
11946,This game is sick!
11947,Short game duration and fun.
11948,FREEEEEEEEEEE
11949,Good time killer
11950,Fun
11951,The game is unexpectedly fun
11952,LOVE IT
11953,It is an amazing game! I am not experiencing any lag issues. This game is a great game that requires strategy and smarts.
11954,"Nice game. Easy to start, hard to master :)"
11955,so fun like a new clash royal
11956,"The free DLC promo made give it a try. It is actually crazy fun! I haven't spent a penny and I'm having a blast! instantaneous queue times also, even at 4am. So I guess there's a bunch of people playing this game. Good stuff. Cool art. Fun gameplay. Seems balanced so far."
11957,Fun and a new way to pvp.
11958,"hi, this game is awesome. Like card games with animation."
11959,Good no doubt.
11960,hay
11961,This game is super fun
11962,Loving the game so far! Great take and a not so insane money hungry scheme for a fun and engaging brawler/card game!
11963,.
11964,Actually really fun and the game is free right now
11965,Gud
11966,'tis fun
11967,"Fun game, not pay-to-win, addictive."
11968,"I've only played for a short bit of time, but so far I really like the game.  Typical lane game, but it's really in depth and tons of things to hold your attention.  Hopefully it stays this way the further I go along."
11969,"Wasn't expecting much until I played the game.

WoW!!! It's really fun!"
11970,yay
11971,nice simple game doesnt feel so p2w like other cards game
11972,"Lazy bean, great fun, best review."
11973,"Love or hate him, Ratbo's spittin straight facts"
11974,"Trash game, terrible ripoff of card-based mobile games like Clash Royale and etc.

Fuck this stupid game I lost a 1v1 and ragequit, it treats my like shit and my opponent had some flying thing that destroyed my base and I couldn't kill it!!!!!!"
11975,yes
11976,"Quick,Simple,Fun way to kill time"
11977,"I've play this game about 3 months, it was one of my favorite game. i love the feelings when cooperated with someone smoothly. I play team battle mainly, bump into a good team mate is always a pleasure in this game.  My rank is grand master 504 in this season. 
 What bother me most recently is the team battle doesn't feels like a competition anymore, it become a gambling game lately. After rank resetting this time, i'd stuck in gold rank like 2 weeks, and then in one night i got a 35 winning streak with the same build and back to master rank. When i came back to grand master for 1 week, a 15 losing streak brought me to master 1 .
  This make me start to wonder what'd happened to the matching system, or is the player really that few for a fair game? Many games match with gm, m vs. gm, contender, i can bear it. but gm, plat vs. gm, contender?  this is getting more and more often and making this game become a gambling game. I'd bought some DLCs, master pack and skins,and i had some fun. but i wouldn't spend anymore. if i'm going to pay for gambling, i'll go to Vegas."
11978,3d 2 lane magic the gathering.
11979,Very nice game. Love it <3
11980,Impressive
11981,pretty fun and addicting game!
11982,fun
11983,"Good easy game, lots of fun"
11984,"very cool game. and its for free. yes there are other expansions that cost money , but once youyplay its forth it."
11985,dope fun ez
11986,fun
11987,"best strategy game its just like clash royale in mobile phone
"
11988,It's fun and quick. Reminds me a lot of the MTG game on xbox. Looks like it has quite a bit of depth through deck building and minion placement.
11989,Fun game to kill some time for sure.
11990,Fun Game
11991,good
11992,I love throwing my time and money at free to play games.
11993,"Fun game cute puffs 7/5
"
11994,Great game
11995,"entertaining for a simple game

Edit: So yesterday I was banned from chat for asking a question.

 I didn't swear I wasn't abusive I simply asked a question. Why is it considered toxic to call someone out for being bad at the game in chat?

 The reason i was given by the mod with the ego trip was just banned for toxic behaviour. You were warned. I wasn't warned though. It was just ask a question get banned. I like the game its great fun but the level of dictatorship powers given to mods is clearly overkill. 

And for that reason I don't recommend this game.

Ok so update I have played a lot of hours since this review and I feel i have to add.

The DEVS DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.
 THE DEVS HAVE CREATED A REPORTING SYSTEM TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE BUT THEY DO NOT CHECK IT EVER. 
I HAVE NOW HAD 20 GAMES IN A ROW WHERE MY TEAM IN RANDOMS WAS ABOUT TO WIN AND SUDDENLY MY TEAM MATE DECIDES TO THROW THE WHOLE GAME.

EVERYONE IS PLAYING TRYING TO MATCH IN RANDOMS AGAINST THEIR OWN BOT ALT ACCOUNT. 

THE DEVS ARE SLOWLY TRYING TO TURN THIS INTO A PAY TO WIN GAME SOMETHING THEY SAID WAS NOT THEIR INTENTION WHEN THEY STARTED.

IF I REPORT SOMEONE I EXPECT THAT EVENTUALLY YOU DON'T MATCH ME WITH THAT PLAYER FOR AT LEAST A FEW DAYS YET LO AND BEHOLD I END UP IN THE GAME WITH THE SAME TEAM MATE 5 TIMES IN 
A ROW AND 5 TIMES IN A ROW THIS TEAM MATE WILL DELIBERATELY LOSE THE GAME.

I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE DEVS OR MODS WHO ARE CLEARLY MARKED AND THEY WATCH ME.

THEY HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY NERFED EVERY CARD IN MY DECK IN THE ONLY DECK I EVER USE.

I AM STILL BANNED FROM CHAT TILL THE YEAR 2047 FOR TOXICITY FOR ASKING A MOD A QUESTION.

DO NOT BOTHER TO INSTALL THIS FREE GAME IT WILL ONLY GRATE ON YOUR NERVES.

Ok update I have now been banned from the game entirely with  no reason given. After 3 years playing i feel like i deserve some kind of reason as to why im banned. I am already banned from chat for 27 years so there is literally nothing i can do or say in chat to warrant a ban and this just comes out of the blue. I always try to win i dont rage quit or leave early I dont understand how i can be given a ban with no reason."
11996,I was skeptical at first but its like tower defense with a special champion select like LoL. Quite enjoyable
11997,Meh idk seems fun to waste time
11998,"easy,fun, and engaging"
11999,AMAZING GAME
12000,Quick and easy to pick up and play.
12001,"In All The Time I've Played So Far I've Enjoyed The Game, Its All About Strategy And The Way The Cards Come To Life Is Amazing I Would Reccomend This To Any Person That Enjoys Hearthstone Or Just Strategy Games In Total!
"
12002,"Fun strategy game to pass the time. I'd play this to cooldown from other games but doesn't mean that I don't find it challenging.
Good job here!"
12003,"look like Heart Stone (real-time).
I Love this game ."
12004,"Easy mechanics, cute design, easy to learn. Good times."
12005,it good
12006,this game is ok
12007,"Quick, simple game play, deep customization and counters.

Fun, especially for the price.

Fast paced Moba style combat with 10 card decks and a variety of interesting MASTERS who lead the minions, buildings, and casting of spells you'll use to dominate your opponent.

Was surprised how much fun it was."
12008,"Good so far, no Clash of Clans, but fairly fun"
12009,"Fun, easy to learn. Definitly reccomenenend for people. 9/10"
12010,"I like it. You choose an avatar called a ""master"" that levels up during a match and choose a deck of ""minions"" that complement the master's abilities and then fight. Your opponent does the same naturally and have you to judge when to pursue your own strategy and when to counter your opponent. 

Reminds me a lot of league of legends even though you don't buy gear for your avatar. Unlike league of legends I love how victory depends on you and you alone."
12011,"Awesome game so far, really good at introducing new players and making you feel welcome!"
12012,very fun game
12013,"Really Enjoying this game at the moment, just one the fence on whether or not it is pay to win"
12014,It's like: Hearthstone + League of Legends + Clash Royale. It's very funny to play!
12015,i love you
12016,nice game
12017,pretty good
12018,Fun
12019,"good lay back game somthing to pull your mind off life
"
12020,Got it expecting it to be meh - is actually really fun. I especially like the team battle mode.
12021,"Game seems pretty fun. Just a nice thing to throw on and play for awhile but I don't see this becoming the next big thing.

Still, overall a very beautifully crafted and enjoyable game."
12022,:)
12023,GG
12024,Alot of fun I cant stop playing it
12025,Very quick fun game
12026,coolio
12027,fun
12028,Really great game.
12029,Seems pretty decent.
12030,"its a very fun game i like the combat system the graphics are nice too 
"
12031,This game is pretty neat.  It's keeping my attention.
12032,Freaking love this game
12033,"good game.
easy to learn and really quick to start having fun.
though they should emphasize how some units are more effective then others against certain opponents, I think."
12034,its good men play this
12035,Great fun. Super intuitive and easy to get into but some pretty deep tactics and counter tactics. The devs also seem keen to continue developing this game as well as the universe.
12036,Better than clash!
12037,It's autochess that lets you interact with the game a bit more
12038,"fun free game,like the gameplay and very addictive;)"
12039,very nice game !
12040,Well made and takes you into the action right away. Best free game i have gotten in a while
12041,Great game
12042,MORELLIA IS STILL NOT NERFED?!
12043,"Great game, loading screens are longer than I'd like, perhaps its my pc. A better Clash Royale."
12044,wtf.... where has this been??? love it
12045,Really enjoying the game. If you check out the reddit the community is really nice and there are a ton of codes to get free stuff. I would recommend this game highly.
12046,"It's great. Its like a better version of the Marvel Strike Force mobile game, with so much more to it and such better options. Imagine Hearthstone combined with that one hex based Magic the Gathering Game"
12047,The game is amazingly good its like that mobile game but i can say this is even better
12048,"Great game, super fun right off the bat, very nice art design and mechanically sound, just plagued with micro transactions that feel pay to win, shame to ruin such a good game with greed."
12049,This game sucks in a good way :)
12050,"gameplay is great, easy to learn."
12051,so far don't have alot of time on this game but been having fun with it
12052,"fun little game, not rushed and really thought out"
12053,Lots of fun.  Balanced.  Quick matches. No pay to win.  I enjoy it a lot.
12054,fun
12055,"Hella good game,
very balanced 
xerath is broken"
12056,"Pretty sure it's pay to win for the most part, but the design is enjoyable and at least the early ranks have been fun so far."
12057,Very good
12058,Great game. You dont have to wait almost at all to get a match
12059,fun game
12060,"I only have a few hours on the game but, Very fun and Very addicting! it has alot to do also not just 1v1 so when you're bored you can try something else! I'd recommend the game if you're ever bored and want to have some random fun!"
12061,"Typical free to play game

ya know, pay to win and all that stuff"
12062,"Fun game, quick battles, free"
12063,Seems legit!
12064,love this game
12065,"Yes. No. Maybe. 

It's one of the three."
12066,good..
12067,a really fun game wish i could me on my phone but it is amazing
12068,Pretty addicting.
12069,Fun quick strategic.
12070,"For now, i like the game, because i don't really understand the mechanics, but I still win, so it's pretty funny to make a perfect against people who understand the game less than me, who's drunk af right now :D"
12071,it's fun to play but has a LOT of crashes right now just a heads up
12072,weeeeee
12073,"It is fun, easy to pick up, and certainly gives a good challenge at times."
12074,"Takes forever to find a match I swear. 0.12 seconds is too long, Clash royal. Less P2W, More P2W to not grind."
12075,"Fun and easy to play. Needs some more single player elements to keep me going though.

Still, has a very ""one more round"" thing to it."
12076,"this game is amazing i recommend this game if you like fighting and card games this is the game for you i love this game it's amazing
"
12077,"So far the game runs perfectly, queue time is short and second card game type i like!"
12078,"Free to play, no pay to win as far as I can see!
Simple to pick up, probably (Very) hard to master"
12079,Excellent game.  Easy but deep.
12080,cool gg fun simple
12081,The game is fun.
12082,Nice game
12083,its kinda fun
12084,Cool game.
12085,Pretty fun game.
12086,"I like how this game doesn't take itself too seriously, its fun
"
12087,"Fun when you have 5 to 10 minutes to play, quick matches"
12088,So far this game is great. Very similar to Clash Royale (the mobile game) but in a good way. It is much better and micro transactions don't seem to be required to win.
12089,I play royal rumble before but MM do give a new spins likes bridge controling stgy add a layer to the games
12090,very fun good game to play when you just want to chill out
12091,copy of battle royale.. i like it
12092,"cool
"
12093,it fun little quick game
12094,very good casual game.
12095,"You dont really lose anything by trying it out, its free, but otherwise its hardly playable, each match you get micro stutters, if this would ba a match against a better player you would be unable to properly react, even with good reaction time you cant do much when the game stutters and freezes. Also every 3-4 matches the game crashes to desktop. Not worth the time in this state."
12096,nice fun game....
12097,Fun
12098,This Game is really fun to play and to mess around in. Would Recommend to other friends!
12099,minion masters is so fun please play with me im having so much fun just try it out this is so fun like just try it man so much fun just play
12100,"This could be a great game and if your into games like clash of clans and Clash Royale you will find yourself right at home, it has that mobile feel and it's fun (to start with). However the game has some big balancing issues.

Let's just say if you have 'certain' cards with a mix of hero (Like Morellia for one example) your almost guaranteed to win. After going back and playing some more, there are SO many things what don't work in this game. Like some masters fire at your base even when you have minions out and they don't have to try and win only hold you off until you have zero HP. The game is REALLY unbalanced is so many ways, I'd stay away.

As for late game there is ZERO skill, it's all about how much you invest."
12101,gg
12102,not sure how it comapres to other in the genre but everything is smooth
12103,pretty enjoyable and gets really competitive
12104,SO NICE
12105,"fun game, kind of TFT meets clash royale"
12106,"Fantastically designed, seems to be many viable strategies and its both fun to play and awesome to look at!"
12107,"--READER DISCRETION ADVISED--
World of Warcraft and Clash Royale snorted cocaine and fucked. No complaints here, excellent game! Job well done devs :)"
12108,Great card game mechanics mixed with RTS gameplay.
12109,Good
12110,Great game!
12111,I'm old as %*(& and own. 10/10.
12112,This game is pretty fun so far havent played much yet but will update if it turns shitty haha
12113,"Wasn't Sure i'd like this game or not. i was drawn in by a Steamer (Sinobii) enjoying the game i thought i'd give it a try and i'm finding it most enjoyable. I'f you like Tower Defense like Game-play and Mobo-esk this is kinda like that. where the enemies are controlled by another player and the bridges are your pathways and the turns are mana-based, That's the best way i can describe it from what games i play. It's Free so give it a try./. Small download and can probably run on a potato of a computer. Lets see how many hours i can sink into this game :P"
12114,really fun card fantasy game
12115,so easy
12116,very cool
12117,"It's casual, easy to learn and play, and it's free...until you decide you want more. Seems fair enough to me. Even if the game is drenched in abhorrent micro-transaction bull crap, it's still a fun game imo."
12118,"interesting game, seems like not pay to win which is big plus only need some balancing on some units keep up the good work"
12119,bE gOOD gAEM
12120,Just launched the game...had a few rounds and its awesome fun so far. ( just an early reaview)
12121,Games a lot of fun so far
12122,"This game is for babies, I LOVE IT"
12123,fun game.  good mix of strategy and action.  like the team play and the fact that games are only 5-10 min long.
12124,"Game feels fresh and fun, not too shabby."
12125,simple and prices are fair and not to expensive #fortshit anyways i like the aspect of teamwork and gg
12126,So far i am undefeated in challenge mode in pvp and in the battle mode
12127,"Really fun game, planed on just checking it out and been playing for 3hrs."
12128,Great fun and quite addicting to play
12129,insane tought game i really enjoy it hope more poeple will play
12130,"this is a great clicker game, light on strategy but really quite fun."
12131,looking ok sofar
12132,I love this game. My 7 yo loves this game. Such a great game.
12133,"This game is a very nice combination of MOBA and deck building games. I enjoy it
"
12134,"Short and fun, yet addicting! 9/10"
12135,"For one of those ""I'm bored, which free game looks good?"", I have to say it's quite pleasant. Games don't take forever, in-game items can be bought with gold or keys or whatever instead of being behind a pay wall. I can see me playing this for hours to come."
12136,very addictive fun and just plain awesome i can see myself playing this for 100 no 1000s of hours
12137,Very fun to play with buddies
12138,fund game but need up ur fiture
12139,Fun so far!
12140,game good good game this is get this game you should
12141,yay
12142,good game :)
12143,awesome game
12144,I like because fun
12145,noiseee
12146,its great.
12147,Draft mode is great
12148,gg
12149,"awesome game fast paced and easy to get started
"
12150,yeye
12151,Fun game. Simple mechanics but it does require strategy when it comes to the units pairings.
12152,Nice Nice Nice...
12153,i fucking love this game
12154,its so funny game love <3
12155,Super addictive.
12156,Its so good I feel like crying
12157,"very exciting and interesting
"
12158,FUN
12159,"Short, intense matches reliant on skill and understanding of the units and how they interact. 

High skill cap game and never feels like a slog or grind. So far has been F2P friendly."
12160,LOVE SO MUCH XD
12161,Fun and simple. At least in the begining you can do much for free.
12162,"fun to play, easy, an uniqeu"
12163,"free, fun, balanced. such a great game. Most importantly it's not a pay to win game :3"
12164,Good game in general
12165,11/10 have big rock man punch bad guys would do again
12166,"Suddenly I become addicted, I can't stop, I must continue."
12167,"It was fun, but you can find a better game of the same type. My issue is all the damn glitches, unable to go full screen, sounds persisting after matches, massive ping spikes and to top everything off I was unable to redeem the codes I was given. Isn't worth the time or space on the hard drive."
12168,"It's like Clash Royale but way cooler. I do hope that they update it so that you get more battle pass points when you win ranked games though. I'd have to win 40 odd games to even get to tier 2, which is kind of ridiculous."
12169,This game is pretty sick Tower Defense Game...
12170,Good
12171,Looks very nice!
12172,I win  is fun with friends
12173,good game
12174,nice game strategic and fun
12175,"really enjoying myself so far, its like hearthstone mixed with a moba , totally different to anything Ive played before, graphics are real eye pleasing, worth a go for sure"
12176,i'm about to hang myself until the game asked me if i'm enjoying it
12177,good game
12178,FUN!
12179,its fun when ur winning
12180,for a free to play game it isnt that bad. i havent seen any p2w in my  games and the dlc is free. give it a try if you like online games
12181,Its a great game. But i hate that i cant play with more than one friend
12182,"Crashes,Crashes and more Crashes since the last update. 5-15 crashes per day!
I don't wanna know how many rank points i lost due this...
And i can't use ingame error report cause always something goes wrong when try to upload it.

Really aweseome.....

(Gameplay itself is fun and addictive)

Edit: Crashes got mostly fixed"
12183,"Nice game, it is fun and the team battle is great."
12184,the game is awesome i am really enjoying it
12185,Very fun arena card deck building game. Lots of options and tactics to consider as you go against other players. Team battle of 2v2 is also a lot of fun.
12186,gud
12187,well not stressfull game :v
12188,Recomendado bb
12189,"its fast pace, fun,and the team matches dont take away from the enjoyment"

12191,-
12192,"This is game is surprisingly fun, quirky little units.
Good job."
12193,Good game enjoy
12194,"An amazing game for people who wants to chill and just have some fun
9/10 because its to hard for me , a casual one"
12195,Nice time waster
12196,this game is awsome and I think that you should add more stuff to the game
12197,is good
12198,"It's really fun at the beginning, but I'm into 4 hours this now and I can barely get any new and useful cards, finished all the extras for now (gotta wait 3 days for the next 'Expedition'), got most of the achievements I can get and I can only play regular matches, which are not that fun anymore playing with the same deck over and over again.

Button line: starts really good, but gets repetitive really soon"
12199,Quite addicting - I'll update my review after i really get into this game.
12200,"Good, clean, simple fun."
12201,it scratches several itches. i like it
12202,It's a pretty fun game!
12203,Its fun and unique
12204,It's fun. Short sessions.
12205,Just an overall amazing game! congrats to the devs.

12207,"well it is fun if you liked clash royal this is kinda same, but it have team match which is good mode with friends"
12208,so far really enjoying this game. has a great rewards program as well to get better cards. havent played too long but so far very enjoyable.
12209,Fun game. lots of fun elements added
12210,Not a bad game overall.... mechanics seems well put together and I like the immediate immersion into the game with the tournament style tutorial. Well done!
12211,This game is fun

12213,"Fun game, good RTS for an easy going time"
12214,it fun

12219,NICE
12220,fun game
12221,Lots of fun!
12222,"Nice tower defense, potential to be competitive"
12223,Fun and goofy
12224,1h played so far seems balanced autochess and leagues seem fair... I am looking forward to playing the team at higher league levels.
12225,"This game is pretty fun, much like clash royale. I think with a few tweaks this could be a massively popular game. The minions could be more lively for one and the interface could use some work, its a great game though."
12226,"Feels alot like Teppen, would definitely like to invest my time in it"
12227,Nice game
12228,"Edit 2021: At some point in late 2020, they did indeed introduce much more P2W structure, for company longevity. Some cards being released were just not thought about balance-wise before they were introduced, and took weeks before any nerfs hit them, while they continued to nerf other cards that even countered the new ones. Unfortunate really, as it was holding up well until this point for me.

I can no longer recommend the game.


Original: Game is playing like a standard phone game. Upon a lot of play time, the game is pretty solid and I've had a lot of fun with it! It seems relatively balanced well, and it is definitely F2P friendly. There isn't a P2W system in place.

The only issue I've come across is crashes at random points in time. It's infrequent however, maybe once a week if played daily.

I'd recommend this to anyone that likes a game with simple mechanics, deck building, and slight strategy aspects."
12229,"Do you like to play with fire?
I like it!"
12230,Fun. Simply fookin fun.
12231,"its fun playing with friends
"
12232,"fun graphics, fun game play :D"
12233,DOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEE
12234,"Light, fun, game, but has options for strategy and depth"
12235,great game so far i've only played a little bit tho but from what i see i like it
12236,very fun
12237,funny simple game
12238,"god
"
12239,Fun game!!
12240,"very fun so far. about as pay to win as hearthstone, which i think is tolerable. Great game :)"
12241,FUN GAME!  Fast paced and easy to get into.
12242,"Broken.

Picked it up today because the DLC was free for the weekend. 9 out of my first 12 matches I was stuck in the loading screen upon entering the match. Apparently, some people were stuck and some weren't. My first ""loading screen match"" I won because my teammate didn't get stuck. Another match, all 3 other people got stuck and I didn't, so I just beat the enemy to death without them spawning anything.

If you are going to have a free weekend to promote your game, make sure your game works first."
12243,So far so good. Team dynamics add skill
12244,No exit button until you reach lvl 7 LUL
12245,"Spending money is not needed to get the most out of this short, fun to play game."
12246,"So far playing the game its very simple and easy to understand at the beginning. 

Grinding for the summoner and deck that you specifically want to run seems to take awhile, but if you truly enjoy the game and plan on playing it then the grind is well worth it! 

The art style is cute and the broadcaster is cheesy and kind of annoying, but it brings an extra element to the game that makes it fun for pretty much anyone whose interested in these types of games."
12247,"So far it seems pretty cool, lovely sound design, I like most of the minions
"
12248,not bad
12249,"They reduced ruby rewards, it's P2W now"
12250,o balanced game
12251,mantab
12252,addicting game not good ...
12253,simples e divertido
12254,"An epic and entertaining game!
Would for sure recommend, have legit been playing it for hours straight and not got bored!"
12255,luv it
12256,fun deck building game
12257,good game
12258,"It's like that one phone game that I tried once, but better because it doesn't seem to have that card level up system that really makes it feel pay to win. I like the team battle mode a lot, it's fresh. Cool game, good as a free game."
12259,very nice
12260,"Easy, simple, cool little game"
12261,I dig the humor and the visuals of this game It's got some neat twists on a familiar genre that I can dig.
12262,Nice card game animated!
12263,btoo o
12264,"Nice chill game

"
12265,So far its been fun! I dont know if I will purchase anything but so far its a really cool little tower def kinda game
12266,"I just dropped in to check it on a free weekend with free DLC included. It's a buffed up mobile game with seemingly decent towerdefence mechanics. It puts quite a strain on my machine but does not look nearly good enough to warrant that.

Even if you just play 10 minutes the very exploitative microtransaction-options become apparent.

Not the time-sink I was looking for and considering that the DLC usually costs upwards of 10 Euros you can figure out that if you asked the developers any questions the answer always would be: ""I can answer that... for money"".

Don't waste your time on it. Not even if it is free."
12267,This is one of the best Deck-Builder Type games i have ever played.I started deck_building games with a mobile game called Clash Royale but this games takes that concept and just improves on it. I absolutely love this game and will reccomend it to everyone
12268,"Looked like a cute game. Played up to lvl 14 or so. Unfortunately game started crashing more and more frequently at the start of battles. Now it's unplayable. Tried lowering graphics, forcing start in DX9, removed discord link - everything I could find online. Game now crashes at the start of every battle. Too bad. Uninstalled."
12269,"good
"
12270,Nice game
12271,very  very good
12272,very nice game
12273,"its a really fun 2v2 clash game i have ever played, the only thing i wish is that there was a way to acquire more cards."
12274,Fun game good graphics better than clash royale would recommend
12275,"Its quite nice experience, a bit linear but not so much. Quite fun so far (been playing for 1h)"
12276,"So far so good...

Okay, after putting some more time into this game I am able to give it a much better review. And it's still good! But I do have a few issues with the game. First off, it's confusing trying to figure out what exactly you're playing for. The reward system is very broad and very weak. I ""feel"" your main goal should be gaining Season Battle Pass experience, but the way to increase your experience gain can be frustrating. If you can even figure out how because it's not really explained to you. Plus, even if you can get Season Battle Pass experience, to really gain the benefits you need to purchase the Battle Pass with Rubies, which are difficult to come by, especially if you don't already have the Battle Pass purchased! So you either need to spend real world money on purchasing Rubies, or wait a Season or two to save up Rubies in-game. And a Season is several months!

The biggest advice is to do tons of research. Tons of research! So you can figure out what your in-game goals should be. Don't waste in-game currencies without first researching what you should be spending it on. And experiment! There's many different Masters to play as, all of which play fairly differently, and many, many different spells/minions to cast. Find the best combinations who work best for you, but still experiment with each new card you find.

Over-all, this is a very fun game! But the reward system is annoyingly frustrating. If you're okay with that fact, and don't mind playing for hours on end with little to no reward, then by all means I recommend this game.

Also, the Legendary Key reward system SUCKS! You need 15 keys to unlock the (not really all that great) card, and each key can take up to a dozen matches just to get the chance to drop, IF YOU WIN. There were so many times I'd be on a major winning streak, the item reward would come up on a match, and I'd finally lose, having to wait another however many matches for another shot at the reward. So... figure at least 100 matches. Just for a card.

Of course my biggest issue is I would LOVE for more solo play options. I'm not a competitive person. I understand this is not the focus of the game, but there are a couple of different solo sections. Just wish you could at least play them more."
12277,nice game for casual play
12278,its very nice and thanks linus from linustechtips for recommending me this game it is very nice
12279,"Very good game, idk if I would pay for it but with it being free right now please just try it, if you have ever played Clash royale mobile game, this game is exactly that but on pc."
12280,Addictive!
12281,good game fun to play
12282,"Simple to understand and play, lot of fun, many counters possible. can be very interesting."
12283,Very fun
12284,"games is very good, could use some sort of tower before killing the base though"
12285,"easy and fun  
"
12286,Must...play....more.....
12287,Grate fun!
12288,I LOVE IT SOOOOOOO MUCH
12289,Pretty tight
12290,"Its alot like clash royale. But i dont have to buy endless to get ""better"" cards and the point that you have a hero to build with/around gives it more depth. 2 vs 2 is nice too. Well done so far. Have to see if this game is getting repetitive fast."
12291,Graphics is pretty good. game is rewarding enough to keep you playing.
12292,10/10 if youre beyond bored and want to play something really chill
12293,"Great card based battle game, well worth a try to pass some time."
12294,This game is simple and fun
12295,"Got this game during the free weekend of August. I thought ""Hey, it's a free game. Why not?"" 

The premise is simple. You're a hero, you summon minions to kill the opposing hero.

I'm not sure what it is, but between the deckbuilding and extremely fast games, I can't get off this game. It's a blast to play and it's a blast to build the decks. 

There's a TON of microtransactions from what I have seen, but they don't feel intrusive or like i'm being held back...yet. 

I look forward to playing this a lot more!"
12296,Quite Fun :)
12297,"exciting, addictive, entertaining, cute minions, and stress busting!"
12298,IT'S FUN
12299,"Solid, light, two-lane moba based on summoning mobs.

The ""please spend money"" content isn't *too* aggressively placed, although it is definitely present, and the game does a good job of scaling you into matches against people with comparable levels.

Not revolutionary, but certainly fun.

Edit: As of the writing of this review (8/17/19), there really isn't a story mode. So if you're like me and you play stuff primarily for the plot, this doesn't have that. It *is* fun and competitive and involves a lot of counterplay, but you're not going to go on an emotional journey through a new world. You're going to dump bags of creatures out into an arena and watch them fight.

Edit: As of 12/5/19 they'll be adding a story mode, but honestly I'm not even sure it needs it. This is a very well balanced game, it's fun casual and it's fun sweaty, and everything in it can be earned at a decent speed by playing. Hats off to the devs. They've got the formula right.

Edit: This is real, real good."
12300,A very good game.
12301,"Fast and Fun. 

Battle Royala - esque (The clash of clans game spinoff). 

You place troops / units in two different lanes and get rewarded for playing aggressively. (It is advantegeous to control the bridges which connect your tereritory woth the opponent. 

Mana is generated and used to place your forces and you have access to ground and flying unites as well as spells. 
Great energy from the ingame narrator / commentator. Highly tailored too, depending on the situations are you in and acts as a great helper for your beginner info. 

This game is also free. I have two hours in already noticed the microtransactions possible. It is possible that it will become an issue later in the game but I am unable to comment on that yet. I have hope that it is balanced and not P2W. 

"
12302,"This reminds me of war craft 3 mini games... Needs some polish but super enjoyable, worth the download.

Don't see this game becoming... an obsession? but fun nonetheless"
12303,"that game is very nice , i like this game , 10++++

good game , good life :)

"
12304,so far been playing for an hour and it has been really fun
12305,"Looks fun so far, it's a strange combination of castle siege and the card game... interesting."
12306,one of the best game ever
12307,Great Game
12308,pay to win trash
12309,Very funy! Good battles!
12310,good
12311,Probably one of the best F2F games on steam. Shame ultrawide resolutions are not supported.
12312,good
12313,Great game played 5 hours and no complaints yet
12314,"clash roayale ripp off but on PC graphics, cool to play."
12315,I haven't played the game much I'm really enjoying it so far. I got the game when there was a sale discounted some DLC so it was free.
12316,great action...continual play..always engaged
12317,Clash Royale for PC. Addictive and fun.
12318,"I always hated the clash royale type a thing, but this is actually fun."
12319,"I enjoy this game mainly due to the announcer. the gameplay is fun, but i love the comments he makes."
12320,fun game!
12321,goood game
12322,Really simple and fun game! Try it as its free
12323,"I like the game for a while, but there is no quit button (back to Windows)?"
12324,Nice and fun game to pass your time!
12325,"Short rounds.
Fun Gameplay.
You can play 10 Minutes or a couple of hours."
12326,Mana well spent
12327,Brilliant Really enjoying it so far :)
12328,nice game
12329,Great game!
12330,A stupid pay2win mobile game on PC with decent graphics and UI.
12331,Great game. Kinda Clash Royale type game but i much rather play this game.
12332,"Great fun so far. Easy to get into, fast and furious action on the battlefield. Mix of Moba and CCG with very available new cards and resources earned free by playing."
12333,"Kurzweilig, vergnüglich, anspruchsvoll und variabel! Cooles Spiel!!!"
12334,Nice game !
12335,"Awesome Game, Lots of fun"
12336,Good game so far.
12337,"For me the game doesn`t want to start , it opens then stay in a screen in witch is just the chat ( doesn`t work ether)."
12338,"Fun, exciting and easy to understand ... What more do you need"
12339,GG!
12340,Realy fun but a bit too easy
12341,"The game is fun, it's very easy to play and understand. For me, it's that kind of game game you play when you want to just chill out and not think too much. So far my most favourite feature is the Team Battle mode, as it needs some understanding of team play which is what makes games more engaging fun to play. I haven't had the time to try out all the heroes, but i like that every hero needs a different playstyle thanks to their perks. The heroes outside appearance and manners are interesting and i like the way they differ from each other. The edgy lady with the book of the dead (sorry, i forgot her name lol) looks the most interesting to me."
12342,"it,s fun and pretty easy"
12343,This game imiditly reminded me of my time i spent playing the flash game Epic Wars as a kid. The dinymc is vary simaler and i love it.
12344,Pretty fun!
12345,"Very fun game, those 5 min matches really are a good time waster."
12346,"Funny game, nice to combo with teammates.. Easy and easily likeable."
12347,Pretty fun game
12348,"So pay to win, they have to bribe new players to join/10"
12349,Decent
12350,WOW! Great game....very VERY addictive... have not been able to stop playing since I turned it on....help....send food and drink.. I dont think my legs work anymore!!!
12351,very nice game and is free to play highly reccomend
12352,nice i love that
12353,"Nice game.
P.S. Mana frenzy SO tasty! I am in love with it. 
P.P.S. I still love it even i quit..."
12354,great
12355,"The game is sweet, i like these kind of troop deployment games. The physics are pretty cool and all in all if you like these kind of games I highly recommend you try it. 10/10 thumbs up !"
12356,It has a lot more starts and skill involved than excepted.
12357,good game
12358,I think this game is really good. I like the battle style and find it really good to play
12359,"fast and amusing just started, seems fun paced 
"
12360,fun
12361,Feels like a Clash Royale for PC but a lil more mature. Might edit this in the future for a deeper insight.
12362,i love this game downloaded it 1 hour ago and can't stop playing it
12363,Nice game to Try
12364,i like this game
12365,fun
12366,I like the card aspect with actually seeing the battle play out. Reminds me of hearthstone strategy but more entertaining since I can see my plays animated. No real negatives. There's a lot to this game and I've only just started.
12367,"A fun game to pass the time. Building your own deck, trying to achieve combo's and taking your opponents out in cleaver movements."
12368,epic card game
12369,nice game
12370,"Let's be honest: this is a mobile game. And while it does that well, Steam isn't for mobile games."
12371,fun
12372,Nice Game;)
12373,goood
12374,so good
12375,"Good to entertain!
"
12376,it's a calm but intence game
12377,Very nice game you can use many tactics and i get it free
12378,I like it
12379,"Easy to play, great rewards
"
12380,This is surprisingly stress-relieving. Watching your minions become paste has this sort of charm to it.
12381,nice game
12382,dsadsad
12383,very nice
12384,Fun and interesting gameplay
12385,The game feels awesome so far.
12386,Fun so far but early days.
12387,good job
12388,"So let's say you're going to make a garbage glorified slot machine lootbox grind mobile game, except for desktop. You might have the insight to say, ""Well, if I'm going to make a garbage game, I ought to make it actually functional and not crash every game."" 

You, sir, would not be the developer of Minion Masters.

Update: I came back to see if it was any more stable. It's not. This game is absurdly badly coded."
12389,Typical Clash Royale!!
12390,"Fun, repetitive, stupid, time wasting pvp. What more could you ask for? Could make dota players jealous they don't have a TFT like mode yet. oh, and there is this game so yea. Enjoy."
12391,good game ever
12392,"A quick and fast paced game. With numerous approaches to play the game in your own deck building.
Do hope more Masters to be added in."
12393,Super SUper awesome game I love it can play for hours
12394,"Good mobile game
Please don't do pay to win, for the love of god."

12404,It so fun
12405,i good game :D
12406,Absolutely love the game and you don't have to pay to get the battle pass which is great its a simple fun game for downtime and it is also really adorable. I strongly recommend it even if it isn't your normal type of game.
12407,"it fun
"
12408,"I mostly play Hentai games, but this is good too"
12409,Its good.
12410,"pretty simple, fast, and fun"
12411,"Awesome, easy, and better than clash royal"
12412,A cute evolution of old two sided tower defense games. It shop is pretty gross though. Very Fortnight exploitative.
12413,Fun game so far
12414,"I got this game for free during a sale so take what I say with a pitch of salt. Very  easy to pick up and play, and decent models"
12415,Tons of fun. No lag. No loading time. Love it.
12416,"simple and easy game to play, with very quick matches, perfect for killing a couple of mins"
12417,"Easy for beginers, with fun graphics and strategies!"
12418,fun
12419,"This game is totally badass! So fun. I have been on a bit of a burnout on video games lately but this game is so awesome. Right off the bat you unlock stuff, you learn how to play the game, so much excellent progression. The game itself is very fun, visually pleasing, the combat is super cool. 10/10 this game is awesome."
12420,Nice
12421,relax and nice game
12422,basic funish PVP tower defene game
12423,go go go !
12424,Awesome game very fun!
12425,good
12426,good game
12427,"One of the better deck-building games made. It also adds some RTS flair and strategy to the mix by location-based summoning and synergistic minion/master abilities, making play fast, fun, and rewarding. I'd recommend playing some and, if you like it, upgrading to premium to buy a few more masters."
12428,Clash royale on pc? Maybe...
12429,great game
12430,"Absolutely addicted right away(seems like they took some ideas from Direct Strike, a Starcraft 2 mod), fast gameplay, easy to get into, nice units etc etc, 9/10"
12431,Love this type of game
12432,Fun game!
12433,Unreasonable drop rank due to mass of stuck & bug. No any compensation of it.
12434,"So much fun to play this game. Build your own deck, win the match."
12435,Card based and RTS all in one!!!  Very cool and original!
12436,top
12437,did not laugh
12438,Very fun game. It's like a card game minus the card play turn base.
12439,"I have no idea how this managed to make it to ""very positive"" it's just more idle P2W lootbox trash.



PS: keep the mobile trash on mobile."
12440,Fun catchy game.
12441,goooooooooooooooooooooooOOoooD
12442,"An awesome game, telling all my friends .... great job!"
12443,Mantap pisan Sluur
12444,"Think clash royal meets hearthstone. There's the standard summon minions and play spells mechanic which works well. AI is predictable and manipulative as it should be. Layered on top of this is XP which gives perks which vary depending on the hero you choose allowing more varied gameplay. Every hero is viable, just some may seem more powerful due to their flexibility to fit multiple deck types and strategies. Layered on top of that some cards have unique synergies akin to TCGs. For example, if a card says call of the slither then it will add a slitherbound minion to the spawn of another slither card in your deck. There are also a dew unique mechanics like invisibility, shields, rage, spirit, etc. Instead of the annoying level up card mechanics to increase stats, leveling up cards just gives you more progression towards battle passes as well as the ability to put multiple copies of the card in your deck. This means you really only need to find one card of a particular card for it to be viable. Less grinding so yay. As far as unlocking cards goes, progression is slow but steady with a jump start in a very beginning. People keep claiming the game is pay to win. Not the case, they just refuse to learn game mechanics. You can play for free and still get a steady progression. Progression is fun with expeditions and mayhem campaigns. Balancing is always an issue with these game but in my opinion there are only one or two cards that seem inherently unbalanced and that's just because I don't know how to play around them. Overall a very solid summoner game."
12445," I kinda like it , but why I cant add it onto my library"
12446,"One of the best free to play games around.
"
12447,"Very good game. 
Not pay to win. Actually Play to win.
Very good for streamers and viewers.
Fin game!"
12448,"Beautiful aesthetics, depth yet simple, and just very enjoyable to play."
12449,fun af :c
12450,"Pretty simple yet has depth, lots of fun. If you had fun playing clash royale I would totally recommend this game!"
12451,"pretty good so far, but i suspect it may turn a bit too microtransaction-y for my tastes"
12452,Awesome Game so far.
12453,It's really fun and Kripp said to play so I'm playing
12454,goood
12455,tthe game is fun and easy to play. The art style looks really good the animations are nice.  But i have only played for 45 mins so far so take me at my word.
12456,"I got the game with the free DLC at the start of the season, and was pleasantly surprised by it. The DLC may be a bit expensive, but for a free to play game, it's not too shabby."
12457,keeps you entertained <3
12458,Review one (102 minions)- Not bad. pretty fun. Addictive. Makes you feel like your participation matters a lot.
12459,"Fancy version of Clash Royale.
Not very special but playable i guess."
12460,so far so good. is pretty ez to start the game (maybe is because i have played lots of card game already).
12461,"Good game, if you like Clash Royale you'll probably like this. It's similar but different enough to be a fresh take."
12462,It's fun so far.
12463,Fun and fast paced.
12464,Fun game
12465,"It's fine.
"
12466,"fun team battle clash like but with more intricacies and combos, placement is key! GL HF!"
12467,Very fun and well designed game. Not some cheeky free to play game. Lots of components and varieties of ways to play.
12468,"Not actually a rip-off of clash royale, despite my first impressions. Would recommend."
12469,WERE ALWAYS WINNING BEST GAME EVER
12470,I like the style yeet
12471,game has been fun thus far.
12472,the best
12473,"easy fun , fast"
12474,"Just started but, so far so good. Totally worth a try if you are into card strategy. The cool thing is you play concurrently , so there is no waiting on opponents turns. Quick paced matches and simple deck building mechanics, i like it.

Edit: After having played much more than when i completed the first review i stand by my words, its a great game, for free. Find a friend , conjure up a deck with your combined strategies and go to town. SO satisfying to know you toppled other teams of two and their strats.

Get this game, the microtranactions arent predatory and ive spent 20$ in store because i enjoyed the product they gave to me for free."
12475,Gewd Gueim
12476,"fun and simply game, by yourself or with friends"
12477,"A nice change from MOBA's and the like.  Definitely a custom card game, lots of minions to choose from.  Check it out, its a good F2P game :D"
12478,Fun on top of more fun
12479,"Great.
"
12480,"Jogo muito divertido!! Excelente, super recomendo"
12481,dynamic deck builder... I like the mechanics of not only having good cards but playing them strategically on the field... where becomes just as important as when you play certain cards
12482,So much fun!
12483,At first the game seemed rather boring and about zone control and stacking your minions ... but once i got to team battle with a friend greatly increased the fun.
12484,"REALLY FUCKING GOOD!!!!!
"
12485,I can say after learning how to play this game.... Ive gotten more p***sy than I ever have before. the ladies drop their pants so fast when they hear i won 3 games in a row but i have to tell them sorry my buns are for minion masters. the lord has dropped this blessing of a game for free for a limited time (sorry to those who missed the free promotion) even if it isnt free when you see this review I highly recommend it especially if you want some mad p***sy  rolling up like its happy hour at sonic.
12486,"Game seems to be card based where players use cards which spawn in things which fight other things.  I don't really care for some of the creatures which are supposed to be demonic, but the game over all and the concept is well thought out.

I'll recommend because of game play not because of some themes."
12487,"Crazy addicting, really fun."
12488,nice game to kill some time
12489,"got this game for free. if you're wanting to take a break from the slower paced games try this. easy point and click, chest like feel. not bad."
12490,I really love paying for loot crates for progression
12491,is fun
12492,"So far so good. If you read it and I haven't change my recommendation yet, then I am farther than ""so far so good"""
12493,"Nice an simple, a chill game to pass the time. Nice for 2 vs 2 team action too."
12494,really good play at first time
12495,coo
12496,"Its a fun card based battle game.  I'm usually not a online game fan, but i'll be playing this again"
12497,played around 1 hours and quite fun. need to see more before further review
12498,"good game just need free gem
"
12499,This is a fun little game...while getting the cards you want is tough it is not impossable.
12500,"Awesome game, kinda like if clash royale had far more depth!"
12501,"Overall , Not a bad game. Only complaint is that teh ingame monetary value is pretty low, so its defently a grinder.

Power tokens are used for unlocking new avitars. OR you could buy the avitar pack and unlock them all currently. idk. game is fun.

I would however change some of the SFX as they are from borderlands series of games."
12502,clash royal on pc
12503,Was alot more fun than i expected and gets better as you lvl up as quite strategic. Very fun & addictive
12504,Fun game! Like clash royale but a lot more fun and active-er. Not pay to win and you easily get everything that the game can offer just by playing it and in game money.
12505,Really enjoying it. Fast paced 1v1 or 2v2 strategy. Could possibly sit alongside Rocket League as one of my PvP games. .
12506,"a bit limited but if this is a beta theyre doing great! idk much about the game yet so I dont know if my criticisms are valid, i will post when I understand the game better, as i have played less than one hour of it: utility cards seem kind of hard to pull off but again i might be using them in bad places/times so idk yet if I'm right or just doing it wrong but definitely give it a try!"
12507,clash royale but no he he he ha
12508,A fun and novel game that is easy to learn and difficult to master. Highly recommended!
12509,its a good game so far
12510,Just started. So far its okay. Will need to see how it pans out at the higher levels when there are more cards to play with and against.
12511,"good game, it will get better with time 
"
12512,Simple Easy and FUN!!!!
12513,It's pretty good to pass time
12514,"Only about 10h in it. But it's a really enjoyable game. different modes to play. And it's just fun to play. A bit of a mix between hearthstone like games and League of Legends like games with a twist. But without the hassle those games bring with them. Fast paced and enjoyable. Only downside for me right now is the community in chat and even on discord. So much whiney little bratts either complaining or measuring eachothers e-peens over who is the better.. blabla.
But the game itself is good stuff. Surprised I didn't find it sooner."
12515,Been playing since closed beta and can definitely say this game is very much worth getting. Even you enjoy games like Clash Royal or card games like Hearthstone I think you will love this game.
12516,Better than Hearthstone
12517,game is pretty fun not a fan of card games btw ye i kinda liked this 1 recommend to try tho
12518,The game reminds me of warcraft 3 mods. gameplay seems enjoyable and the progression system seems fair and well thought out.
12519,very nice game
12520,This game is really nice. It is really addictive. Thanks for the game! Cheers! It is a must try game. :)
12521,Good game
12522,very nice game
12523,"great game, i just wish when you duo'ed with a rando and they leave it wouldnt affect yourself just them"
12524,GG nice game ;)
12525,"Essentially a Clash Royale clone, but good enough to stand on its own. I'm enjoying it, we'll see if the feeling sticks"
12526,it fucking sucks
12527,Fun game and a good change of pace from my usual shooters and RPGs. Very welcoming and positive community aswell
12528,cool game so far
12529,Me gusto la forma que tiene el juego .
12530,"Game has serious bugs and the fact that the bug report function doesn't even work is a terrible sign. In this kind of F2P model if I can pay for a draft match, have it fail to load and get 'defeated' without ever seeing my opponent, and then be told there's no way to report that issue and I'm just out with no recourse, I'm not going to keep playing."
12531,love it.
12532,its a vary fun game
12533,Fun for free. Similar to Clash royal on mobile.
12534,a fantastic game
12535,good
12536,pretty legit so far
12537,Fun Game! Love it!
12538,"I enjoy that is strategy, its fast paced, there are many active animations going on but yet a card game, the ability to build many types of teams, playing with someone or solo to achieve a goal, feel rewarded after every match, at the current moment does not feel like a pay to win, able to obtain a lot just playing, and having what i think is ranked available is always good. very well made. quests are good to feel like you have things to accomplish besides winning."
12539,good game
12540,I feel that this game is a great game there are so many asspects that are great THanks!
12541,"aight, its fun"
12542,nice game with strategic depth
12543,cool cool cool cococococococoool
12544,Brutus.
12545,going go so far
12546,"good game
"
12547,"Its just fun to play, tutorial is easy and game is easy to learn. 
Its very stratetic but not in a hard way."
12548,"Better than most card games. Nice visuals, and no software issues so far."
12549,very nice games!
12550,Fast ..fun ... great game ;)
12551,Nice
12552,Fun little game to play with a friend. Bit of strategy with presets to pick. Great with a couple of beers on a chill evening.
12553,Surprisingly catchy.
12554,good all around game with no pay2win stuff it is easy to learn pick and play kind of game
12555,great game fun and easy
12556,Cool game to pass the time.
12557,its fun but my computer is garbage so i have bad graphics but fun game
12558,"It was free, I tried it and I very quickly got bored."
12559,"its fun 
"
12560,"It's fun. It's also the only multiplayer game I play so I couldn't possibly recommend it over anything else. It might be the worst one out there for all I know :) But I can honestly say it's fun. In one game my opponent and I both had very little health and my opponent was sending his armies out. As luck had it, my fireball card recharged and I sent it to his tower, winning the game when I was one second away from losing it. The reverse has happened to me also and I guess that's the human aspect. Definitely stressful but definitely fun :)"
12561,"1st day  -  I am just lvl 10 -  its fun, Fast to learn card drafting area style game - lot of quick loot - new cards - def worth trying out :)"
12562,"A+ rating, would of paid for this game if it was not free to play."
12563,"Its like Clash Royale but actually a challenge! So much fun, really enjoying it so far"
12564,fucking brilliant
12565,"Nice Clash Royale type game with constant updates, fun cards and gameplay. Tons of deck possibilities and on top of that, you have different masters you can play as. Masters have different skill sets and basic attacks that can go well with your deck. They keep giving free dlc's and cards too. Dev's are really generous and caring. If you are looking for a strategic online card battler, give Minion Masters a try."
12566,The game is good so far. We will see later :)
12567,"It is a good game, I like the team battles the most!"
12568,Its a fun game
12569,Easy. Fun.
12570,nice game
12571,good game
12572,CAN PLAY (AND HAVE BEEN) FOR HOURS
12573,Great game!
12574,NICE
12575,AWSOME GAME
12576,rounds are fast and fun
12577,Very fast pased DOTA on a smaller scale. LOVE it
12578,Pretty Fun. But I have no Idea if these people are bots or not.
12579,Fun Game so far. Unique and lotsa rewards to keep you playing.
12580,amoooooooooooooozing
12581,"Good free fun! 

Edit* - The customer support for this game is speedy and generous. I can highly recommend this developer based on how dealing with there support made me feel wanted as a paying player."
12582,awesome fun casual style but engaging
12583,It is balanced and funny.
12584,Playtime: 1 hour. its fun right now. trying duo now
12585,Good Game
12586,great game. add more characters
12587,Awesome game!
12588,Really good )))
12589,This game is surprisingly good.
12590,"ITs entertaining, You dont have to buy anything in order to win"
12591,good game
12592,10/10 fun game
12593,"I play dota, love that sort of game, this is a great 5 minute alternative when you don't have the time for Dota or Dota Underlords"
12594,oldukça başarılı bir strateji oyunu ve çok zevkli.
12595,"HELLO GUYS I PLAY WITH MY FRIEND AND HIM AND THE ENEMYS CANT LOAD IN THE GAME SO I WIN THE GAME FOR US YAY

#ROAD TO CHALLENGER
#100% WINRATE"
12596,Relatively easy game with need of strategic thinking.
12597,Excellent game!! Mini strategy card type!!
12598,the game shows promise
12599,"So fun that it's ridiculous. So ridiculous that it's fun. So addictive that grinding for cards is a joy. Skill and strategy is rewarded but you can also hang around in lower arenas just to goof around with a deck. 

2vs2 is a blast!

If you´re like me and sometimes get anxious playing against other players, this game make that go away :)"
12600,i love it .its so fun and the grafics are good to
12601,"GOOD...Funny and Good
"
12602,I leave this review cus they asked me to. But i like the game so no biggie
12603,"This game is amazing. I tried because of the free dlc, and I can confidently say that I'm pretty hooked on it. The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fluid, and you get a new experience by using different Masters."
12604,good
12605,"Simple yet enticing game.  Entertaining and different cards to collect to balance a deck, Too many high end cards and you'll be waiting for mana to charge up, while taking damage.  Seems balanced overall but more playtime will be needed :)"
12606,Basically clash royal. On steam. much cringe. Good game.
12607,"Cant find the exit button. Overall ok
"
12608,"Pretty good! Not pay 2 win
"
12609,XIII
12610,GG
12611,This game is simple and amazing
12612,"Great game. Very simple mechanics. Easy to play. A decent selection of cards to build a deck, and several Masters to choose. There are enough variations to allow different play styles and strategies.

I am still very early in the game play, so this review may get updated as I go.

Team battles are great, however I feel that more game modes, or map designs could vastly improve the game play and need for decision making skills.

The graphics are nice, for the style. 9/10
The audio is fairly simple and could be improved. 8/10
Balance, I can't really comment on at the moment.
Gameplay, I have not encountered any strange behavior or bugs.

Try it. I prefer grid map, turn-based strategy games, but this one is plenty of fun. I am sure there are other options out there just like this, but I have never given them a try. I am glad I did on this one."
12613,lots of fun! very competitive and strategic game
12614,"its a really great game, good job!"
12615,fun relaxing game
12616,best game in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12617,better then the others
12618,"Fun with friends, but why the battle pass tho?"
12619,"If you liked games such as Mighty Party or Clash Royale this may be the game for you! I've had a good time playing it thus far and it seems not to have as much of a power creep problem that I noticed in other games in the genre. For now, I say it's Free to Play so give it a try!"
12620,"Super fun, easy to start, deep enough to keep me interested."
12621,I am enjoying this game so far because it's well fun.. easy to understand
12622,Same old tower defens.
12623,Very approachable game and very fun. I definitely recommend.
12624,Fun game. The tutorial could be a little more helpful for crafting decks and cards though. I am still trying to get the hang of it.
12625,Cool game to pass the time
12626,"good
"
12627,Easy to get into. Quick matches but complex strategies with different card effects.
12628,"Basically clash royal without pay 2 win
1v1 and 2v2"
12629,"Its fun, easy to pick up, has a large amount of variety of units. I am having a great time so far."
12630,this is game that work
12631,"Fun little card game to play. Looks to have a pretty decent build system for teams and such and has quite a variety of cards from what i have sen and played with. Overall it's worth giving it a go, as it is FREE, and you never know it could be the game for you (Alas my internet is too unreliable as of late for me to become invested in this game)
8/10 (-2 solely because i havent played enough to give it a full and fair review based on time played but by my observations alone)"
12632,nicely developed. fun. enjoyable learning curve. I would recommend giving it a try
12633,Excellent especially with a friend on team match
12634,"Before any of you starts to say ""OMG IT IS PAY TO WIN""
They really make all the ways to be possible to everyone gets an good deck
From time to time, they even put some of the dlc's for free

""OH BUT IS CLASH ROYALLE""
yes and no
In this game you can really feel a greater strategic freedom, instead of having to deal with addictive decks and strategies, as in most parts of deck games.
In less than a week I was able to reach diamond position 5, even though I had few cards in the game.
About the ranking system.
There is no system that your card evolves or anything like (such as clash royale), at most you release the right to have more than one card on the deck.
It is extremely satisfying as they have a separate system for each game mode, 1v1, 2v2 and also have one for people who want players with predetermined groups (yes it has a rank for random players only).
Ways to win prizes (which I have learned so far).
Free daily prize (usually cash), daily mission, twitch drops, several unique game modes that take place in event form, ranking up prize, level up prize, free prize keys.
And there is also the ability to buy the specific card you want, which you get through a coin that accumulates every time you get a new card."
12635,"It's a simple, fast paced game. In all it's simplicity it has loads of complex strategies."
12636,It's fun
12637,only been playing for an hour or so but this is a great game 11/10 no problems (yet)
12638,The game it s wery fun intresting and good for tactic thinking to protect  the Terotory
12639,A really nice concept. enjoying very much thus far
12640,just started playing - seems nice :)
12641,Fun!
12642,Fun game.
12643,Free to play and its awesome!
12644,fun
12645,"its addictive!!
"
12646,"It's addictive, it's the same sort of card pack opening/drafting style of game that's so common these days with loot crates etc. But I honestly was drawn to the free promotion. Never would have bought it/played it if it wasn't made free, but im glad it was. Would recommend to friends :)"
12647,karen will never come back
12648,"i like the push back and forth and the quickness of each game is good for quick play 
"
12649,simple fun for anyone who cares to play some card games once in a while.
12650,"overall fun game. im enjoying the team battles so far. if u dont use money for getting upgrades u can still use the rotation master for free or grind for what u want so theres no worry there.
"
12651,fun
12652,"fun to play, and looks pretty good"
12653,"Quick, simple rounds. Brings some life to a card style game. Looking forward to spending more time with it."
12654,nice game
12655,"New look on a tower defense game, its coop/duos which is the greatest part. (death to lootboxs and (ea)!)"
12656,Бомба
12657,"I'm not good with reviews, but like, this game fun."
12658,GJ worth to play
12659,Good if you don't mind not knowing when you're fighting bots
12660,"යෝ යෝ ඔන්න ඉත්තෑවා අයින් කරන්න නියම ගේම් එකක් සනික අරගනින්... 
Good GAME :*"
12661,"Very similar to Clash Royale, with some added features afforded by it being a game for PC.

12670,Fun and easy to play with nice graphics :)
12671,cant SMOrc?? no huffer????
12672,"One of ""those"" games where you get inducted, then play an ""online""  match you easily ""win"" ... and then start to ""loose"" as you progress .... and magically get boosters to help you ""win"" ... and then it all goes downhill from there...micro transactions blah blah blah."
12673,"Just playd a few games but it seems prety fun for both casual players and harcore,"
12674,I like team battle :D
12675,"Great fun! Downloaded as a freebie, nice to pick up  and play off the bat, quick matches that get you hooked"
12676,its awesome

12682,"Actually fun. Easy to play, easy to get hooked."

12687,Loving it so far!
12688,nice game
12689,"is fun

a bit like td wars back in warcraft (without towers) and deck building

"
12690,"Nice game commended, an upgrade version of clash royale..."
12691,: )
12692,"What I'm looking for in games:
1) Simple
2) Easy to learn
3) Able to outthink/outmechanic players

The game has all 3 so I like it
It is also very fun 
9/10"
12693,Heaps of fun with friends. Easy to learn
12694,nice games
12695,Good so far
12696,good
12697,Is fun
12698,"its really simple game, and its really enjoyable game.

I recommended this game for who that have short free time. its only take only 3 to 5 minuts to finished the game."
12699,Good Game
12700,good relaxing game i decided to try on free weekend having fun soo far only played a few games hope i see some card diversity later one :D but its a blast so far !
12701,"I had seen this game on Youtube once and thought ""what a great looking game"", reminded me off star wars chess..... just a lot better. Never could find it again. 6 months Steam recommends the game, and i'm like ""there it is !!!!!""  Man, i am so glad that happened. Haven't stopped playing it since and i'm an hour in and cant wait to keep going. Very helpful tutorial style of introduction which is well designed. Set up so user has a positive experience straight away, which in my opinion is smart. 
Hopefully the game continues this same way. Anyhow back to it for me. Cheers. Solo Joelo"
12702,Good Game
12703,Easy going nice flow. Causal and serious play.
12704,Quick and simple game thats deceptively deep
12705,"Having just started the game, I must say it's got something for anyone - whether you like CCGs, RPGs or simply enjoy strategy games. It's also extremely intuitive as others have pointed out and 30 mins it, it already becomes fun and challenging. I see no reason not to try it."
12706,THIS GAME IS SOO GOOD
12707,"This game is awesome, u can play alone or with a friend it is amazing and funny!"
12708,"Really Good Game.

Only thing I'd say is lacking is the UI is a tad all over the place at times.

And grinding to unlocking cards can be a pain sometimes, but its not that bad.

"
12709,GOod game :P
12710,I dont like this kind of games but this one is fun.

"
12714,"The game is FREE, fun game, I also really like how character were design and there ability, collect all card you want, there lot of positive, but my negative is, there meta card's like best card and must have, if your planing on  beating your opponent."

12752,Game is fun and matches are quick. I just wish that you could buy rubins with in game gold
12753,So far so good! Its very easy to learn & quite entertaining. I look forward to mastering it.
12754,I rather like this game! It's free but they've been very generous with the content. I enjoy the voice acting quite a bit. The art style is charming and the game play is easy to pick up and has enough customization that I don't feel like im cookie cuttered build wise.
12755,Very Funny
12756,nice game
12757,i really like this game. i only came across one problem you guys might want to address in the future. you might want to consider a basic AI for the team battles if you teammate drops out for higher leagues or remove the point deduction for them leaving you high and dry. But other than that great work guys
12758,"Its actually pretty fun!
"
12759,good stuff
12760,good and enjoy

12773,"Only on early game so far, but it's very enjoyable. Team play is great, the cards are cool, and getting new cards so far is fairly simple. Highly recommend."
12774,"Something totally Different in a while, this is a well made game."
12775,I like this game <3
12776,great so far
12777,10/10
12778,this is some shit clash royale rip off. absolute garbage avoid at all cost
12779,Really fun game to pass the time with.
12780,Beautiful shot!
12781,"very fun, simple to get into yet solid strategy behind.  Well done.  Sadly all pvp."
12782,love the real-time response you can make in the game
12783,"This game is pretty fun, best played with a friend. would like to see 4v4 mode options in the future! 

It's f2p, so be aware of f2p-esque features (primo currency and the likes) but you are able to win games and stuff without them. 

maybe like 20% p2w and 80% matchups and strategy. 

Overall i recommend. its fun. thats all i can ask from it since i didn't spend a dime."
12784,fun game so far. playing with friends is the best
12785,It's really fun. when i first saw it it looked boring. but when u actually play it. its a whole new game. so fun. highly recomended
12786,just started the game but I am already wanting more
12787,"fun game, just love how much there is without being to hard to understand everything"
12788,"Fun, fast paced and easy to understand, nice game if you are into deck building games"
12789,fine game
12790,good
12791,pretty fun game somewhat similar to auto chess with more strategy and less rng
12792,"Fun with extremely quick matches, anything over 3 minutes is rare. Game has potential for pay to win, but seems to combat that by offering generous amounts of loot boxes for free."
12793,"Я потерял своего кабанчика (борова). А так да, игра хорошая. Всегда мечтал поиграть в нарды онлайн с друзьями."
12794,it's like clash royale but fun and not trying to molest your wallet
12795,Basically Clash Royale except with a great announcer guy :). Great game
12796,"fast paced, random variables basic off static set of units, my friends and i got it earlier today and haven't stopped playing since it's great."
12797,fun game enjoying it.
12798,"Easy to pick up, highly reccomend it."
12799,really fun game!
12800,Its addictive games and very fun
12801,Great way to waste some time. Also good strategy elements.
12802,love it
12803,Fun game easy to pick up
12804,"I am a very casual gamer. I play for fun, I don't like my games to be too hard. That's why I greatly dislike multiplayer games like this. But I play them every so often, mostly to play vs ai. 

I enjoy this game enough to be willing to play against the actual other players. that says a lot for me, it's not really my kind of thing. I'm digging the game style, and the way things are set up here. definately a game I'm willing to keep working on and enjoying."
12805,"Phone games, now available on steam. Come enjoy your skinner box mechanics designed to exploit your addictions! I mean...hobbies.. Now calling all whales, come spend your thousands of dollars on this!"
12806,easy to get in to
12807,fun
12808,This game is fun and can be intense at times but thats what makes it great to play.
12809,clash royale 2.0
12810,yea its ok for killing time 5/10 not great not awful
12811,"Ótimo jogo, viciante, com ótima mecânica pode jogar sem medo"
12812,good to try
12813,"The game is barely playable for me because of the random crashes all the time.
at first it only happened because of the split-screen option in the settings after that it kept happening randomly.
i tried to post on the about that in the bug report a month ago and tried to contact support but got no respond.
i guess the game is poorly optimized."
12814,Easy and fun to learn. I'm really enjoying it!
12815,so far really fun
12816,"game is good its casual and fun ive been playing since the very beginning
also the mechanics are quite in depth and the potential for strategy is huge like.. better than hearthstone in my opinion.,
also its cool to watch 
its fun to play with a friend.
its one of the only two player card games i rthink ive ever seen"
12817,A free game that's perfect to pass time and with no apparent ptw mechanics.
12818,Fun
12819,Addicting mini game! Love it :)
12820,"I only play this game cause I usually always win 
"
12821,Addictive! great short attention span gaming!
12822,I very like this game if it free:))
12823,"started playing, seemed pretty iffy, unsure of what units where good, how to place stuff, then i found out there are these things called scrats, super cheap weak units that flood the board.

scrats are offshoot warhammer skaven.

ive won my last 10 games by tossing rats at people.

free to play so its worth a try in my book"
12824,"Clean graphics, responsive UI, and a neat concept. Seems more consumer friendly than many games out there in a similar genre
"
12825,"So far so fun. 

It combines Hearthstone elements with a fun
top down arcadey-tower-defense type feel. 

It's good to relax and play, I wouldn't suggest
taking it too incredibly seriously until you 
get pretty high up in the ranks."
12826,Awesome game so far. Just getting into it but it has seem balanced and great.
12827,"Easy concept , Will change review after spending more time"
12828,"fun game like other games on smart phones, but i still prefer playing on my computer"
12829,Good game!
12830,"Fun game, much like clash royale but for PC and with some more complexity. Great price!"
12831,league of legends coc royale ripoff
12832,"Because it doesn't require a lot of thought, but there's tons of customization, and I am having fun playing coop with my girlfriend.

The matchmaking interface blows."
12833,"Nice game and enjoyable, it reminds me of a game on Mobile phone but PC is way better for enjoying things appropriately"
12834,"pretty fun, a bit concerned about micro transactions, that is really what will make or break my decision to continue playing
"
12835,Nice simple game
12836,Addictive game only complaint is the sand wars it looks too much like star wars
12837,"actually kinda fun
I was hesitant but not bad"
12838,Love it... The end.
12839,Simple fun if you want something quick and fast to play.
12840,"Overall, this game is fun. Very easy to grasp, and I do enjoy the minion design. The matches don't take long and has a lot of room to grow. However, I would only recommend this game with decent graphics. I had a minor freeze up during a match after my first lost. I would recommend this game to others when they have the time. The market however is still confusing, and the upgrades currency works for everything. This does feel like a casual game though, so it may get tedious in future game play, unless you get the DLC content for expansion units and spells. SO it will take some time to get that perfect team."
12841,Pretty fun.  I'm about 45 minutes in and I am hitting a stride with the low skill floor.  Tactics are (blessedly) generously grasped.  I'm not much of a TCG or MOBA guy but it's a little more accessible than other similar titles in my limited experience.  Bite sized play sessions are easier to stomach than prolonged and fruitless exchanges of HOTS that ultimately terminate in a loss because I can't git gud.  Worth a decent review at least.
12842,Better than some phone game I remember playing.
12843,"just another battle royale garbage copy.....nothing new, interesting, or unique."
12844,Is good
12845,This game is good! I will keep this game since it is cheap
12846,"good so far
"
12847,If you enjoy Clash Royale you will enjoy this game. Similar idea but has a refreshing twist that makes each game a little more interesting.
12848,Similar as clash royal. Good animation. And It is free now ̣20/8/2019
12849,"It was fun, but now it's all childish emotes and crap. I'm not a 4 year old kid, so I'll have to quit playing this game now."
12850,"the game is pretty cool, you should give it a try."
12851,Awesome quick based game for all ages. It has a low entry level and you can build up to high skill levels and pro levels. Solo or team based.
12852, fun
12853,ITS AWSOME
12854,Solid example of free to play done right that has nailed the early game balance.
12855,very fun and easy to play. simple strategy game that passes the time
12856,"Good game for a FTP so far, will stick with it for a bit and see how it goes."
12857,"So far to start its been rather fun, a rush of back and forth play that leaves you wanting more hehe"
12858,"Idk why but its so addictive
"
12859,pree guuud
12860,Fun game.....Definitely a different type of card game :)
12861,"The game so far is appealing, with a combination of colourful visuals and witty comedic commentary. The game appears to be balanced thus far, however, this will be subject to playing further into the game. A fun game that I would recommend to pass the time, especially considering that it is free! :)"
12862,It's pretty fun so far. It has a bit of LoL vibe to it but without the whole map. Team battles are fun. I haven't played to much but it's pretty addicting. I like the strategy between deck building and needing to have troops on the field. You can't have all heavy hitters because you sometimes need a quick spawn to defend.
12863,it fun time waster
12864,Great game
12865,"Cool game! Similar to Clash Royale but also has capture points and stuff that give it a bit more strategy. Got it on Discord Store when it launched and played for probably 10 hours or so on there. In case you're not sure if you should get it, it's free!"
12866,Quirky announcer that makes the game even more enjoyable. Minion Masters isn't a large file game. Instructions/Rules are simple  for veterans or beginner players.  The game has a new feel atmosphere as it has only been out for a few months. Friendly developers from reading the updated notes on past patches. Matches are not long and rather a great way if you are a streamer who needs to play a secondary game while waiting for the primary one you are playing.  Noted this is not turned based game play.
12867,Just started playing but I'm already loving this game. The combination of the CCG with the real time battle is awesome.
12868,Having fun so far. More later.
12869,"its a fasz paced tower defence card game. with lots of cards, factions and options. its free to play and you can still kick a$$ without spending any money. i however did spend money bc i like how the devs aproach things. they listen to feedback, buff and nerf cards if they get too strong or week. also, unlike other cardgames, where with every new expansion, you have to collect a whole bunch of new cards, here they only add 2 new cards. i returned to the game after a year and my cheap zoo deck was performing just as well as the day i left. and with the new expansion, they added cards to my favorite faction, the outlanders, and now i can play with space marines, flying drones and a big fkn tank that shoots at stuff and it has 2 side lazer weapons that make pew pew pew.. yes, recomended"
12870,Fun little time waster
12871,"Holy crap, this game is excellent. The rhythm to the gameplay is so tight and nuanced that you really need to pay attention and make snap decisions that could make or break the game. There's randomness but in a good way, the back and forth is solid, and the art makes for some eye-pleasing gameplay."
12872,Its fun
12873,"Great game, love it"
12874,"Tons of free stuff if you know where to look. Game is relatively fair, though, as with any F2P game, throwing money at it gets you A LOT very quickly."
12875,ITS FUN
12876,"Take a break from your versus basic games. This one is fun, and for fun. :)"
12877,"Love this game! YES it's free to play, YES it has in game purchases, but you don't NEED to pay to win! I love this game. It's a great game for anyone who likes these types of games, matches can be super short, and you can just keep grinding! Lots of cards and a good amount of masters to unlock!"
12878,Ebic
12879,Enjoyable pace of battle. Unit combat looks convincing. Fun pick'me up ^.^
12880,More fun than some triple A games. Recommend
12881,very fun
12882,cool man
12883,"This is a really fun game, games are usually quick and very moreish, you also get regular loot and rewards at least when beginning, my only comment is that some of the champions seem much better than others, at least in my limited experience."
12884,"fun, quick... and loot.  not boring either."
12885,"Played a few games when the popup showed up to leave review.
For the time i have played. this has been a great experience.
Fun sounds, good jokes, feels rewarding as well to play with all the rewards straight away.
Funny game in general.
I love the introduction to the game, no BS, just straight in.
Nicely made tbh!
For what i have seen so far, i would advise this game.
Good development!"
12886,This game is unique. I used to be a huge magic and hearthstone player and this is a fresh taste.
12887,This is a very relaxing game. Not to difficult so you can just have fun.
12888,Simple to learn and quick to get started.  Despite outward appearances of being hectic. it is actually fairly easy to control.
12889,"Minion Masters is easy to get into and doesn't waste your time. The business model is very fair and it runs great on my old hardware.  Matches are quick and rewards are plentiful!

Check it out if you want some light RTS action with CCG mechanics!!"
12890,good
12891,"I don't like much competitive multiplayer games, but this has team battles, and they are quite fun."
12892,"It has a really cool style, I love the quirky and hilarious jokes of the announcer and I can tell the creators care about the game! Having a lot of fun so far, keep it up :D!"
12893,Great stuff
12894,For a free to play game this has been a wonderfully fun and relaxing experience!!  Would recommend to anyone who likes strategy games!
12895,"the game in my opinion is worth it when it's free however i can't condem 30 dollars 

it like a clash royal, but anime art style and funny answer [sorry for my bad spelling ]

honestly get it when it free then support the developer but honestly i wouldn't do that till the game became free to play"
12896,"Like Clash Royale on PC, its good and simple to play.
Haven´t played a lot to know better, but give it a try!"
12897,재밌는데?
12898,good job
12899,yea i think everybody knows this is a clash royale clone. its good tho
12900,perron pa matar la aburricion xD
12901,Very fun
12902,"لعبة  جيده و بسيطة - مثل كلاش رويال 
---------------------------
    اللعبة ممتعه بشكل كبير و الفريق مهتم في اللعبة بشكل اكبر 
 --------------------------

فيها افكار حلوه مثل 2 ضد 2 ..و درفت .. واشياء ثانيه معروفه في العاب مشابهه
وبطبع فيها متجر و سكنات و تشري بكجات ^_^

لكن في المجمل لعبة ممتعه"
12903,aWESOME GAME
12904,so far so good!
12905,It's a VS game very similar to clash royale BUT with all the charm and fun of forced showdown! I think its a great little game and I'll probably keep playing it. It's free so give it a shot and see what you think
12906,It's fun ! :D
12907,better than CR
12908,good gam
12909,The team battle is just amazing! but the tutorial is a bit wierd. Could be done better
12910,"Nice real time strategy card game, which is easy to learn and fun.
Most matches last about 3-8 minutes. So it´s a good game if you just have little time to play.

The biggest downside of the game is that it is too grindy without spending real money by buying the ingame shard currency.
I didn't payed anything so far and I miss about 15 legendary cards. 
The good thing is that you can either win or craft cards, but legendaries just require too many crafting materials (2000 shards) from my point of view. 1000 to 1500 would be a more reasonable price. 
Nevertheless most big DLCs were free for a limited time and the game gets regular updates.
So I would still recommend it.
Try it out, it´s free!"
12911,HMMM. WAS REDIRECTED TO LEAVE A REVIEW.
12912,"Mix of clash royale, hs"
12913,A Really good and fun game i recommend it and it's free witch is very good.
12914,"Played a bit, is quite fun.
Either I am lucky as fuck with my enemies or I just drew a good minion combination, but it right now it is fun. No P2W that is so blatantly obvious that you instantly regret even downloading the game (there are some games like that) and to be precise I have yet to see anything that I need to pay to get.

To describe the game itself; it's simple strategy where you learn by fighting on what unit is the best for what scenario, can get complex and really fast if the you get past the 5 minute mark since then it's almost just minion spam except that you need to still watch out where you place whom.

All in all, I recommend it, but unless you are a fan of simple strategy (at least simpler than card games) you will not be putting in 10 hours a day but it is a good game to play once a day/week.



Let's hope this won't be like Battlerite, a game that looked fun but failed miserably in the skill department where depending on your char and your enemy you simply can't win against him unless you are some gaming god and I pray that this game will keep being simple and fair.
Also props to BetaDwarf, Forced is a nice coop game I played at my friends house and I never would've expected this to be from them since it is quite different."
12915,Its a copy of clash royale but its much better
12916,"pros:
- makes a lot of fun ( especially premade 2v2 )
- free to play ( u also can get many stuff from the marked and even season passes for free, because u get crystals easily with quests and rank ups. every dlc wich comes out, is also free for the 1st week )
- regularly new cards and events
- no pay to win possibilitys
- hard ranking reset every month ( if u climb up again u farm enough crystals for battlepass )
- u dont need rare cards to make good plays

cons:
- many bots til gold rank"
12917,Played the first 3 Games and wanted to close it. But there is no exit button.
12918,"Good stuff, pls add more !!!"
12919,"Not bad at all, Worth trying."
12920,easy to pick up and fun so far
12921,good game
12922,Its fun with a friend and its free so not a bad deal.
12923,"Major connection issues. Other games work fine. Seem to get stuck in an infinite ""loading"" screen before battles, and if you exit the game it counts as a loss. Will rate thumbs up if the connectivity gets fixed."
12924,"It's basically a high-rez, better version of Clash Royale"
12925,lootboxes are bad  also i hate this game
12926,It's a great game and well done. Just like Heartstone with cards but this got some action in it.
12927,This game is awesome! I recommend you to play it! It's very fun.
12928,"Good pace at the start pretty smooth. Interested in the twitch integration since I stream.
"
12929,"Cool and simple game, also  free so that's a plus too."
12930,This was a fun find on Steam.
12931,"Ok, it's free and it's less boring than other card games because it has more active gameplay and it's all  of positivity I can muster.

It's basicly thrash of a game like heartstone, magic or whatever other card game, only diffrence being style of playing. There is meta and you better stick with it or else you are screwed and ofcourse this meta is not in favor of freeloaders like me. If you want another part time job to grind for things or wanna spend a lot of cash on freemium game, be my guest and go for it, for the rest: just stay away.

I have no clue why devs bothered making this game for PC since it's just bound to fail here. IMHO it would net them more cash as mobile game."
12932,"[b]My favourite game.[/b]
Easy to pick up, 
lots of possibilities to design your deck, 
not microtransaction-dependent,
and very fun to play alone or with friends.

Only con that newly introduced cards or masters can be unbalanced at first.

9/10"
12933,"Addictive and fun game, easy to learn hard to master, solid graphics, and gameplay. Doesn't require to much time, a match takes 5-6 min. Plenty of rewards, and not pay to win, which is something to look for in free-games like this, but happy to report, paying does give a small advantage but it's not pay to win at all."
12934,yes portugal
12935,This game is a simple yet addicting game to play. Very easy to learn and I can't seem to put it down!
12936,"This game is good if your looking for something to pass the time, it is well balanced, and tons of fun!"
12937,"Very fun, seems very good playing with a mate too!"
12938,"great way to pass time ,very fun and enjoyable"
12939,"While I love this game's mechanics, it's a never again for me: Toxic Community (including mods), cheaters, spammers, jumpers, reporting button for teammate only, poor matchmaking, etc. This may have been good at one time, but that time has passed"
12940,Fun little time waster
12941,Its like clash royal but better and way more options.
12942,It's well done and fair with new players.
12943,"quick and easy to gtet grips with with a tiered level up combat very pleased with it
"
12944,Love the art style and gameplay
12945,"Really fun so far! The game seems easy for me, and I hope to generate more players (: Thank you for making this game!"
12946,"super fun,  like MTG or heathstone but without the thinking. ;) 
"
12947,"This game is hella fun.  It reminds me of a WarCraft 3 UMS map i used to play.  It has lots of cool stuff added like the card collection to build 'decks'.  There's a nice learning curve, strategy, and room to be creative in your own deckbuilding rather than copying other decks like hearthstone etc."
12948,gg
12949,"seems alright so far, asked me for opinion 15 minutes in so need more time"
12950,"it's a good tower defense vs game, would like more of a PvE aspect to it though"
12951,"A Unique, skill-based game with a cool art style and almost humorous theme. I love this game because matches are fast and there are plenty of ways to change up my play experience. This is not pay to win. You need to realize a few key strategies, and then early game cards can easily earn your way to Master or even Grand Master ranks"
12952,­
12953,Ive played a wee bit. Devs give free shit. I like this game and the developer. Its free now but if u need a key message me
12954,goodgame not THAT pay2win
12955,its good fun with your friends!
12956,fun.... just fun
12957,"Excellent game, fun to play"
12958,GG
12959,feels like clash royale or heroic great game i understand the concept. fun PC game
12960,very fun and entertaining.
12961,"CRACK. You have been warned.

Hey Kids, Drug are bad m'kay? Just play MM instead.

I have been gaming for 40 years, and MM is hands down one of the best games ever. 

In my top 5 of all time. Slick. Fun. Fast. Rewarding. 

Get your adrenaline and reward hook in this game.

60 hours in 4.5 days since I installed it. And yes I have a full time job.


UPDATE 1 week after installing:

I have somehow logged 95 hours since I installed this exactly 7x24 = 168 hrs ago. 

That means in one week I have spent 33 hours 'living' (ie sleeping, bio-breaks and commuting to/from  work).

Wtf is wrong with me, I will be in Rehab by Christmas if I don't stop.



WHY THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING:

Imagine an instance in an MMO condensed into a 5-10 minute game (often less!).

You enter the instance at 0 experience and you level to 125 in that time frame.

Only the mobs in the instance are decided by another real player (or 2 in co-op) and not by some shitty AI code.

The instance however, only has one room, and it is booby trapped differently by the other players all the time. You can learn the traps and tricks by playing more and more.

But they are never, ever, ever, ever the same. Like, NEVER.

DId I mention that you can do all this for FREE?

And no it is not P2W either - if you want to save time you can just buy some in-game currency  to make collecting cards faster.

It is genuinely a 100% totally free game, and you can get all 100% of the content by just playing regularly.

FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. FREE. BUT....

I am a developer so BetaDwarf are getting all my spare cash from now on. 

They are my Drug Dealer of choice.

Ok, Honey Bunny, just one more game..."
12962,Very cool game!
12963,Minion Masters is a really fun tactical game. Picture a live action chess board with a variety of units and spells. You can play solo or with a partner which is a neat twist on the genre. Another nice feature is that it's not pay to win at all. If you like strategy and quick thinking then this is your game.
12964,g
12965,fun way to waste time
12966,Not Bad.
12967,"Easy to learn and great to enjoy in short or long bursts as you like. Average game takes a few minutes, longer for 2vs2 team battles. Lots of content to enjoy from ranked to vs AI, draft modes and more. It's a Free to play game, but doesn't feel pay to win. Decently generous rewards for ranking up, winning etc. Moba/card game/tower defense combo that's very appealing. Will definitely keep playing."
12968,"Lots of fun and quick matches
"
12969,Game kicks ass!
12970,"Fun game, the counters are pretty easy to understand."
12971,addicting and fun
12972,A MOBA tha lays perfectly with a controller!
12973,Really nice to play with my best bud. 2v2 is a really nice mode
12974,GREAT GAME!
12975,-_-
12976,"I've decided to uninstall today. The game is rather frustrating due to developers ""going by feel"" with game balance. Morellia has been nerfed 4x and rebuffed twice. The latest update shows how many times developers flip flop on their designs. Changing cards abilities to only later, change them back again.  2 examples, combustion and hugger both being reverted back to near what they were before they changed them last time. Additionally the season ticket has continuously offered players less and less for the same money (rubies/premium currency). It's an all around disappointment. I feel sorry for the kickstarters of this game as developers are just clearing them out. I'm sure they will advertise and get a new fanbase that is ignorant to the past mistakes/grievances
 and money grabs."
12977,Laid back strategy
12978,Fun and addicting and fairly unique
12979,Great game
12980,"Very good Game its like Clash royal,without p2w element!
Great job Dev!
Updates coming right at your door!"
12981,"Nothing comes close to Minion Masters
Amazing game play ✓
Smooth sexy graphics ✓
Great community ✓
Amazing devs who give every expansion away for free on release !✓
10/10  Nothing comes close to this game its the best card game ✓
Jog on hearthstone✓"
12982,"My name is odinN, and I recommend this game that must play everyone!"
12983,it good
12984,This game prompted me to leave this review. It seems fun maybe?
12985,Not a bad game. A good time waster and is easy on any machine.
12986,games frickin dope mate
12987,"
its a simple, fun game.  Graphics are good and there is a lot of daily quest to keep you busy.  Give it a try and you might stay for a spell or two."
12988,it's good
12989,"good combo of good games. Will see how much pay to win there is later.
"
12990,Very dynamic. I'm enjoying so far...
12991,fun relaxing
12992,easy controls and very fun
12993,"Who knew a genre-blender of deckbuilding, tower defense, and RTS could work so well? Well not me, the name 'Minion Masters' sounded so generic I didn't think it was worth my time trying out.

Boy do I hate being wrong."
12994,its a good game
12995,DUDE LITERALLY JUST STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME AND ITS FUN AS FUCK. IM JUICE WRLD AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE
12996,"Super bon jeu vraiment, c'est très EXTRA, meilleur que Clash Royal! Continuez excellent travail!"
12997,"Seems balanced, plenty of rewards and even a store for those who want to buy more stuff."
12998,I like it. not sure why.
12999,"Seems interesting so far. 
Haven't really played enough to say if it's good or not for me, but at the moment seems alright. 
Definitely worth giving it a try especially since the it's free."
13000,good game
13001,"Minion Masters is sort of like Hearthstone but actually fun, and instead it's in the Tower Card-Playing Defense genre. Similar to games like Clash Royale, Minion Masters has some unique takes on the genre that make it more interesting and I'd argue a better game. Oh, but it's buggy as f*ck. Don't be surprised if you or someone else gets disconnected maybe 1 out of any 5 given games. Seriously, please fix this. Otherwise, overall good game."
13002,"At this time its a ok game you should give it a try, the most fun to have is in team battle."
13003,"Pretty fun game! Have only played for a bout an hour. Feels really simple, I haven't lost a single game yet. Will keep playing to see if it gets difficult."
13004,addicted
13005,"Seems like a different version of Hearthstone that has it's own quirks, I think I'm going to enjoy it."
13006,complete h-o-r-s-e-s-h-i-t !
13007,gg
13008,Quick and lots of fun
13009,great
13010,Really great game.
13011,"nice game , pretty original for the janra"
13012,Great simkple game. Different modes to play and a quick time killer. Rather emjoyable
13013,"Very fun and easy to jump into and play, usual loot crate bs BUT these are easily accessible without paying through your nose for doubles of cards and content"
13014,:)
13015,"Great game, makes interesting use of minion mechanics."
13016,Great fun and quick to learn but challenging to master!
13017,It makes me feel like a general on the battlefield! And you can co-op with a friend on the same side as you; that's great!!
13018,"Great game, awesome graphics, and best with a friend!!!"
13019,"really fun, alot like clash royale"
13020,I Really love this Game! It's a Battle Game and I like Battle Games
13021,It's alright.
13022, FUN!
13023,its fun and its like Clash royale
13024,Super awesome da
13025,Controled game
13026,"Fun game so far. I know I don't have a lot of time in the game, but I would just give it a shot if you were thinking about playing it."
13027,"its good, its free, its fun!"
13028,"Don't usually write reviews but this game asked if I would so why not! Still pretty new to it but it's really easy to pick up and a lot of fun to play. I haven't done much solo play, as soon as I hit level 6 (1 battle after the tutorial) I unlocked team battles and have been playing with a friend sense. Honestly, it's the most fun i've had with a free to play game in a long time. Love the deck building aspect of the game, the masters have some fun abilities and the minions are a lot of fun to see fight each other. It's just an all around fun game!"
13029,"""Gifting"" people an unsolicited F2P game is incredibly lame of the publisher and clutters up the gift window unless you accept it, forcing people to add it to their library. Added dev to my block list, and I will never consider playing a game from them in the future due to their heavy handed advertising methods."
13030,"Developers love their game.
Nice mechanics, good graphics.
Gameplay is indeed balanced.


Updates sometimes are slow :P
Great content potential"
13031,best strategy game ever!! you should play this game
13032,"This game has a great tutorial for beginners.
Easy controls and gameplay. The artwork's are nice as well."
13033,"Morellia ruins the game, I've played to Master and while I still win more than half of the games, you pretty much HAVE to end the game before your opponent reaches skill 3 or, in most cases, the Dragon just cheeses you. To kill the dragon, you either have to blow cards on it until it dies, assuming it doesn't kill you first, have cards put in your deck JUST for the dragon and hope they work, because one is random and the other is high cost and only cuts its HP to half, and it has a lot of HP, OR hope your opponent sucks and lets you just drop two shock prods on it and lets them hit the thing for MINUTES, since they only do barely any damage each hit, and the thing has nearly 2K HP. 

Besides the metawhores who play Morellia and all run the same deck, there's also the Chinese players who have infinite mana and can seemingly play any card from their deck at any time. The devs do nothing about this and don't even have a report feature. Apparently to them summoning 12 Cleavers over a few seconds is fine and normal. I can only recommend this game at high levels of play if one-Master meta is fixed, but low level play can be relatively enjoyable. Matches are typically five minutes and team games are decent."
13034,How nice the strategy game is!
13035,Loving The Game Hope More Features 2 Come 1 of the best!!
13036,funny and relaxing game
13037,Very fun and interactive
13038,"basic game is good

but most important matching system is holy terrible.

i saw meet same people 5 times in a low. there is no reasonable team match.

match by only rank not reasonable. short period rank season also problem.

i can't understand this. and disconnect tool maybe exist.

only appeal this free. and so many people play short and leave soon. 

at last only few people left.

i want question to developer ""do u have played online match???"""
13039,Great game and it's pretty easy to get addicted. But it's no fun anymore -  Morellia is totally unbalanced and way too powerful. It's practically impossible to win against her. She needs a lot of balancing. Sadly the game is destroying itself with it and loosing a lot of players along with it.
13040,Relaxing lighthearted. the 2v2 mode is tons of fun
13041,Pretty good. Doing this cause I was prompted to. LOL!
13042,Nice looking game has good balance and short match finding time
13043,"similar to clash royale, a lot of fun and pretty well made game and has some tactics and what not, i give it a thumps up"
13044,Huh.
13045,"Pretty fun, atleast with friends, nice game to waste some time on from time to time."
13046,"Solid , well thought out."
13047,Been playing allot of auto chess latley and got me into the looking at other similar games as i like to play mobas this game kind of put the 2 together and been enjoying it allot so far :)
13048,"I came back to this two years after picking it up during a stint of having my off hand injured and keeping me from games I wanted to play, and while I did make a point of picking up the -free- DLC that the devs put up (every new release of DLC that I have seen has been available for -free- for at least a few days after it launches) I really didn't touch it much. After dusting it off for the first time in a while I was quickly whisked away into the lovely blitz of short and fierce games in ranked duels and found that nothing fundamentally has changed. 

Sure, cards I used before sure have changed around a bit, making old tricks no longer useful or a bit more cumbersome to pull off, but all in the name of flavor and differentiating the factions that the cards represent. I was also pleased to see at least two new Masters to play as and scooped the second Outlander as my newest purchase because frankly why not - though new players bear in mind that your Master has no real implication on how you build your deck, and you should strive to brew a synergy that mixes different characters with different factions for fun results!"
13049,Great for a free to play game.
13050,Is pretty good aye.
13051,its a pretty simple game... but its pretty fun.
13052,ITS HEAT
13053,idk man most games like this are boring  but hoooooooowie not this one. its loads better with a friend. great fun that makes you think.
13054,"Game is fun, challenging, and exciting....especially when winning battles...."
13055,amazing
13056,Nice time killer and fun to play next to your main game.
13057,"Interesting to say the least, it reminds me of a more well rounded version of the Magic:the gathering game for the original xbox"
13058,Entertaining good to play with friends.
13059,!!
13060,i like it
13061,"Note:  This is not a P2W game.  You can get all cards in the game in one way or another.  You can craft any card in the game by using shards.


"
13062,DS2 IS GUD
13063,"Freaking fun and addictive , great for what it is."
13064,"This game is easy, fun, and quick. Plus it's free, so that's cool."
13065,Used to play this game before it initially released. Was a lot of fun. Starting on a new account now unfortunately but it'll be fine. I still know the strats that work well hah
13066,"Simple game in concept, however allows for a lot of depth. The way the game plays feels really nice."
13067,"Minion Masters is a good game, although it has a serious balancing issues. There a combos with either masters/cards that can quickly overwhelm you in a matter seconds. Also, the game works well with my potato laptop, the game has not crashed since I began to play it.  It takes time to collect cards and masters but its a good experience for a F2P games.

Update 1: Again, this game continues to work on my potato (Intel HD Broadwell) and have not suffered any crashes. I forgto to mention that there are expeditions, a type of ""singleplayer"" (you fight against other players) but you need to complete certain objectives to get more points."
13068,Great game
13069,fun game
13070,"Very fun and fast paced strategy game! Lots of deck possibilities. Many different modes. Easy to get into and hard to master.

But it takes over a year to get the best cards and climb the ladder as free to play. Play in short sessions. 

It is free so definitely give it a try."
13071,Fun! Or pay to win....
13072,Its good !
13073,so far a fun game
13074,just good for the relaxing man
13075,Quite fun.  Skill AND strategy come into play.
13076,trash
13077,this game is free and also really fun with friends its fun just to watch everything get so hectic on the screen and at the edge of my seat :D
13078,Funny little game for the break!
13079,"Pretty straight forward, classic TD with a twist"
13080,"good game
enjoy it"
13081,"So i've been playing this game for about an hour now, and i have to say :D i enjoy playing so far. Reminds me of clash royale and the new auto chess games"
13082,gg
13083,i have not played much but from what i have played it's pretty fun
13084,"Free, fun, user friendly, comical battle game. Is well worth the hard drive space, a game that keeps on giving."
13085,Starts out very good but very soon turns into pay to win hell.
13086,its a funny game
13087,Good tutorial. Fun game.
13088,fun game liked the voice overs
13089,Fun and easy
13090,"Its fun .........until you reach high ranks and get matched against premade teams. Matches like that more or less last 2 mins as you struggle to cast your creatures against all their counters.

Its fun ......until you stop leveling up every 2-3 matches and instead every 20+, earning a pitiful 80 gold per game, when one normal token costs 1000 and you actually can get the same cards over and over so youre not even getting the potential of a better deck.

Its fun .....until you notice the daily quests are simply daily quest (singular) giving you something between 1000-1600 gold ....again, just enough for one single token.

Its fun until you notice that the ""free token"" you get daily gives around 50-100 gold or 20 shard or 10 rubies.

Its fun until you notice that theres a ""free Pass"" and a ""battle pass"" for battle rank of the season. the free pass gives you some shit reward every 2 ranks and if you want a go at the super rewards of the ""battle pass"", you gotta pay up 1500 rubies, which is around 11$ CAN. 

In short : the first 15-20 hours are fun, after that, you hit a brick wall like any other F2P games out there. Either you pay up, or you match against people twice your level (which means nothing besides more hours played) with prolly better cards or setup because they actually have more choice in cards than you to build an actual decent deck."
13091,Solo and Team Battles with lots of minion variety. Overall fun game.
13092,Fun. Simple to learn. More strategy that is obvious at first glance. Well worth FREE!
13093,"AAAAAAARRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhh.

This game is getting worse and worse..."
13094,"it's a fun game, and it's not p2win...nuff said.
it's rare for a good quality free game to NOT be p2w. this game is a breath of fresh air in the free2play genre."
13095,10/10 It's lit.
13096,Good Game User Friendly
13097,Fun game with a cool concept fun mechanicsb  and cool cards!
13098,"A spoko, luźna giera. ;]"
13099,Really great game!
13100,Relaxing . Easy to pick up fun game.
13101,"The main problem of the game is, that there are too many cards (I, for example, have around 200 cards, but I only use 20 of them). 

Maybe if you were able to sell/discard your cards it would be better."
13102,"be warned this game is addictive, BUT it is also a pay to win game."
13103,"Game is pretty fun and quick to learn
"
13104,"Great game, well balanced, and lots of fun!"
13105,very nice game. recommend
13106,just like clash royal
13107,fun game
13108,"It is a great variation of supercells battle royale. It's good to have a differend kind of a game on the same genre. 

Game is not buggy sometimes mid-battle game slows just a litte but it could be my gpu too.

Game is a bit hard to master & learn - discover cards required which could be proccessed though playing so keep on playing give it a chance od not abandon it quick ^^"
13109,Really fun and unique
13110,Gotta love the Team Battle!
13111,Thumbs up
13112,SO good game :D
13113,"this is pretty fun. 
its like a better version of the autochess stuff that is getting so popular right now."
13114,just started playing and this game really fun hope it keeps up
13115,"Cute game,"
13116,"Easier to pick up than I thought and is really really fun to play, yet it is a strategic game."
13117,is cool
13118,perfecto
13119,if morellia is removed then i want nothing to do with this game
13120,Just start it looks fun
13121,"So far pretty good, matchmaking is quick, game is responsive. The matches don't last too long and the gameplay is easy to get into but seems deep to master. I can't comment on late game or how competative is, but casual is pretty fun."
13122,Very fun game!
13123,oynamayın
13124,"Enjoying the game very much! 
Disfrutando el juego muchisimo!
Macht spass !"
13125,Simple and fun game to pass your time .. :)
13126,"This free to play game just throws you right into the fun. Its a quick download and highly populated instantly accessible minion wave game.

I dig it."
13127,Great mechanics and animations and love the fan service
13128,best gameeeeeeeeeee^0^^0^
13129,phone died so i went to look for something to play while it charged and 4 hours later I'm still at my desk playing this awesome game XD
13130,"It's really not bad until you hit higher ranked play (low-Diamond and up) where two cards end up losing you the game.

Devs are really generous with giveaways in the game and if you are active you can amass a vast amount of cards without much effort.

Original review: Drop money to get two handfuls of UNBALANCED Legendaries or lose to people who did."
13131,awesome game just getting started but i like the different cards to strategies great  game
13132,"Really a fun game to play
gameplay and effects make a good combo"
13133,"Fast and easy way to blow some steam off, friendly interface and nice animations"
13134,"this game has a smooth feel to it, and it really does a great way of combining both quick time rts, card game, and even hints of a auto chess/ moba feel. rewards are fun and cool and it quick enough to keep attention of most players."
13135,its a fun and simple card game with a good twist but i feel like it has enough depth to play for a good time
13136,good
13137,"I am reviewing Minion Masters.

It is free and while I play it I don't hate it.

This is the end of my review."
13138,Great game! one of my favorite genre of games with some great mechanics and twists! I will keep going with these guys they know what they are doing!
13139,"I enjoy these types of games and hope we see more like it. Reminds me of WC3 custom maps.

Solo Adventures are a nice addition."
13140,"Very fun game, not p2w, helps my stream grow, more strategy than luck..makes this an all around good game. Keep it up and join me at www.twitch.tv/falcn_2001"
13141,"So can i have my money back now that this shit is free???
Its a pay to win game that started off as a fun 5 dollar game...
BTW  the game becomes an annoying grind for anything atfer a while...
I just dont understand the decision to make it f2p and p2w ...
I mean the playerbase was doing fine when it was buy 2 play ..."
13142,Good straight forward fun game
13143,great game
13144,fun and easy to jump into
13145,Simple and fast matches
13146,yeah
13147,Prepare for the salt.
13148,very nice game with the great graphic if the game is stay on like this i gonna like this game a lot
13149,"Starts out nicely but very quickly turns into pure grind for basic cards. Don't expect to do any advanced deck building unless you first sink in hundreds of hours or dollars to get decent cards.

Worth to try since it's free to play, but I don't recommend spending any currency."
13150,"playing with mah buddy, real nice concept from old wc3!"
13151,Super Spiel!
13152,"I saw the game ads somewhere i forgot, the game look dumb-fun card game so i give a shot, need quick match and ready to go anywhere its the game for you..

thats what im thinking before,in fact i quite enjoy the game bought myself season pass and im actually i got everything on current season pass 
got myself too 90% of current card in the game inc Nyrvir and i can spam 2 dragon at once,,yes fun fun

but thing is this game title seem wrong to be called minion master..

its should be called Chain Lightning the game
or Magma Storm master

cheap spells wiped entire minion on map that everyone spam so damn annoying
you cant build anything, shit just getting destroyed in sec

not cancerous enough?? yepp there's thing called ""wild card"" where u can add 2 duplicate card of your choice
and yes 1 guy able to use 3 chain lightning at once or 3 magma storm at once

JUST GIVE A SHOT !!  and feel the cancer"
13153,"I loved the game but the devs keep destroying it.

First: people say its p2w
But its veeeery far from being p2w. You get so many things from quests and free stuff, i never spent any money and have every card available, which you dont need btw.

Sadly the big point is that the devs just cant balance this game correctly. 
Weve seen it several times already, and i just play for about half a year now but i still remember the stormy times, which was UNCHANGED for MONTHS even after countless people complained about it.

Now we have the same with the new master morellia, who is just the best master by far.
And instead of adressing her problems they just nerfed some small numbers. And nerfed one of her mechanics (which was fine without her, meaning that other balanced cards that used this are now nerfed without a reason)

In the end this means that there is again another thing in the game that breaks it completely and is UNCHANGED for MONTHS. 

Im sorry. I loved this game but this just ruined the whole fun. Please get your stuff together and fix things like this faster, because im not the only one that left because of your poor balancing choices.


Editing my review:

After ANOTHER month they are gonna nerf her book with 5 seconds cooldown? 
Many people want a rework of her because shes just so stupid but you know what?
Everyone is using cursebearer because its one of the cards that can at least counter her but they nerf it :) Thats the end for me, after playing again and losing in the highest league multiple times just because they were able to spam their garbage dragon im done. Have fun destroying your game, it was a nice time but im gone until this garbage is redesigned.


Btw this whole post im not even talking about the whole wildcard exploits that makes the game super unbalanced and some combos just obnoxious. Instead of dealing with that they rather nerf totally balanced cards. Bye."
13154,Great game so far :)
13155,"fun
"
13156,remember that game kenny played on south park where all the angels and demons fought on his gameboy? its kinda like that
13157,good game
13158,fun game
13159,This is a great game but if the other player got better card then GG bros
13160,"Do you recommend this game?

Yes
 
"
13161,"I have only played the game for a day so i can't leave a very comprehensive review, but i'm liking the experience so far. It is definitely a fun game and a great time killer. 10/10 would recommend."
13162,There's no dragging story line to try and give more excitement. You just build your deck and try and slaughter the other person. Or play in a team with the same concept of victory. I'm not that far in but I'm enjoying it so far. If I had to compare it to a game it would be the phone app Clash Royale. If you enjoy that one you're sure to like this one too.
13163,Great game! Loads of fun
13164,Great game so far that I am using to pass the time with. :)
13165,"the only thing saving this game from one of the worst f2p card collecting systems EVER is its fun and well put together gameplay.
I cant even wrap my head around all the weird menus and currency and the terrible deck editor.
also the graphics fucking SUCK i mean have you SEEN the model for ratbo? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON THERE? invest in some new character models! youve been around for a million years! that f2p model has to be generating at least a LITTLE money right?"
13166,"Clean Mechanics.
Short, fast paced games.
Well Polished
Caters to streamers."
13167,its easy to play and understand
13168,"Unfortunately I cannot recommend - crashes like CRAZY.    Usually just at the end of a long game.   
It crashed a bit before,  but the last patch seems to have made it even more unstable.   
Nothing else crashes on my PC.


Shame because the game plays well and has a 'competative PVP' feel about it,  which i did find fun."
13169,"its a good gane for free
"
13170,Very fast pace. Very easy to pick up with a lot of room to grow and master
13171,grate game i jest wish with the crossplay i was able to add my xbox frinds
13172,very fun simple mechanics game
13173,Pretty awesome
13174,"I had this game sitting in the Library with the 2 DLC I got for free, so I decided to give it a shot. First impressions are very good. It takes the best parts from many game genres and combines them together. You've got the card collecting aspect of CCGs, the RTS aspect of placing units, and it also plays like Auto Chess, watching your units march out and battle against the opponent. 

People have compared it to games like Clash Royale, though the unit levelling system is much fairer: unit levels do not give extra stats, so there's no pay-to-win there. Instead, opening copies of cards gives you Glory, which allows you faster Battle Pass progress (like a Fortnite Battle Pass), for more rewards, and the benefit of being able to have multiple copies of the same unit on your team, which is a nice touch, but not essential to your game strategy.

There are plenty of game modes and features that give you rewards, the devs have clearly put much thought into fleshing out each of their systems to provide progression for free-to-play players and also giving people the option to buy cosmetics and other enhancements without feeling like you have to.

With the gameplay, I was shocked at how much jam-packed action you get in a single game, there's a huge amount of strategic depth, and yet, games last between 3-6 mins! Yes, short game time, but it feels much longer and really fun.

The game isn't perfect - there may be some high level competitive concerns with matchmaking and certain OP combos, but for playing casually and getting into the game, it's great and a blast!"
13175,i orignally downlod as jok but now enjoyu. dragon lady bad though get rid of her
13176,cool
13177,fun fun and more fun!
13178,"Been awhile since i played a variation of this kinda game, i think it's a lot easier to get into then most. I've only been playing for a few hours, but my initial impression is that this game isn't too bad. I'm at work atm and it's pretty slow here, so this is nice to have in the background and is fast enough where i don't feel bothered to stop if a customer walks in. Haven't seen the late game in terms on what decks are top tier as of yet, but i haven't been frustrated in the games i lost so far. I do love how cards aren't restricted to certain classes also. I don't plan to spend money on this game, and i wonder how long it'll be before i feel restricted to certain decks because i don't have the right cards, which was my experience in games like Hearthstone. But who knows what's in store for me in this game, maybe that won't be an issue. It did prompt me to write a review on it for some free in game currency, but i wanted to give a non biased review the best i could. I should get back to work honestly...Btw next time anybody makes a cup of coffee, always pour the creamer in before the coffee, not after. Also coconut creamer is pretty dope. That is all."
13179,"This game is well plugged in with its community. The way that Twitch is linked makes it attractive to content creators. The next phase will likely be a bunch of creators well connected and interacting with each other thus consolidating the community, or it will be the untimely death of the series. I hope for the former."
13180,Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring.
13181,"This game is just fun on the bun solo, with a friend or with a ton of friends. Great gameplay, good balancing, tough strategy, and a shitty announcer. what more could you ask?"
13182,"Nice game, you can play with your teammates."
13183,simple and easy to play
13184,nice game.
13185,Great game !
13186,pay/10
13187,Fun game to play
13188,Great Game
13189,"Fast, easy to learn, and just plain fun."
13190,this game is a good RTS quick match game with pretty fun cards to match
13191,"Minion masters is a nice, fun and relaxing game."
13192,fun so far
13193,very entertaining good strategy nice units
13194,"Similar to Clash Royale, but fun and free :)"
13195,yes
13196,Pay to win.
13197,its very fun and dynamic
13198,great game tbh had it sitting in my library cause i thought it was lame but i can say now that i was being foolish PLAY THIS WHILE HIGH FOR A GOOD TIME
13199,Just another pay to win game.  Tried it for a couple of weeks and the new hero added was unbalanced and OP.  Do not recommend.
13200,friends recommend it to me and i play. game good.
13201,nice graphics and gameplay
13202,"Nice game, runs hot on the graphics but its entretaining. The characters kinda gave me cancer but its fine so far."
13203,I love this game
13204,damin it cool
13205,Clash Of Clans but better!!!!
13206,Good game.. Really enjoy it <3
13207,"Great game, strategy is needed but its fairly easy to pick up."
13208,Not yummy.
13209,"i want more adult style game play then this its too childidsh
"
13210,7/10 clash royale
13211,"fun, reminds  me of command and conquer generals except eve more fast paced. 5 stars."
13212,It's just a lot of fun and a good time killer :)
13213,"Fun little time waster, but ULTRA pay to win if you play it at all beyond silver/gold tier. New cards=best cards, rarity=power level. Don't get invested in it, you'll only get frustrated.

Shame because it's a fun little real time CCG ala nexus wars."
13214,A handsome man-friend of mine got me into it. Hopefully I don't impulsively spend a bunch of money on it. But it's a lot of fun :)
13215,"Fun game, just CAN NOT stop playing it!"
13216,everyone who plays this is bad i win every time its ok
13217,"The game is balanced and not pay to win, everyone should support this game and their developers, they really did a great job with this one"
13218,"good game
"
13219,A lot of fun and more interactive than the traditional card based battle game. Really great art design and graphics. Highly enjoyable.
13220,Pretty cool
13221,"Jogo rápido, objetivo, curto esse estilo. Bem feito!"
13222,"The Minions Masters has a good number of options to choose from, simple commands, and each match is usually quick."
13223,"I havent spent too much time but the cross-platform and  just jump in for fun, is a great combo this game has."
13224,good game..
13225,free and fun
13226,"Yes it is very fun, to play and fool around with a friend. :) Great fun."
13227,"fun game like clash royale but for pc
"
13228,Played this game for 2 hours. I can already tell I am extremely addicted. It is really enjoyable with a friend and has a pretty deep gamemechanical aspect ones you read the different abilities of the cards you use. Definetly recommendable!! Many possibilites
13229,Games badass.
13230,"Similar to Magic the gathering real world game, pretty cool i like"
13231,"The game itself is pretty okay fun.
The sound design is often  very bad, having annoying sounds and bad voiceacting (also pitching up some interns voice doesn't count as voice acting...)
The characters and cards have designs ranging from absolutely awful to very nice looking.

Don't expect too much and this game's okayish fun"
13232,Fun game and on a winning streak.  The game has an interesting concept and seems to be very rewarding.
13233,"very different kind of card game. really fun and addictive, has great potential. I see this being the new ""Hearthstone"" or ""Magic"" ."
13234,I really do enjoy the way the game is made. I like the look of the characters also!!
13235,"Still trying it but fun so far, i haven't seen any ""pay to win"" so far"
13236,"First of all, I need to say that I can't normally be bothered to write reviews for games because I'm lazy, I have a full time job and I like to play video games which takes up all my free time. I however felt compelled to come here to write this review because people that enjoy games need to give this a try.

I have experienced a lot of the game and there is much more I still have to experience so please understand this is more of a first impressions review than a complete one.

1.) The game in incredibly intuitive to anyone who has every played a MOBA or TCG. You will pick the general rules up almost immediately. Even if you don't master it right away, the game is so fun that you will want to learn everything about it so that you can be the best. It's not very often the natural organic game state makes you do additional work on your own time and it's exciting for you lol.

2.) The graphics, flavor, UI and flow of the game are amazing, it feels incredible polished and more than that, the amount of additional content that can and surely will be added seemlessly is mind blowing.

3.) IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN! That's right! You can dive right into this game not not spend a penny and because you love playing it so much, you can earn all the currency you need in game. If you want to go a little faster and spend some cash, go ahead and do it because we all should support these devs a bit with some cash for giving us something this amazing for free. That said, if you never want to spend a penny, you don't have to and I honestly can't see you feeling like you need to.

4.) The time to fun ratio is the best Iv'e seen in this type of game by far, typical matches if they are single or team player (2v2) are over in around 4 minutes. At a time when you see Control Warriors in Hearthstone having 35 minute matches, this is much more ingestible and fun.

I will tell you, I am so impressed by this game, I'm gonna buy stuff I don't need just to support the devs for giving it to me. That is the free to play business model done right. When people don't need to buy what your selling to progress but want to because they are having so much dang fun.

PICK THIS UP AND PLAY IT!!!!!!!"
13237,"Simple, clean, entertaining for what it is. Nice little casual game."
13238,fun
13239,Very fun . Absolutely love it!
13240,Cool stuff
13241,I recommend.
13242,PC clash royale with a lot more cards and customization/optimization
13243,It is a very fun strategy action game.  Nice twist to the gaming era.
13244,"Positive:
1. No level up on cards (this way it is all fair)
2. Great visual for the game price (which is free)
3. Great game for loosening up and trying to get them bun clenched when your base is low and you clutch it
4. You can get your minion cards from all rarity with shards (and you can choose and preview the skills for the minions)
5. Free battle pass so you don't need to buy them (but you can buy it if you want more rewards)

Negative:
1. You need to grind a bit to get shards and get new cards

Conclusion:

Great F2P game that is overall balanced and fun to play. Just don't get frustrated when you got lose streak, that means you need to take a break and play with cool head. Try and experiments with some of the expensive minions, sometimes it is worth having 1 expensive minion just to turn the table"
13245,"Good Game overall

PS. if you want to win easily use and max Crossbow dudes. It is awesome"
13246,"Quite a fun game initially that promotes creating interesting synergies between cards and masters.

When you get matched up against opponents who have significantly more valuable cards than yours though, it isn't interesting anymore."
13247,It's pretty fun
13248,"Pros
- Fun, short, quick matches
- Easy to pick up and learn

Cons
- I can see how people consider this as a pay to win as you buy masters with real cash as well as upgrading cards
- Has a freemium mobile game feel to it

Overall, haven't played much but I think it's a good pick up, and progress seems smooth so far. Just a bite-sized simple fun"
13249,Super casual fun
13250,Good game
13251,"Great game.
You can get super far and have lots and lots of fun not spending a dime
10/10
100/100
You probably have to pay in the end if you want the best of the best stuff that stomps, but honestly skill is a big part of the game so even with the right cards you still will lose if you don't know how to play them."
13252,Pretty entertaining!
13253,"Games Fun, what else can i say."
13254,good card game
13255,its a lot like Ham's Build and Brawl in Wc#!
13256,Nice timepass game. Nothing really a amazing
13257,It's pretty fun
13258,Clash Royale PC
13259,yeah really nice game
13260,"Easy to get into, fun to play"
13261,SUPER FUN GAME im loving it
13262,very good
13263,ДА ЭТО ЖЕСТКО
13264,"Pretty fun, also not as pay to win as others like it."
13265,ótimo jogo!
13266,GG
13267,Very cool and easy game to pick up!
13268,"Kewl.

Lol."
13269,GG.
13270,I like this game. Very addictive lol the only thing I dont really like is the announcer...makes the game seem more childish rather than intense. Believe me it can get really intense sometimes lol. Also one thing I would add settus taking off her mask when she wins or adding a skin to buy without her mask. 7.8/10
13271,is ok
13272,Easy to get into and super fun!
13273,Its good
13274,prety good having fun with the game so far havent run into any major pay walls yet
13275,Not at all
13276,"Great game to never play serious and still own bad players and waste your life
Game is overall broken with some cards at current time which I totally dont want to see fixed if it isnt used againt me :^)

6/9 totally will stay addicted"
13277,pay to win garbage... also filled with cheaters. uninstalled after 15 minutes.
13278,i love it
13279,"Game has evolved a lot, worth playing C:"
13280,"Fun game if your into the whole cards and summoning minions, watching them battle. casting spells.

Great game for the card genre. Actually does it very well."
13281,"GG, so far i dont think its p2w, sure, with money u get some things faster, and long time players have better cards, but i think its fair
pro: funny, fast matches, kinda like dota underlords, but better controll over units, many units and spells
neutral and negativ: u need exp and matches for better cards, same map design, and look my wishes


this i added a few days later: negative point. u need shards to buy new cards, but u cant buy them much(with money either, just from packages, but with this u get poor). Sometimes there is an offer in the shop, and u get them sometimes from  treasures and sometimes from lvl up. But not much. Im lvl 33, and i rly dont get new cards. Even from treasures i get most time ones i already have.  And if u get some new they most r low tier and/or fit just good in card combos/decks, so i cant use them rly.  I have 33% of the cards, this looks ok, but u start with 10% or so. Nad early u get cards, but after lvl 15-20. It stops. If u buy the alltime lvl exp and bonus gold for 20€, dont do it for the more exp or 50%gold. 
This u get only from matches, not the things from lvl up or treasures. So u still need ages for different decks.


what i wish for this game is to improve some things:

5 instead 4 cards in fights( so can counter better, and less snowball),
2 more cards for your deck(so can switch between tactics better),
little more hp of the hero in 1vs1(prevents snowball), and these rush games in 1.30 mins
more hp and bigger maps in 2vs2(here even more important),
different maps, like 3 bridges, some towers, no bridges and aoeboss event, items and/or card combos in a match,i dont know :D

better as dota underlord and games like it, u have just more controll,  dota underlords heroes in this kind of game would be awesome, but games r too short, hope they balance it better for more tactical and comebacks"
13282,Awesome and unique game. Combines tactical challenges of card games with dynamics and engagement of RTS
13283,"=enjoyable, entertaining, amusing. Overall FUN! :D
"
13284,"Tight animation, surprising amount of strategy present, quick to pick up and plenty to learn!"
13285,"I really enjoyed this game, I love the idea of controlling a little army and bringing it to the other guy. It has a hybrid feel of a MOBA and strategy card game. After a few days of playing it has really grown on me, its a fun game to team up and play with friends too. My friend and I played in a team game and got a decent rank. I would defiantly recommend this to somebody looking to play something with a challenge or just to chill and relax.

13286,decent.
13287,Like clash royale. Feels good
13288,"QUick and fun, seemeless gameplay. Umm, don't get the level 10 brothers of light. They blow."
13289,lol for kids but its still kinda fun
13290,U LOOK LIKE FISH
13291,game rocks my socks
13292,Fun game with simple mechanics. Worth a go!
13293,AWSOME SAUCE
13294,easy to pick up and play and a tun of fun
13295,"Playing against the same Minion Master (Morellia, at the moment of writing) becomes old very fast, doesn't matter if you are winning or losing.

The decks are too small and easy to copy. No skill/strategy needed - rock-paper-scissors game mechanics."
13296,Playing an hour. So far so good! Simple pleasing combat which is easy to get into.
13297,"Great game, Quick battles can go either way at any moment."
13298,Much better than boring underlords or other stuff
13299,Because its fun
13300,nice game
13301,"Didn't think that I would like it at first glance, but it's actually a pretty fun game!"
13302,Like A moba but this good to :)
13303,"Kinda like CLash royale but with different kings. pretty nifty
"
13304,"It is pretty much a Clash Royale in 3D with fantastic grafics and ragdoll effects.

The difference is that cards are on a fixed level, meaning that you can not power your units up with cheap pay to win methods or have your hero conveniently have more HP then that of your enemy, the game is very fair in that regard.

Heros are kind of your tower, which the enemy has to destroy. They all have a form of basic attack and different skills, which unlock during the course of a match. Just watching a gameplay video should be enough to get the gist :P.

Personally i feel like the game is very free 2 play friendly, rotating heros, lots of rewards in form of new cards etc., but the hero package is still worth its price if you just want to have everyone for more variety. 
Farming them normally can be a bit of a pain, quite expensive, so i went for it (and to support the devs, because i actually like the game)

The only con i have is this stupid dragon from Morellia, playing Duos only to be greeted by 2 of them after 10 minutes of stalling gameplay is pretty annoying.
Also i feel like the game needs more cards, i can already see limits as to how much i can do with my current sets, so i am definetly looking forward for more.
Nerfing or buffing some cards would be great too, i feel like some cards, like for example the 3 Mana Xion Dragon, are in a lot of decks i play against, because they just go well with anything. Also buff the snake hero please, noone plays it :P.

"
13305,its fun
13306,"I like deck building and auto battlers. This is perfect so far. Just an hour in and I'm having a blast.

Though I was extremely frustrated when I was winning my team battle (pretty handily, I might add) and my teammate disconnected so it was my only defeat so far. Obnoxious to say the least.

Otherwise, it's awesome."
13307,"its literally clash royale which isn't a bad thing, i actually like it more than the mobile game"
13308,"This game is amazing, I didn't know what I was getting into but this game is very relaxing and reminds me of the old tug of war games you could find on like warcraft and starcraft. And the player base isn't bad from what I've seen just very chill!"
13309,"Regardless of the game's clunky past, it is a great and fun polished game right now. If you're looking for something with TD and Competitive aspects I can only recommend it. Plus the Team Mode is a jewel as well. 10/10"
13310,it is a nice and easy going game. i like it
13311,Its like clash royale but much better because its on pc. just try this game out you will see. its my favorite game in this type of game :D
13312,Great battle system and a very low skill level entry point.
13313,"Crack
"
13314,YES
13315,Very fun game to relax and think on.
13316,"Fun so far! Throws you into pvp pretty early, and there's team battles."
13317,"Fun, natural next step after clash of clans/star wars force arena and similar games. Has some new mechanics that add a bit to the genre."
13318,10/10 Would watch my ex on featured streamer again.
13319,nice 1 hand game <3
13320,OK
13321,"Well to be honest, the WC3 comic look (they even used the same font!) is kinda grinding my gears, but nevertheless it is a great game, maybe I'll write something more in-depth afer some playing"
13322,Good game
13323,✔︎
13324,Looks good. Sounds good. Plays good.
13325,"Morellia ... Although not my biggest problem with the game, definitely goes to show that this game is pay-to-win beneath the facade. Why introduce a hero who is obviously overpowered on every front? Sales. Force everyone to buy said hero. Release another hero that's more overpowered and voila, people will be forced to buy that as well. You don't -have- to buy it but it requires a lot of skill (and luck) to make up for what Morellia brings to the table, especially if she's played well. Having to wonder if you're going to be dragon-spammed every match is just annoying. They are tweaking her in the patch but you can't convince me that her awesome powers weren't discovered during a few playtests. They must have known about this and decided to release her any way.

There are other problems with this game as well: Chinese players that always seem to have more mana available than you do and certain cards that simply everyone uses and cards that are completely useless because their mana cost doesn't weigh up against what they bring to the table. And it's game over if you end up with a team mate who has a completely experimental deck that you had no idea would be thrown into a match. No way to punish your teammate either. Don't want to play with a certain person again? Tough luck. Teammate disconnects? You lose, other team wins. 

There's no 'surrender' button in single player matches which i found annoying. Yes, I can see someone is beating me but I don't get more or less gold for staying in the game for another minute or so and neither does my opponent. I'd like to just quit, re-adjust my deck and retry. In team games, I can understand but for solo games having to sit out the entire match is just annoying.

And yes, you can play 2 vs 2 with friends but you will still have no clue what you'll be fighting. Not even a glimpse of the heroes you'll be facing. Plus you'll need to have a friend to play with. This game features no friends list, you have to add someone to Steam friends before you can play with them which I found very annoying because I like to reserve that list for people I actually give a hoot about, not random players I happened to want to team up with on occasion.

Sometimes you'll run into a good strategy that has had some thought put into it but a lot of times you'll just be spammed by units and end up with a dragon or two to finish you off or just chain-stunned and magma-balled to oblivion. Great. And I don't have those cards so I can't add them to my deck to just use the same lame strategy they used against me.

Although I really like the concept, I find game balance to be all over the place. There is no indication of whom you'll be fighting so it is impossible to prepare a deck beforehand, you'll just have to create a deck that is as balanced as possible and hope that among the 50 cards or so (out of a 150 total) you'll find some powerful cards otherwise you'll either have to grind a heck of a lot or spend money to get the cards you see everyone else using. There are some alternative game modes as well (Mayhem) but heck, those are an even bigger crap shoot! And then there's the 'exploration' which is just a really, really boring version of a table-top game where you run around doing team or solo fights. There's nothing else to do but fight and not to mention that you get more mana regeneration and experience by picking up items on the map, meaning that some of your opponents will actually be weaker or stronger without them (or you) having been able to do anything about. The 'exploration' you're doing  is absolutely meaningless and I'm not sure how that made it into the game, it seems like a complete waste of labour.

I also found that I could go on winning sprees (I'm currently at master with solo and team) and continuously win and the very next day constantly be beaten with the exact same deck then the next day, I'd be winning again. It just felt completely random. You'd figure adjusting your deck would be the thing to do but since you have no idea of whom you'll be battling, you might as well sacrifice a goat and hope the gods will intervene.

There's also a bit of a problem with the ranking system: once you move high up the ranking, you'll be severely punished for experimenting with new decks as you can no longer really afford to lose games (if you want to keep your ranking) so you (or at least I do) sort of end up sticking with the same deck and only make very small adjustments which makes the game boring. 

They do have an interesting 'draft' mode which forces you to choose from a set of cards (despite whether or not you own them) but once you do, you're locked to that selection. If you create a deck (either by accident or because there was no other choice) without any anti-air, you're going to have an extremely hard time until you've lost enough games to be allowed to shuffle a new 'draft' deck (or retire and completely lose the admission price) so hopefully, once again, the fights will be random enough for you to win and get some of your investment back.

I bought the premium upgrade at a discount and I got 60 hours of gameplay out of it which isn't bad but the whole experience feels rather empty. There's no real progress except collecting cards and profile-leveling, guild-play also involves grinding levels and not much else. Chasing a higher rank is the only thing you can to 'quickly' feel like you're making any progress.

Good concept, mediocre execution."
13326,just cause.. like it.
13327,great game love it!!
13328,good
13329,so Aesome
13330,"Easy to get into, fun kind of like those old Warcraft 3 maps"
13331,"It's like a combination of Auto chess but realtime and in some form of moba combat making the game really appealing and fun.

The card system is very interesting and gives the game variety.

This game uses alot of brainpower strategy wise when you go against really good enemies especially when in team battle.

So far this is really fun and takes what i love about auto chess and mobas and makes it it's own game mode."
13332,Its cool
13333,"pretty much Castle Crush , i love it :)"
13334,cool game !
13335,nice game
13336,"Funny PC Version like Clash Royale but with more ooohhhh's and aaaaah's.
Let's see when it turns into P2W - I don't know yet, but so far, I like it.

Only thing I do not really understand is some of the currencies, and a battle pass here and ruby there and some diamond-like things and then is gold and lots of different tokens for... whatever...

no explanation, just a zillion of currencies no one really needs. Thats the not-to-recommend part on this game.
don't know why they design things like that. No one needs that."
13337,"Fun, fast paced and lots of options. Free and active. Graphics are attractive and sound is pleasant. Can't be much more to be a good game. Some more map variation would be nice and more customization for player character would be awesome, but those are minor details that will hopefully be addressed in the future. Great game and thanks for allowing us to play it free!"
13338,this game is too easy
13339,"it is a good game <3
it needs more fame 
fun auto chess"
13340,8/10
13341,great game. lots of fun.
13342,adictive
13343,Super fun and simple to pick up!
13344,I've been having fun with MM. And that's what counts for me.
13345,"Fun times
"
13346,Very fun game
13347,Fun game.
13348,"Really great game, it's not based off card levels like other games of this genre. really fun and great to play with others. The minions look and feel good, it's a tiny bit slower but not too bad, I'm sure later it gets quicker. 

Also cool to have the additional aspects of the ""Masters"" which you can build synergy around with your deck"
13349,"the game is fun and addictive, and is easy to pick up. No big amount of grinding needed, just take your cards and have fun"
13350,"It's an awesome game, It's really fun and I've been playing it for only a day."
13351,The best on this game is the story.
13352,"Went in for a coke, came out with a Michael Jackson!"
13353,very fun and addicting love it definetly reccomend
13354,s'good
13355,Great game So Far It's A Speedy Battle Chess
13356,"Another game designed by suits. We got the casual blizzard artstyle clash of clans zynga lootbox etc, basically some things that have made money in the past put together. Getda fuck outta here with this bull$#it. Can't even quit it once it starts: there's no quit button, and I don;t actually remember adding it to my gamest list. I have a strong suspicion Steam added it as a ""promotional"" move"
13357,wow what a cool game to 2v2 with your buddy in. get in tear it up and have fun
13358,The minion design is entertaining.
13359,"This a Awesome game if you have played supercell's game (i cant spell its name) and have some knowledge based on this game

-Has more custom decks
-More cards with better characters and has more options to you and play styles
-Easy to understand and you can have more friends on the this than supercell
-No waiting on loot to get powerful cards"
13360,I'd liken it to Clash Royale on pc. I mainly use it to relax with an audiobook or podcast
13361,good game
13362,"Just try it, you'll like it ;)"
13363,"Awesome, just love it...."
13364,"cool game add more heros
"
13365,Nice game
13366,"great game fun to play.

great strategy"
13367,IS THIS CLASH ROYAL ON PC??
13368,fun game
13369,I love love love this game! So addicting
13370,Minion Masters is the perfect blend between a deck-builder and arena battles. I highly recommend this game!
13371,It's great.
13372,I do not like this game.
13373,"Easy to play, fun, and I'm really enjoying the game at the moment. Honestly its been the only other game to keep my attention other then Fortnite."
13374,"Really cool game, id recommend fun to play, stream and enjoy with friends!"
13375,"Fun game, good illustrations. simple."
13376,"this game was good i liked the gameplay even if its kind of a clash of royale gmae
"
13377,Easy to pick up and learn.
13378,We've got more of a look at the upcoming features in Version 1.3 as well as the new Tri-Team Tourney that lets you vote for a card we'll be making in a future update.
13379,"definitely pretty cool game, i wish me and my buddy could do cross-platform though
any way i could get the character models though? i hope that's not against any ToS or anything 'cause i don't plan to modify or anything i just wanted to see if i could be a brother of light in Garry's mod, for the crusader memes ya know"
13380,Fun game to just hop in and play. Even better with a friend.
13381,Pretty fun game to kill some time
13382,"Great card game. Fun to play to pass time and a lot of things to do as well!

The avatars are cool they have their own abilities you can use in the battle.
The characters are very creative and demonic looking and fun to play, each having their own special ability.
Team battle is by far my favourite and can become a bit hectic.

Overall, the game is pretty good for what it is!"
13383,As of Level 10 which seems to be just getting my teeth into the meat of the game I think it is very fun.
13384,Game gud
13385,"Playing Minion Masters so far has been a great experience!
Great balance, visuals, smooth gameplay with intuitive screens and commands, not to mention free to play with super short combats. A real deal!"
13386,"I find myself very addicted to this type of card game. I never really wanted to play a card game, but I gave a free one a chance and bam....LOVE-IT....now i can't stop playing. This is a great game once you understand the cards and the game play of the cards. Setting up your deck the right way can take awhile but once you do...man....you can have some great battles."
13387,"simple, easy to play and games are quick . you can pay for cards but even the simple card can be useful if built right."
13388,"I would love to recommend this game, however there is too many broken cards/combos that people abuse to climb the ranks (which reset every month).   If they worked on the balancing than this game has the potential to be great, however until then I would just avoid."
13389,Game takes too long to update
13390,"much minion, very master"
13391,"Addictive, fast paced game. It's new player friendly, and the community as a whole is pretty welcoming. It's also got one of the coolest Twitch integrations for games I've seen where if you're in my chat while I'm streaming it, you're a puff and get to change colors of your puff, dance around and even throw things into the arena. It's really cool.

The bad side of things is that as you rank up higher you risk running into cheese decks a lot more where they exploit certain things. And let's not forget the day where we all faced self-healing Stormy. But it's that much sweeter when you beat them even though they're running those decks. Haha.

The devs try hard to make the game fun and enjoyable and run smoothly, and you can tell that they really do care and want their game to grow. It's a free game with tons of free content, and tons of ways to easily earn even more free content, with free drops, with... seriously you get the idea. It's a free game and it's actually fun.

My favorite mode is Premade Team (Duo), because I can actually team up with my friend in a card game. While this isn't a pure card game, it's close enough for me.

Hope you grab it and at least give it a try. Get past the tutorial and get to where you're playing vs real people. Pop in a stream and say hi and control your puff. Streamers love seeing the puffs !jump around. Have a good one!"
13392,"Pretty fun, quick game."
13393,awesome game
13394,Yet another money draining mobile game.
13395,"I must say it's a good game, the concept is simple and the idea is good. Only bad thing would be the pay-to-win element in the game where you can buy special characters and minions the items are getable by playing but still makes it PTW. 

Even though I HATE PTW games I recommend this game as it's really nice to play and joyful"
13396,8.5/10 would recommend
13397,RIPPENNY
13398,fun game
13399,"I fell in love with this game. It realy doesn´t matter what I do or how bad I am at playing this I still have fun. I can lose a lot or win a little and there will always be something that will make me enjoy it . 
This game is free and I didn´t feel like I have to buy something with real money,because this game rewards me every time I play ,gain level or rank or when I do some quests.
After some time of playing it gets repetitive a lot,but I can always find something that will entertain me. For example I met some funny players and even thought we can´t speak when we play we can toss around different emotes like bunch of adolescents.
It is easy to understand,fun to play and for me there is a lot of content I like. 
Everyone can pick up their own style how to play and I like that too.
There are still some bugs and errors,but it doesn´t bother me much,because developers are still working on this game and try to repair it and make it easier and more fun to play.
Sometimes you can even get some things for free and I already got few free things.
There are not many games that I like this much so I am glad I am able to play and enjoy this game. 
There are plenty of things to do in this game and developers are adding new cards and content so this game won't  get boring any time soon .
It is free to play game,but it is perfect."
13400,Addicting free game
13401,Clash Royale Ripoff
13402,One of the best minion arena card game thingies I've ever played!
13403,"[h1] Minion Masters [/h1]

What can i say? i love this game!

A lot of cards to pick from, each have there own counters and advantages against others. You will always come across someone that can counter your own deck no matter what you build, there are cheap ways of winning in this game which can be countered with another cheap or unique tactic. It just depends on your play style, sometimes a random deck will beat a cheap deck quite rarely but was fun to try it out.

Starter cards can get you quite far in the game, no pay to win tactics like most other free to play games (mostly pay for the cosmetics here, you can still earn them for free in game), Developers are constantly active with the community with patches and fixes to certain minions that were not intended to be weak or to powerful on there first appearance, cards can be crafted with in game currency known as shards, they sometimes appear in the shop as coins which are much easier to earn, can vary on cost depending on [b] Rarity [/b].

Gameplay is smooth, connection issues become more apparent in team battles sometimes you can win a fight in a short duration due to someone disconnecting, or the other way around which can be annoying if your on a winning streak and your team mate or you disconnect hopefully they get that fixed at some point, content is amazing with community voting updates for cards.

Battle pass, you can buy the battle passes or save up enough Gems to buy into it, each battle pass features new seasonal cards for the event, which can be earned by opening season tokens you earn from battle passes or expeditions.

Cards cannot be upgraded (Tis be a good thing) but the more of the same card you earn the more glory points that card will receive at the end of a match, the more glory points you earn the more XP you gain towards your battle pass. you can have a total of 3 of the same card in 1 deck at once, wild cards are used to limit the amount of the same card in someones deck.

Masters can be Earned with in-game Currency each master has there own unique skills and abilities that will help you decide on what cards to pick for which master, and what suits them best, some cards will match there ability set and gain advantages from them very handy if you want to use certain unique sets or some cheap sets (might not be fun for others lol). With new masters being added once every so often, sets can change and card stats can also change.

This game has a-ton of content and has a lot of future potential, looking forward to what [b] BetaDwarf [/b] has planned next in the future for Minion Masters what i would like to see next is Spider Minions perhaps.

13404,"This game is simple, strategic, and fun."
13405,"I have great hesitance in recommending this game. While it is a phenominally easy game to hop into, pay to win does exist... This is a deck building game and as a result, comes with all the negatives that all do. Just, beware of this before deciding this is worth your time. Definitely the least troublesome game to get into, but playing against players with more stuff does happen"
13406,"PC version of Clash Royale.

13422,This game is very similar to clash royale and i can really appreciate it.
13423,Great game
13424,Awesome!
13425,Fast paced real time strategy card game that makes it fun and keeps you on your toes. The tutorial is very lacking however and you get thrown into other players without even knowing what does what and counters which units.
13426,its pretty good
13427,GOOD GAME
13428,"very fun, a mix of lol and mtg, its simple but also surprising has alot of strategy to it, i love loading up each weekend and playing with my mates"

13431,it is good
13432,Great mechanics. Great cards to choose from! Fun game!

13434,good game
13435,1
13436,"Clah royale clone made by danish developer. Love the developer, great guys but they went into the ""dark side"". Gameplay is very easy and smooth, un-demanding. Fun game when you want to relax, and really easy to get into. It could have been great if they stayed on retail and did not go into the free to play service market.

Welcome to hundreds of cash grab / addiction features á la mobile game casino. Tokens, gold, rubies, daily quest, expeditions, challenges, achievements, daily free spin, rotating shop feature, crafting etc. They got it all. Designed bots that look like humans, pretend and then loses so you can feel good about 90% win rate. All designed to make you hooked and/or become a whale. People love gambling, yes, if you can't handle it, don't play this. If you can you may love this danish piece."
13437,"Great fun little game, which isn't P2W, 2v2 in any game is just the best. Also worth mentioning that this feels like a polished AAA title."
13438,"Quick to pickup, even more fun to master! Its simple mechanics after a boat load of ways to play and teaming up with a friend makes it even more fun! 4/5 stars for me and would highly recommend!"
13439,10/10
13440,"I wouldn't say I don't recommend this game, but if there was a pass button on steam. I would rather have chosen that. 

Minion Masters is a free to play game, and at first glance it kind of seemed a little fun but not unique. When I streamed this game a while ago. People made references to Clash Royale and they are right to think so. There's nothing to write home about this game, because it does everything safe in the tower defense genre. I like the different characters you can choose from, but you have to unlock them with shards and rubies. Yeah, I'm not really going to spend money on this game. People do, and this game isn't exciting enough for me to put some money on it. I feel that this game is pay to win to some degree, but Minion masters gives you challenges to earn some shards/rubies to collect for yourself to unlock characters/cards. 

Let's talk about the cards in this game. The cards reveals a minion that comes into life on the field during matches. You have to stack up a good deck that will compliment good attack/defense strategies. If you don't know on how to go about that, then you'll have a lot of difficulty to work your way up the ranks. With the ranks, you go up really quickly. If you win like 4-5 matches You'll gain a rank.

I feel like the developers need to implement more counters, at this point right now there are players that know the ultimate set of cards to win almost every match they play. That is not fun, when you have no chance to win the match at all. Let me give you an example. In the anime yugioh, there is a set of cards that completes the exodia monster and whenever the player does, it's an automatic win. That's how some people play this game, they get those winning cards and just win matches over and over again. There needs to be updates to the game, since it's card based. Make it possible that even the pro players don't get the advantage all the time. 

Matchmaking can be frustrating in the later ranks, when you're playing with someone and they are just placing very weak cards against strong enemies. It gets very exhausting, and I've played hours on end. It just makes you not want to play a game. People often forget that when you have to pass the ""checkpoint"" in the middle of the stage (when it turns to red to blue) Thats how you level up your power tiers so that the rate of your cards that pops up goes rapidly faster. People tend to forget that. 

Some matches can go from 2 minutes to sometimes even 8 minutes. Sometimes you lose because of a bad mistake. I play mostly in team matches because it's more enjoyable playing with someone on your side. It sometimes get really chaotic and try hard-ish when you play single matches. 

I like expedition mode, because it provides variety. Draft mode is a unique but also complex mode because they give you a couple of classes to choose from, and then provides cards to pick from. But when you verse someone. They possibly may had a better result of cards. Draft mode could be very unfair depending on what cards you choose, and especially which character you choose.

I would say try out the game, but it can be a pass for me. I'm not sure if I'll keep playing this game after this review. There's other games thats worth my time."
13441,"Amazing setting, love the cards, and the gameplay can be just as dynamic as action game. It can be a still and heavily strategy based as well."
13442,"Quick matches, pretty fun, similar to a card game type"
13443,Simple and fun. The duo system is great times with a friend and the characters are shockingly compelling despite their silly designs.
13444,"Very fun game with a lot of potential with new seasons. If you have played clash royale in the past and enjoyed it you will get into this game just fine. Not pay to win at all, free players will do just fine and it is very easy to aquire every card."
13445,fun addictive game
13446,great game
13447,"Pros: Decently Generous, Easy to learn, RAGDOLLS, great co-op 
Cons: hard elo resets"
13448,"Really like this game, fun little competitive PVP if you want to kill half an hour!"
13449,I great game.
13450,"I can't make a deck that is all Walking Blind Date. 
5/10"
13451,"Fun to play, until you get in higher ranks."
13452,p2w
13453,Im just reviewing this for the summersale
13454,Good game.
13455,"Best Tower defence game i ever played! And best Balanced! Its much easier for somone who doesnt to pay money to get the cards you like to have. And no stupid leveling system, that increases any stats. Just the amount you can have in your deck."
13456,GG
13457,This game is surprisingly fun!
13458,"Relaxing and fun game to play, great when you only have short time to play because matches are usually quick.
You have to rethink you deck every now and then because of new content/seasons, which of course is a good thing."
13459,decent
13460,I wasn't sure at first but after the first 30 mins or so it started to hook me. I think I'll keep this one installed for a while and play when I've got a few mins at a time to kill. I like that matches are short and sweet and that there are different ways to play with or without friends. Check it out!
13461,I've been playing Clash Royale for years and this is like a cool PC cousin.
13462,sale!
13463,"I like the fast flow of the game, and the unexpected complexity that exist in the gameplay. at the moment of writing there are only a few masters to choose from but i trust that number to increase with time. the masters and there individual skills are fun and appropriately different from each other."
13464,lots of minions
13465,"Good game 
"
13466,ti's okai
13467,ADD 3v3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13468,This is a cute game. I particularly like that the matches are engaging but not long.
13469,.
13470,This game for me is very fun and passes time by.
13471,"There are a lot of games out there, but this is the one I always return to.

Multiplayer games that use a daily quest system often become tiresome, but here the rewards are plenty and even if sometimes I don't feel like playing I still get enough resources to be able to enjoy the new content whenever it comes out.

And when I play just to burn through my quests, the matches are generally fun and quick as long as you don't limit yourself.

That's why I recommend it. Because it's fun when you want to play it, and it's also fun when you don't."
13472,good
13473,Not bad good size
13474,"Relaxing and an addicting game. Similar to some android clash games, this one on PC delivers the same gameplay but higher graphics and a different experience. It can also be played one handed (mouse only) so +1 to that."
13475,"Pretty good game, Like!"
13476,"like crash royal,but this game makes more crazy improve!
the style is different too.
"
13477,Fun game!
13478,It's alright to casually play. Don't let the grind get to you! I've hit Masters a few times using decks that don't have a single Legendary.
13479,"Pretty good game, doesn't require any purchases to be good, and the devs hand out free stuff as often as they breathe."
13480,I have no idea why I played this.
13481,it's ok
13482,"Easy to lean, fun to play.  Will update once I've played more."
13483,GOOD SHIT
13484,Good game
13485,This is a mobile game on pc. The entire main menu is setup to try and get you to buy rubies.  The gameplay itself had no lasting value to me. There are two lanes to choose from to send your minions plus a few spells. The goal is to buy better minions to become strong.
13486,It's a simple and fun card game.
13487,"Quite addictive. Performs patches regularly.
A lot of bugs tho."
13488,"Been here since beta. The game is fun if you like quick matches and some objectives every now and then.
Lot's of cards to play, enough masters to change every so often and it's not pay to win.
The different game modes are not worth it at all.

The game is not really very well optimized even as a light game that it is. Simple stuff that the devs won't do anything about them cause they probably don't play or test that much.

1. Buzz sound, every time you or the teammate holds a card ready to play but won't place it down there is a sample sound that keeps repeating on every single frame making actually sound like a buzz.

2. No reset on the settings. Also the end of the cursor is not the actual point where it clicks so UI needs some work.

3. Disconnects are happening and teammates leave at the start of the game which abruptly ends the game and you lose.
Sometimes you wait for too long for results when the game ends, or when you try to unlock items. So maybe I'd prefer networking over UI.

4. Hover-over sounds of the game play when you move the mouse and you have alt-tabed to another software.

5. Viewing your cards and managing decks can be a pain sometimes and laggy for sure when you try to view all of them which is not pleasant to do anyway.

6. I had to turn down a few key settings to not stress my GPU. So it needs some more optimization."
13489,Great!
13490,Fun game. Easy to learn and totally free if you want it to be.
13491,"good game
"
13492,this game is real good try it
13493,"I play casually, coop is fun, but 1v1 kinda boring.  Its game I keep coming back to every now and then. I also love the variety of ways you can build a deck and you can get free stuff. 

I had an email from AMD which gave me free stuff for the game so thought I would try it out, and then signed up to the BetaDwarf newsletter which gives you free stuff an sometimes lets you know of a 100% off on new dlcs. I also brought the All masters upgrade and really enjoy playing the game :)"
13494,Its a great game. Love the way that you fight agains others and have you own castle to protect=)
13495,Amazing game!
13496,5/5 filler game.
13497,"Pretty middle of the road in terms of actual gameplay. I got frustrated that they made it difficult to find the button to exit the game was, i didn't see it in the menu so i had to close the game externally."
13498,"You Master the Minions

BANANA"
13499,It's fun and free.
13500,"Don't be fooled by my playtime. The launcher used to not require that your Steam profile be online to play, so I racked up gameplay in offline mode.

This is one of the only competitive games I've ever played, and I enjoyed my time with it greatly. If you've ever played Clash Royale, this game will feel very familiar. It's a hybrid of RTS, MOBA, and deck-building gameplay. You can play 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 matches, either premade or with randoms. Your units are your cards, which cost Mana to place. Mana is generated over time and is generated faster the longer the match lasts. You battle for control over two Bridges, which give you extra experience over time. Experience levels up your master, and higher levels unlock abilities unique to that Master. There are four total levels, and the fourth, called Mana Frenzy, converts any further experience gained into Mana, allowing you to furiously spam cards. There is skill involved with placement and timing of units and spells, as well as room for different strategies. Do you rush to kill the enemy Master before they can get any good synergies rolling? Do you play defensively and control Bridges before steamrolling your opponent after reaching Mana Frenzy first? That said, at it's heart, this is a deckbuilder where synergies will ultimately determine how effective you are. Some decks are simply terrible and will not be competitive even in the hands of a top player. That said, top tier decks will not guarantee success because the game is based around every unit having multiple counters, so for every meta deck, there an equal and opposite counter-meta deck. While this game has had numerous broken synergies and cards over its lifespan, the devs are very active and always patching and rebalancing the game. I can count the times where a broken meta persisted both long and powerfully enough to significantly hamper my enjoyment on one hand, and I was an active player for over a year.

That's not to say that this game is flawless. My largest criticism is that the game is extremely grindy. Cards drops are almost entirely random and there is little you can do to ensure that you get the cards you want, even when spending money. I never had every card, and many more cards have been added since I stopped playing. I should also note that I was free to play during that entire time and never felt that it caused me any real disadvantage as I was able to hit Master and Grand Master tiers pretty reliably. While I enjoyed my time with this game, I simply don't have the patience to grind anymore, and if you don't either, I'd give this one a pass. If you enjoy, or at least don't mind, grinding, especially if you have like minded friends, then I'd say give this game a shot. It's engaging and I think you should find out relatively quickly if you're going to want to spend quality time on it like I did. If you aren't sure how to start, the grandmasters' active decks are visible, though some of them will be meme decks, and there are numerous streamers who can help guide you. Shout out to twitch.tv/sinobii. Super nice guy and I always enjoyed his streams.

So long Minion Masters. I hope you bring to many others as much enjoyment as you brought me."
13501,"Like Clash Royale but not, Only 9/10 because I can't take my PC to the toilet."
13502,"Great game, you will win faster with cash tho"
13503,Simple in concept low commitment time and fun.
13504,"Fun, and fast"
13505,"fun little game.
easy to play, hard to master."
13506,"very good F2P,"
13507,"Highly addictive game.
You should have tried this game and you will definitely love it !"
13508,"This is honestly the most fun i've had playing a game in a very long time. I haven't put much time into it yet, but man I seriously love this game."
13509,A nice tactical game where you easy earn the cards you wanna play by just playing. Within a month of decent play and doing daily quests you will be well set without spending a dime.
13510,"It's fun, easy to learn, easy to play. It's like DOTA 2 had a kid with Heroes Of Might And Magic's battle mode."
13511,"Fun, but also not fun."
13512,:P
13513,"so minion masters is a fun little deck building game that has your cards spawn minions and spells on a battlefield.  so you get to see your guys duke it out rather than just see a couple of cards waggle with some special effects, which is nice.  the selection of cards at the moment is okay, but i feel the game needs quite a bit more to really mix things up.  having said that, with the cards you get for free from leveling up and whatnot, you can put together a competent deck and enjoy the game.  i haven't felt the need to spend any cash on the game, but crafting cards takes time; so you'll be relying on whatever you get from tokens.  overall its a fun game that you can play to kill a few minutes or longer, and its free."
13514,fun
13515,"So far I've got to say the game is quite fun. It has plenty of diversity, and is the sort of easy to learn hard to master kind of experience. The animations and character designs are well fleshed out and I really like the overall aesthethic and vibe the game has going for it.
If you are looking for a good strategic game with quick matches where you can play either casually or competetively then Minion Master seems like a good choice. The fact that it mixes tower defence and card collecting is also a plus since I do enjoy both genres of gameplay."
13516,"Very nice concept of tower deffense game.
+Clever
+Card style
+lot of acheavements
+ does not have to be pay to play
-not to manny variations"
13517,great game
13518,cool
13519,Not P2W. Very addictive
13520,totaly great game i love it ;)
13521,Gud game
13522,very fun competitive game
13523,"Despite the rather cartoon-y graphics and card style rng there is a surprising degree of depth in just unit placement alone not to mention in unit interaction, pathing, wave building, and animation resets just to name a few. The game needs a few more expansions worth of content to really be a big hit but it's making good progress so far!"
13524,Really love this game.  Great game play mechanics.
13525,"Great game so far enjoying it, using a lot of my experience from Badland Brawl & Clash Royale. Game is very enjoyable and I haven't had any complaints so far. A very good game to play if you came from Clash Royale. Finally a game like it that's not on the phone!"
13526,"I think playing cards -when you have enough mana- is good card.

If u don't win, blame balance"
13527,"Nice game to play ,9/10"
13528,I like this game. matchmaking works and theres a ton of combinations to work with. Granted some cards are inherently better than others and it takes time to collect cards but you can work your way up with the events. plus subscribing to the newsletter gets free packages and dlc
13529,"Pretty straightforward deckbuilding card battler. Reminds me of Clash Royale. Gotta say, though, I cannot stand the meme stuff the announcer says. Have a little dignity. But still, pretty fun and worth a try (it is free, after all)."
13530,the game is very good. the gameplay is very unique
13531,It has a pay to win aspect where you benefit from spending money to get cards to play better decks.  However if you casually play you can slowly get every card over time.
13532,It's good
13533,It keeps getting better and better.
13534,real fun -  casual on one side - but with depth - no need of pay4win -  but support the greatly engaged dev-team with some purchase!
13535,Virtual Crack!
13536,corno!
13537,Play this game to wreck some 6 year old on a phone within 1 min of a match and spam emotes after
13538,Clash Royale but better
13539,.
13540,"Casual.
"
13541,"Really fast-paced and fun, but sometimes also very overpowered. I love team vs. team battles.

Haven't spent a dime on this one yet, so it's kinda F2P."
13542,Good fun :)
13543,Actually quite a bit of fun.
13544,fast matches and 2v2 game is solid one of the best free games around
13545,"good game
better than clash royale"
13546,A ton of fun even if you are a free player. Currently the game doesnt have a ton of different cards but there is enough cards and masters to have a ton of different strategies. As it keeps growing it will only get better. The cash shop is completely optional.
13547,"Quick, fun and you thought this was a review, but it is I DIO!"
13548,Cards are fun.
13549,gud
13550,neat
13551,Played it for almost 600 hours and it is quite enjoyable experience. Works on linux with proton.
13552,Great fun! This is my review for the steam summer event 2019. Thank you for reading this in depth analysis of Minion Masters a free to play game.
13553,"This game is for me better, as Clash Royale."
13554,good game
13555,<5 minute games. Fun with friendz :)
13556,Best Game
13557,"This game can be said to be balanced, because all cards have their own counters. And developers are very active in reworking all existing cards."
13558,"for a free game this is damn addicting, give it a try :D"
13559,pretty legit
13560,"VERY INTERSTING GAMEPLAY
"
13561,Good and fun game!
13562,Clash Royale on PC.. Not Bad!
13563,"A fast pace strategy game that uses unique aspects from the tower defense to table top card games. Its gameplay is very uncommon due to the fact that this game has its own twist to your tower defense games, and it also adds many updates, since its pre release who knows whats coming next?"
13564,"Fun to play, easy to learn, fast paced. Free... what more can I say?"
13565,"Super fun to battle others online in this Tug of War game.  One of my casual daily games, that I can turn to to do some quests and try new strategies, very fun. Updates bring allot of new and exciting content as well. Also for a better experience play with friends. :)"
13566,"A perfect example of a game that started good and slowly lost it's edge.

Game still suffers from memory leak problems that might lead to your computer overheating the longer you have the program running without restarting it. Remains unfixed despite it being a known problem."
13567,goog game tho
13568,pree good
13569,Its a good game!!
13570,"This game is ok, but I don't think I will play it too much"
13571,"Simple premise, with a bit of depth. And a very fair and fun f2p system."
13572,dope
13573,Don't remember playing this but I have 3 hrs on it.  Don't even see in library.  Weird.
13574,Great game. Not pay to win. Basically it's the PC version of Clash royale.
13575,"Lots of fun, very similar to mobile card brawl games."
13576,it's a fun game
13577,Great game.  Individual matches are quick and game is very generous with new cards and currency.
13578,"I downloaded this game on a whim and was extremely surprised to see how quickly I was hooked! The basic premise is Clash Royale, but this is so much better!"
13579,"Very fun game and easy to get into. Seems relatively well-balanced and allows for a lot of strategies. The game rewards almost nothing for playing when you've run out of quests, but the daily and special quests give pretty hefty rewards, so it's still a pretty good free experience, and at that point the game has handed you out a lot of stuff to start with."
13580,it's fun
13581,Surprisingly fun.  Mix of something like Squad TD and Nexus wars maybe?
13582,Surprisingly Fun Tower Defense/Card Battle game.  I don't usually play these but Im having a good time.
13583,Good and positive game
13584,"Game started interesting with a nice variety of strategies, but then hero Morellia was introduced and now every single 2v2 match has at least 2 of her, including Grand Master. Just check the leaderboard and you will see 50% of it is Morellia.
I'm hoping that the developers will realise that the game is not balanced atm and come up with a way of bring all heroes to the same level and prevent these tedious repetitive matches."
13585,"Fun and exciting, especially with friends :)"
13586,"Fun card game. 9/10. Need to improve expeditions, though. A lot of free content."
13587,good
13588,noicee minions
13589,funny but power leveling breaks it with every update
13590,good game
13591,"Pretty addictive, not p2w as long as you play regularly. Devs nerf overpowered cards from time to time, so it's relatively balanced. A time-sinker, typical game to spend 15-30 minutes on every now and then."
13592,Love this game!
13593,Cool game
13594,Fun fact: Scrats are naked under the barrel.
13595,Fun
13596,Clash Royale on my computer.
13597,nice
13598,"4 hours into game and so far its enjoyable. Not too hard, not too easy. Will post results when I am high rank."
13599,"win10
crashes: no
other issues: no
liked the game: yes
other: at times it can feel p2w and imbalanced, but i guess that's just the nature of tcgs"
13600,Great game
13601,"You do need skill for this game, and because you have to capture the bridge for xp, it brings a hole new strategy element that changes the game completely from other games of the gendre. It makes it a lot more dynamic."
13602,"I like it, I like it a lot!"
13603,Nice game to spend some time with
13604,"Great game! 
Quick, fun and balanced."
13605,its a grate game quick to start
13606,Please fix all the bugs!
13607,stress free
13608,"good game, lotso fun :3"
13609,"Minion masters is an easy game to get into but not hard to master, if you've played any other card game it just takes some time depending on how frequent you play it to get used to all the cards and their abilities and this game is no different. you can mostly learn by playing and very little need to do wiki searches or post on forums, but that shouldn't stop you from connecting with the community which is very lively."
13610,Nice
13611,in new york i milly rock
13612,okay
13613,Seems generous and enjoyable enough. Not bad for F2P.
13614,"ya its a good strategic game and its real have good graphic if i can say...really good and creative game,"
13615,Fun card game with a fresh look has some interesting mechanics and seems to get regularly updated plus the devs made it fairly easy to earn premium currency so if you like card games I'd suggest giving this a shot. It can be a bit addictive though! lol
13616,"Alright, if you want a quick, fun game that you can spend time with, this is definitely one of them. 
It's just like in the video, you place cards using mana then those ""minions"" fight for you. I'll place some pros and cons below:

Pros:
The game is downright simple,  can be played by almost anyone.
The graphics and textures aren't too high so it can be run by most pc's, laptops, etc.
Tons of fun, there are a lot of cards for different playing styles and ways on how you can win.
Competitive or for fun, Single or Multiplayer, Versus Player or Robot, you can choose any.
FREE to play and FREE items, by joining their newsletter you can grab some free stuff as well!

Cons:
Grinding - If you're new it means you'll only have a few cards to use, and with every update more get introduced.
Complexity - Sometimes there are cards that require you to read a bit to understand and to use on the field.
Teamwork - When playing there's a bit of an issue of not talking, so sometimes your teammate doesn't know you're new or quits.

As you can see it has more pros than cons, it's a really fun time waster and you don't need to study a lot for you to have fun, just summon minions and watch them tackle other minions in order to destroy the summoners! The sounds are great, the voice acting is very funny and you can watch what you summon fight in real time  unlike other turn-based card games with only pictures!
Seriously though, if you have the storage and the boredom, you can easily try this out.

"
13617,"Ive Played Similar games that Ive enjoyed but this one really stands out as you get to see live attacks with your cards, making it more unique and fun. Being able to play solo or with a friend I can play it for hours on end. You get to level up your cards more and make them more powerful and advance and get great rewards after each battle."
13618,"great game. fast, fun and entertaining"
13619,This is a great game and if you ask me the team mode is the best!
13620,"So... Imagine having a friend who's really, really into co-op games. Imagine yourself being not (like, really not) into co-op games. Imagine that friend of yours asking you to play every co-op game they found with them. Imagine yourself refusing to play every co-op game with them. Then imagine yourself agreeing to play just this one game because... well, because you actually like your friend very much and feel kinda bad having refused to play all those previous games with them. Imagine yourself playing this game with your friend. Then imagine yourself actually liking this game. Finally, imagine yourself playing it more than your friend does.

Imagined? Then this game must be Minion Masters. :)"
13621,"For real this game is so much fun but it steals your time also.
+rep: very active developers, always fixing stuff that would break
+rep: addin new cards every season
+rep: very very twitch-streamer/-viewer friendly game
+rep: not only the game is free but also many of the DLCs were for free, not anymore tho

-rep: only contra I know and that dont even bother me is no crossplay for Steam and Discord players :D


Feel free to play that game and join the fun today and enjoy some free stuff with my inv link

13622,cool!
13623,"A ""Clash Royale"" clone with some unique features. 

PROS:
-Good gameplay almost identical to Clash Royale
-Variety of unit types and heroes
-No one deck seems overly overpowered (but I only made it about halfway up the ranks so far)

CONS:
-The gameplay is designed for mobile, so its a bit shallow/slow on a PC.
-The UI (outside of matches) is extremely confusing. 
-It is not clear what, if anything, many of the unlockables do (e.g. the stars you collect after you have already unlocked a card don't seem to actually do anything?)
"
13624,"A pretty solid game. Not really pay-to-win, it's quite easy to climb the ranked ladder even early on when you don't have many minions yet. The game is pretty generous in regards to the in-game currency you get as well...I've been able to afford the battle pass each season just using the premium currency you get from finishing the previous season at a high rank.

My biggest complaint about the game is that the devs seem to make some pretty poor balancing decisions, and then take quite a while to fix them. I understand that balancing a game can be difficult, but the devs need to be way quicker in responding when they mess up. There isn't really any justifiable reason for blatantly broken combos to dominate the meta for months at a time with no changes. The 2v2 meta seems to suffer from this especially.

Overall, the game is pretty fun most of the time, whether playing solo or with a friend in duos. Not perfect by any means, but still enjoyable. The games are also pretty quick, so it's really easy to pop on and just play a couple matches whenever you have some down time."
13625,"Still a favorite after many, many hours.  The updates have done a good job of keeping it fresh."
13626,"I really love this game! high graphics, good strategy and gameplay,  very fun, especially when playing with a friend."
13627,biggus dickus p fun good time killer and fairly decent though needs some performace improvements
13628,"BERRY GOOD GAME, SO MUCH FUN BALANCE IN ALL THINGS"
13629,"After playing Minion Masters for a couple of months, I find it to be hit or miss, depending upon the time of day I play.  If I want a challenge, go on at this time... if I want it easy, go at this time.  Overall though, many people have said, ""Play to win"".  I don't believe that to be true.  You can obtain all of the cards over time using different strats.  This makes the game, in my opinion, not a pay to win, but a play to win."
13630,Great Game!
13631,"Fun, free to play game that does reward playing well  over just playing expensive or hard to grind cards (feels good to win over a guy with latest hero and full legendary deck with just some cheap crap). Skill over pay to win so far, but we will see how future expansions will change the game. Also some free stuff from time to time and it doesnt want me to sign in with instagram nor like them on facebook for it."
13632,"Fun! If you like Clash Royale on mobile, this game is for you."
13633,"Fun game that was VERY easy to learn for any skill level, but still provides plenty of challenge.

Deck building is not hard and comes quickly (you can also craft cards at minimum resource cost), and the card / strategy diversity is super deep.  Lots of heroes to choose from that all have different strengths and weaknesses further adding depth to the strategic pool, plus new heroes and cards are CONSTANTLY being added.

You can play for free and get plenty deep into the game, though players that have made purchases will have an advantage in that they will likely have more heroes / cards / spells to choose from, and thus be able to get a bit more diverse in their strategy.  However, the ladder system is decent so you're not going to constantly get slaughtered by OP opponents.  And if you have a few bucks to spare, a small amount of cash goes a VERY long way in this game.

Game is VERY polished, with good mechanics, solid balance, tons of players, quick matches, good ladder, not to mention one of the most active developers i've ever seen that is constantly pumping out tons of new content.  And did I mention they have regular freebie giveaways that are actually useful?  GET IT NOW."
13634,"Fun game, but it is rough to compete without some of the legendaries.  New hero is extremely not fun to play against"
13635,Best cardarena game available on PC!
13636,A nice game blending card decks with strategy of timely placement and managing distance to target for tactics. Might be more fun for casuals if AI play is added to the game
13637,"Been playing since the beginning, still good."
13638,"I have played so many video games, and I have to say... this is one of them."
13639,Oh i its so simple mechanic but i realy love it
13640,"Pretty fuckin great, make me a pro"
13641,verr niic
13642,"Fun quick games of about 5 min or so, very friendly to ftp players or players who only want to make a small initial investment."
13643,"This game has potential. However, recent updates gave way to serious balancing issues leaving the game less enjoyable. As a result I have seen a steady decline in people playing and having longer wait times. Hopefully this will be changed soon but I wouldn't hold my breath."
13644,Great game to kill time small amount of time as average match time is about 2-3 min
13645,It was worth checking out. I like the humor embedded within as well.
13646,"Minion Masters is a simple f2p game with an easy learning curve, with average game times ranging from 1 to 5 minutes, though some will occasionally reach up to around 10 minutes in length. It is a Moba/Card Strategy crossbreed that may have appeal to fans of either genre. 

Devs need to work on balancing the meta better when they release new cards/masters to the game but overall it is not a gamebreaking issue. 

Low spec requirements, pleasant graphics, intuitive interface, all in game currencies can be earned at a meaningful rate via f2p, though spending money will significantly increase the rate at which you gain currency. The game is not by any means pay to win, paying money just opens up more variety in strategic options, but strong players can perform competitively at a high level without spending a dime."
13647,this game is good and once you get it you will addicited to this game
13648,"I've been playing this on and off since the official launch, which was almost unplayably buggy, but addictive enough that I persisted with it. The bugs I was encountering seem to have all been resolved in a pretty short time. It's a pretty simple tower battle game, of the sort that I'd expect to find on Newgrounds 15 years ago, but with a lot more pizzaz. That said, it's probably not as graphically appealing as the stick figure flash games that used to be abundant in the genre. It is free to play and very easy to grind for cosmetic features.

All in all, the game is fun and reasonably balanced, with a lot of different viable strategies. Games are extremely quick, often less than a minute, so it can be a refreshing game to play in a short break."
13649,its cool but gets stale fast cause not enough content you know what i mean?
13650,"Fun to play, super easy to get the hang of - its almost like playing chess with monster cards."
13651,Good!
13652,Fun
13653,The developers have put a lot of work into this game and it shows
13654,a fun little time waster of a game. ive been enjoying it. but strategy card / tower defence game
13655,A fun dueling LCG based game. Nice blend of strategy and luck.
13656,its ok
13657,"Decent little casual game, very much what you would find on mobile but with better graphics and controls."
13658,Great f2p with very quick matches.
13659,Fun time waster.
13660,"good co-op game, a little rough in 1v1 though, needs a little better balance at higher tier where strict ""spam this legendary to auto win"" happens."
13661,awesome tug of war game
13662,"
Just played this to get the achievment for the summer sale and it's actually really fun.... I should be doing work atm but might put a few hours more into this tonight :)"
13663,"Extremely fun game that you can play with a friend if you like card games, you'll like this, it's a little more than that, think a little more of the Yugioh card-game custom map on wc3 or of battleforge, except you don't get to control your units"
13664,"This is one of my favorite free games.  

There's a bit if pay 2 win in the paid battlepass, but it's all stuff you can get eventuallyyyyyy through normal gameplay.

8/10, very good game, fun to team up with friends, fun to make decks and try them out."
13665,"Worthwhile game if you enjoy deck building with unit placement and zone control. Many decks will work and not work. Many will annoy you, but you can figure out how to often beat them or look up a guide if you're lazy. Has a ""team battle"" mode if you want to bring a friend which is still fun as well."
13666,Tried it out just for Summer Sale. Actually enjoyed it. Will probably try more once my son gets a little older.
13667,Okay so... this game is like clash royale BUT the HUUUGEEEE difference is that this game is actually good. This game has way more characters and instead of 1 king you have many different kings so you can send ur slaves to die and kill the other king :P
13668,Game if pretty good
13669,Nice game so far! Easy and fast found opponents! Cant wait new minions and magic!! :) And iTS FREEE!!! :)
13670,free game and rather fun to kill time with most of the things in game can be earnd
13671,"good , not p2w"
13672,good game lol
13673,Chill game :)
13674,"surprisingly amazing would play again
even better with friends"
13675,HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY this is pretty good. I hope the developers don't become greedy.
13676,Yes
13677,great card game
13678,Nice and chill
13679,good
13680,Its a fun game to kill some time with
13681,Good Game :)
13682,Good fast-paced card game basically like any tcg but fun.
13683,it is a very good game and i hope it has a lot of updates
13684,Fun to play!!!
13685,<3
13686,reminds me of footmen wars back in warcraft 3 days X-)
13687,"Only 2h on the Game yet, its fun and intuitive, no signs of pay to win yet. 
"
13688,Good Game
13689,"Highly addictive, I recommend even if your not sure about the genre it's got me hooked!"
13690,it is so.
13691,Mobile game on PC i guess
13692,Fun twist on the old castle fight format.
13693,One of the best F2P games in this genre.
13694,i am...... ADDICTED
13695,Pretty well balanced game and its not too grindy. The story was too heavy and dark for me though.
13696,its like autochess but its a card game and then rng isn't so much but like yeah its gonna i played thi so
13697,"It's fun, free, and not pay to win (p2w)

10/10  would recommend"
13698,good for casual play.
13699,fun
13700,Good
13701,Suprisingly very fun and addictive.
13702,very good game
13703,"Great game, nice free to play model and fantastic fun. Have a go its a good multi layered tactics, moba thingy."
13704,truly a masterpiece of a game
13705,"This game is an absolute must! Easy to lean, hard to master!"
13706,Good game
13707,"Great game overall. Great for killing time and having fun with friends. Some units can be a bit OP, but its not too hard to get new units in the first place. It also gives you a lot of free stuff."
13708,"Great game, absolutely love it."
13709,"Quick rounds, simple to understand.
Perfect to kill time."
13710,This game is a lot of fun i highly recommend it.
13711,BORING
13712,"Always publishing new content, often free for a limited time. Very fun to play especially with friends!!"
13713,"it's good fun, worth trying if you like the genre"
13714,clash royale but on pc
13715,"An exelent cooperative realatively lag insensible game, recomended to play with friends while playing other games"
13716,This is a pretty good game.  You can compete and get to the top without putting any money into it.  It is basically a much better version of Clash Royale.
13717,"Great game, especially if you're in the mood for a quick 5 min match and don't have a lot of time."
13718,"It's a fun game + it's free to play. 
I see no reason you shouldn't atleast give it a try."
13719,excellent
13720,I like it
13721,ja
13722,Nice to play some quick games with ty for incrased max points steam
13723,"Definitely my favorite new F2P title on Steam. This damn game gets you so good you forget you've played 20 matches, lost 8, and have 12 tokens and chests to open and freak out every time a favorite card is upgraded (because some of us aren't lucky enough to get them epics too often) and you just hop into another series of 5 matches and there goes your night. Give it a try, it's truly something else."
13724,A very good game
13725,Good!
13726,good game thats all you need to know
13727,10/10
13728,Is fun
13729,Fun to play with friend
13730,"Fast paced and a lot of fun, great if you don't want to be forced to commit 30-60 minutes for a single match. Most matches only last a few minutes, even had a few that lasted less than a minute and the longest one lasted for a bit over 7 minutes. Even if you do decide to not put any money in the game, it will still be very enjoyable. The 2v2 mode is a lot of fun as well. Definitely worth checking out."
13731,I love the silliness of this game.
13732,It's an okay enough game :D
13733,Enjoyable game. 10/10
13734,very good game
13735,"I recommend this as a casual gamer
They give freebies from time to time through email which is good"
13736,10/10 would play again ;)
13737,"Great game, regular updates, now it's free to play."
13738,"Fresh, fast paced and stimulating"
13739,"Just saw this on Twitch. Seems fun to play against.

https://clips.twitch.tv/ManlyEvilWatercressFailFish

noice."
13740,"I've lost in 40 seconds, once i get to gm"
13741,yeah
13742,Very fun tug of war game.
13743,its a cool game
13744,"Beta Dwarf took the mobile game Clash Royale, expanded on it, and put it on PC. The game is fun, easy to learn but hard to master thanks to the large variety of cards and card effects. It can be a bit annoying to try and unlock some of the more rare cards, but it's not too bad and the devs are relatively generous with their events and built-in rewards systems. The game also has twitch integration that allows spectators to interact with the game, which is pretty cool and not something I've seen in many other games."
13745,eskyeetit
13746,"How to be good at this:

1) keep loosing games until you can afford overpowerd cards and heroes of the season

2) use your wallet"
13747,Gud
13748,Fun game just can't really keep an interest in it over time
13749,"This game showed me the theory that a--holes always win and changed my way of playing other games. Don't get me wrong, this game is a lot of fun and quite addicting. Perfect game to play with your bro ^^. BUT, in the higher ranks (we got into master) the meta is so disgustingly disgusting its not even funny anymore. AND if you don't use the meta you won't win often.
10/10 Would convert to an a--hole again."
13750,"It's a good game as long as you keep a cool head, know that people will use cheesy tactics against you, but you can always go right on to the next match. You can lose one and win one and still come out further ahead than when you started.

"
13751,I've enjoyed my time so far.
13752,"Enjoyable fast paced minion brawler. Plus, it is free."
13753,"Honestly great casual fun, not much thought or stress needed even in the higher leagues I've been playing since last year and found that the learning curve is quite forgiving. What else could you want from a f2p game"
13754,simple and casual. but thats what i wanted. so perfect.
13755,VERRY ADICTING
13756,steam event
13757,"A great F2P game that will keep you busy for a while.  Got solo matches, 2v2, drafts (random cards), mayhem, expeditions!  Can rank up , rank down, very rock paper scissor, but some games are super close.  

I wouldn't say there are too many imbalances, but every game has them.  But it's free, so who cares unless you're trying to be Grandmaster rank.  GM ranks tend to be kinda cheese, but you can view the top players decks and copy them.

No pay to win, just pay for convenience to get unlocks faster.

So grab a friend, grab some cards, slap em down and have a good time!

Updated Review - 3/25/2020:

So there are definitely some imbalances in the game with some of the Masters and if you're doing non premade 2v2s, you will sometimes end up playing against premades.  Unsure if actually intended at all or not.

Still some cheese tactics, you'll probably be sticking with 1 or 2 decks for your entire rank climb, which is fine.  I used one deck that got me all the way to GM lol.

Game is still fun minus some of it's downfalls, the new Jademasters expansion and cards are fun and they released some balance changes on the new cards super quick!"
13758,Great game when you only get to have about 30 minutes to play some thing. love the news letters that send the free goodies
13759,"Amazing Clash Royale style game, far more involved, but very balanced and fair, not at all Pay To WIn"
13760,Like Clash Royale but not bad.
13761,For a free to play game you can't go wrong.
13762,"Imagine Clash Royale but with 2 people.
Also dragons are overpowered."
13763,Needs a bit of re-balancing. Some cards does not really fit to any build/deck.
13764,it's cool
13765,great fun game
13766,meh
13767,"dis game sooo good, very cute, much wow"
13768,great game made by a great dev team
13769,Great game with a surprising amount of depth and no pay to win
13770,"It's kinda fine, it's like clash of clans. No thanks."
13771,"As far as tug-o-war games go, this is one of the best. a good combination of interesting cards, masters, and strategy. It takes a while to build up a good collection, but you don't need to spend money to advance."
13772,its very fun i would rate it 9.5/10
13773,love it. simple and high skill ceiling.
13774,good
13775,Cool
13776,Fun so far and not overly complicated like most games these days.
13777,"greatest strategy game in steam, you should check it out
"
13778,"Not too bad, no easy to find exit game button"
13779,FUN AND CHALLENGING
13780,Awesome love it always updating and adding new stuff :)
13781,great game
13782,"Great concept and replayability.
Worth trying!"
13783,"Way more fun than expected, what i wish Harthstone was"
13784,I don't enjoy card games not even harthstone but i enjoy this game
13785,"While I've seen complaints about it being a Pay-2-Win game, I've never felt like that was an issue. I've played completely F2P up to this point (~90 hours on record) and yes, it took time to earn my cards, but I find the game offers a good amount rotating content cycles, each with their own varying-levels of reward systems, that (if timed right) you can really maximize your in-game earnings without feeling left in the dust.

From a free Master rotation, Expeditions, Mayhem scenarios, Tri-house Tournaments, Drafting bouts, Guild conquests, and (yes) a Battle Pass, it's been a fun strategy game to learn and adapt to with the past few content updates I've seen thus far (new cards, new master, card balancing)."
13786,b+. a lil buggy but great fun and super f20
13787,"Honestly, this is just budget clash royale. Maybe a little bit less pay to win but it just doesn't feel as polished."
13788,grand prix
13789,Nice game
13790,Very Nice
13791,"A simple two lane pusher with great balance, reasonable monetization model, and games that last only a few minutes.



Definitely worth a look!"
13792,"Great game in the beginning. Until you hit the meta builds, then it gets very boring. Hope it will get better when more cards are added. will be back. 

update 1: Glad to see quiet a few changes to balancing and cards added. Decks getting more diverse."
13793,Not a bad game if your trying to kill some time but lacks depth.
13794,Great easy to learn game that is fast paced and more entertaining than others like it.
13795,"The Minion Masters game - there's a deck for you to collect your minion pieces/cards. Creating a deck is pretty easy - observe a few games and unlock the cards you need, isn't too hard - the exclusive cards are pretty hard to use, so you need to improve and become be a better player, before starting to use the really cool minions/spells.  

Each minion card has a score and a higher score, means more points are achieved, when you win. So you can unlock the cards (at once) - and upgrade by paying or playing the game. In order to avoid meeting players that are too good or too bad, the players are divided in tiers, as you progress in skill so the match making, isn't too bad, unless you have picked really unsuitable minions against an opponent, and lose instantly anyway. 

Minions have a value in energy/time, and the more it's worth the more power you get, but you have to wait longer to activate, in actual play - means you have to selects a balance and not select only expensive cards - or you lose by not being able to play. The time to regenerate energy decreases as you play and the more expensive selection becomes usually the winner if the game takes a long time.

The deck you create is pretty important, and the players skill is usually based on your selection of master, what playing style you choose to use - you match with a deck. 

Some selections are really good, others less so. You notice immediately, when you begin playing team with somebody else - how playing skill becomes increasingly important, but also modifying your deck picking correct master to help your teammate. There's three kinds of currency - gold, shards and rubies (can be bought for real money) to help you create a deck, obtain great looks, buy masters - and unlock and improve the value at wins of your minion-cards. Playing skill - picking the correct minion or spell - becomes more and more important, the higher ranked you become. One wrong move can decide the outcome of an even game.

The game has a lot of skins/arenas/upgrades for points for the cards - you can obtain by paying/playing or just reading the newsletters. It has great looks - is great for streaming, you can modify your master/pick an arena that looks stunning - but its basically the same deck of cards - so picking the right deck and master is vital. Looks and emoticions for your public are available for buying in the game store and as rewards.

I rekommend this for the STEAM award of game of the year 2019, due to the enormous amount of work put into it. It's become significantly better than the original game. Playability 10 of 10; and there's the remote chance of luck - you pick a deck that can make you win against a really good player."
13796,"I loved the game, it's super fast paced which i like, and love the animations. great game, mechanics are great. keep the good work guys"
13797,Very very fun! needs a couple balance changes tho.
13798,If you like Clash Royale but hate P2W part of it. This is really good game and its more for PC players.
13799,"Lots of fun. Congrats! Looks like its addicting!
Tá muito divertido. Estão de parabens! Parece viciante!!"
13800,"good game, but some updates de-balance the gameplay."
13801,"Game good, super fun."
13802,bajsbra!
13803,"Fun game, easy time-sink. After some time it felt stale because of obvious meta choices, but I enjoyed it very much."
13804,This game gets better and better every time i play it! They've added alot since i've played it last and i love all the new stuff they are implenting!
13805,Fun and awesome!
13806,love it
13807,became boring to me quickly
13808,fun for those who like card games
13809,well crafted game with good flow and mechanics
13810,"Fun game, games not too long but always different."
13811,"Similar to clash royale gameplay, but far less pay to win."
13812,Great game
13813,"Many people complain about some imbalances in the cards but if you look at the cards in the top ranks you will see a lot of diversity. Also it is possible to have a very good deck without any rare cards.

I like the idea of the game that you have very few chosen cards and though this makes themes of deck less likely and your deck will consist of a few counters and a few core cards to make damage to your foes."
13814,Its pretty fun
13815,Not a bad mix of a Moba and CCG I've enjoyed it enough so far without putting any money into it but I may get the season pass soon.
13816,"Pretty fun game playing casually. However, the lack of variety in cards leads to a relatively boring ladder environment."
13817,"Lots of different, crazy ways to play"
13818,fun little game alot like clash royale but funner and has more options
13819,pretty good
13820,"Easy game to spend a lot of time in.
Simple gameplay mechanics with some unique card and minion effects

The devs deny the evidence of bots that plague the game. 1/2 of all your games played will be paired against or with a bot.
"
13821,Great free game. Includes twitch drops. Not pay2win at all. Highly recommend
13822,Very good
13823,Loving this game.  Not a pay to win game in my opinion which is awesome.  Very friendly community as well.  Careful not to get addicted to this game though.
13824,Its pretty good
13825,Best f2p.
13826,"free to play, not pay to win - i'm impressed"
13827,Its a good game
13828,Quick Fun game that captures the hybrid CCG/Battler perfectly.
13829,"Good clash royale type game for the PC. Cards do not improve as you collect more copies of the same card, so competitive for both new and experienced players."
13830,"Pros:
- super fun
- IMHO not much pay to win
- short games (longest match i've played was 15 minutes i think, but those are extremely rare)
- easy to learn, hard to master

Cons:
- can get a bit repetitive, but that settles after a break"
13831,"Only been playing for 48 minutes when this game asked me to leave a review, so here it is...

It's actually fun. Simple, yet fun, and actually does require some strategic thinking, but not much.

I'm sure later down the road it'll get more interesting as I earn more cards, otherwise this game seems pretty entertaining. Only lost 1 match so far."
13832,"Really great game for casuals and professionals alike, Minion Masters is kind of like Clash Royale, but a million times better because it's on PC and Xbox, lmao"
13833,"Good strategy based game, very fun to play, games are very short!"
13834,not p2w
13835,"It's quite early days but it's fairly fun and addictive. Not a massive amount of depth, but enough to get you thinking.

I'm not sure it will have much shelf life but I'm enjoying it. Not a huge fan of f2p , but we'll see."
13836,"______________________________________________

This game is interesting if you have more free time this 
game is for you XOXO
______________________________________________"
13837,Fun game with somewhat silly looks and good strategic component.
13838,yes
13839,frf
13840,Fun game.
13841,good stuff
13842,"Cool game, play it, spend 5 bucks."
13843,"Free, Fun... What more could you ask for?"
13844,Great game. i've never played a game in this genre but Minion Master certainly manged to keep me playing.
13845,"This is wonderful fun. 
While you only control where you place units on the battlefield, there's strategy and tactics on various levels.

You need to learn the behavior of the units,  any useful combinations of cards and lastly when playing 2v2 coordinate with your partner to play devastating combos.

The choice of master matters as well and have interesting synergies with some cards.

The game has been improving constantly and you can play for a long time on the free tier before you need to invest anything.
Given how much fun I had so far, I have no issue buying their DLCs. 

After an evening of stressful SC2, this is a very relaxing multi-player game.
"
13846,"Why do I keep playing this game?

Simple... it's fun, just play it.

"
13847,I went into the game not sure if it was for me.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I recommend trying it out if it piques your interest.
13848,It's great!
13849,"This used to be a very fun, addictive and generous free to play card game, but this is the basic gist of things now:

Balancing is all over the place --> start hemorrhaging players --> the game isn't as profitable anymore --> remove means of obtaining premium currency in-game so your already small player-base feels the need to pay more --> ??? --> profit."
13850,very fun to play with friend
13851,"Fun game I LOVE RTS games they are so much fun!!!
"
13852,"On the surface it may seem like many other FTP clickbait games, but there's a surprising amount of depth here and the balance is OK."
13853,"simple, fast and fun."
13854,.
13855,"awesome game, short fights and balanced. fun for short plays"
13856,"This is like real life to me, because I play Volco and burn all my bridges.


In duos, if you want to play with a specific master skin that you don't own: 
- Select a master that is different than what you want to play, 
- then navigate to the master you want
- then go to the skin you want to use, and just be idle on that spot until the game queue pops"
13857,Bit p2w later on but good fun regardless
13858,"Great game that grows on you. Easy to learn, tough to master."
13859,Kid game
13860,"Simple and easy to understand, fun and challenging to master, great time killer!"
13861,It's Good
13862,"Like hearthstone, but better"
13863,"fun game, absolutely not pay to win (some of the most important streamers use super basic decks to reach triple Grandmaster; you simply need to learn how to react on the enemy plays).
You also get rewarded by watching others on twitch (for example with ingame gold)."
13864,Decent game
13865,"A lot of the changes they've been making recently are just ruining their game. I can no longer recommend this game, as it becomes more predatory by the update and devs begin to show their true, unsavory colors."
13866,A surprisingly fun and addictive game
13867,"A great pc version of the Clash Royale style of game, with the bridge economy being a small twist that gives it a fresh feel.  The graphics and the menus leave a little something to be desired however."
13868,"I enjoy playing this game and it's fun to play. 
Overtime you learn more about the game, about the cards and about countermeasures then strategies.
Not a dull moment. :)"
13869,"Casual and interesting game worth a try :) the concept is unsuall, but really fun :))"
13870,"Fun, fast paced gotcha game.  Enjoyable format, and complicated enough to bring in the power gamers.  Nice game!"
13871,Better than pacman
13872,A lot of fun and easy to go into.. Not hard to learn but will take some time to get the good minions if not lucky or paying. I enjoy it a lot
13873,Picked this up and was immidiately fighting through tournaments versus bots which seamlessly transitioned to players. It has been a fun ride so far. Some strategy is required but I have not unlocked enough cards to judge whether p2w combos are a problem..
13874,"One or more players failed to connect to the game.

You have been disconnected from the game.


What fucking era is this to have such shitty servers. It's 2019 FFS"
13875,"It's pretty fun, matches don't take long, you don't have to spend money if you don't want to."
13876,Game is as great as chicken wings
13877,Extremely addicting for a free to play game! Option to pay for some in-game currencies but you can also just earn those by playing the game. Easy way to pass time in game with the quick online match times.
13878,"Totally fun and addictive, a real good strategy card playing game with good graphics and gameplay."
13879,Good casual fun.
13880,;-;
13881,"No balance, but NOT P2W


Broken masters and cards seem to be the new theme."
13882,My favorite game after I played it for first time.
13883,uy
13884,"Pretty hooked into this game.
Enjoying it and yes I have spent some money on it but it doesn't seem decent for what it gives away for free."
13885,Not pay 2 win
13886,fun game
13887,"I enjoyed this one more than I expected. One of the better free-to-play games out there based on skill, not money."
13888,"I've gotta say I've had great fun with this game, and played a lot of hours. There's plenty of content and you can do really well without spending any money, I haven't spent anything and I find that going back and forth to it periodically has worked well.
Pro's:
Free.
Easy to learn.
Easy to get into matches.
You can do really well without spending any money.

Con's:
It is pay to win, no doubt about that. But you can still do really well without spending any money, And having the best cards doesn't always mean you'll win anyway.
The time between bonuses and expeditions etc is a long time, but that is to encourage you to spend money, The legendary cards take ages to save up for as well.

Overall it's a good game, just go into it being cautious not to get carried away."

13895,a real time card based game better than clash royal
13896,8/10 game
13897,"Played 3 ranked games. All against bots. Kinda dead servers. Probably higher ranks have more real players though. Also too many meaningless shiny containers popping around main menu, feels like the target audience is 3-5 yo with ipads."
13898,"Minion Master combines aspects of MOBA and deckbuilding. You choose a master (each has a set of unique abilities) and then create a deck of creatures (minions), spells, and/or buildings and battle in an arena divided into two sides, connected by two bridges. The goal is to defeat the other master.

At first, I wasn't expecting much from this game. However, it managed to hook me in with its easy to learn, but tactical gameplay and consumer-friendly F2P business model. You could unlock everything in this game without paying a single cent. Entry level minions remain. The deckbuilding offers a variety of archetypes and tactical options. There are also multiple battle modes, from 1v1 to 2v2, either premade or random matchup. 

This game is truly a hidden gem!"
13899,Clash Royal 2.0

+ Cross-Plat with Discord Users

- Pretty Ugly and Often Distasteful Artstyles
- Voiceovers (TURN VOICE OFF IN AUDIO OPTIONS)

It's Free To Play- try it out!"
13911,"Ever played Epic War ? This game is somewhat like that + it is 3D + it has 4 player mode, which is quite fun + different leaders with different abilities. And it's free to pay, with no paywalls."
13912,It's aight.
13913,"I find it to be a fast pace game sporting amusing animations.

Strongly recommend!"
13914,Awesome game. Tons of combos!
13915,this game is soooo trash. i would rather drink bleach
13916,Great casual game.
13917,"Something difference. Best aspect of this game has to be 2 v 2 matches which I like most about this game. You have to anticipate your partner move while trying to counter opponent. Yes, there are cards that are op from time to time but they will get patch to remove the advantage even with that, there are always counter. Most of the time matches will come down to, how you play and when you play that will determine the outcome. I'm not sure about free to play aspect because I bought all the packages and enjoyed play it. However if you are free to play, you still grind to get everything in game. Definitely a must try."
13918,Funnish game so far
13919,Pretty good
13920,"Lots of fun and updated regularly.

It like clash but so much better.

Cons: 
Cosmetics can be a bit pricey
Can lose track of time if on a win streak

Pros: 
Great game play
Varied game modes
Frequently updated
A small investment of time and/or money will get you competition ready
No need to spend money - I bought the original 9 heroes when I first started playing since then only used in game rewards and I have most of the cards and all the heroes without playing religiously.

Easy to pick up and harder to master - but lots of fun.

"
13921,"Very fun!  I don't have a lot of time to game now a days, so this game allows me short bursts of game time."
13922,I tried to play this game but it was too buggy. Every time I tried to click battle the connection failed. Since I am level 5 and the exit button does not show up until level 7 I had to use Alt-F4 to exit the game.
13923,.
13924,Fun
13925,"Basically Hearthstone on steroid.
Very addictive. Time sink and a money sink too. Play with caution.
"
13926,It's has a lot of micro transactions but it's still playable
13927,awesome game heaps of fun and its free
13928,This game is made of penut butter and tomato sauce! 5 stars!!
13929,"Loves this game.  I waste an hour a day on it at least.  It's very easy to get started and be competitive without spending money but a reasonable cash investment will improve the grind.  Lot's of different modes to play and ways to earn in game currency to get more stuff to improve decks and cosmetics for masters.  It all works and is an easy, fun, time waster to relieve stress and relax.

Also if you stream on Twitch or Mixer there is really cool support to help your viewers interact and win prizes when you do.  Really cool.  I have not attracted millions to my stream playing the game but I pretty sure that's not the games fault.  They do everything they can to help!!!  lol

It's free.  Download it and check it out.  I love it."
13930,"Fantastic little game that's far more addicting than it seems at first glance. The basis of the game is a rock-beats-paper sort of mechanic, but timing and placement of units makes such a huge impact on your ability to win that there's a LOT of strategy. Combine this with the quality of life features, the diverse roster of minions and masters, and the fantastic way the game lets everyone compete, even F2P players, and it's a great option for those who like the genre. A+"
13931,Very Good Game though I'm feeling unsure as to what I am gonna do now
13932,"I was browsing a semi-popular site, imgur.com, when a user posted a link to this game. I gave it a shot and I am impressed. My old laptop can't handle it at it's best, but I still like the mechanics of the game. Very cool. Bravo gents."
13933,Purdy Gud
13934,"amazing, 10/10 will play over and over and over again"
13935,"Maybe the best, quick battler on Steam right now. F2P auto-battler that looks and feels good to play. I enjoy a lot of types of games, but there is something to this forumula that just feels good to participate in. You'll play for a good ten hours or less and buy something, just to support this team. Or you'll bounce off. Either way, ti's free to try."
13936,This game is super easy and really addicting game. If you like Hearthstone and/or Clash Royal you will enjoy this game.
13937,5 min in and I'm hooked this game really reminds me of clash royal except better!

"
13945,good game
13946,Quite fun. Matchmaking corrected opponent selection after getting wiped by a great player here and there. Playing same skill players keeps this game fun. Only played a bit so far and it's promising.
13947,"Love this game. The games are short, competitive and strategic. The creators are constantly putting out new content to keep the game fresh and interesting. Buy it, play it, enjoy it --- you won't be disappointed."
13948,"lovely little game.
I had some hours of fun, but it gets repetitive quick.
Matchmaking is quick and so is the matches
However, it's a game I find myself comming back to again and again when I need some time to kill."
13949,ez
13950,Very addictive f2p game
13951,"A shameful amount of fun in 10 minute chunks. A little pay2win, but not excessively. The grind for free players isn't the worst that's out there, and it's fairly easy to become decently competitive."
13952,Awesome game!
13953,good
13954,"Seemed like fun at the start, but too hard to close game. Maybe I had to play more to unlock the ""Quit""?"
13955,Worth the price
13956,"Edit: 5 years later and the game is still trash. 2 battles in and I was reminded entirely of why I quit.
This game is a masterpiece when it comes to making you feel helpless, especially in adventure mode.


==============
Game has a good look and feel, but not much else.

The devs do NOT know how to balance, every new master + set of cards are overpowered because they are putting sales over quality of life.
IE: Morella's dragon.  They are 90% autowin cards.

The gameplay mechanics themself are terrible, you will often find yourself in a position where you just lost for 5 minutes straight as you can never get anywhere.  
Mana is extremely restrictive and makes hearthstone look like a balanced game.  There are a ton of useless cards that are over priced as well.  10 mana for a medium tank and maybe some archers who die instantly to aoe - vs a massive golem with tons of hp and a massive aoe swing.

9 mana golem - pretty much 1 shots everything...summon a 7 mana air unit that has knockback and high damage to counter?  Newp, because after you summon that there's not only a horde of minions coming your way the enemy master just got a free massive demon tank.  spawn some units to counter? Have them lightning bolted and killed.

Summon the 7 mana ranged guy sooner you say?!  Sure.....and watch it get killed by a 5 mana ranged unit or 3 mana lightning bolt.

and its 4 cards to a hand.....who is the fucking idiot that decided a 4 card hand was an ideal number??

Its like they hired the fucking idiots from Blizzard that thought jade golems was a good idea.

The matchmaking is even worse, they favor time over quality - often leaving you with a pug vs arranged team or against someone way to high for your level.

I plan on uninstalling after I hit GM."
13957,Still addicting
13958,"Only played through the tutorial part and a few matches, and  i gotta say this is fun. I like the mix of card gameplay and rts."
13959,The best review
13960,"Basically a gateway drug off of MOBAs. True ftp game, but can be pay to win at the same time. Fun little tower defense game where there is one tower and matches last about 3 minutes average. This sounds short, but you are constantly developing your strategy throughout the match. Super fun with a handful of ""heros"" with different powers. Your ""hand of cards"" are the spells and monsters you play. Usually match que times are about 10 secs or less. Really fun game with matchmaking better than Blizzard games (not hard to accomplish)."
13961,"Plying casually at my current rank. Pretty fun card collecting and tactics game;
"
13962,"A spamming good time!
Great if you're looking to just chill and spam some troops off to their deaths, a little rage inducing if you run into a loss streak. 
It's balanced and as far as i can tell not pay to win. Big ""fancy"" cards tend to lose to swarms of little spammy cards. Balanced so far."
13963,"This is really fun,not gonna say alot but:the crads,the masters ,THE EVERYTINGH is nice"
13964,its a pretty alright clash royale clone without card levels.
13965,Really good game. RECOMMEND !
13966,🔥🔥🔥🔥
13967,"A fun, not at all mindless, tug of war card game. I've put a lot of time into this game, and don't regret a minute of it."
13968,"Pros:
Incredibly caring and open Devs,
Game play is simple yet fun,
Roadmap for updates.

Cons:
Player base can be salty AF, 
Meta always in a scramble,
Graphics are pretty simple
"
13969,"yknow, i can see why it would be hard to get into, but once you do its one of the best times ive had, alone and with friends"
13970,"Insanely simple base with a great amount of depth. At first glance it looks like a Clash clone, but it is so much more than that."
13971,Fun
13972,simple map
13973,Malade
13974,Easy to learn. Quick play. Lots of Fun.
13975,"simple, 5 min games you can play one handed(i play while feeding my child).  can get far without money but if you want to do anything be prepared to shell out."
13976,is good
13977,Quick clean fun
13978,Oprah's favourite game
13979,"Cute and fun free 2 play game.

No pay to win mechanics.
No need to dedicate many hours in order to stay on par with dedicated players"
13980,"A fun game that's great to pick up and play, whether you want to play for 4 hours or 15 min. Best described as a cross between league of legends and magic the gathering"
13981,Nice and fun Castle defence game.
13982,Proper free to play and no pay to win BS
13983,"If you like Castle fight the wc3 mod, This is pretty close to it"
13984,love the game
13985,"Amazeballs time-sink. I've found myself saying: ""Man, this is an amazing time-sink"" multiple times."
13986,"depth of play is nice, and the f2p value is rewarding even from the initial hours of gameplay."
13987,"Good progression system, frequent updates and lots of ways you can build your deck.

Go ahead and try it yourself, it's free :v"
13988,simple to understand the basics but definetly has depth and complexity to it
13989,Is good.
13990,"Good game, would play again and did"
13991,enjoyable. easy to learn
13992,This game is an amazing take on the Clash royale
13993,mto bagua mesmo
13994,Awesome game!
13995,fun game to play in duos you can build a decent deck with starter cards and don't need to spend money to playranked
13996,"Chill quick games, definitely not pay to win if you're worried about that but you can definitely get cards faster and some neat skins/emotes if you choose to"
13997,"
I really like this game! It has all facets in a game that I love. If you ask me; tower defense at it's finest!

In addition, it also has a portion of humor. The heroes are cool and diverse."
13998,Good Game
13999,I've played the game for only a couple hours but so far it seems pretty good.
14000,Great game! Its not pay2win :) already on master rank :D
14001,"Fun game, not pay to win, lot of people playing so you find games really quick plus it's free, so give it a go."
14002,Auto-chess like rpg deckbuilding rts game with almost no requiresments.Good for old players and begginers in these types of games. Highly recomended
14003,"casual game, you select and click to spawn minions, not much strategy there... uninstalled ... but it's free so you can try it ^^"
14004,this good
14005,best game
14006,"So far seems like a pretty fair game.  Buying stuff doesn't appear to be too much of an advantage, but it will take significant time investment to earn things in-game.   Especially after you finish all the achievements."
14007,"Fun to play, Clash Royal on Steam"
14008,Good Game
14009,nice
14010,"Great Game there is no pay to win, and everything can be earned. Matches are quick to find and quick to play!"
14011,Good Game
14012,"Games of this genre never really caught my interest, but honestly it's built so well that I just find it too darn fun to put down. It's free, so it's at least worth checking out."
14013,Not bad to play at all
14014,Great game if you have ADD and just wanna pump out game after game. I hit GM in premade teambattle without spending a cent.
14015,This game is silly and fun :)
14016,Good game
14017,"This game was a pleasant surprise for me. I always liked the style and vibes from Dota 2, but found it too complicated and that it required too much of my time. This game is a more casual variant with 1vs1 and 2vs2 matches that usually just takes 2-4 minutes to finish. You don't control your minions directly, but you spawn them when and where you want. They are implemented as cards in a deck that you build, and come in many different flavors (not just rock, paper, scissors). Not all are offensive, and some are actually spells instead of ""units"". In this regard, it's more similar to games like Artifact (which I haven't tried), but it's not hard to grasp.

You can play this game for free and get pretty far. I haven't spent a dime on it, but I'm already in the second best rank in 2vs2. I've seen most of the available cards in actual play now, but I still find it fun. No two matches are exactly the same. As for game modes, there are some more options than just plain 1vs1 and 2vs2, but I haven't tried them yet. There's a sort of ""adventure"" mode which is basically just a quest system with an ""overworld"" type of map with enemies and rewards on it.

There's plenty of reward systems in place, and three different kind of currencies. You get cards from reward chests, by spending ""coins"", or by crafting using ""shards"". There are also ""rubies"" which is more rarely awarded or available for purchase. There's a ""premium"" upgrade you can buy to unlock more space in your deck and some other stuff.

I think that's pretty much all I can say at this point. I really enjoy it. I recommend trying it out.

2019-07-09: Well, I've played this game some more, and I've decided to stop playing and uninstall this game. The reason for this is a frustration in regards to imbalances and how the fate of a match is decided very early on. I can't say I blame the makers of this game to fail in balancing things, because it's a very difficult thing to do, unless you stick with very basic concepts such as rock, paper & scissors. Still, after a while I just got really tired of it, and due to the limitation of playing a 10 card deck, it's just not possible to be prepared for any conceivable situation that might happen. I started just leaving many matches because I could see I was just going to lose anyway. Just a tiny mistake can sometimes be enough, or the enemy playing a certain combo. I'll still recommend the game, but with this additional note. There's a great game somewhere inside there."
14018,Great for free to play content with friends.
14019,Cheesy Free to play card/tower defense cross    fairly fun for those with short time to play
14020,Good Game
14021,Pretty good
14022,This game is a great mix of Clash Royal and League of Legends. The mechanic of building a deck stems from clash and the having champions stems from league. Spam decks seem to not be too much in use which is good for trying to rank up.
14023,It could've been much better. Waste of time.
14024,Good Game
14025,try it
14026,Better than clash
14027,"It's quite similar to Hearthstone where you can customize your deck with different types of cards and the experience is fun.Although you have to spent more hours in the game to level to get better cards,the process is easy to be dealt with.Some cards may be too good but the developers do make sure that the game is well balance though it might take some time for them to realize it"
14028,better hearthstone
14029,Good Game
14030,"I love this game. 
Easy to learn, hard to master."
14031,"If strapped for time this can easily be played up to 7 minutes every round. The team mode (2 vs 2) gives more leeway in play-styles and some strategy. The seasonal metas change quite regularly and there are enough hooks (like dailies, a season reward track and token lottery) to feel addicted to keep playing. That said it's quite nice for something quick"
14032,Good Game
14033,Good Game!
14034,It's good for a free game and in-game currency isn't frustratingly slow to earn .
14035,Smart gameplay and a lot of fun!
14036,"C'mon, using 3 skeletons in a deck isn't gimmicky, it's called strategy!"
14037,I love the cards characters and concept. but next fixed when it comes to matchmaking. people silver shouldnt have to face people who are master level.
14038,Nice game when you are bored =)
14039,"I have about 700 hours on discord this just ptr.

Its good but some cards / masters are a need to own to win in higher ranks like master, where creativity gets thrown out of the window."
14040,"OK for F2P game, your default time waster if you have nothing to play."
14041,"Great fun, very well made for a Free-to-Play game! You don't have to invest $ to become competitive or relevant. Most of the minions are well balanced and only a few are overpowered, they update the game often. You can get premium currencies well enough to craft specific cards you really want without an obnoxious amount of grinding. I definitely recommend as one of the best FTP games around atm."
14042,Clash of clans but not pay to win! Have Master rank in solo and Grandmaster in team and haven't spent a cent yet!
14043,"Amazing game!!! it got mix of LOL and tower defense, graphics awesome...all in all great fun and very interesting game :)"
14044,I'ts kind of a good game that you can play here and there sometimes with friends
14045,"Good game, new patch needs some balance changes with the new hero. Otherwise solid free to play game."
14046,Very interesting and exciting game for two!!!
14047,nice game
14048,"A nice, action packed but casual game."
14049,A good casual point and click game. Its easy to learn but in higher level ranks it gets harder as you match up with better opponents. May take you a bit of time to understand.

[u] Review [/u] 
A very promising free to play game, you're not forced to spend money and you're given a healthy sum of cards to get you started on building a deck. They're still updating which I always look out for with a game like this and the community are pretty friendly.

It's free so why not try it?

■■■■■■■■□□ 8 / 10"
14051,Quite enjoyable quick games (1-5 mins) and 1v1 or 2v2 available
14052,So much fun
14053,"My mate and me played Rock Rivals & Hypnotize with wildcards in 2vs2 premade. 
The streamer we played against was #2 Grandmaster & got very euphoric cause of that and called us ""SO SKILLED players"" a lot of times. That was hell of a sportsmanship! So many compliments in 45 seconds! WOW!
I wish every community would be so friendly, and recognizes such a strong performance. 
To be honest, this game is easy to learn but hard to master. 
I totally recommend it!!!"
14054,Great game!!!! play asap
14055,"Like Clash Royale but for PC, very F2P friendly."
14056,its k
14057,Mobile Game Trash
14058,"Fun little game like clash royale, just less pay2winny"
14059,More than I expected.  The game was free so I decided to give it a try and I ended up still playing it hours later.  It's not like many games where you feel like you have to pay to win.  It comes down to timing and countering what your opponent is doing.  I also like the game b/c I can play it a few minutes and walk away in case something comes up or I can keep playing.
14060,Very good tower defense game
14061,gud
14062,"Minion Masters is a fast-paced card-based MOBA-ish game that is easy to learn but hard to master. You basically create decks that you use in battles against other players - those battles are always ranked/competetive and therefore affect your ranking in the leaderboard. You've got different masters with different abilities that are unlocked via experience that you gain via controlling two points/bridges for your own team or via slaying enemy-minions that you can summon via mana. There's tons of different spells, buildings and minions and while you're able to pay for microtransactions to unlock certain stuff, most of it can still be unlocked via in-game-currency/for free basically. Therefore it's not pay-to-win, especially since you need skill/strategy in-game instead of cash/etc.

Rounds last 0.5-4 minutes, depending on your playstyle and how your opponent plays. My longest round was about 8 minutes. The music is okay, but I usually play with spotify or steam music on (preferably Crypt of the Necrodancer, Deadbolt or Risk of Rain OST). The art style is okay as well, nothing special, the german translation however sucks quite a lot so I'd say, play it in english. I don't know what it's like in different translations, so I won't judge those.

All in all, I'd say it's a good game for in-between. It's free, try it out."
14063,"Great tutorial and easy to get into.
UI is a bit overwhelming, and I'm still not sure what some bits do - so that needs some work, however gameplay is fun, tactical, and has a good learning curve :)"
14064,"I didn't expect it to be as fun as it is. So after some hours spent, I have to recommend it.
But I have one complain: even with the lowest graphics, it makes my laptop able to fry an egg, and I own a good gaming laptop with cooling system xD 
Thank you, I used to have a toaster, now I have a frying pan."
14065,Very fun game. If you like clash royale you should give it a shot.
14066,"Easy to learn and play. Got into the game primarily through streamer code rewards. So my take, without those codes, you'd probably have hard time grinding for cards you want for various deckplays. Still somewhat fun play experience from my viewpoint."
14067,"Very fun and refreshing game. A free deck can actually work even beyond the low tier ranks. If you like Hearthstone, you should like this as well. Didn't find a flaw to this game yet, although I didn't play much. Would recommend it anyone."
14068,"Deceptively simple to play but there's quite a bit of depth to the gameplay between the pacing of minion placement, Master powers and field control.  Also it doesn't bombard you with the free to play elements and doles out the in game currency at a healthy pace allowing you to build an effective army quite quickly.  So far I'm really enjoying the game."
14069,Filled with awful puns
14070,"Pretty awesome twist on the traditional TCG - Players build decks of creatures, then play them on the battlefield solo or on teams of two. Co-op mode with your friend is available."
14071,.
14072,Fun little game
14073,Minion Masters Lmfao -_-.
14074,"Indeed a very rewarding game. Played for three months and i have everything, and you feel like you will have everything within short amount of time. And its easy and fun."
14075,so bad
14076,"One of the best deck build related game out there. And since you actually can see your minions on the field moving, placing them on the field creates another kind of opportunity to take advantage."
14077,good game
14078,"Infinite fun, and competitive"
14079,"Minion Masters is a good mix of a tower defense game and a card game -- in the same genre as a Warcraft mod and, yes, Clash Royale.  What makes it differ from the latter is just how friendly MM is about handing its rewards out, and how many of the pay to win pitfalls have been dodged.  

Clash Royale, for instance, has cards that you can upgrade, where people that have played for a long time / spent money are able to speed past players that haven't.  In Minion Masters, levelling up a card merely makes it give you more rewards for including that card in your deck -- your copy of a crossbow dude is always exactly as powerful as anyone else's, no matter how long they've been playing.

There's definitely a few wrinkles here and there that still need to be resolved, such as being a little more aggressive against people that frequently leave in team battles, but the blemishes are minor, and easily overlooked.  As you can see with the ridiculous amount of time I've put into the game, I love it -- and if a mix of strategy and reaction sounds interesting to you, I think you might too.

As an update, the game has been continuing to update with new cards for a few years now, and still keeping itself fresh.  I have been having minor connectivity issues at times, but still strongly recommend this game."
14080,Classic game
14081,"Take Clash Royale, add more minions and gameplay, remove pay to win and you have this gem."
14082,"Minion Masters is easy to pick up, but the simplicity hides a game with a lot of strategic depth. It has the potential to be something big if they can work out some balance issues and maintain a solid playerbase.

"
14083,nice game
14084,"I wasn't even aware this game existed until I saw it on steam recently and noticed it was similar to another game I was really into Clash Royale, so I decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did because this game has been one of my favorites in recent weeks.  The goal of the game is to defend your tower by placing units on a battle field, which cost mana, to defeat your opponents tower on the opposite side of the battle field.  There are over 150 different units to choose from with unique abilities and movements as well as 10 different Heroes with different abilities as well.

This game distances itself from Clash Royale to me by being significantly less expensive, and even quite fair to Free to Play players.  Any hardcore Clash player knows upgrading cards gets very expensive,  Minion Masters does away with card levels in favor of being able to place them multiple times in decks and cosmetic upgrades.  This is a very welcome change as it makes collecting the cards a primary focus and cosmetic upgrades the primary source of microtransactions, and as a result it's a much more fair game from the onset. For the cost of upgrading a mere 2-3 cards in Clash, you can have a very complete set in Minion Masters, and in this regard it makes competitive balance much better.

Art style and sounds in the game are well done and it has the feel of a game that was developed by a larger studio, although once you dig deeper you do tend to see where some of the patchwork has been done.  Overall though, the game has a level of polish that lends itself to players familiar with games like Hearthstone, while maybe not quite hitting those levels of refinement.  

Overall the game play is great and very smooth although if I had one complaint it is that the servers do still have issues from time to time.  This can be very frustrating as disconnects count as a loss, but the grind itself in the game is actually pretty forgiving, so if you do lose a little progress it isn't hard to earn it back.  

If you are looking for a strategy game give Minion Masters a try, it has fun challenging game play that scales well with skill and is friendly to F2P players in a way other games of the genre aren't."
14085,disconnects all the damn time. not worth downloading. it just dc's you from all your matches and you lose.
14086,"GARBAGE game,pushes offers in your face and email non stop,dont try it if you are after achievements than good luck cause not all of them work"
14087,ez yes
14088,Awesome strategy game. Action packed carnage!
14089,Glad I tried this game.. It's free so give it a go.. You may find yourself playing it for a while just like me!
14090,"For a while it's quite entertaining, but after some time it gets repetitive...
...at least for me."
14091,"A game full of charm that's really easy to get into, and has a lot of depth once you look deeper into the deckbuilding. The developers are also very responsive and you can really feel their love for the game!"
14092,Beep
14093,"Fun game
 still the best and the fairest out there"
14094,good
14095,thx for points :)
14096,"First of all its a fun game ,BUT the game still needs lots of tweaking for it to become fun late game , so yes you wil have lots of fun in the beginning of the game , then it starts to go downhill fast because their are just not enough deck builds yet to keep this game fresh and variable.

Early game 10/10
Late game 2/10
Still needs a lot of balancing"
14097,Good game. Some cards can really shift the meta.
14098,210 hours in and I'm still not bored of seeing Scrats flying all over from a fireball.
14099,Good game
14100,good game
14101,"Definetly recommended. A nice balanced card game. Classic strategies are required.
So if you got timing, counters and economy householding, you will make it far."
14102,Yes
14103,awesome card game
14104,Used to be fun but now days is mostly bots and trolls.
14105,"Simple, enjoyable and fun."
14106,very gud and 1 dap game
14107,good.
14108,"Fun game, easy for start hard to master."
14109,good
14110,good game for casual games if you are bored :)
14111,"very fun game

I realy like it"
14112,Fun as a casual game to play. However highly unbalanced.
14113,"I used to love minion masters, but things changes. took a break from it and came back to look at it today. The season passes kinda suck now, and you only get 1/3 of what you used to get. Adentures seems pretty lazy, same bosses, no story, and only 1 lvl, there used to be 3 different lvls atleast with rewards. Its just pretty boring in general. 
If you have never played it before, its still a good game to try out(they also give dlcs away for free when they release in weekends.), but i played since beta and honestly, i personally just dont like the new updates and content for the game"
14114,Definitely my favorite take on deckbuilding tower defense games.  Steep learning curve but really good gameplay once you understand what is going on.
14115,"Addictive, simple, fun."
14116,"Simple 
Addictive to a point
8/8 would rate again"
14117,not bad
14118,"Its just an amazing experience , free to play , not pay to win ;)"
14119,Gud gameeeee
14120,"Really interesting Arena Strategy Game based on card sets made up of creatures, spells and buildings. These are used in order to eventually overcome the enemy by sheer use of clever strategy and tactics. Thumbs up and a really recommended game for this respective game style's fans out there !"
14121,great job am not disapointed
14122,Fantastic short-paced and strategic card game. And the best part is: You can earn any content by just playing. There's no need for you to spend any money.
14123,Yes I recommend
14124,A fun little game to pass the time.
14125,"Simple to understand but tough to master, addictive at times but you might lose interest due to lack of goals. I don't like the rank reset every month. But overall it's a good game."
14126,Its just a better clash royale
14127,"Surprisingly fun and feels balanced, haven't spent a dime and I am doing pretty well. Strategy and proper deck construction matter more than dumping money to just get really good cards. I went for crafting super strong cards early and wished I hadn't."
14128,"Quite a decent Defence game with a variety of 'Minions' to choose from in building a 10 card deck. 
Objective of the game is to destroy the opposing tower while keeping yours safe.

The thing I hate the most though about this game is balancing, some of it can be plain atrocious with the devs not doing anything about it. This might change in the next update but we shall see, certain cards like Stormy are just broken because the entire field can be effected by it's attack which also stuns.

There's also a plethora of other issues from the occasional bug to frequent connection faults.

Really this needs a 50/50 review rating option. But, because I'm a fan of Defence or TD then I'll go with a recommend on that deciding factor alone. Otherwise, 50/50."
14129,EZ game to rank up
14130,"Great game with nice quick matches, good to fill in time."
14131,One of the best free steam games there is currently
14132,"Very fun and addictive, but gets frustrating when everyone plays the same cheese decks. Still i would recommend and it's F2P."
14133,A really good game
14134,"I frequently get free item codes for this game on my newsletter email.
I'm not mad

The game is good though. 8/10"
14135,"Yes Veddy Good Game.

14136,"I play this game since the Alpha, and I absolutely love it. When I want to chill, its Minion Master's Time!

Please port this game to Android (and maybe iOS). A LOT of players will gladly play it for free (with their exist account, or with a new mobile/tablet one)."
14137,weird but fun
14138,"Ok: UPDATE..
Game is still getting love from the Dev's and it shows. Game play is good and dev support is great. A+ Devs!

Great Game! I love it! Outstanding game play. I think this is the best card based game I have ever played. Watch the making of Video on this. I have made so many friends playing this game. The guild support is good and also VERY Twitch Streamer/Watcher Friendly. Give it a try and you will be hooked."
14139,"Awsome game with many combinations of cards. You spawn minions and let them destroy your enemy. Good solo, much better with friend in 2v2. I like this game. With many new cards, heroes and updates"
14140,"Quite addictive ! Too bad that they have trash servers that disconnect everyone and lose points in each direction ! Bad , i will stop playing this , it is a waste of time  ! 

1/2 hour - 2 times my team budd got disconnected , and once me ... fair to lose 250 pst !"
14141,i guess what makes it really fun is the team battle mode.
14142,"Smooth, simple, fun. Very generous with the drops and games are quick and easy. Late game does fall back to tier-whoring but that's to be expected of TCGs."
14143,"If you like non-turn based tower defense games, give this game a try"
14144,it is a good small casual game
14145,very nice
14146,"Pretty nice game if they remove the wildcard mechanic.

*Revised. Pretty nice game."
14147,Minion Masters on PC > Clash Royale.
14148,"Quite fun. Need to learn quite a bit to counter the attacks effectively, but I haven't seen any overpowered or uncounterable strategies yet."
14149,"Enjoying this game far more than I feel like I should be. Short, entertaining and pretty balanced game."
14150,"Funny little game, far better than actual Hearthstone. When you get into higher Ranks you mostly see the same cards/not much variity, but it's still nice to play for a few minutes in your spare time."
14151,This game is extremely addictive and the devs are on top of this
14152,"Pretty addicting deckbuilder. Easy to learn, really fun with a friend, tons of content and it's always being updated/content being tweaked. If you're a fan of clash royale, come and watch these minions fight"
14153,"Fun card play style game. Easy to pick up and start playing. 
Did notice there are some pretty common combinations that more seasoned players use which are hard to defend against or counter. Requires either dropping some money or slowly grind  enough shards if you want to collect better cards/masters. Overall fun game and people are friendly in the chat."
14154,nice and balance
14155,"Great free to play time killer. Before I tried this game, I hated games like this, but it's very addicting."
14156,meh
14157,great game with a great community
14158,+ 2 like
14159,It is a nice game worth trying.
14160,Great
14161,Its pretty good game just clash royale on PC
14162,This game has it's unbalanced units but it really feels rewarding to play and very fun. It does not feel like you have to pay to play either as you can buy cards but they are more then generous enough if you put in the time. Seasons end fast so you keep getting the rewards for leveling up in them again and again to buy cards with. Overall a great game that I still play off and on.
14163,Good.
14164,"good game havent seen pay to win aspects, literally won all my games so far, now im like stone 2? or something. 
7/10

try it out."
14165,"literally free.
Not pay 2 win.
Grinding isn't a pain since you learn your cards and combination along the way.
sure, paying money gives you extra stuff, but you won't feel like you're Donald Trump.
"
14166,I certainly advise  you to try this game!
14167,Great game
14168,good
14169,a fun little time waster game
14170,A nice mix of simple-yet-complex gameplay.
14171,I have a beefy PC and I can't even get through the TUTORIAL without it crashing.
14172,Good.
14173,Milloween thighs
14174,good game to play with friends. kinda fun too
14175,"A game similar to Clash Royale, but incredibly F2P friendly."
14176,This game has a pretty good Free To Play model in terms of how frequently it gives you cards for just playing the game.
14177,nice game
14178,Shockingly enjoyable
14179,Really fun game. I appreciate that it isn't pay to win at all!
14180,There's minions AND MASTERS
14181,Actually pretty fun when u play with a friend
14182,Amazing Game
14183,Great fun. Not pay to win. Supportive devs.
14184,"Fun and surprisingly deep strategy.
There are some stability issues though."
14185,"I've been playing this game off and on since it first came out, iirc, and it has only really gotten easier to play and more fun. 
If you like card games then this is a neat new take on them."
14186,relaxing
14187,"Very hooking game, causes you to come back even after you said never again."
14188,"Fun and casual, good for a quick 10 minute session. Wait times for matchmaking are fairly short as well."
14189,Feels like being Ainz in Overlord
14190,Fun game.
14191,game has come a long way since i started playing its a great game
14192,GOOD GAME
14193,"Extremely addicting (just 5 more minutes!), fairly-modeled F2P mix between tower defense and deck-builder.
It's easy to understand/hard to master kind of thing. Definitely recommended.

[EDIT] Nominating it for ""The Best Game You Suck At"". :)"
14194,qweqweasdqwe
14195,"Not a bad game. F2P strategy game that does not really force you into p2w elements, can easily pwn players in comp battles with zero dollars invested. Kind of funny actually, but it totally does not feel like I HAVE to spend money in order to be the best here, it's just a battle of wits."
14196,this game is a mobile game
14197,=)
14198,It gud game 4 me tu play wit frind. I lik it
14199,just love it.
14200,It's alright
14201,"Once you get a good amount of cards, this game is worth playing. The game can be frustrating if you don't have many cards. You can slowly earn them or pay cash for gems which can be converted to in-game currency. Give the game a try; it's free!"
14202,You can pay if you want to go faster. Or you can get it with time. Either way there is no set winning ways. Rock/Paper/Scissors ..Very fun.
14203,"Lots of fun, decent idea, and lots of room for some fun expansions with a solid platform. doesn't feel grindy at all."
14204,"it is lot's of fun. pvp combat is very easy to get into
"
14205,"Pros:
The multiple heroes that change each match
F2P
Ways to earn in-game currency 
Other modes instead of matchmaking
Cons:
P2W
Hard as a F2P
""Loot Boxes""
Rating:
Like Clash Royale, but with more gameplay and modes"
14206,like clash royale but more cards and not a grindfest
14207,Its pretty cool
14208,"I have been playing since season 1. Overall, this has been a very good card-based strategy game. At this point, the game can be enjoyed both by free players and those who invest to increase the speed that they grow. Any card and item can be gained for free and the pay side is restricted to cosmetic items. Free to play done well."
14209,It's an interesting take on the card/lane combat system.  It grows on you.
14210,op game
14211,A casual and fun real-time card battler.
14212,Not fun game
14213,Very fun game
14214,"Quality pick-up-and-play game. Great fun for short sessions as matches usually only last 2-8 minutes. Monetisation is done superbly, and the game is really generous in giving out rewards."
14215,"so much fun compared to clash royale, many more game modes, and free DLC with promo codes once in a while"
14216,"Fun game, easy to get started, but like all games alike thins one, you will spend a lot of time or a lot of money to be in the top of the ladder. And sadly, there is not much to do except PVP."
14217,"Great game 8/10. One thing that probably should be changed is that when you are disconnected from a match for some reason(other than quitting), the match should not be counted as a loss to you or a win for your opponent. Other than that, the game is pretty great!"
14218,"What started as simple card game has become so much more.
Easy to play, yet hard to guess the outcomes, each game is as unique as the decks that are player made... A game that looks like a sure thing can turn about to a sure loss with the right combination of cards played by your opponent.
I haven't liked a card game like this since MTG originally came out in the 90's.
9/10 Dragons"
14219,"Seriously this game is quite fun, the deck building is a bit complex but as you play it starts to come natural."
14220,Worth a play
14221,"Fun game, cute graphics, nice mix of RTS and TCG."
14222,hi ewdioihbwkjcihv nxfgnx cjclkkx;cvcngdbdn
14223,fun
14224,A better version of Clash Royale
14225,4 nyrvir meta 10/10 recommend to everyone (still works)
14226,Fun
14227,Amazing game with amazingly enjoyable 3D battle mechanics and originally OPTIONAL micro transactions recommended !
14228,this game is a hoot and very f2p friendly. Needs an advertising budget. Would have never known about it if it wasnt for a friend
14229,two lane card game with cool animations. will continue to play.
14230,A fun light-hearted Moba that is pretty chill I would thoroughly recommend easy to learn and pop right into.
14231,Best game top kek
14232,PC edition (clash royale) nice to play
14233,Really easy to get into and play casually. difficult to master and so many different strategies and counters
14234,Fun strategy game with cute characters^^
14235,Pretty great game:)
14236,still glorified clash royale
14237,Pretty nice!
14238,"This game is really fun and every match is only around 3 min. long! The game is also not pay-to-win as you are given plenty of options to get free cards and premium currency to buy special cards and such, not that you have to use them anyway (can buy everything else with the base currency. Great Game!"
14239,Nice game
14240,spam.. any button it doesn't matter
14241,"It's a nice game.

1vs1 (pvp) 
2vs2 (pvp) team and random play
1vs1 adventure mode(pve)
Real-time strategy (RTS) -Deckbuilding gameplay"
14242,"This game was a lot of fun until they released Morellia, while at the same time buffing Nivir the dragons health from 1800 to 2200. Morellia can summon Nivir the dragon with her 3rd perk, all the while allowing the collection process of obtaining an additional Nivir easier if you have Nivir slumbers in your deck. As people who play the game know very well now, using two Morellias and dropping two Nivirs at perk three (sometimes 4 Nivir dragons) has become the new meta at grand master level and has broken the game. Reform, and I will edit this review.

Edited: Game is more balanced now."
14243,"Only been playing about an hour and it is really fun.  The controls are intuitive, the animations are impressive and each round is exciting and new."
14244,"Easy to pick up, fast paced play-style, you just jump right in and start fighting other players. It's awesome."
14245,Fun casual Game
14246,"This game is pretty awesome! Fast paced, easy to understand the cards intuitively. AND you get a ton of chests! 

Some of the player characters you have to buy, but they give you really cool ones for free too. Hardly ever see that in F2P games. 
Overall awesome game! Especially for being free."
14247,"Great to skip some time, it's a lot of fun.
At certain ranks it can actually turn kinda challenging. I recommend it!"
14248,"Game is fun, interactive and pretty fast-paced :D i like it, keep it up"
14249,high ranks are boring as pole. Devs do not nerf meta builds and op heroes. boooooring and desperate
14250,"F2P Easy to get all the cards. Fun and the varations of cards and decks are expanding quickly with the new expansions.
All in all great great game"
14251,I love it because I win all the games!
14252,"Quick note; We will not have giveaways anymore while streaming Minion Masters, until they as a company show us love, and provide us with dwarf packs requested by our viewers. No reason has been given as to why, in many attempts and wish to not try to hard when not getting responses.

However... the game is fun.

Fantastic fun on every level. Immersive, challenging, and strategic.

Come watch our stream daily and give us a follow please! On watch and win for us unfortunately.

www.twitch.tv/icewatercreek

You have a bit of MOBA feel and a bit of Hearthstone combo.

First you collect cards.
DO a fantastic tutorial.
Collect more cards and then it is pay to win.

Then fight with those cards that rotate thru a match until there is a winner.
It is an ebb and flow exchange of intense back and forth tactics all in real time.

Great effects just add to its immersive nature.

If you like to make decisions on the fly, risk and reward, pummel like its your full time job, or want to troll... this game is for you!

Get in the arena, let the other player think he has it in the bag, then just WRECK him with your power cards.
or
Get in the arena, dominate the other player and show off your might.
or
Get in the arena and be pummeled like a group of Italian's, stomping grapes during wine season!

Any way you slice it, tons of ways to earn and win extra cards, and even the meek decks can show boss tactics when played correctly. It is all about timing, mana, card use and tactics to be a Minion Master!

UPDATE December 3rd 2020
Game is dying. They are not offering fair cash for in game items and it has been complained about for a long while. Sadly, bad marketing and business management is still very apparent. Seems like a ""Cash Grab"" for our work done, delay a sinking ship, launch expansion after expansion premature...ie.... New UPRISING released expansion.... in a better late than never.. attempt to boost the community again. Still lame packages for rubies in the store, some things will never change. They might have a small bolster in games but it is a band-aid on what is a dying, once beloved, game."
14253,i hate this shit
14254,"simple yet enjoyable for me thats why i like it
"
14255,DANK game fam wow
14256,"Fun game, been looking for a good card based game. this one seams good so far. early stages for me. level 10.  but no money spent so far. so... yeah worth a try at least."
14257,this game is so much fun with and without friends i play it with my boyfriend will extremely likely tell my friends about this game
14258,very fun game so far been enjoying it with my girlfriend
14259,So far it has been a fun free to play game! Not hard to learn and it feels like i get something out of each round i play.
14260,Op shitt boiiii
14261,"I've only played briefly and I can comfortably say that this is one of those games I see myself sinking a ton of hours into. Not to mention the fact that it's completely free, on top of that the game play has a really nice balance between being relaxing and engaging, just enough to where the isn't playing itself. All in all I feel that this game's community will only grow in time. 9/10"
14262,really good game i like it
14263,If you like Clash Royale you will like this game its very  much the same combat mechanics but this studio has done a good job making a unique experience and the art style is something that references a 90s montage of mobs we would see in some of the most popular RTS.  Keep it up guys!
14264,I am loving this game more than I thought I would. Def a must play
14265,"Its fun but I get lag spikes, not game breaking though."
14266,trash game don't download
14267,Its pretty fun strategy game.
14268,Great game. Easy to get into even for free. Not difficult to understand at all.
14269,A++
14270,"Fun, fast pace RTS kind of game.  Not pay to win.  Easy to to master with common cards."
14271,Awesome little game!
14272,Fast past games easy to learn
14273,"Enjoyable, quick game"
14274,"i really like this game
"
14275,I really like this game.  It is the gamiest!
14276,very addicting
14277,"Pretty solid and easy to get into game, its fine so far, but i have to wonder how much counterplay there is once one side starts stomping the other"
14278,"It's an okay game, mostly because it's not entirely my style though.  So you can take these suggestions with more salt then usual.


Would like a game mode that is more of an RTS style, instead of fast reflexes and spamming a cool idea would be to have a large map and you place down all units all at once. There is probably a game like that though, but a slower paced game with more thought is more my thing. Maybe add a way to control units too.

Playing against AI, just for practicing and when I need a break from competitive play.

More interesting ways to upgrade minions, and maybe more minions too. 

Maybe some balancing feedback? Ranged units are a bit weak and area effect abilities can just be dropped on them all the time, maybe increase the DPS or add a dodge mechanic and have some units survive.

Update - Community experience seems worrying, so end game may be questionable. Also some of the characters need more armor, but that's because I focus on more family friendly things. So thumbs down for now.

That's it for now, good luck with further development.





Others - I think a few cool suggestions would to add a TABS style sandbox mode where you can place a huge wave of units and just watch them fight. It can be a normal game mode too, for bigger maps you can have individual unit control or something. Say you have 50 points to spend on an army, and then after 1 minute you can spawn another 25 point wave. And I like the idea of spawning in more then one type of unit, say I can place down 5 soldier units or something. Some other things to consider, the wild card system seems fairly odd. I guess it is for balance, though I would like to be able to own multiple of the same card."
14279,Pay to progress. Everythings locked behind a big paywall or long time grinding. The recent update is chinese related. Do not play.

14281,Good fun with friends. I highly recommend this game if you need a new game to play with friends
14282,"Quite intriguing little Card game. You summon monsters, try to maintain control of the bridges connecting your battlefields and attack the enemy. Its rather unique in the way its set up mixing spawning monsters, that operate on their own on the battlefield while at the same time be a quite interesting deckbuilder.

If there was one thing, however, which i would say displeases me, then it is the way they do the ""season pass"". Its the same rip off mechanics as they employ in Fortnite, where you have to pay in order to get all the rewards for playing the season and otherwise you only get a pittance. I mean, yeah, i get its a F2P game, but isn't cosmetics and the ability to buy 'boosterpacks' enough to keep the game afloat? Do we really have to make people for their incentives to play the game?

I can't say much about the pay model.. as i didn't invest money and got to Silver Rank in a less than 3 hours. Now maybe its the equality of the players or i just got really lucky when i drew that one rare monsters, but thus far i seem to be facing largely the same cards i have access to.

Your mileage may vary. But its a fun game. There is just little point in keeping playing once you did your dailies... its just a waste of time, reward wise to do so, even if its fun."
14283,Yo this game is tight
14284,worth a try
14285,You should increase the time rule.
14286,Nice fast past and very cool because of the 2vs2 mod i can enjoy the game with my friend
14287,"How to put into words why I am enjoying this game... 
It's smooth, competitive, new but familiar... it's fantastic."
14288,Damn fun Nuff said!
14289,"Amazing game, thank you! This is already super addicting. xD"
14290,I don't know what this genre is called but it's basically PVP Tower Defense and it is so addictive. Games are quick so you can squeeze as many in as you have time for. The are is clean and the designs clearly distinguish the units so you know exactly what's happening on screen
14291,"Not a bad way to kill time. Kind of surprising, really.

Simple yet has a lot to it. Enjoyable."
14292,I love this game more than league!
14293,cool
14294,Addicting
14295,Really fun game I've played since discord added it but switched over cause steam is  my main platform
14296,"Fun game. Can be challenging at times.  Sadly, I think their server is powered by hamsters or squirrels.  Frequently get DC'd trying to launch a match, at the start of a match, or during a match, causing an instant loss. Or a team mate or opponent DC's, causing a win or loss.  Not even at peak times, gets rather annoying. Had some real fun just playing with my kid. You can earn everything in the game for free, but be prepared to do some serious grinding for some of it. Just like almost any other free to play game really. Do some research online, and look for redeem codes.  There are a few still out there for free in game stuff."
14297,FUN!
14298,"Game's fun, and I have a crippling lootbox addiction"
14299,"Pretty fun game that is easy to learn. Requires resource management and unit placement but that is really all you need as your units are controlled by the ai. It also offers a 2v2 mode so if you enjoy this kind of game and want to play with a friend, then this is something to try out."
14300,great game!
14301,"great game, its like league of legends only u dont have to depend on teammates except for team battle"
14302,Easy to learn how to play and fun to play.
14303,Fun and intricate game!
14304,"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GMAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"
14305,*****
14306,Better than Hearthstone
14307,"Balance is shit
You either roll or get rolled"
14308,"What should I say, it's fun - ROOOOONNY APPROVED."
14309,I love how it is your standard card game with an actual tower defense aspect. Easy to learn and interesting. It's really fun and entertaining!
14310,thanks for evening out the decks again!
14311,Very fun game to play with friends and by yourself. Highly recommend!
14312,Pretty good for a free game
14313,"The game is easy, fast and nice to look at. It's a really nice game if haven't too much time and you look for some distraction!"
14314,This is probably the best tencent product on epic games.
14315,"Played it a couple of times, might play it again..."
14316,fun game
14317,"Awesome game, really good graphics and good gameplay"
14318,yEET
14319,"Pretty enjoyable. It's one of those instant gratification tactical games with matches lasting only minutes at most. Doesn't feel predatory, not hard to extract fun out of it.

Can't vouch for it's longevity, however. But hey, it's genuinely free."
14320,Very addicting. Got hooked real quick.
14321,It keeps you wanting to play. I understand the concept of the game quickly. Character against character play action in real time format. I wish that it had a better way of swapping cards however. Difference of mana to mana reccomendations for new players. Its hard to view the play output that a character really has when bunched up in a cluster. Overall great game though.
14322,"The game has a lot of solid features such as: Choose your own decks and battle ranking. The free version is good if you don't mind getting pounded by cash players sometimes. Game also lets you learn from your defeat buy letting you see the deck you were just thrashed by. Oh the minionmanity!! So, yes play MM

So, additional, anyone who says this is NOT Cash leaning is kidding themselves!!!!! I have just spent 12 games in a row playing obvious OP cash players simply because I'm trying to complete the Win 10 games quest!! The AI is making it so every opponent gets the cards they need exactly when they need them and they are getting much faster mana fills. They also have the cash cards from the latest deals. So, again if you don't mind getting pasted by the OP cash guys and gals then by all means keep playing!!

The game is definitely rigged to favor cash players!!!!!!!! Oh, and it gives your cash opponent faster manna fills and the perfect card set as they go. Yes, I'm annoyed with this game!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, I'm adding to this review again!! This is the most Unbalanced game on Steam it is completely geared to cash players and it gives the player what they need when they need it!! Again if you like losing to the basement crew then by all means waste your time!! This game is not for anyone who wants to play for quests or an adventure!! It is geared to the elite that either sit all day grinding or cash their way up!! I will wait a good long while before I ever try it again!! No, do not pay anything for the DLC because there is no point once you are deep into the game. I don't believe for a moment that it will give you same advantage as the people that have apparently devoted their lives and money to this wretched waste of space and time game!!!!!!"
14323,alot of fun and tons of diffrent things to do. for sum people it might get repetitive but in my eyes almost every game does to some extent. so atleast this one is funny and always has slight changes to it yes being slight rng based being as you have a deck
14324,Super fun and has great game mechanics
14325,"It's kind of like Clash Royale, but on PC. Good game though, I like it."
14326,So far So fun
14327,"honestly didn't think i would be a fan, but i'm hooked instantly in the RNG based strategy card game."
14328,"This is the 6th player on your LoL team embodied. A MOBA should employ this as a position on the team, like a goalie

14329,Iz fee.99 and fun
14330,This satisfies my hunger for power and domination OP/10
14331,Amazing game and highly addictive
14332,Yes
14333,"FUN, QUICK BATTLES

14336,i have erectyl dysfunction
14337,This game is so fun and simple even Cosmo Kramer can play it.
14338,Love the mechanics. Having a very enjoyable experience with a friend. Reminds us of games we played on Warcraft and what not with a new flavor.
14339,It's a good game . But I dont think remove two sub towers in Clash Royale is a good choice .It makes strategy simple .
14340,i cant stop playing. if you like minion battlers this game is so much fun. and it has coop to play with a buddy. so many different strategies that can be employed. would def recommend
14341,Pretty damn fun
14342,"It's like a PC version of Clash Royale, I personally love playing duo's with friends or randoms late at night on my free time, the game overall is just fun to play (a very addictive one too). Loving the game so far!"
14343,"First thing you need to know is that it's 100% Pay to win, and also with "" surprise mechanics."" The second thing you need to know-it's not worth it.

The reason it's not worth it is because it's endlessly redundant. Yet, no game is the same, but there are absolutely ""certain cards""  that players will use if they have access to them. After playing a long time, you see these cards so often that it all blends into the same game-over and over again. Conversely, there are many cards that are useless because their math fails; the cost is too much to cast, and they don't offer the value of other cards. This aspect limits the choices for a viable hand. All of these ""power cards"" verses ""weak cards"" adds up to encouraging you to spend real money to build a few diverse decks. 

Put it this way; It's a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. For free, you get the rock, but the paper, and scissors are gonna cost you.

There may be a decent game concept here, but it will need a less greedy, and  a smarter developer (one who can do simple math; other than sales targets) to bring this game to light."
14344,Immediately Addicting! Love it!
14345,Troubadour
14346,Well designed game to be completely honest. You would think the menu is too much but the game teaches you. Only 45 minutes of play time but I like the mix of a Summoner Wars with MTG/Hearthstone. Fun to play with a friend.
14347,1
14348,"Very well polished game, can't get enough!"
14349,"You've never been truly cucked until you spam hundreds of Blood Imps and Puffs into a bridge just for your f2p opponent to be running a fucking Whirly Scrat, instantly erasing you from this dimension."
14350,great battle game
14351,Nerf Morella Plz. Both her ability and attack are way more powerful than other hero. Otherwise this game is pretty good.
14352,Pretty baller
14353,its pretty alright
14354,fun game to play with a friend
14355,"Quick games are a plus. Requires moderate strategy, and has an aesthetically pleasing visual style."
14356,"has a lot of potential as a competitive game, pretty similar to clash royale but it feels more dinamic. Like the horizontal view. It combines hearthstone MTG Arena and clash royale"
14357,"I love it, very fun game"
14358,Its alright
14359,Fun Game so far
14360,very intense game
14361,"it so funn game
"
14362,"Great game, i just wish it didnt freeze and lag out so much on the xbox."
14363,"I like cheese, so I like this game."
14364,"I don't usually comment on games, but this has to be said. 
If you are a casual player it's a game for you. You can stop right here and go download it, BUT:
If you are a competitive player and you do not want to spend money on this game, DON'T PLAY IT. 
I have had a very positive opinion about this game when I first started playing it. I really had.
The good:
+ Good graphics
+ Good mechanics, even on low settings
+ Required actual skill to be good at this and isn't really all that pay2win. You can beat players with high-end decks with a theoretically weaker one if you are good.
+ Nice system of achievments and quests makes you want to come back to unlock more and more stuff
+ Very balanced EVERYTHING.
+ In 2v2 mode your teammate can see what you are planning to do, which is cool since you play often in a duo with some random guy
+ The 2v2 and 1v1 modes are very different which allow you to create fun synergies with your partner
+ Cool shop system with rotating shop offers every day

And that was it for a while... Despite some minor bugs it was good, but I am a competitive player and there is a lot that ultimately destroyed the experience for me.
DRAFT MODE:
You pay 750 gold(it's not a lot, it's more than a fair price) and you pick 10 cards out of 10 random sets of three and see how many games you can win(you can lose up to three times). The concept is similar to Arena in Hearthstone, but done much more poorly. A lot of the time there are cards that are really weak on their own and need some other card for synergy. Some don't even work without another compatibile card. I had that situation a few times, where I picked a card that requires me to play a ranged minion afterwards and then the roster didn't allow me to pick a ranged card. Bad design. Also if you finally get a really cool deck you are limited to 12 wins, which sounds like a lot but doesn't feel like this at all when you have 12 wins and 0 losses. Extremally underwhelming.
2v2 MODE:
- Very bad ping system on 2v2 mode. It's poor and rarely allows you to show your intentions to someone unless it's something very simple. Very unreliable half the time when non-premade, and when premade it's almost useless since you are probably on voice anyway.
- On 2v2 you can go either solo, where you get a random person assigned to your team, or premade, where you can take in someone from your guild or friends list. There is separate ranking for non-premade duo and premade duo, which means that if you get diamond ranking with premade and you start playing solo you have wood ranking there, which is good, BUT there is one matchmaking queue for both, which means that on highter levels you and your non-premade partner will get premade enemies a lot, which means they already have a strategy and some deck syndergies and 99% of the time you will just get rekt. From what people in chat say this complaint has been around since 2017, so that doesn't really bode well for the 2v2 mode.
REPORTING/FEEDBACK/BUGS:
- You cannot report a player from inside of the game. You can only report player for chat in-game. That's it. If you want to report a player for example for afking as your non-premade duo partner and ruining your match, or an enemy for cheating you have to write an e-mail. And boy, they haven't replied to mine for like two weeks now, so I wonder how are they gonna take care of the cheaters/trolls.
- You cannot report a bug in-game. There is a ""feedback"" button, but it requires you to open a browser. Just stupid.
- There was a particular exploitable bug a while ago where stealth minions would restealth immediately after attacking, which just results in invisible minions killing you with you sitting there defenseless if you don't have the right cards to destroy them. But it happens sometimes, right? It sure does, but it took them ages to fix this instead of disabling the troublesome cards immediately.  Everyone exploited the hell out of it throwing the ranked system and draft mode into chaos. Seems like an in-game bug reporting system would help.
FINALLY THE WORST:
I eariler said it isn't really that much of a pay2win game, but I was hella wrong. The main reason I quit this game was the 2v2 premade > non-premade fiasco, but there is another one I think is a big red flag for/from the developer.
Recently they have released a new hero, Morella. She is just OP. If you don't defeat her fast enough, she will level up and get ""Queen's Dragon"" card. It costs 6 mana, but casts 6/7(I am not sure now) cost spell and summons a minion that costs 2 + 10 mana(you have to play at least two cards to get it). So you spend 6 mana and get around 18/19 mana out of this. 
A lot of people are defending it, but the truth is that if you don't have specific cards to deal with this monument of stupidity you will lose within a moment. And you don't know who you will be matched against next game, so you build a general deck that possibly defeat as many potential enemies as possible. The dragon renders most of those decks useless.
The best part?
You can get matched in non-premade duo vs premade duo of two morellas and beat your keyboard with your own face, because you already know they are going to tear you a few new holes just so they can ravage them again and again. 
And no, I refuse to belive that out there lives someone so mentally inept that they don't see that as a problem. This was done on purpose so players will now HAVE to buy this hero with money (you can but her with the ""free"" currency, but if you haven't saved for her until now it will take you at least a few weeks before you are able to).
And after a while, when half the player base bought her with cash/in-game currency and the other half is done with losing constantly to the double dragon FYIAD they will nerf her to playable levels so people don't abandon the ship.
No, they don't have a forum where you can share your concerns, there isn't polls you can take to show them your disapproval. IF YOU WANT, WRITE US AN EMAIL.
This is a scum tactic to temporarily turn a game from f2p to p2w and I hold nothing but pure contempt to the genius behind this idea. Probably shouldn't hire anyone who has ""Activision"", ""Bethesda"" and ""Blizzard"" in their CV."
14365,thoroughly enjoying every second of this! Would recommend to anyone!
14366,"good game.short time game .nice
"
14367,"I'd recommend it to others. There's no networking issues, the UI is clean and responsive.  The gameplay is intuitive and exciting.  The variety of cards and strategies has already made me excited to play this game more"
14368,"Lots of fun. Simple, addictive and cr@p ton of fun!"
14369,"I agree the new master is impossible to win especially in team play which is my preferred method of play. I usually use Ravager, but his 3 tier xp drop is a joke compared to a dragon being dropped. I will stop playimg this game since it isn't fun anymore.
"
14370,"Game is enjoyable - Easy to understand, and play, with high intensity action. Its free, what do you have to lose."
14371,"Easy to learn, quick matches."
14372,fun
14373,total biscuit recommended it and i played it. its pretty good
14374,it looks like a android game but also cooler
14375,It's simple and yet very indebt. The community is active and great to play with friends.
14376,It is designed to play on human traits of serotonin release but its simple relaxing and fun
14377,it fun
14378,Great game fun and addictive like meth
14379,.
14380,fun
14381,"Its simple yet fun, im enjoying this game with my wifu, but when we lose in duos i make her clean the floor or do the dishes... so we dont really get to play the game for too much, caus she's always cleaning the house now adays."
14382,"Minion Masters is a pretty cool game, it takes card games and adds real time battles with the summons and spells from the cards. The game was easy for me to pick up and start playing, and I would honestly recommend it to anyone who thought it sounded interesting."
14383,"macht spass, ganz besonders mit meiner freundin"
14384,this game is mega fun to play!
14385,worst game ever
14386,"What to say about this game? Well at first it seems fun. Then reality sets in. It becomes clear early on that you are going to have to invest money into the game to get anywhere (as is the case with all Pay to win games ... oh I mean Free to play games). The game has its fun factor up until you get thrown into the shark tank player pool. Then the glaring and obvious cheats manifest. Unfortunately Minion Masters is not immune to the Plague of cheating that infests online games now days. The two most popular cheats I have encountered are infinite mana cheats and unit hack cheats. When you see players cast two 10 mana creatures back to back ... time to go .... and this game seems to be riddled with players that use the mana boost cheat. Others have posted the same problem (cheating) and responses were :You probably didn't see the mana puiffs they were using"" to which I had a good laugh at. Puffs period are easy to spot and are destroyed even easier. Mana puffs have to dance around on a bridge for 10 seconds to produce 1 mana .... yeah. No they do not explain casting 8+ casting cost creatures in rapid succession ..... and no mana frenzy doesn't cover it either as we are talking early game here not late game. So until the cheating is reigned in I would say avoid this train wreck BUT ... if they ever do get the cheating under control this could be fun.

**Update** - as of 09/27/2019 - The cheating has only gotten worse. Mana regen cheats, unit health and damage cheats it is awful especially after school hours, weekends and holidays in fact this game is a close 2nd to TF 2 as THE single most cheated in game on the internet.

**Update** - helpful hint for new players .... play in the morning block (North America) you can get a lot of clean games during the times of 0600 to 1200  (CST)  .... after that the cheating crew starts showing up and clean games are far and few between.

**Update**  - 10/24/2020 -  I have been playing this game for quite awhile now and I have watched as the player base had dwindled drastically. According to Steam Charts as of this date, MM has lost 187% of its player base in the last 30 days and is down to no more than 1K people playing at any given time. The reason for the player base loss is obvious as the legit player base mostly has left the game. It is hard to get new players in here as they come in and see the obvious cheating and leave rather than deal with it. All one needs is an open set of eyeballs and a basic set of math skills to see what is plain. The so called ""Replay"" system for this game is nothing of the sort. It is not an actual game replay at all but rather a data point game recreation algorhythm.

 The data points merely collect the data on what unit was cast and where on the grid it was positioned initially, thats it. It then allows the recreation to play out according to game rules. Problem is that when cheats are used is LIVE action, those cheats are not rendered in the recreation therefor the game often plays out much differently than the LIVE action version. The point is cheats do not show on the replay. They know this thus the game has become a Haven for the unscrupulous. The Devs crearted this system and have to know the truth of it , the recreation system acts like a shield of steel against cheating claims because the first thing they and the cheaters themselves will scream for .... yep a REPLAY. The problem is that very shield of steel and the haven it provided cheaters is the very reason the game is rapidly declining. Too bad as this game COULD have been one of the best in its genre."
14387,"Dev, please fix the bug where I can't buy ruby from shop. This game is one of the rare case where I feel bad for being unable to support the developer.
Game is fun, constantly updated. Beside some high tier cosmetic that required ruby (the cash currency), everything else that affect gameplay, you can grind and unlock without relying on random mechanic like loot-boxs.
I can't really think of anything that I dislike about the game beside the lack of cosmetics, not many interesting things to buy. This probably due to the developer team is small and they have to focus on gameplay.
"
14388,Very fun. I got to gold in like 4 hours.
14389,"goofy fun, nice eye candy"
14390,Fun game!!!
14391,"Easy to learn, fun to play."
14392,(y)
14393,Great little time killer.
14394,"good graphics, good gameplay.
"
14395,New kind of strategy game.. Great graphics.. enjoyable..Remind me of childhood cards games with visible graphics..
14396,Having fun so far
14397,"Honestly... the latest hero Morellia is ridiculous. It really brings to light how pay-to-win this game is. She out-damages, slows...and her abilities: Unholy Bargain and Queen's dragon are ridiculous. What's the point in releasing a hero that out-does every other hero they have made before her? Sales. Compare her abilities to a hero like Ratbow. The damage+range stats and bonus cards that are added to the deck guarantees a win based on hero alone. Dumb. Wanna get that win streak? Get that hero. Done."
14398,"The balance is garbage. Whoever has the most Dragons wins. Since he shows up in every single game (because the exceptionally OP card isn't even the least rare) multiple times, the game becomes entirely about luck instead of about who can build a decent deck."
14399,"This is a fun game, the lag isn’t fun, but easily fixable with a graphics decrease. Very enjoyable, and the announcer guy is awesome. Definitely needs improvement though."
14400,because its easy to play
14401,something like mobile phone but i still like it in my computer enjoy playing it
14402,Quick paced action. Fun card selection. 10/10
14403,"Easy to pick up and play, fun mechanics!"
14404,Fuck dude this game is fun!
14405,its good
14406,It runs on my laptop and I enjoy the mechanics.
14407,Fun game.
14408,"This game is exactly what I've been hungry for: Strategy, graphics, and how it is pretty FTP. I love these kinds of games, but I can rarely find one that scratches my itch. Well, I would say more, but I really wanna go back to the game. 100-100. <3"
14409,Pay to win
14410,"This is basically a PC version of Clash Royale, but the game is surprisingly good and addictive. The game is a hybrid of CCG and real time tactics, where units and effects you summon are determined by the cards you have.

Minion masters has intense short matches (averaging 2-5 minutes), very quick matchmaking queues (usually less than 10 seconds), several game modes and tons of various units called minions.

Playing as a master, you choose where to spawn these minions (playing cards from your deck) on the battlefield, but have no direct control over them. Different minions counter or support each other, allowing you to create combos or outplaying your opponent by breaking up his strategy. There are also spells, allowing you to interact with the battlefield and the minions directly.

I played less than 20 hours and reached only platinum, but it doesn't seem yet there's only a few boring meta-decks ruling over everything else. Sure, some minions are weaker than the other, but huge variety of them (around 170 in total and you can only choose 10 for your ""army"") allows very different types of decks.

Moreover, there are several masters (essentially, classes) in the game, each with their own passive and active abilities. This allows more strategies, more decks, and, in the end, increasing variety of the game.

The only downside of the game is that it's somewhat grindy, but which online f2p game isn't? Anyway, I wouldn't call Minion Masters P2W. Yes, you will progress faster if you spend real money, but the majority of good cards are pretty accessible, and even the starting deck (unlike in the most card games) is pretty good and fun to play.

Totally recommended, 9/10!"
14411,"nice, i love to play this game. But, your fcking card is pay to win. u cant make this game balance."
14412,simple+fast+fun+win :D
14413,fun time killer keep making new units :)
14414,"It is a nice card battle game with good concept and balanced frame. If you are the fan of the genre, it may be worth checking."
14415,Who's of thought... But this Game is amazingly fun! It may just be my game of choice! Check it out!
14416,"After grinding to GM and playing the game for a little while I saw the true nature of the game as greedy. While a developer could easily plead ignorance to the fact they nerf the cheaper, much more easily attained combos and simultaneously release much more powerful and expensive cards. I am fine with a power curve as any game with rarity in a collection has one. To me though, this one seems intentional by the developers to maximize profit. Atleast thats how I feel when they nerf the easily countered and cheaper stormy combo and then release a hero that is clearly more powerful in every stage of the game than the others. How are the players not going to feel that this was an intentional move to get us spend more money. I dropped 20 bucks in the first hours because I really enjoyed the game and felt you deserved my support. If i knew how slow collecting shards would be, or if I knew that a legendary card would take me more than 71 hours of gameplay to save up for(I bought a few 50 and 125 shard cards to be fair), then I definitely would not have spent money on this game and no longer recommend it to my friends."
14417,Really fun game
14418,just to pass some time its fun. not much to say. just home your team mate leaves you. =/
14419,very enjoyable :)
14420,Becomes pay to win when new updates with op cards/heroes are released. Those who pay for those cards/hero gets a head start and when one finally affords them they get nerfed.. Thanx..
14421,"Great game, and its not P2W"
14422,Great real time strategy 2 lane card game
14423,Its like Clash Royale but with better WAY better animations and no pay to win aspekt its super fun
14424,Very easy to get into. It has smooth gameplay with easy to understand tutorials/guides. There is a lot of replayability and variety in this game that makes you want to level up and earn more rewards. Great game overall!
14425,"Its fast paced and easy to pick up but hard to master, and its free so its worth the try."
14426,The only HearthStone replacement for me since Hearthstone was released. I wanted a new casual game to play every day so much. This one is inspired by so many games. even the music reminds me of Fortnite. Hearthstone looks so boring now and playing with another person is so much more fun. Everything about this game is quality and fun. Must play!
14427,"Fun game if you like games similar to ""Clash Royale"". I approve."
14428,noice
14429,RIP Minion Masters
14430,"loads of fun, pretty good learning curve, need to focus build to move up in ladders."
14431,"Great fun, I really enjoy how to have a master and the whole game runs super smooth. Looking forward to playing the team match with some friends"
14432,"A fun card, minion game that is fast paced and easy to learn but still with enough potential to be difficult with more time played because of card strategy opening up"
14433,"Nice learning curve getting in. Not a big fan of the micro-transaction feel I get of this game. having said that it seem to look fair without pay to win yet?
"
14434,A cute little time killer.
14435,Fun free to play game.
14436,Lich killed it for me. Fuck you game. I'm out.
14437,it's simply to play. just drag and wait
14438,"Very entertaining, lots of cards, lots of strategies, I don't know if there's a meta but I managed to build a maze that gives me 90% of wins and still it seems balanced, it has a lot of innovative game modes, give it a try c'mon"
14439,great
14440,Simple and Fun
14441,"This game was fantastic.  Combination luck and strategy.  Interesting, a good time sink.  Then....

Devs.  For some reason, they release a Master that is basically unbeatable.  Only by sheer luck and a clueless player can you beat her.

Bye.  Why do they always ruin the good ones?"
14442,Fun little game. I am enjoying it as a something to do to unwind.
14443,Nope
14444,"This game is very addictive.  User friendly game controls. Teaches you how to play as you go and gives you all the loot you need.
"
14445,"Its like childhood game come true type board/card game, back when you use action figures and fought, here its dream come true via game. It uses masters who have their own perks, these masters, ie us uses a deck consisting of variety of minons and spells then we control the bridge and push forth to victory if you can :3 . So far the tutorial is decent, not P2W the PVP grind is good, the PVE is not so great or develped like heathstone's and best part there is 2v2 heh and you can matchmake 2v2 with freinds just for fun over all so far very nice."
14446,Like Clash royale but hella better
14447,fun game better clash royal
14448,si si muy bueno
14449,"Its fun and i like it
"
14450,Yes
14451,"Card game brawler where you use a growing mana pool to play different cards that summon different creatures or abilities.
Player base doesn't seem to be that large, and you will certainly know when you are fighting a bot or an actual player (mostly cause the real player will have a built deck and will usually crush you).
The servers are really unstable and regularly drop players or flat out crashes before or after a game....... If it crashes after a game you loose anything you got from winning or loosing that game.
I would not really recommend this game because without a lot of time and patience with the terrible servers you will run into a wall fast.
I also got bored fairly fast because it becomes really repetitive and if you start loosing a game it's almost impossible to recover.
If you play a team one you better hope your ally built their deck good or it's an auto loose...... If the server doesn't drop you that is or freeze while you are loading in.
Cool concept but not a very good game in the end."
14452,"Highly recc this game mainly for fun fast paced strategy / lane pvp, every game is fast and it's an amazing game to jump in and out of. Current ques are under 10 seconds a que, tons of masters, tons of cards and deck building, strategy, co op or duel, etc. Very solid and underrated title. since recent balance changes all previous issues have been rather solved."
14453,Fun game. It's free so try it out.
14454,Good game//AKA copy of clash royale
14455,"Simple good time killer, fast matches that are tense but enjoyable. Cute graphics. Would definitely say give it a shot."
14456,its good
14457,Pretty strong start. Let's see if the game holds on
14458,"Ex-GrandMaster number 601 here. This game on its time would have suck your life and you would have loved it. Its amazing. But the game devs went full greedy, don't know how it is nowadays i might try it again."
14459,awesome game. worth trying.
14460,"Because it's fair, because it's fun, because the UI doesn't suck.  That's why I am having fun."
14461,"Well made game, and is really fun I highly recommend."
14462,Took my friend and I 21 hours to get to masters in pre-made team battles. easy game tbh
14463,lotsa fun ... what if the game allowed heroes to level up
14464,This was a fun game but then the latest patch came out and fucked it. I'll change my review if they rebalance this bullshit.
14465,this game is so cool u can do so much with it
14466,"Fun game, great tutorial"
14467,"good game
"
14468,Great Fast paced game with high strategic value!
14469,Exceptional Game!
14470,pretty clean. runs great. good balance on units so far.
14471,"Super fun, great job by the devs.  Really looking forward to other work they put out, putting them on a rare follow.  The only problem with the game and why I stopped playing it in the first week is the grind is so real in this game.  Your progression grinds to a halt in the first two days and then it takes days before you gain anything else.  I was destroying people and it didnt matter, barely any new cards/upgrades.  Creeping super slow up ranks with way more than 5/1 win ratio too.  Thats in some ways a personal thing, but you need absolutely give this game a try if you like MOBAs or card games because the graphics, gameplay, and everything about it feels fresh in this market.  See for yourself if its something for you."
14472,"Fun game, remind me of Barrack Masters from Dota2 Mods"
14473,(y)
14474,"Good game to let time pass by....and alot of minions to choose from:D
If they keep adding units variety and more features it will improve the fun experience :D"
14475,"I've only played for a bit so far, but this game is really engaging and has a lot of tactical potential that I'm sure I will see in due time."
14476,Reminds me of Card Shuffle from WC3 custom map
14477,game is great I'm enjoying it Right
14478,"Good game, made me review it, but honestly, it's fun. I was skeptical, don't generally like these types of games, I hated the popular mobile one... but this? This is pretty fun. Could it be because I haven't played very much? Probably. But, ya know, that's just how it goes some times."
14479,"Very fun.

14480,"Simple, yet complex. Enjoyable anyway you want it"

[b] What I Liked [/b]

I had a ton of fun with this game.  I loved building my own decks, positioning troops, watching card combinations work together, etc.  I always felt like I had a reason to play on an almost daily basis.

[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]

For one, I could never tell if I was fighting a player or a NPC.  However, the worst part of the game was the same combination of cards are used over and over again, which kills any variety the game has.  The devs are adding more masters and cards, but, it just replicated the issue.

[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]

While I had a ton of enjoyment out of it, it's now all gone.  The same combination of cards are used over and over, and it's killed any variety the game has to offer.  I'll no longer spend more time in it due to that.

[b] Disclaimer [/b]

I have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!

14482,"Snowflake game full of disguised bots, designed so that everyone gets to Masters rank.  The coding is addicting and the developers troll you in game."
14483,Awesome sauce!
14484,game is great I love this diddly
14485,"my first day and so far its pretty fun, maybe it because am only winning so far lol"
14486,"Good game, really enjoying it for now. The gameplay feels good and is awesome. There is a feeling of acomplishemnt when you win.

The narration is awesome too. Nothing to say about the game that is bad, for now."
14487,Fast paced matches with snap decision making tactics and a clearly deep meta to dive into on deck construction.
14488,?
14489,"addicting gameplay, easy to learn, usually short and intense battles.  frequent rewards.  enjoying the heck out of it so far.  5/5"
14490,"Challenging simple and intense 
I personally feel its better played with friends but the game is a lot of fun solo and in teams"
14491,love this game!!
14492,eh
14493,<3
14494,Nice game
14495,"This game is a sh*tshow.

Unbalanced cards purposely released in order to get people to pay real money into their battlepass to get the new cards.  Cards are then later fixed aka nerfed because their intentional of getting people to pay money is done.

They don't do proper QA in this game before releasing/making changes. 

General tuning of the cards doesn't work because the fine line between 2/3/4/5 mana cards leads to some cards having more value than others.   Also they screw up the game balance with poorly thought of changes."
14496,"If you like card games, strategy games, and quick games, as in 5min games (which hence doesn't require tons of hours of play every day), then this game could work for you. I'm also a clash royal player and the concept is very similar. Very good all in all, well balanced, and a real free to play at the end of the day which is even better. I've still put 20 euros in it at the start, money well spent, no need for more"

14502,Pretty fun game. It's like MTG RTS.
14503,One of the best games I have played...
14504,Fun game seems well balanced and paced and good variety of cards so far.
14505,good game . love it
14506,"fun game, strategic. And reminds me of a mod I used to play on starcraft years ago.  Menus n stuff could use a bit of work but honestly its pretty good over all."
14507,che ta buenardo
14508,I loved this game's concept; I enjoyed very much the combination of card play with minion semi-controlled attacks against your opponents.
14509,"Great concept, a lot of great things about the game but the devs and updates are seemingly non-existent or have never actually played their own game. It was fun until you get into the master tiers where everybody uses the same exact broken decks so there's no room at all for creativity in the game. If you don't feel like running the meta, you're going to lose every time. There's been broken cards since I started playing and absolutely nothing has been done about it."
14510,fun
14511,Very fun so far!
14512,Great Game
14513,"Been playing this game for 30 minutes, so far i'm having a great time!"
14514,Good clean fun.
14515,I just joined the game and I'm steamrolling on some people who spent money on the game. You can progress faster by getting your credit card but skills matter a lot as well. Fun times!
14516,Great quick game to pass the time!!
14517,very fun a good way to kill some time and play with viewers
14518,"Some of the combos in this game are stupid. You can literaly just wait till you have enough mana to play a healer, an elemental that blocks all damage to nearby minions and then just some ranged to poop on everything, and if they have the lengendary wolf down too yea you just not going to win certain combos like if you see someone put a stormy and a healer like yea no thanks too OP to counter."

14527,pretty cool
14528,"Simple, Easy tug of War style game with a lot of variety of minions to use at your disposale. A lot to unlock and a crap ton of rewards. Never spent a dime yet and it's sooo much fun! Give it a try it's a small download, looks great, easy to learn, and FREE!"
14529,"I love the game but sadly it's ruined by this stupid card mechanic like hearthstone.
It just gives people who do have good cards an insane advantage. 
And good luck getting these cards yourself without paying any money.
That may take a while.
Castle Fights is a great game by principle, but not with card decks."
14530,"I am happy that finally there is a game in this field where gaining the same card doesn't mean it got better stats, so players who don't spend their insurance money to buy packs doesn't have the handicap in a mirror game"
14531,Lit...
14532,bad
14533,Just try and get addicted to it. Don't ask more!
14534,This game is just a copy/paste of the mobile game Clash Royal with less satisfying animations and confusing characters.
14535,"Clean Graphics, and variety of ways to deck build and challenge. Solo play mode is an absolute plus."
14536,Fun Card Game
14537,game is cool thx
14538,I like this game. Its great at making you feel like an absolute pro at it. I win 99% of my games against players and I refuse to believe I am any good. Its refreshing from other reflex and precision skill related PVP games I play.
14539,Awesome game !
14540,Fun game for a casual gamer. Easy to understand tutorial that introduces the various game options.
14541,awsome game :D
14542,Lote of fun
14543,Good time killer with strategy but easy pick up and play capabilities.
14544,Fun game to play with friends.

14547,GG HF !
14548,This is actually an incredible game
14549,Fun
14550,"First impressions when I first saw this game were very low, but after playing it literally projects you up high from the start and isn't afraid to give out gifts often.  You'll get more for winning, but still a great amount even if you aren't always the winner.
 
What's unusual though is being able to build up towards heroes though if you don't want to do that they have a few free heros available for you each week to play as to help if you really don't like the starter hero of course.
 
 I would say making heros easier to unlock should be a priority thing down the road to make it less pay to win cause some heros can make it or break it for some people, but the combination of what you use for cards/minions should always be the first thing you look at when you're playing.

  Always keep looking for a synergy when you get a reward based on what you've already unlocked and it will benefit you in the long run.

I would very much appreciate it if the developers would look into making it a little easier to upgrading lower ranked minions vs. higher ranked minions cause you can get some amazing legendaries or epics out of a chest or a 1,000 gold draw for a power stone, but if you don't and all you've got are lower leveled minions promoting/upgrading those minions can be the worst pain in the entire game.    
      Also there aren't enough spells in the game vs. putting out minions and it would be great if we could see a combination of Minions & spells or minions that cast spells when they are put on the field.

 I play a ton of Hearthstone and love ranked, but I don't see a lot of solo game play in this game and that at first really deters me from the game though hopefully soon the developers will see this and put in content that people can play that doesn't always have to be against another player.    
   Basically some SOLO content would be appreciated. 

It's a 3D spin on what hearthstone could have been, so this is more than just a card game it's for Masters."
14551,decent
14552,loving it!!
14553,review
14554,So dope! the announcer isn't even that annoying.....
14555,Great game and quick matches so you're not stuck in 30 min plus games like other multiplayer games
14556,Quick to play and a lot of fun :)
14557,can't stop playin
14558,Nice and fast fun
14559,"good game, more depth then expected."
14560,"pros:
games are quick
you get cards much faster than you would think
great time waster

cons:
feels kinda shallow
seams like a story mode would be cool but there isnt one
hard to get new masters"
14561,"smooth, addictive, not p2w, team battle is good fun!
"
14562,yes
14563,"ay imma tell you right now, best game i ever streamed on twitch :DDDD my chat is loving it! fun video game!"
14564,This game bangs
14565,Good game so far.
14566,I like it because its similar to another card came I play but with real time requires you to think on your feat .
14567,"Easy got get into, fun to play, so far doesnt seem to be p2w."
14568,"This game is pretty fun so far. I'm about 3 hours in and I'd say it'd got just the right amount of content that the pay to win jewel buying isn't necessary at all. It's like a MOBA card game, if that makes any sense. 

[h1]*UPDATE*[/h1]

Hahahahahaha, 3 hours in. Those were the days, when I was wet behind the Minion Masters ears. This game is nothing short of GLORIOUS."
14569,"A mixed bag of RTS/TD are an excellent game for a F2P, but as you can see, microtransaction is all scattered in this game. Would I recommend it, of course, It's f2p even if you won't spend a dime you can still enjoy it. 

Relaxing

Fun

Enjoyable

Competitive

I want to know who is the voice the announcer when the game starts and finish he/she deserves a big raise.

14570,it fun it silly and it free
14571,Very fun and casual game.
14572,Awesome
14573,Fun Game to kill some free time.
14574,Game seems fun thus far
14575,good free game
14576,"game seems fun so far,"
14577,good game recommed
14578,"TLDR Nice and interesting game, but random cards selection in game ruin fun.

UPDATE: New cards that are introduced in each season are strong (too strong) and others get nerfed. So if you want to stay competitive you have to buy season pass. If feels like this is slowly becoming Pay2Win game.

Quality game with really nice graphics and lots of different minions to choose so you can tailor your own deck to play.
Minions are unlocked with Gold, Shards or Rubies. Additionally you can spin gears which will unlock random minion. All this can be purchased with real money (it is F2P game after all). One could argue that this gives paying players advantage, but I don't really see it that way (it only boost's their unlock progress instead of grinding and they could buy some fancy skins).
At the moment of writing, there around 200 minions in game (but at start you only get about 20 if I am not wrong, rest of them you have to unlock through progress).
You get daily challenges that are sometimes interesting to solve.

BUT, when game starts you get RANDOM cards from ones that you picked.
So you can use only 4 cards at the time and this makes it a lot luck based game. It is impossible to create deck which will suite for in most scenarios, you can only hope get opponent which has weaker deck (and/or less luck) than you.
Additionally, if you reach higher rank with only weak cards, you won't have fun at all (you need to unlock stronger cards if you want to counter some tough combos from opponents).

Minion balance might be questionable. There are some cards which I never saw that anyone played simply because they are too weak.

4/10"
14579,Great game much fun
14580,"Runs really smooth, matchmaking is fun"

14590,Meth.
14591,Its pretty cool for a free game for now. Didnt play much but its cool
14592,simple and good
14593,"This game is entertaining. 

You choose your army like in a card game, then in battle you must make your choices and strategies in real time, the armies are not static, they fight each other depending on how they come close each another. The purpose is to destroy the enemy tower, so you have to arrive with your armies to the tower. You are the master of the army, and each type of master has its own specific perks.
As you level you get to upgrade your perks and  your army, and you also may buy new units.

The game is easy going, with simple intuitive interface, and you do not get bored.
I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to battle, but not in a static way like in cards game."
14594,(Y)
14595,Excellent online game! :-)
14596,tactical but simple
14597,"awesome
"
14598,Havent played much yet but I really enjoy the concept so far :)
14599,"This game is a lot more skill based than you can thought about. 
If you are not, then you ll most likely come here writing a bad review blaming about p2w or how cheesy are some combos.

° Jokes aside, I'm a p2w hater and I guarantee you it's not one. I think you can get all the card day1 for around 100€ which is nothing for that kind of business model, and what would be stupid to do before you play at least 15hours.
° You can 100% play it free to play.
° The only way I see you may need to pay is if you are really into theory crafting and building decks AND want to test everything by yourself, AND don't wanna wait 1 or 2 months,THEN you may need ~40€ to get 90% of cards.

° About gameplay it's a lot of fun IMMEDIATLY.
° You can start with a friend since there is 2v2, which is the one mod I prefer personnaly
° It's very skill based
° The balance is ok+ , not perfect of course , since players nowaday don't like to think and will alway play the few deck above the average, but you can compensate with skill if you don't wanna play cheese deck. And that may only be a problem starting at master 1 / grand master. And I can assure you, you gonna loose against budget deck too, since some players are insanely good.

All in all it's a 92 out of 100 IMO.

oY"
14600,"Fun for a free game
"
14601,"its really fun and great to play with friends
"
14602,Very good intro to this fun and quick action game.  Recommended!
14603,"This game is not as strategic as you might think. There is good reason to believe they pair you up with bots at the lower ranks so you'll feel good about winning over and over again. You soon realize the same three decks are played at the higher ranks. Go to the subreddit and see what advice is available for crafting. Everyone recommends you craft the same two legendary minions, showing those cards are overpowered and the game lacks decent balance. Most of the strategy is in unit placement and rock - paper - scissors style countering against your opponents units, since you do not control them. If you enjoy that go ahead, not my cup of tea."
14604,nice game
14605,"Worth a try, definitely."
14606,This is a very good game and I am enjoying it thoroughly.
14607,great and nice
14608,"This game is a blast.
A mixture of tower defense, card-deckbuilding, real-time-strategy, tactics and teamplay. Two parties (1on1 or 2on2) on two different sides, each second your mana goes up and you spend it on summoning units, spells and sometimes temporary buildings (obstacles or actual defensive towers). Once summoned, you cannot control your minions any more, they follow a strict AI-plan: Go towards the enemy tower, and once reached, attack it. And on the way there, attack any enemies that come in range. The AI does not seem ""clever"", but that's intenional and you enemies' minions follow the exact same rules as yours. With this, the aspect of luck is almost entirely eradicated (apart from a small amount of cards which have some randomness in their effect). This game is 99% skill and 1% luck (okay, apart from getting a good/bad team partner :D). Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses, the game follows a strict rock/paper/scissors-scheme.
You select 10 cards from a pool of ~150 cards (which you have to unlock/buy/craft, but more on that later) to use in a match. Each cards has a certain mana-cost, normally more mana means ""better"", but you have to balance the mana-cost of your deck, otherwise you just sit there waiting to get more mana while the enemy runs you over with cheaper cards.

The concept is pretty simple, but, as it should be, hard to master.

The game offers different ""masters"" to pick from - your master sits on your tower as the last line of defense if enemies make it through. Each master also has a different attack pattern and some unique skills which you can/should take into account when building your deck of 10 cards.

The game is free-to-play, and has an absolut fair price model - in general the game's pretty generous in rewarding you with all kinds of stuff. I spent some bucks in the beginning (best deal is to upgrade your account to ""premium"" and then get the battle-pass for the rubies you get when buying the account-upgrade), but that was in no way ""necessary"". I've been playing this game for ~2 weeks (omg...101.4 hours in the last two weeks accordings to Steam...) and got about 3/4 of the available cards. But even without spending money you still get enough cards to play many differents decks.

The best part of the game for me is the possibility to play with a friend in Co-Op agains other teams. It's beyond me that so few ""card"" games pick up this idea, it's just so much fun.
The games last just 2-6 minutes on average, which gets you in that horribly addictive ""ah, just one more game...""-spiral ;)

There are a ton of game-modes (including Draft), and the devs seems to have a steady look at the game balance. I hope this game will get the attention it deserves.






"
14609,This is a fun game. My son and I enjoy playing it.
14610,very good game
14611,This game has become who can play the most op cards sad shell of it's former self. The lack of skill now a days is incredible everyone plays (right now) the over powered monkey and mm would be happy to sell you a copy.  Trash....wish someone would do this game some justice and remake it they've already gone to far in the wrong direction don't think it can be fixed because the current players base only exists to exploit over powered cards so it essence killing off any remaining player base that doesn't wish to use the op shit stain cards.
14612,i rate 4/20 would hit agen

14623,What a terrible game. All you ever do is have fun. -10/10
14624,"the coolest game everr !!!

14625,"Great fun for a free game! Can lvl up and get ingame currency fairly easy, a little slow but only if you want the skins or op cards. Good game length, 5 mins, good match ups. Great 2 v 2s with friends. Fun minions and classes."
14626,"realy fun game i like the game so far 
a bit glitchy but fun thx for the good game"
14627,"it's alright, until you hit a certain rank and suddenly every match becomes a tilt. All set

Game is fine, just not my style, at all."
14628,good game

Has P2W, but not a huge issue as they seem to be in their own league at least at this time of the game for me."
14633,I like the artwork of the game. I also like the team battle feature
14634,"Great so far, no complaints yet!"
14635,"Put about 9 hours into this game f2p over a couple of weeks to get a good feel for how deep this game runs, making it to gold. While the gameplay is fun, there is not enough progress/ways to collect to cards without spending money. I think this game could be good with some minor fixes, but rn I don't think that its worth the time investment.

Pros:
-Fun and simple gameplay.
-Deckbuilding and many counterplay options
-Draft mode that lets you play around with cards you don't own

Cons:
-As f2p, there is no real way to quickly improve your collection. You will basically spend most of your time playing with your beginning cards. There are tokens that you can buy with currency, but overall progress is very slow. I'd say time needed to build a collection is similar to hearthstone, and is much more geared to paying players than f2p/grinders.
-Once you get past the lower ranks, you end up finding that there are certain cards/combos that are just way stronger than everything else, and that everyone that just runs those cards just wins. This something that will likely be fixed with time/future expansions, but for now it takes the fun out of the game.

Overall: I think this is a fun and fairly addictive game, but the more you play it, the less fun it becomes. Early game play is fun because nobody has particularly good cards, but once you delve deeper, you'll find that you will need a deeper collection with specific cards that will require and deep time/wallet commitment to complete. I think the game has a lot of potential and could get better with time, but currently I don't think that it's currently worth committing to. A fun base game with unfun out of game issues.

Score: 6.5/10"

though at first I did have some connection issue, but its all solved now"
14649,Like Heartstone but more enganging.
14650,"So far so good, seems like a game that's free to play, pay to win. Just my guess based on the structure of cards and leveling them, so it'll be fun until my win rate is lower than 50% or so. Then, I'll probably hang it up."
14651,"Great fun, easy to get into and starting out feels like you are not hampered by not paying."

14670,Turned out to be more fun than I expected.
14671,One of the best games i played since long time!!!!!!!!
14672,Very easy to understand and fun for me. I like the colors and GFX this has. nice eye candy. Haven't dealt with anything that feels broken so that's nice. Let's hope it doesn't become p2w lol
14673,i just ... like it :)))
14674,very fun
14675,This game is very simple to learn but a lot of fun
14676,Fun
14677,Absolute dope game im too addicted for my own good.
14678,good
14679,very good game. Recommend this.
14680,good as f2p
14681,Nice
14682,"From the start really nice game, but need so much balance. Many people saying its not pay to win, its not on lower ranks, on higher u always facing guy with 4+ legendary cards with custom skin on master and arena so it is pay to win. Most funny thing is u invested so much money to your cards and then comes new Master Milloween with 1-3 mana cards (max is 10 mana for card) and easily kill u cause of broken abillities. 

The game is very addictive at start, I played it a lot in just one week, but as I already said at some point u will face same combos with bronken legendary cards, and u will be stucked at one rank forever no matter how good u are...

I'm not gonna give this game thumbs down cause it's really nice game u should try it but for higher ranks u need to invest some real cash to beat your opponents."
14683,"I think this is a little bit early to give a review, i just reached stone league. But this game offers a great expirience of arena fights (and you just asked for a review)

So what are you doing when you are first time in ""Minion Masters""? 
At first, you will encounter the tutorial, that is an easy way to get your first cards and a good guide for beginning. After that you have access to other heroes and the multiplayer matches - including leagues. As in ""Forced Showdown"", you get cards and play them every round. After every round you get a reward - shards, new cards, spells, and currency for stones, which offer special rewards. You can switch your cards between every round, so you can play new cards of specialize your deck. And you will get rewards for EVERYTHING. 

So, this game is for everyone who love TCG (and collecting them), Arena fights, and sometimes you will defeated - that's normal.

14684,Fun easy and amazing!
14685,is good
14686,Great game!
14687,"It's like Dota Auto Chess, but an actual video game."
14688,I like it
14689,good
14690,"Fun game so far, cool customization features and cards."
14691,The gameplay is very new and unique for me. Had a great time so far.
14692,Love the strategy in this game. It's an interesting concept and it really makes brings out the anxiety! Haven't felt that kind of adrenaline in awhile. Only going to go up hill from here!
14693,THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE YOU
14694,"Great Game so far, Remind me a magic card game but with action ! 
A lot of strategy, Good potentiel game !"
14695,"Still an early opinion, but I'm enjoying it so far. The mechanics are simple and will probably show its depth the more I play."
14696,AMZIGN@!
14697,Fun to play with friends
14698,"This is just the kind of game I was looking for. Awhile back I played a game called BattleForge which had a similar concept, but you had to capture multiple towers to win. This is filling that void I've felt since the game closed down. Wonderful card-based strategy with a cartoonish, happy tone over the flow of gameplay."
14699,pretty casual but i'm sure can be much more intense at higher levels. I'd like to see this game get as big as clash royale just because its more relaxing to play on my PC than my phone
14700,awesome!!!
14701,Super fun!
14702,"Nice simple, fun game. Quick matches, and love the animations."
14703,"Game is fun, casual and fast paced for the most part and can be a nice way to just mess about with out loads of stress.. 
"
14704,"
then game is good，But there are still some shortcomings.First of all, the president and some members of the guild have been away for a month. They have seriously hampered the task of our guild's struggle. We hope that the production team can transfer the long-absent president of the guild to the person who contributes the most, so as to effectively prevent the long-absent president from influencing the guild.Secondly, some cards are too strong to affect the balance of the game. Yes, it is the storm. It is not good to target it effectively after doubling the blood volume. So doubling the blood volume is a bad mechanism. I hope the production team can balance the game in time.Finally, I hope the game can be better."
14705,Love the play style.
14706,"Spielt sich wie Royal Clash fürs Smartphone, mit ein ""paar"" content updates könnte es sogar ziemlich erfolgreich werden :) Ansonsten nettes spiel für den Zeitvertreib ala Hearthstone"
14707,"its a nice game to play while listening to podcasts =)

14715,Breezy and fun so far.
14716,Found this easy to play and fun.
14717,PRetty fun so far!
14718,It's a good game with good graphics it has enough content so you don't get bored.
14719,very good and nice game so fun
14720,Great game love it lots to consider to when in match
14721,Very cool
14722,good game +1
14723,"Minion Masters
Really fun and addictive gameplay.  The commentary is funny and clever.  Great sense of humor all around.  Its a game that you want to keep playing.  You want to learn all the cards and see what cards do.  Its a game that will keep you up at night in a sense were you want to learn what cards are best for your deck.  Also ranking up is very fun and makes for a great competitive game experience.  I can also relax and eat food and play this game at the same time do to the fact that you can play with just your mouse.  There are micro transactions of course but the game is set up in a way were you can earn the cards you want by simply playing more.  The only things that are actual money are cosmetics and new masters.  Very very fun game nonetheless."
14724,epic
14725,fun haha
14726,Simple fun game to just chill and play
14727,Well Worth My Time. i have followed this type of game since sega. The evolution of the game type cant evolve much more then what this game has to offer now other than upgrading eye candy as tech advances. 2 Thumbs Guys!
14728,More fun Clash Royale
14729,nice
14730,"Buggy, very buggy and frequently in ways that lose matches. Cards not doing what they say, crashes... I like the concept, but to work it has to be more stable. Monetization is confusing at first, too many currencies and different screens for quests. Click your avatar on the home screen! Kind of obviously pay to win, as the heroes all cost different amounts. Not recommending at this time."
14731,Some of the most fun I have had with a game in a long time
14732,mix of clash royale and hearthstone and its fun
14733,Its really fun!
14734,Very addictive. Good with friends or solo.
14735,yeyeeye
14736,Great Game.
14737,Fun
14738,"Blowing stuff up, <arnold voice> leaving the enemy dead and hearing the lamentation of their women.... err .. the game is nice...

Seriously, it has depth, lots of choice  and isn't pay to win. 10 out of 10 for me."
14739,makes fun!
14740,"Servers in China, often broken chains"
14741,Decent game very addictive
14742,"It is fun and fast game for my kids.
No publicity or spam.
Love it."
14743,awesome
14744,I'll try to make this simple and short .. This game is really fun and addictive and deserves a much larger playerbase. The devs are constantly listening to player feedback and bringing out regular updates to address the concerns of players.
14745,Good game
14746,MOIST
14747,Good enough to waste time on 7/10
14748,"Pleasantly Surprised, was a bit worried that it was gonna be a bit of a cash grab. But it's well balanced and a good learning curve. Will be happy to spend money here as it's not constantly asking for it.

63 Hours later and I'm still playing, plus they give loads of stuff away for free whenever there is a new expansion."
14749,fun
14750,"Just started playing and like with all online CCG's its great, and I havent had nearly enough time to get mad at the fact that Im playing against the same meta deck over and over and over again. Maybe my opinion will change then"
14751,mana puff
14752,"Take a look at the negative reviews, which are the minority, and then take a look at the positive ones. Not coincidentally, almost all the negative reviews are from players with a lot of hours in the game whereas most of the positives are from people with very few hours in the game. And the game is designed for exactly that.

It's initially fun, easy, varied and balanced and it's easy to get addicted to the fast and fun games.

Then you hit upper Master or Grandmaster and all of that is gone. It becomes completely imbalanced and PAY TO WIN, repetitive and simply not fun. There are only a small handful of viable decks at the top and fast cycling is oppressively dominant to where slower or even more mid range oriented decks are outright non-viable. 

The large amount of positive reviews are deceptive- most of those players are not playing competitively or at the Master/Grandmaster level. The game is frustrating, imbalanced garbage when you get to that point.

I don't see this game sticking around for the long haul."
14753,Only played like 10 games but it's super fun. It might not be if you don't pick up on strategy semi-quickly :P
14754,Same as Clash Royal :-P
14755,very nice game i just started it i hope its not p2w
14756,"This is a solid 1v1 MOBA-Lite-ish with two lanes and Blizzard-esque styling. It runs well and is fairly polished for what it is. It's the best game of its kind I've played on Steam, and is memorable enough that I keep circling back to it. As Free-to-Play, you can't beat the price. Microtransactions are present but not constantly in your face. Rounds are conveniently short for those of us with busy lives. Don't expect a full RTS or deep strategy and you'll do fine."
14757,It's fun easy to get into but has a deep level of strategy to master the game and be at the very top
14758,Yeet
14759,great game and even more fun to play with friends!
14760,Enjoyable characters and fun progression thus far.
14761,Pretty fun game and simple and quick to learn. Just started but plan to continue playing!
14762,Its great.
14763,"Interesting game. Feels like a card game, except it's real time instead of turn based. So much better than the card-based games out there by a long shot."
14764,"insanely fun!! definitely better than any other game in its genre. The art style is what brought me to download it, i stayed for the battles :)"
14765,"hearthstone, but good"
14766,is alright
14767,"It good, me like. Think League and Hearthstone had a baby."
14768,Tutorial is informative on the basic mechanics of the game. Easy first few levels make it easy to continue playing. Matching against other people helps you see different strategies and how different abilities can work with what you have. Seems like a good game so far.
14769,it's chill
14770,Very entertaining
14771,Good so far
14772,"fun little game. its tower D kinda, but you can fight each other. its wave vs. wave style, and you can build a deck to customize your style of play. Its really cool."
14773,Awesome
14774,So far so good
14775,"This game lacks proper publicity, it's a good game for quick matches."
14776,ok
14777,"has been an awesome blast so far!
"
14778,great fun little card/arena game
14779,GOOD
14780,pretty damn addicting
14781,好玩的，但是玩两个小时以后会卡，非常卡，重启一下才行
14782,A very simple yet very fun game
14783,Nice polished game. Easy to play and very enjoyable.
14784,Noice
14785,"Great game, very addictive!"
14786,Because
14787,Its Fun.  They have built a fun game that actually has a good amount of strategy built into it
14788,Easy and simple to play...but wicked
14789,"Fun game, takes enough strategy to make you think, but not to much to where new players can have fun. Overall good game."
14790,"Well there was a game here same as this, but from other company, and it was in beta, and then they took all our achievements and people just left. This team took all the good stuff from that game and made it unique. 1v1 as the main thing (there was 3v3 only) and much more customization, there you just needed to wait for the Dragons then stack dragons and you win. Here i like the DECK concept that the cards are DRAWN, there you could play ANY card, so this  game is better. I don't even the remember the others games name, but we always called it minions, and the name is just right for this game. Its just the start but give this game a try, oh and ""pro tip-try to balance your deck like in other games"" since its all about making all around good minions, and having a counter for everything that the enemy drops, so, the edge goes to the player who can create more synergy in his troops, and ofc you need to have luck. :)"""
14791,Easy to learn hard to master. One of the best F2P games I have tried on steam in a while
14792,"Started in Wood,,, had a win streak of , 46 wins straight,, and only ranked up to silver 4 after all that winning i would expect i would be around top tier or something,,,

feels like i wasted my time, game is good,,, but honestly 46 wins in a row to get barely anywhere,,, no thanks,

other people have told me i am lying or it's a bug,,,, you get 200 plus points for win streaks while i only get 80 ,,,,,which has made me quit because it takes to long to rank up for  me,,,

and from the time i spent building and playing for serious has made me un interested"
14793,"It is a great game. But it seems there are bots in the game and it feels a bit dishonest that bots are used in this game without disclosure. So I have to say I am not into this game anymore.

Update: Ingame you still dont know if u fight in ranked a bot or human. But on their website they sad it is only a bot to master or so. I still dont understand a ranked system where you climb against bots..."
14794,Castle fight but better.
14795,fun at start then pay to win... not worth my time
14796,"This is a toss up.. 
My biggest complaint is when playing teams, if the other person does not agree with your deck, they just stop playing and give up instantly. Aside from the person intentionally losing which is frustrating as heck, when I report the person, I have no way to confirm if the developers actually ban them or not.   
So.. given the fact this situation is occurring more often lately, enough for me to update my review, leads me to the conclusion there is no disciplinary actions (Banning) for this behavior (intentionally losing).
This is a decent card game, but this crap where people just lose intentionally so often has led me to uninstall. (maybe if I was informed the jerk was banned from my reporting them, I would be confident this behavior is being addressed and stopped).
"
14797,"GREAT GAME VERY FUN. MUST GET 
"
14798,good
14799,I like the fast pace and strategic appeal! Keep it up BetaDwarfs!!
14800,"New take on clash royale style game, PC optimized"
14801,Friend bugged me about the game for a week or 2. I kept forgetting about downloading the game. I finally downloaded it and it's pretty good so far. Edit - Been playing for almost 30 hours now. Just hit Diamond 3 with a friend. Bought the Masters pack and the Premium Upgrade. Worth every penny. I hope this game gets huge! Only problem is people have spent a decent amount of money to get better minions.. So it gets kinda tough higher up in ranks. You can beat them with the right strategy but it is definitely tough!
14802,Very Free-To-Play friendly
14803,It is a lot of fun!
14804,"simple yet fun, games are short, 
graphics are excellent
i like the announcer's  voice"
14805,Great game and it is a lot of fun to play!
14806,no more fun
14807,"so cool
"
14808,I love these card games they are strategic yet action pact.
14809,Awesome
14810,fun
14811,"Very Fun, Easy to learn, hard to master!"
14812,"Great so far
"
14813,i'm lovin it!
14814,Love this reminds me of Legion TD
14815,"This game fails time and time again to adapt. The original cards are by far the most frequently played and used. They add new cards all the time, however the see no play what so ever. I can take a deck I've had since I began playing and easily dominate new, fun, or even interesting decks. The new characters they add see almost no play, because they are often too expensive or underpowered.

I play a lot of strategy games like this and without new cards coming in to shift your meta, players are going to get bored. The top ranked decks/cards almost never change."
14816,"Highly addictive and fun! If you enjoy deck building games with a bit of tower defense (or more like tower offense), give this a try!"
14817,it`s fun and let the player to be more creative i think yeah definitely who is more creative here he win's he i like game's like this.
14818,good
14819,"Actually very fun, I was keeping my distance at first because I didn't want to waste time on a f2p game that I will not like. But it actually is VERY FUN and I will put more time into this!"
14820,Simple fun and seems balanced so far. No spamming of buying stuff with real $$
14821,"Minion Masters feels like a well balanced non-P2W version of common mobile games. There is an incredible amount of depth in both the deck building and figuring out the win condition for you deck. Even in unfavorable matchups you can often come out ahead by timing your summons and spells so you'll trade more efficiently. If you are at all interested it's free to try!

Also I highly recommend checking out their blog. Some of the posts are so funny that they will make you want to support the developers!"
14822,Fun game
14823,headass not gonna lie
14824,"How about you fix your goddamn game. Decks gone missing at fist. when i played a match, we both lagged so much that the units doesnt spawn at all
"
14825,"gg once you settled on a fun deck and start whining, i mean winning.."
14826,basically this mobile game thingy on pc
14827,awsome
14828,Next level of Clash Royal
14829,I like card games but get bored of them quickly. But because there is another level of skill in placing cards correctly. Also google minion masters codes and there is so much free stuff out there to help you get into the game. The top players also use 90% of the cards I earned in my first 2 days of playing which is so cool.
14830,"Very interesting concept, first time playing it but I can see why people look it at like clash royale. Though, without paywalls and drip feeding content. It's gonna be one of those copy/paste meta situations if people aren't able to adopt their own play style. Which I enjoy watching people try new and interesting ways of winning rather than cookie cutting."
14831,cuz its good
14832,Solid so far balanced game with no pay to win aspects! rare to find in games these days
14833,easy to get hands on but hard to master. plenty of combinations
14834,A bit rough around the edges but loads of fun.  It's F2P right now so I recommend giving it a try.
14835,i like the game a lot. immediately addicting. could make it a little less cluttered/overwhelming though from a UI perspective. and also- understanding how the heroes are different more intuitively
14836,"Great game, good cross between card battler and defense strategy."
14837,fun and addictive. worth ten times the price tag
14838,"Great game! Easy to learn and play. I love the different cards you get and how engaging this game is, while yet remaining simple. 
"
14839,"Simple, addictive, fast-paced, suspenseful, customizable, great graphics."
14840,I am addicted. only been playing 30 minutes but this concept is awesome. I know how to building a deck thanks to yugioh but this game is amazing!
14841,cool game
14842,"Fast paced and fun.

Good progression and wicked graphics

Only level 10 so far, will write again a bit further on
"
14843,"This gem of a game is addicting, fun, and simple. It gets challenging in Grand Master rank, but that's what keeps me coming back. You can co-op with a friend for premade 2v2 rank climb or 2v2 randoms for random team climb. The 1v1 ladder climb is pretty fun. You will learn real quick. The starter deck the game gives you will get you up to Masters 1v1 if you learn and play with it enough.

The cash shop is unique in the way that it's not pay-to-win but rather it's pay-to-get and the shop cycles out deals every 24 hours. One card is the full card's strength. You can have up to two to three duplicates of any card in your deck at any time. You don't need to buy hundreds of the same card to make it stronger like mobile RTS games. Besides cards, there's purchasable emotes and Master skins. Some are very cool.

I recommend giving it up to 20 hours of play time to see if you really like to put in some money for card shop offers. The game is free and definitely worth a try.

STARTER TIPS:
Keep your deck's average mana to 3.3 to 4.3.
Use a Master that will work best for your deck.
Support ranged cards with a beefy tank.
Don't use a damaging spell on enemy cards that just aren't worth it.
Each ""bar"" of health is 100 HP on minions."
14844,Seems Fun.
14845,never thought id like this but its very addictive
14846,"very unique and creative game
"
14847,Very good i approve
14848,They're fixing balancing issues.
14849,I can summon rat
14850,"So far i love the game. Its practically clash royale but on my computer, Including the amazing graphics and tons of cards. Im hooked."
14851,1
14852,"Best game I’ve played in decades.

If you like Magic/Hearthstone and/or RTS mods like Castle Fight/Nexus Wars, you will LOVE Minion Masters.

Simple yet incredibly deep. Fast matches (if you only have a few minutes to play one round). Cool integration with Twitch (in game rewards for watching). Just plain satisfying.

My only real complaint is that It can take awhile to unlock all the cards if you go the 100% free to play route, so start doing your daily quests asap.

But other than that, fantastic game.

9.8/10

14853,FeelsOkayMan
14854,fun game
14855,"So far the game has been fun after just playing a few games. I dunno if my opponents aren't playing stuff as much because all my games have been a straight smash and all i do is play stuff.

I guess the game can get intense with minion placement and protection.

This game seems like a mix between tower defense and a card game that is more interactive than most games. It has a good pace and very short games with can be a plus for most people."
14856,pretty sweet game!
14857,Pretty funny game!
14858,LOve it!
14859,"Very little time put in thus far, but having a lot of fun. Kinda thought it seemed like a faceroll game my first round, then I realized how effective counters and strategy can be. Looking forward to getting into it more."
14860,"Very solid game, suprisingly fun and engaging, havent noticed any blatant balance issues so far either."
14861,very good game
14862,Great Fun game! :) love 2 vs 2

Edit: They fixed them."

14867,"Better than clash royale 

"
14868,cant even log in dont install this shit hate buggy games
14869,This game is surprisingly and refreshingly  addicting! I love it.... I absolutely love it.... Everything about it is great so far... Cant wait to truly dive in and update this review.. But so far its perfect.
14870,imagine DotA the card game
14871,So far so fun
14872,it's clash royal but more action....
14873,fun ;)
14874,Great graphics. Easy to learn and play.

14885,"Updated review:

It's clear the developers are on the road to monetizing everything and locking cards behind a paywall.  You either pay for the season pass or don't get the cards for the season.  You can't even craft them, which in the past, wasn't a problem.  The same old broken trash decks with the hot garbage wildcard system has brought me to the point that I'm out, forever.  The hell with this company and the ""GET OUT YER WALLETZ!"" mentality.  Joke's on you, i aint paying and won't ever pay.  I needed to free up some space on my M.2 anyways, this seemed like a good place to vaporize the bits back to zer0.



This used to be true at the first time of review:

The game has an easy entry skill level and progressively gets more challenging without being pay2win.  Overall, I've been having a good time.  While some of the concepts are still new or unknown to me, I can pick up on everything else with ease.  It doesn't throw 500 game mechanics at you at once and if you played TCG from Starcraft 2, this game will make you feel right at home.  I wish I had found this game a few years ago when it was new."
14886,I dont review shi% bit this game is fun a.f.
14887,"The game is like a card summoner and rts at the same time. Not just is it about mana saving and timing, but also where you place your summons. Fantastic quick paced game!"
14888," a mix of a Towerdefense and a Cardgame, sounds kinda boring at first. But the Design of the units is quite nice. The Diffrent Masters have thier own skills witch lvl up during a game.to get all the Masters you have to grind quite a bit or you can flat out buy them for 20 bugs."
14889,Its fast and funny !
14890,"pretty good ,crowd control is slightly to strong but pretty fun game"
14891,"Fun seems well balanced on release and diverse characters and grindy and that was a lot of ands
"
14892,great game enjoying it a lot
14893,Fun so far still have to get into the the meat of it.
14894,"2/10
- EXTREMELY addictive game
- unbalanced beyond wild imagination ( RIOT - Leauge of Legends is a joke compared to this)
- no p2w = no cards (20-30 coins per win, 1000 coins per token, token = 1 random card) , quick example on my 44th token got my 1st legendary that's not even that strong, one of the weaker ones , yay...
- opening token constant duplicates and blue and green trash cards
- horrible rewards and game-play
- constantly versing people will legendary filled card decks = instant losses
 
If you haven't played this yet don't start it will be waste of time, if you're already playing... ""Welcome to hell""."
14895,"Now, I have a super computer and amazing internet... The game is ok for about 3 days. It is buggy as hell, most of the links don't work properly, you get booted out of games easily and end up losing because of it. If you play duo and your team mate gets dc'ed, you lose even if you are winning by a ton. It's super easy to get diamond or above in solo and duo, not really an exciting moment in the entire game. They say its a strategy game and it is sort of, but if you have any kind of IQ, then you outclass 90% of the people in the game. I played over 30 hours and blew past most of the content. If you get decent cards, you can arrange them to where you almost always win. Noob bots all the way through the  game make winning easy. Not recommended for anyone that is truly looking for a strategy game."
14896,"The game used to crash every ten minutes or so, in dozens of different ways.  They asked for the crash logs.  It hasn't crashed in months now.  Good fun casual game.  It is extreme pay to win and never sure if I'm fighting a player or a bot.  But that doesn't take away from the fun."
14897,It's fun
14898,"great variety, non pay to win, decent timekiller, especially for casual gamers, or for queue  times in other games. can be played for 5 minutes, or 5 hours in a row. This is an overall good game."
14899,Fun little card game.  I like the real-time nature of playing cards off of a regenerating mana system.  Feels more fast-paced than turn-based card games.
14900,"Very entertaining to watch, nice tutorial. One of the better ""Easy to learn hard to master"" available."
14901,good game :D
14902,"fun, fast, casual but tactical. Loving it so far."
14903,"More generous Clash Royale, except you choose a ""master"" for each deck which gives passive abilities as you gain exp from taking territory. Otherwise seems like nothing special."
14904,"Absolutely Fantastic, addictive, fun, fast, casual but tactical. Loving it."
14905,nice to play from time to time
14906,Gameplay is good and fun! The Graphic is great! Good job
14907,"Finally, a game that doesn't need a high end computer just to operate correctly. appealing to the eyes and a great game overall 99/10"
14908,nice game
14909,yews
14910,Fun to play and great graphics.
14911,Interesting Game
14912,I wanted to hate it. But instead I got a magical port-a-potty building that spawns infinite crossbowmen.
14913,good
14914,"this is a fun game, but i think you should try to fix all the bugs and make compatibility smoother"
14915,Fun strategy game with unique cards and game play.
14916,So far it's very intuitive and fun.
14917,THIS GAME IS NICEEEE
14918,Fast paced and equal so far. Seems balanced. Not to long of a wait for games to start. Costumization is a +
14919,GOOD
14920,Cool game I enjoy it so far !
14921,noice
14922,fun.
14923,pretty good. got platinum rank within 10 hours with my friend.
14924,"kewl game dawg
"
14925,"Crazy fun free to play game, well worth the download!"
14926,"1-60 error, can not create lobby, no fix. Unplayable, for me at least, good luck."
14927,"The game is fun and doesn't feel like an ass mobile game. The developers actually cared about gameplay and how people play, they try to make the game enjoyable as best they could.
The game is enjoyable, and pretty easy for starters. 
7.5 Jeffs / 10"
14928,"Very easy and immersive, fun UI, and enough momentum that microtransactions aren't a necessity. So far so good!"
14929,fast fun fun fun
14930,"Game is pretty run but two things I don't really like: (1) there are only 163 cards and there just aren't enough cards to spend any time deck building. I have a deck it almost never loses, it's boring playing the same deck all the time. (2) they reset your rank every month. Earned Platinum, nope at start of the month you are now Silver 2 or whatever.... and.... you have to grind it all over again with the same deck as before. I'm thumbs down on this one."
14931,"Fun, easy to learn, hard to master and enjoyable game to just kick back and watch the carnage"
14932,Its worth your time to try it out. Solid free game.
14933,Addicting and super fun ^_^
14934,"Interesting game, reminds me of a really old magic the gathering game i used to play with my cousin"
14935,this game is horrible lmfao
14936,Great game!
14937,"the game is simple and fun need an easyer way to get cards tho '
"
14938,"great job lots of fun try it
"
14939,Nice!
14940,very fun game. might be my new addiction tbh
14941,Neat game especially for a free game. i recommend to look into it and judge for yourself. gl & hf
14942,"Depending on your gaming style, this is either an ideal ""relaxing while watching Netflix on your other monitor"" or ""Sweaty competitive make-a-mistake-and-you-die"" kind. It's a well-executed cross between a playing card game and an RTS, minus the macro aspects. Unit placement, timing, countering, and deck building skills all come into play here. It's definitely worth a shot!"
14943,Quick games that are still fun and unique each time.
14944,"new update sucks, now everyone is using invisible troops and it ruin the fun."
14945,best game
14946,"So far the game has been entertaining, will update my review again, not enough time played to critically examine it"
14947,"it's like hearthstone with micro management <3

love the cartoon style.

"
14948,"blah, cool game run prooly.... The PC UI is worst I ever seen for a game thats been around for a long time, for example it tells you to press alt in a tip loading screen to ping your teammate.. it dont use alt key and no keybinds.... color design is bland, so the cards you play look like others and you play the wrong one... buttons are in same place so you click and exit game when you meant to look at teammate deck... community is raging hard that the devs always make something overpowered on patch day, and milk it financially, which kills the player base.. they are revolting hard... not sure there is a playerbase, as always playing bots..

cool game, but not going anywhere, doubt it will be around in 3 months."
14949,When Clash Royale just wasn't enough...
14950,good game
14951,"I initially wrote this off as some more f2p mobile-esque garbage, but decided to give it a chance. I am very glad I did, this is one of the most addicting and fun competitive games out there today. I haven't enjoyed a game like this in a very long time.

It is a simple concept, you have a ""deck"" of 10 cards, which can be minions, spells, buildings, etc You and your opponent frantically place your minions and try to kill each other. Therein lies the fun and the depth to this game. There are many deck building possibilities, there is timing, placement, mind-games, counters, etc. There is a surprising amount of strategy and skill to this game. And best of all? It's completely free and there is no pay to win garbage.

The main mode is a straight 1v1 so there is no bad teammate shenanigans or bs, just a straight battle of skill. But there are 2v2s, challenges, drafts, etc if you want to change it up. Games last anywhere from 1-10 minutes. Healthy, friendly, and active playerbase with guilds if you want. All the way up the ladder to master queue has been 15 seconds or less.

I highly recommend giving the game a chance, you have nothing to lose but the time you will inevitable sink into it."
14952,Fun tower defense/card strategy game.
14953,best game of this type that i have found. i like how you cant level cards and can only have a couple of the same card. makes it more of a challenge :)
14954,"one of those easy to pick up but hard to master types. The game format has been done before, but I like how they put a spin on their version. Its free to play so why not give it a try."
14955,"Very fun, very simple, short matches, good F2P Model"
14956,fun game!
14957,"easy and fast
"
14958,"Fun so far, I'd say check it out."
14959,Love it
14960,Simple Fun.
14961,"The bad

-Some card and hero balance is questionable 

-There should not be a differing rule set from the minion masters pro scene 
Meaning that if some cards are banned there they should be banned in mm and also, we shouldnt be able to overload our decks with 3 copies of one card to reduce any type of rng 

-Having multiple copies of a card in hand creates some glaring issues with card balance. Why would you ever use this card when you can just have another copy of this card instead and in a game of pure value, its not healthy.


The good 

You can see the large amount of opportunity with deck creation until you realize the 3 of the same card in one deck idea

Heroes are a unique aspect and create new deck types usually for the better


Overall its a fun game for sure but irritating at higher levels of play due to the divergence between mm and pro scene. Devs just gotta figure out that making ranked different from pro scene is not a good decision.

EDIT: The balance gets more questionable as time goes on. same cards over and over again :D"
14962,awesome game play...awesome graphics ...super fun and easy to learn but hard to master !
14963,Excelente Game
14964,"Easy to play. Fun fun fun.
Rolls out learning curve over the first 10 levels.
Nicely done"
14965,tedious long term
14966,fun
14967,fun.simple.and fast paced
14968,For a free game it gives enough playability to be fun for awhile. Will write a review after i've sunk a few more hours into the game.
14969,"Great fun ,nice hybrid bitween dota and tcg i like it"
14970,"About an hour in , feels really good. This might turn into somthing!"
14971,good
14972,c:
14973,Fun tutorial
14974,Very fun casual game. Great relaxing fun. UI is easy to use.
14975,"Like some modern casinos, they use tricks to hook you. The matchmaking isn't based on ladder rank. They control how often you win/lose by matching you against decks that either can or can't counter your deck. For this reason most players stick to 2v2s, so that the matchmaker can't as easily control the win rate.

I sank about 500 hours on this only to be betrayed and disgusted. They have three types of in-game currency and try to say the game isn't pay-to-win because you can grind to get the ""real world money"" in-game currency. Unfortunately, because of a bug in the game, I lost roughly 100 hours worth of the real world currency. Nothing under my control, I just exited a match and was collecting my winnings when the game subtracted about 15 000 ""Rubies"" instead of awarding something I'd won. I've seen bugs intermittently in the game before but the developers have been totally unhelpful in restoring the Rubies this bug took. Customer service never even e-mailed me back. If they want to erase 100 hours of work because of their incompetence I'm not playing this mess and I'm going to warn others to stay away. STAY AWAY!"
14976,Enjoying it so far. Reminds me of the clash royal which i enjoyed as well.
14977,"Seems really good so far, quite in depth, not sure how pay to win it is yet, (or if it is pay to win at all).

Must say, never heard of it but thanks to Day9 I found a little gem!"
14978,FUN
14979,Holy MOly Guac! Definitely recommend this for the summer!
14980,"Nice game, props to the devs but server crash and relog are a bit often, I hope they can fix this issue soon."
14981,"this is a amazing game havent played enough to know if it is pay to win but great great quality of a game mechanics and love the season aspect of it as well 
"
14982,"its okay so far
"
14983,bretty good
14984,Great Game!
14985,Bettter then LoL and Dota2
14986,"NICE GAME !! 
Worth to play"
14987,"this game is not P2w. Very Fun. need some good graphic Maybe


***please upgrade/change the visual graphics or engine, this game has so much potential to grow but the graphics is not attractive enough to pull a players to try this game out."
14988,"Easy to play, so far seems fun. May need more quests and cards. Also not pay to win please. New play style or special events will be nice."
14989,"no problem steam, i will write that entire review again, thanks for deleting my entire text just because i switched my review from thumbs up to thumbs down.
just a few days after i switched my review from negative to positive, early access dwarf ruins the game yet again. 2 patches ago they introduced a """"""""feature"""""""" which allows for some players to load into the game faster than other players, and the game already starts even though some players are not connected yet (great work again early access dwarf), the next - most recent - patch, they of course didnt fix that bug but instead introduced heavy fps lags which render the game basically unplayable or at least not enjoyable to play, they actually managed to max out on the memory leak they had in their game half a year ago - which they actually fixed. now we get the fps lags not after 15 games in a session but starting from the first game. you got your deserved thumbs down back again - you earned it."
14990,"The core game is insanely fun. Me and my partner got to [strike]gold[/strike] platinum league just fine. But then the pay 2 win hits and it hits hard. There's no two ways about this. Nothing is more frustrating than getting absolutely ruined by someone who clearly just swiped their credit card to win.

A very fun core game ruined by a greedy monetization scheme. Have fun with your whale poaching BetaDwarf. I'd love to play more of this game and I'd love to pay for the game, for the skins, for whatever, but I don't support this pay2win nonsense. 

Also, all the rewards, gold drops, crystals and whatnot dry out at about level 20. At that point you get new cards (which are just flat out superior to normal ones) by paying real cash in their store. If you thought Magic the Gathering was a money sink, try being competitive here.


EDIT:
So as you can see by the hours I've spent on this game... it really does suck you in. And I have spent more money on this game than on any other I recall in recent past. And I play Total War games. The money sink is real. And they'll get you paying, even if you really didn't want to. And yes. You absolutely need to throw a lot of money at this to be competitive in top ranks of play. It's easy to not see it though. They're very clever with how they milk money out of you."
14991,nice
14992,just like it
14993,great game
14994,Awesome game
14995,Great game. Although I only have a short amount of time playing I am enjoying what I have experienced so far.
14996,Great fun little game
14997,Clash royale v2
14998,"good,it is a game"
14999,"starts quick, levels fast, people actually playing.. fun so far"
15000,"Pretty fun, easy to play"
15001,"After you get past bronze rank you start playing against the cheap pay to win cards that linger on the map and are invincible and one shot your minions (even my high mana cost legendaries) Oh and that minion had flying to. It was some white and golden metal winged angel guy with a sword. No Idea what card it was, almost made me uninstall the game. It needs to be nerfed asap. I might still uninstall the game over it. 

...Other than that yeah download it play it for 2 hours and have fun until you hit the pay to win wall like I did. 

Good graphics, cool concept, fun for a quick match every other day or so. Its good.

Please nerf your pay to win cards/10!"
15002,"take this like option not a choice. Everything is has pros and cons. Once you accept that, you will enjoy this game. Rush, take time, rush, rush (oh shit grass hopper lost its way) dies! learn to use mana and proper key cards that works for you. Do not hate me for the lack of hrs in game. Just believe in your gut move and you will win!"
15003,"fun and easy to understand while still giving harder strategies time to shine, the tide of battle is always changing and yet it always seems fair, good game"
15004,rthgwehhg they asked me to review
15005,gg
15006,This is a really good game and you should play it
15007,Super fun so far.  Everything is great.
15008,sgood
15009,"Easy and fun. 
Maybe good for kids too."
15010,good
15011,Fun as heck.
15012,"A surprisingly simple yet compelling game. Solid game play and charming art style with its gameshow gimmick. And for the price of free, very enjoyable."
15013,"Pay to spin, spin to win. This game is aggressively monetized with loot boxes. You can't buy virtually any of the cards directly. Instead, you can buy rubies that you spend on packs that give you more loot boxes. You earn tokens which can pretty much only be spent on lootboxes. You also earn shards that you can use to buy cards, but because the rarer cards are so ludicrously expensive, it'll take you months to actually unlock all of the cards this way. The in game account boost is worthless. It helps you level faster, but all you get are a negligible amounts of coins and shards per level. The battle pass is worthless, because you progress extremely slow and earn nothing but a few shards, coins, rubies and loot boxes.

In a game like this, balance can never be perfected. There will always be cards that are too strong during any given patch. When you can't access these cards, the game becomes pay to spin, spin to win. The more loot boxes you buy, the better your odds of getting the OP cards. But you'll have to buy a sh1t ton of loot boxes, because the drop rates are abysmal. You'll need well over 2000 loot boxes to unlock all of the cards. 

The actual game is really fun and overall well done. But this monetization strategy, especially being targeted at kids, is a straight up gambling trap. They want people to get invested in the game so that when they need those better cards they feel compelled to spend money. They give you all these pretty colours, pleasant sounds, and cha-ching cha-ching currency after every match that only leads you to the flashy, addictive loot boxes. The fact that they're brazenly making compulsive gamblers out of children is sickening."
15014,A very fun  mix of Yu-Gi-Oh and Clash Royale.. Lots to grind towards and always love a game with a ranking system.
15015,nice game :))))))) keep going with the update. nice nice
15016,Definitly better than Clash Royal haha :`D
15017,Surprisingly fun and addicting! You don't have to spend money to win matches. Made me stop playing hearthstone even though I don't want to!
15018,"its such an amazing game and well thought out, i enjoy it alot and will start to stream it! twitch.tv/hegrelapsed"
15019,Fun and kinda like Clash Royale game.
15020,Quick and easy to get in to. Colorful and fun. Exciting and fast paced.
15021,good game free to play
15022,Seems like a clash royale ripoff at first. But its actually really fun and there is no ptw mechanics. The devs give out free dlc pretty often so you dont have to worry about falling behind. Its fun and you should at least try it.
15023,haha nice
15024,entertaining game
15025,i r8 8/8
15026,"Extremely fun game and its not like other card games ( Clash Royale , Hearthstone) I truely hope this becomes mobile soon.  I cant wait to stream this and see what others think about the game"
15027,The game is AWESOME !!!!!
15028,fun af and simple
15029,"Prety interesting
"
15030,Its fun and free.
15031,"Lovin It,, mMmmmmBabbbbby"
15032,Very surprised with Minion Masters! very simple and entertaining. Feels very rewarding with out buying anything. would 100% recommend to anyone.
15033,"its just simply awesome
"
15034,so cool
15035,"Was hoping it was more skill based than luck or investment based, but it wasn't."
15036,Game is good to pass the time
15037,awesome table top strategy and free to play.
15038,Just. One. More. Game.
15039,pretty good game fun easy and straight forward
15040,"Easy to learn , interesting cards, and quite a bit of depth. ~ 5m per round. doesnt even look like p2w
"
15041,easy and strait forward gameplay :) and i like the cartoonsish look
15042,"This game is pretty awesome its easy to pick up and fun to play with friends and or randoms
"
15043,"Fun, Quick and easy to learn.  Also it's F2P.  Why not give it a try."
15044,хорошаяигра:)качайте
15045,"The game follows the same recipe as most free mobile style games. It front loads the progression experience heavily, and gives you just enough to get hooked. After that, you better have a gold credit card, or a good amount of patience.

The game is enjoyable enough. There are some issues with server response. The added modes are fairly uninteresting and hollow. The thing is chock full of what I call ""egg timer mechanics"" That is to say, it counts down on a myriad of offers and cycles in order to make you keep checking in and keep coming back, even though essentially, there is little to do other than keep playing the modes you like.

At it's core, it is a Clash Royale game with more space and less pace. It's nothing to write home about, but it's not bad either. It's not really Pay to Win, at least not blatantly. Arguably, you could say that progression = win to some extent. Either way, I think you're going to find that if you don't want to use that credit card, you'll get bored with it fairly quickly.

I'm thumbing it down, but not uninstalling it. Take away from that what you will.

EDIT: I was unfairly pre-judgemental with regards to your ability to progress. It's not as bad as most mobile games. Also seeing as I'm still playing, I'm changing to thumbs up. Everything else that I wrote in the review is pretty much accurate though."
15046,Great gem
15047,"The gameplay in this game is very fun and the individual games are very short and fast paced (usually a few minutes of action). I criticize nothing about the gameplay, it's really great.

I'm not recommending it for one reason; Deck Building disappears after the initial burst of achievements.

Once the achievements start to dry up you're stuck playing with whatever cards you managed to draw. Even if you buy the 50% permanent upgrade for 20$, 50% of nothing is still nothing. You should get more gold period. Especially for winning. It sucks being stuck with the same deck. Once you take the deck building out of the game it gets stale really fast (for me personally at least). You essentially just get your daily quest and that's usually good for a power token, close to two frequently...but then I only want to play for the 20-30 minutes it takes to knock that out. See if I got anything fun looking (spoiler: there's rarely anything fun looking) and then log off. Then it's in that 'why is this video game a job' category for me and I stop playing it and write a bad review.

Plus, it really does seem like you're playing bots until you're ranked around platinum. That's a bit shady. You should tell people if they're playing bots.

TL;DR If they just gave gold for playing/winning matches the game would be awesome. Progression is too slow and you're stuck with the same deck for long periods. It takes the deck building out of a deck building rts."
15048,Is veri good.
15049,Surprisingly fun!
15050,"cool game
"
15051,"Lazy A$$ Developer, You cant Replace Clash Royale"
15052,Fun game
15053,Is veri good
15054,"absolutely fantastic game, not pay to win but I will happily buy a pack to show my support.

From what I've played it seems very balanced, cards are unique and it appears to suit many play styles."
15055,its interesting reminded me of clash royal on the android but better
15056,"it is very casual and fun,looks amazing"
15057,"lets forget about the balancing, because the devs sure have. lets move onto what the devs currently are focused on.
ruining your wallet.
in their first post about the ""economy rebalance"" they said they wanted to make getting rubies harder.
first off, after the rightly earned backlash, the decided to respend! good.
on their forums, on a post you cant respond to..
cowards.

with that out of the way, let me say this:
they claim that ""50%"" of their rubies are ""grinded out and thats an issue for premium currency.""
come now, thats just sad. the vast, vast majority of Warframe players dont drop cash on Platinum and grind it out. prob around 80% of the plat is grinded out.
oh, im sorry. i shouldnt compare those two games. Warframe is an indie game that grew from nothing into a cult classic. and this is...an indie game that, at this rate, going to die miserably.
let me make something clear devs, design the game FIRST, THEN monetize it!

you know what sickens me the most though?
the game is a triple layered cash grab.
premium currency.
season passes.
loot boxes.

you buy rubies to buy the season pass, so that you can earn tokens for a spin at the loot box machine.
disgusting. somehow EA has been out done. bravo devs. bravo"
15058,Great game so far!
15059,Because this game is an arena game style while also having Strategy with your cards as well.... while still using placement and timing.  Well Done
15060,I like this game
15061,Really fun and enjoyable!
15062,Thoroughly enjoyable...and not pay to win!
15063,having fun so far!
15064,"Super simple to understand, with a high skill ceiling. A mobile version and tournament support would carry this game a great distance. I hope to see more from this franchise!"
15065,very competitive. tons of fun
15066,"veteran to Hearthstone/Clash Royale, and I believe this game is worth the time. 8/10"
15067,"This game is super fun and awesome, but.....One card at a time bullshit, instead of card packs, we get this roulette wheel that is made solely for showing players that they are visibly being fucked when they want to acquire new cards.

I literally had a match where the game claimed, Opponent lost trying to use a card that they do not own????? Then how the fuck were they able to get into the queue in the first place??? 

I made a match with a friend, challenged him, and l lost due to supposedly not owning the cards that I was using. Then I remade the lobby, and used the exact same fucking deck, and behold, the game works.

Besides this, they have fixed the awful connection issues that used to dominate the game, and now it is pretty fun to play.

Now players can cheat by turning game changing cards invisible.

This game with the new Best Plan No Plan makes the game super oppressive and very unenjoyable sometimes because there is no unranked mode to play fun decks in. Either the match will be against super meta frustration deck, or it'll be against easiest bots ever seen in a game. The new cards, which can make or break a meta, can only be used if a player pays for them in the new battle pass, so if they turn out to be game breaking, only the players that pay to win are able to with the new cards."
15068,The 2v2 mode is great and seems better balanced than other games on the matchmaking side. Definitely recommend.
15069,The game is such a fun card game with the fact you can also do 2v2 which makes the game better if you don't want to do just 1v1!
15070,good game
15071,Awesome tower defense game with a twist in the card game genre.
15072,"This game is not P2W for cards, people who say that have no clue what P2W really is.
Game Gems can be gathered over time by doing your daily's lvling up and more iv payed nothing for 2x battle passes just by earning the gems as i play.
All cards and in-games items no matter what item or card is obtainable over time. <- this is not p2w at all.
No one card is a all mighty and will Be OP AF  games will done.
"
15073,fast paced action .. I like it
15074,"Team battle mode is great fun, matches are not to long. Have not seen any glaring balance issues as of this review"
15075,"lots of fun, easy to pick up and play, and the commentator is funny"
15076,Super entretenido!
15077,i play clash royal and this is better than it u feel me
15078,I enjoy this game
15079,fun game love the idea
15080,"Super fun and casual! Use your wits and fast decision making to outcome your opponents! to see some live gameplays,fllow Bigfudge43 on twitch!"
15081,its good.. feel like need more cards.
15082,"They released the champion Moreilla in a pretty broken state and even pre-Moreilla, there were some consistent issues where a certain card combination that was clearly broken was being pushed out of the store, being that this combo was achievable for most once they had the legendary card... So, rather than attempting to fix the Legendary card or how it interacted with these cards, devs decide to put this legendary card on SALE.... Are you kidding me? Yes, they did end up balancing the card combo several weeks later, but not before getting as many sales on it as they could... This practice just feels really scummy and to see them continue this trend with Moreilla is telling.

It is clear that Minion Masters will continue to try to cheese you out of your money, rather than earning it with balanced game play and reasonable transactions and that is just a shame, this game had a lot of potential before the mass exodus of the community after Moreilla was released... And let me be clear, Moreilla, even though broken, was not the primary cause of the mass exodus from this game, but rather, it was the continued hard pay walls implemented through having clearly overpowered card combinations and the fact that they continue to push these combinations out of the store instead of fixing them.

I may come back once these devs get it together and stop trying to cheese everyone out of their money, but currently, there is no end in sight for the constant cheese and I imagine the future updates are going to be even worse, as sales decline more and more."
15083,I wish lanes were a little longer and complex to add some jungle action BUT it is still a fun little game overall. I am not one for card games either nor will I play this daily.
15084,actually super fun and the leveling up system never makes you feel like this is pay to win
15085,Great
15086,"After reaching Grandmaster there isn't really much for you to do in this game , it is really good and enjoyable for a free 2 play semi strategy card game.
More than often you will find that some cards are relatively hard to obtain , that there is a very slim amount of powercreeped new expensive cards that have interesting combo possibilitys.
1v1 is not as much strategy as you can simply sit back and counter everything your opponent throws at you.
2v2 on the other you'll more than likely have to carry your teammate and occasionally end up playing 1v2 as the vast majority of the people have such absolutely horrible decks , bad decisionmaking and atrocious coordination.

It is f2p , it's fun but i don't really see me spending alot of time in this title after seeing just how underwhelmingly mediocre the highest level of play in this game is. 

Try it for yourself and see , it's not a bad game by any means. It just has issues like any other title does. At the time of this review the servers seemed overwhelmed too as the usual responsetime was within 8seconds with 4000 people playing when pinging the server for loot access."
15087,"Awesome game. Has a quick play and quick reward feel to it. It SEEMS the micro transactions can all be gained through just playing the game, as well, so I find that to be fair. 8.5/10!"
15088,"Not much to say, other than I like it."
15089,"Very fun and entertaining. Doesn't take much time and is very enjoyable.
"
15090,"So i've dumbed about 30H into this game in one week, got to Master in premade 2V2, bought both the premium as the all hero upgrade and received the accursed army as well as the voidborne onslaught dlc for free. Besides that leaving some streams open every time i play this game for the drop feature and some of the sponsered giveaways I got to the point where i unlocked half of the cards.

So, let's get started why i Recommend this game
It is basicly Clash royale for who played it, but with extra features and way less pay to win if it even is p2w.
Every hero has a unique basic attack as well as 3 unique abilities. Every card is balanced in it's own way and has counters to it AND DUPLICATE CARDS/UPGRADES DON'T MAKE THE CARD STRONGER, they just allow you to add additional copies of a card into your deck using a wildcard system (which I heard they are planning to remake or remove) (the system allows you to add up to 2 additional copies of 1/2 cards into the deck if they got at least the bronze upgrade) but as far as i'm aware most decks actually suffer when using multiple copies of a card.

Besides that, the starter deck actually is able of making it to the highest rank, and the leaderboard is litteraly filled with the starter hero (there is one starter hero and a weekly rotation containing 2 heroes).

The queue times at this moment aren't verry long, up to 1 minute maximum.

It's simple, yet addictive, most games don't take verry long (about 10 minutes maximum but can be over in 1-3 minutes).

The twitch integrations are great and hilarious, some AAA companies can learn from this.

The game is rewarding but does get grindy if you'd like to have a certain card and just keep on getting unlucky on the rolls.

There are micro transactions both on the steam store as in game, So be aware of that, but as I stated above, the P2W aspect in the game isn't actually present if you know what you are doing with deckbuilding and playing the deck.

SO, my conclusion, I'm currious what direction the developers take with this game and how the playerbase will develope.
But so far, i Recommend this game 100%!"
15091,"Good, Fresh, Strategic, Digital, Cards. Fun and creative content. Good for players who know WTF they're doing. <3"
15092,Interesting concept for a card game. Haven't really seen anything else like it.
15093,Free to play and interesting!
15094,nice game ...
15095,"gran juego , y muy diverttido
"
15096,loving it.
15097,"Great game based on minions, it`s like Clash Royale but on PC."
15098,"good game, I like it so far!"
15099,Game is purely amazing and youre fighting nonstop doing duos is the best part of it cause you can both builda deck to compliment each other and choose a character that does the same as well
15100,Great Game
15101,"There was a design flaw where users were able to gain unlimited amounts of shards from twitch drops by watching multiple streams on Twitch. This has been fixed recently but the damage is done where a portion of the community was able to attain a vast amount of shards and build their perfect decks. This gave an unfair advantage to everyone else who has to grind extremely slowly to buy cards. Oh, and you get disconnected from matches all the time which counts as a loss due to poor servers. Avoid this game as the community will fall off by the time they fix their mess."
15102,dun fun
15103,Action in a card game. I've been wondering when I'd see something like this finally. It's definitely fun!
15104,"Fast, fun, game."
15105,yeh
15106,i like it (:
15107,"Its cool
"
15108,Erinnert ein wenig an Hearthstone?
15109,"Actually deceptively simple, strategically deep. Gameplay wise it's hands down the most polished of this genre I think. 
There's a lot of clutter beside the core game though, and there isnt actually a functional new player experience to guide you through stuff like glory/ battle pass/ guilds. Expeditions is lackluster at best, feels like it needs another overhaul. 
Good game, hope the devs keep developing it, quality of life improvements etc."
15110,For me its seems like the Clash Royale in mobile but a better one in PC version. I like it so far its very nice and have a duel and team battle which is different from just one on one.
15111,The game is surprisingly fun and addictive. The F2P model is fair and not grindy at all compare to other F2P games. Less randomness and 2v2 co-op make me want to play the game more and more.
15112,"good game 

i dont want to be rude but it feels like an better clash royal 
after a few hours u still cant have enough 

hope more people think about gettin it when u are still thinkin try it if u dont like it den deinstall it again i mean its free after all"
15113,Good game!
15114,clash of clans but with a more appealing aesthetic and a lot less ptw
15115,"If u are looking for Free to play multiplayer game for fun wasting. i suggest u this game, Part of pay to win, but im sure u can collect any card u want by playing it, its craftable and awesome"
15116,"I actually want to give this game a meh/neutral but since there is no middle vote the cons outweight the pro.

- Disclaimer I'm used to play clash royale without spend a single dime and constantly remain among the top 100 and In this game I'm  GM<500 in both team and solo ranking . trust me I know about balance 

pros
+ Fair play no P2W
+ acceptable F2P progression

cons
- Unbalance unit 
  - generally most flying unit in this game is unbalance except for the scrat. because most range unit in this game is absurdly weak 
        1 hit from even a tank and they are gone

    -  the most absurding unbalance unit is xiao long the green dragon cost 3 mana mediocore DPS of 19.3 and 80 health. seem 
          shitty isn""t he ? well the catch is he has atk range of 8 so he'll be perfectly safe most of the time in this scenario in most 
          other game the couter is to hurl some spell at him right? but not this game if you use any spell he'll get free shield which protect him from any source of damage 1 time and he'll also enter  a frenzy and rage mode which give him 50% dmg and atk speed. so the only option is to kill the tank and then killl him .
 there's no real counter no wonder why he is a legendary card.

     - spell especially chain lightning. you see this spell can chain off it target to other unit dealing dmg and stunt potentially you can 
          cast this spell to hit  unit  in front of your base and it'll chain off the enemy unit untill it hit every unit in the field including 
      enemy base with the cost 
       of 4 mana. oh it can only hit for 100 dmg you say? well like I said in the case of xiao long most of the time you use spell tactically to kill enemy DPS in the back line right ? most if not all DPS has a helth lower than 100. you see with only 4 mana you can delete all enemy back line
      - Stormy. imagine a cloud that have the same abilities as chain lightning spell and you got stormy . but that would be too op right ? so each atk will cost stormy 1/3 of it max hp but couple with Priestess who can heal other unit and Guradian which absorb any dmg that adjecent friendy unit take to him self

so  Guardian + Stormy + Priestess and optionally Xiao long  you'll get a heavy hitting with stunt that can hit multiple unit and able to heal it self

in conclusion the cards is either shitty or OP for it mana cost. the only redeeming thing about it is you can unlock all the card without spending any real money. and with the game being F2P the inevitable of power creep is near."
15117,Games's pretty fun.  Easy to get into and really smooth UI.  10/10
15118,"Its one of those games you know already, its fun."
15119,is chill
15120,Fun castle wars concept game. Me gusta.
15121,"On a whim I decided to play this game. This is a surprisingly fun. Between this and Forced Showdown, BetaDwarf gets me."
15122,Awesome Game!!!!
15123,nice
15124,LOVER THIS GAME
15125,"Started on console and moved to Steam. As the game goes, it feels like some mobile games I have played, but don't be deceived, this game is simple but from my short time spent on it, I have found a tactical depth that is quite captivating and the deck building is perfect for whom enjoyed the many TCG's out there but without a hefty price."
15126,"easy to start and easy to understand
"
15127,"Good game but 99% of the players are mentaly braindead, and deserve all the shit life as to offer! :D"
15128,"Nice little deck building game with some depth.
If you have little time to spare this is the game for you."
15129,Simple to play and keeps me engaged!
15130,good game
15131,fun
15132,"This game is a lot of fun.
I don't like the announcer or the feeling of being in casino with chests and wheel, but the game itself is a lot of fun."
15133,"This game is actually a lot of fun. Don't expect insane graphics, and remember if you're playing this more than for fun then it's pay to win; but otherwise it's a pretty solid game with lots of different strategies to win."
15134,"It's a Clash of XYZ style game, but on PC. F2P Model: Gives you tons of progress from achievements and rank ups alone. There's a premium upgrade available which permanently increases your gold gain rate but it's win gold and not achievement or rank up gold so it's not really a huge boost for someone new and should only be bought if you're sure you're going to play this game for hundreds of hours to come. There's also all masters upgrade which again is good if you're going to stick with the game and if you're sure you absolutely want them all, but having a different master doesn't make a huge difference until you have a deck to synergize with it and the master you start with is really good. TL;DR No P2W here, and I do not feel forced to pay to progress either. Better not spend any money until you're sure you're here to stay."
15135,Games a mess. Its a P2W game that tries to be cleaver in the way it presents itself (Buy Season Pass and/or Rubies and you will have a major advantage). If you dont buy anything guess what you will grind beyond any other game I have seen in this genre earning 1 card (which you will most likely already own) every couple of hours. Too bad because its a fun game but the way its right now it will most likely frustrate you more than anything. Cards are also unbalanced leaving any strategy pretty much at the door. As the time writing this review I'm Diamond and I know the decks I want to build but cant because unless I spend money it means spending countless hours trying to earn enough shards to get 1 card. Ridiculous
15136,Good game similar to clash royale in many ways but improves on a few aspects
15137,"kinda digging it so far, creatures are memorable and the hero classes rotate so you can try them out before you decide to ""buy"" them. like it so far. easy go to for a relaxed night of games"
15138,Amazing game!!!
15139,"Really love this game so far ^^


Edit: even though after investing a bit of time in this game , I was never hooked for too long. Unfortunately maybe I am not into these type of games anymore. Still  I would recommend if you like games like Clash Royal but better."
15140,"GREAT FAST GAME - ENJOY
"
15141,"great to lose track of time
"
15142,Great game!
15143,good
15144,"Easy to play, hard to master. The card collecting got me hooked."
15145,this game is the best mobile game i've ever played... But legit it's a good game. Give it a try.
15146,"game is great, fun fast paced easy to pick up but deep to keep coming back to"
15147,Clash Royale if it were good
15148,easy to learn but a lot of depth can be had.
15149,.
15150,Game Gud
15151,Fun and Easy to play. seems to be hard to master. wish you didnt need to unlock every card.
15152,"It's a fun game. There is some deep strategy and decision making with your minions you summon and when, where you place them, and in team battle it really depends on what your teammate is doing as well.

I would however strongly advise against getting sucked into the microtransactions and just playing the game for what it is in free to play."
15153,its a good and fun game like a card game but more action
15154,Classic <3 but ELVOLVED
15155,yap it's fun!!
15156,good game uwu
15157,"very addicting and fun game. A mixture of clash royale, league of legends, and hearthstone combined"
15158,"Is good, kinda reminds me of hearthstone meets phone destroyer. Very solid game so far,"
15159,"The gameplay itself is really fun, so I do recommend it overall. But a lot of the bells and whistles really detract from the game for me. The main things are the over the top reward screens ""OMG you got 1000 gold!!!!1 this is CRAZZZYYYY"", loot box mechanics, and cringeworthy cheesy commentary. You can almost feel the devs reaching out from the game to try and tickle the reward centres of your brain, and it's obnoxious.

However as I said, the actual gameplay is solid, it's kind of like a starcraft-y vibe in that units counter other units, but in a lot more constrained battlefield which might take some depth away for some people. But there's still plenty of strategy to keep things interesting."
15160,"Fast paced action, enjoying it."
15161,its amazing
15162,LET ME BUY SHARDS!
15163,awesommmmmme!
15164,"Very quick to become interesting. Feels like you have a lot of control over whether or not you will be successful. Reminds me a lot of the mini-games that I used to play in Starcraft. If you don't mind the mobile-gaming style elements of loot-boxes and timed rewards, and are looking for a game that can be enjoyed in small bursts, this is a good choice."
15165,"70/100 not bad, but f2p CashShop game

The whole menue thing looks a bit arcade-like and clunky,
also the fun without investment is LOW

But worse than P2Win is the boring repetitive gameplay.

-> No mid-/longterm motivation. It´s free, but not really worth investing much time"
15166,beste spiel !11
15167,"It's free and games are <10 minutes. Progression without paying is pretty glacial, but eh.

I'd give it a 6/10 is I could rate it."
15168,Is Ok.
15169,"good graphics, easy to learn"
15170,Really enjoying the game so far. Don't think I've lost yet haha.
15171,"The game has nice concept to it i love minion tower defense games a well
so far the reward system is ok no complaints there
So long as there is some kind of Master addition to it as far as more added and variety then the game should keep my interest."
15172,Games good bro
15173,fun battler
15174,A nice fun game. Nothing too serious and the rewards given per win OR loss make you want to play even more.
15175,AWSOME AND FUN GAME
15176,Very enjoyable game that had easy to understand mechanics and good gameplay. The different abilities and minions make every game interesting. Overall a very good game.
15177,"PC version of Clash Royale, if you enjoyed the mechanics of CR you'll love this game. Highly recommend."
15178,Really fun
15179,gud
15180,Wish it had Mac support.
15181,Absolutely amazing collectible card game/tactical war game! 10 out of 10!!!
15182,Minion Masters for Casual Strategy Gaming with Decks
15183,Similiar like Clash Royale but much more fun
15184,it is fun to kill minons
15185,"Relaxing game that gets you hooked in an instant.

Def give it a try"
15186,gooddddd
15187,"Quick matches, intuitive play, skinner box.
"
15188,more free stuff plz
15189,"Good game, maybe it could use more minions, they are never enough :D"
15190,fun game
15191,Absolutely Fantastic Squires
15192,"Very easy to jump straight in, hilarious and can't stop laughing. 100% recommend"
15193,i deleted my coment but again i post it you cant win this i invited a new player to this game we play pre made and its no use 4 titans evry game or some other op pay to win card its good game for like few hours but if you dont wanna invest like 50e. srsly i try to come back to this game but spend 10k gold and 500 rubies on spins yea you cant buy that cards you need to spin because you want to buy good card give them dollars and gues what i got on those spins nothing 0 fuck this game hope they go under with their pay to win bs they are worse than a fucking clash of clans
15194,Fun simple strategy game.
15195,It's a bit like clash royale but on pc.
15196,So far so good.
15197,yeay
15198,"This game to me is almost a call back to Age of War, but with Hearthstone like cards.  The game is kept at a fast pace and strategy revolves around summoning weaker minions now, or waiting for the big ones.  It also takes a hefty pinch of luck to ensure you have the right cards in hand."
15199,"Completely buggy, I am losing 20% of my games cause it crashes and I get thrown out immediatly :D
Game is alright but sooo many bugs and server errors its literally unplayable"
15200,"Good Day!!! 

The Game is good, entertaining and not addictive. That is the good things on a game, it entertains you and you don't get addicted to it. I could say 4.5/5 for the gameplay."
15201,Nice game :) Its fun to play
15202,"Where to start. I have never played a game like this before but i have been told it is like ""Clash Royale""...  Having said that, I immediately enjoyed this game.

Gameplay: Easy to learn and the tutorial level really gives you an idea of how to play against other players.  PVP games are short but fun.

Graphics:  Pretty good, the units look great and quite unique. It has a dota2'esque look in some ways.  The top down third person play is easy to use, and the controls are easy.

PVP: Queues are nearly instant at this point, I have found this to be the case throughout the few days I have played.

Sense of reward:  Unlocking new cards gets pretty hard after the tutorials and this makes it even more rewarding, but you are also bombarded with other rewards, which although nice, the continual graphical nature of them gets a bit bleh."
15203,game is extremely fun not hard to get use to and its not p2w like clash royale
15204,"Pretty fun so far. We will see how it holds up.
"
15205,"Few hours played. Enjoying it, havent put it down yet."
15206,"very funny game and it's really awesome.
it's exactly like clash royal :p"
15207,Fun little game to kill time.
15208,"Finally an enjoyable ""card game""
some polish, optimization and will be top notch"
15209,Fantastic Game.
15210,"It is the game how Clash Royale should be. Fair gameplay, no P2W, gain ingame gold / shard to get heroes and cards. No need to level up cards. Just needed to be more stable. Worth to play."
15211,"Great Game, very funny... short matches, nice Card game"
15212,ok
15213,Instantly addictive and rewarding.
15214,Fun game super easy to learn
15215,"good game simple game,,love it"
15216,A fun little card game with some sweet strategic elements. Not really my cup of tea but I've had fun with it
15217,I'm destroying these noobs
15218,Get a cleave and werewolf card and win the match with that single buffed minion
15219,Fun at least for this first hours
15220,I can play with a friend and get exp and/or goods. HELL YA; best goddamn card game yet. period.
15221,So far so good!
15222,"I'm too high for this right now, but this game has been a breath of fresh air for me. I recommend it. That is all."
15223,"Fun concept, interested to see how it progresses."
15224,Pretty Cool
15225,"not bad, short quick matches. only played a little"
15226,"good game.
can't buy rubies through Steam. Pls fix"
15227,"Free cool game, really fun with friends, if you have any, nerd."
15228,Fun :)
15229,Lots of fun and easy to learn.
15230,"fun fast paced game, about 50 hours logged so far, but now i cant actually get a match to start and if it does it gives me the defeat every time. I was pretty excited for the new update, but if i cant play it then whats the point."
15231,Im trying the game out. The game is fun and new to me. It is abit weird but what game isn't.
15232,"The announcer reminds me of Rachet & Clank :-p
Its pretty fun for a couple of random games during the day :-)"
15233,Recent updates made this game worse than it used to be.
15234,Great Game!
15235,"Im being coached by the best player this game ever seen twitch.tv/silasftw #1, love the game!"
15236,Love how the game wants me to rate so early.... Either way so far am enjoying the gameplay / competitive side
15237,goat
15238,GGGGOOOOOOOODDDDD IMHO
15239,great game funny cut scenes
15240,Fun!
15241,Fun
15242,this game is amazing
15243,very fun try build a army for this war :V
15244,"Surprisingly fun game, that's much more in depth than it looks. It's definitely worth giving a shot."
15245,Not bad
15246,good
15247,Clash Royale a mobile phone game. Big pay 2 win mechanics
15248,"not very many cards really, and only a handful of different heroes to play as. A fair amount of grinding to unlock content and earn various currencies.

Game is pretty good, but seems to be missing a lot."
15249,Fun
15250,quick and fun
15251,nice game
15252,Super addictive and fast paced. Once through the tutorial it is amazing.
15253,BEST GAME :)
15254,nettes spiele hoffe die laune bleibt :)
15255,"nicely made, but cheeky asking me to review it after an hour"
15256,"This is exactly the sort of game that I have had little love for and avoided in the past. Tempted to give it a try with the free DLC offer, I am now' pretty much addicted.

[u]The Good[/u]
Definitely NOT pay to win. If you are one of those people who likes to have everything available in the game ASAP then you are going to have a hell of a grind but, this game is perfectly playable, and, winnable, with easy to get cards. That said, I will definitely be buying something in this game to throw the devs some cash (a first for me in the F2P model), it is well deserved. 

Chess meets rock, paper, scissors is the best, real world, comparison that I can make. I love the style of the graphics, though they will not be to everyone's taste. Battles feel intense and there is plenty of variety to the game play.

[u]The Bad[/u]
I realise that this is hardly an original game, it is almost a complete rip-off of clash royale. Some complaints about balancing issues with the cards but, nothing too severe. Everything has a counter, you just have to find it and be prepared. Currently suffering from server issues that range from mildly intrusive to really frustrating. The cards are consistently reviewed and re-balanced so props to the devs for that at least. I hope, and would expect, the server issues to be sorted soon. While, most of the time, any issues are barely noticeable, it makes the game look rather unprofessional.

Overall. Its free. Try it. If its not for you, you will have lost only a little of your time. Hopefully, like me, you will have a blast. 9/10 Fix the servers and I will have found my perfect 10 game."
15257,Its a very straight foward game of King of the Hill. Balance of lower and higher cost minions to effectively take out your opponent. But its amusing and have a very good replay value.
15258,cool game
15259,"been following these guys for 5 years + on imgur
i downloaded it because i wanted to support u on imgur
they gave me a free gift on imgur
i can support u by playing my best

thanks imgur for bringing us together
https://imgur.com/"
15260,verry fun game rely
15261,It has Strategies if you pause and take a moment what each minion does. The masters make a impact specially if you combine them with the right cards.
15262,Very enjoyable game; offers a lot of fun new tools and flavor. I don't think it differs that much in comparison to other tower defence games/RTS but that does not make it bad! The only downside of this game is that it looks a little bit like a mobile game. For the rest 10/10 would play!
15263,I like powning noobs thumbs up from me dog!
15264,"fun, easy to pick up, hard to master. Best awkward card style game."
15265,nice alternative to clash royale
15266,"seems fun so far... and even if it is a blatent clash royale knock off, it is way better, the balance is vastly superior, and it is far and away the best game of its genre. maybe im biased as i have won my first 7 games without dropping a loss idk."
15267,"Easy to get into, but with a surprising amount of depth due to the unit variations and all their abilities."
15268,NICE
15269,"This game has way to many bugs and server timeouts. The amount of errors for not joining games and it registers as a lost or winning a game and not registering brought me to hating this game. It is a complete mess.

Gameplay is fun, but means nothing. You can have an epic match and win, only for it not to register on the server.

Would not recommend this to anyone."
15270,"Simple game, but very entertaining and fun"
15271,"This game has really bad Player Retention
(take a look at Steam Charts)  and there are many reasons for it.

Most of those ""Positive"" reviews are from players just starting
(playing 5-10 hours or less) and playing majority of their games against Bots.
(in a PvP advertised game...makes you think oO)

Then after Honeymoon period they realise this game 
is just some shallow predatory mobile game on PC
and now they are a punching bag for few Veteran players around
so it's time to leave or start using the best card - Credit card ;)
"
15272,"Very fun, simple, but in-depth game.  Thoroughly enjoying it."
15273,"The game is full of bug, crash and network error."
15274,"Short Games, Learning Curve is easy...
Fun and CASUAL
They are expanding the game, Just added a new mode and new faction..
Adventure Mode Added 
DEVS are constantly asking for feedback on game balance. DEVS listen to the community and actually let them vote on new cards. DEVS are active in global chat. MM has a Discord server. These guys are really dedicated to making this game grow."
15275,very nice! ;)
15276,Great game !
15277,"Really cool card collecting battle game consists of  1v1 and 2v2 matchs, really fast pace game matchs last no longer than 5 mins and i happen to enjoy it alot."
15278,A very fun and accessible game. I'll be sure to tell my friends about it so we can play some team games!
15279,I LOVE JEFFY
15280,Really fun so far
15281,"In its current state it's Clash Royale without the grinding for power, which is really fun if it's your kinda thing. You still have to grind for variety, but that's reasonable. What's unknown is whether they will go P2W in the future, and unfortunately there's no way to know that. It's great at time of review."
15282,"Addictive, fun, fast, casual but tactical. Loving it so far."
15283,now i understand where Clash of Clans gets all that money from.
15284,1000x better than MTGA
15285,"Really simply but really fun, have not explored deck building too much but can't wait"
15286,nice game :D remind me of clash royale!
15287,"Love it. Everyone should try.
"
15288,"You know Card Wars from adventure time? Yeah, that."
15289,"I love this game, its so simple yet so engaging. Perfect for people who works 9 hrs a day and just wants to sit down and play a game for an hour or two."
15290,Fun fast pace game
15291,"Pay to win, gg. Lost to ppl my level with way too good of cards"
15292,"Well done Clash Royale style game for PC. Probably the best I have played like it on PC. It's smooth, makes sense, nothing seems overly unbalanced, at least not at the early stages."
15293,"This game is amazing. They did such a great job making a fun game, it's like an amazing Starcraft/Warcraft map."
15294,"Great game, the gameplay is pretty similar with mobile game clash royale but with different vibes and theme, i hope its continue to improve and add new cards or features."
15295,"Pros:

Quick to Play.
Easy to understand.
Very enjoyable and addicting.

Cons:

Random disconnections but can be ignored.
Matches starting and ending because the other player failed to join in team game.



Overall I very much enjoy this game.  Will keep playing it to pass time and to see how it progresses. The cons even if more end up being added are easy to ignore and I am positive will be fixed in time. I suggest anyone who is thinking about it to give it a try and even if you lose, just keep trying and watch replays to see what your enemies are doing. You can learn as much from losing as winning.  Above all enjoy."
15296,Great Clash Royale inspired game
15297,game reminds me of clash of clans
15298,"Great game, took the turn based portion out of magic and hearthstone. this is going to be a big e sport."
15299,gooood
15300,Great free game
15301,"Fun and interesting twist on the MOBA genre, a strategic card game at the core with some real time management & RPG elements found other MOBA games."
15302,"[h1] quick and intuitive gameplay [/h1]

gameplay is very fast paced and easy to pick up. the ui is a little cluttered but that is ok. love the variety of spells and monsters to use to really tailor your strategy to who your fighting...very league of legends like"
15303,Where do I start. I saw this on discord at first and didn't really try it. My computer couldn't handle it so I'm so happy its on Steam now. This game may look cartoony but you need strategy to prevail here. This is such an awesome game to play especially when you have time to kill.
15304,"pretty much hearthstone mixed with LoL 


fun game :)"
15305,It's a great time waster
15306,fun to play
15307,:)
15308,fun game
15309,"Great game
Pros
 - Fast matchmaking 0 second queue
 - Not Pay to play/Pay to Win got to plat an going higher without spending a dime.
 - Playerbase is super friendly streamed the game an a lot of people came into my stream think i had around 50 the whole time.
 - Discord community is active though seems like it's used mostly for BMing Indirectly :') 
 - Graphics are actually really nice which keeps ya playing.
 - It's not really a card game more of a tower defense kind of game.
 - Games are short but the more intense ones once you reach plat+ Can last up to 6 minutes or longer one false move can lose you the game.
Cons
 - Lots of disconnections an errors. But keep in mind the game is still fairly new.
 - Random framedrops/jitters my rig: RTX 2060, 32 GB Ram, Ryzen 7


In this review the pros outweighed the cons. Great game hopefully it'll stay that way. 
"
15310,It's a fun game!
15311,so far so good
15312,Addicting and doesn't rely a lot on micro transactions which most games are doing nowadays. Keep it coming guys!
15313,"They take everything good from the lane fighting games, and merge it into this masterpiece. F2P, so no risk and all fun. Try it"
15314,"this game is so much fun i  can play four hours.  Its awesome that none else can ruin the game for me and the perfect pace allows me to stragize
"
15315,I've always wanted a tug of war game based on cards ever since I played a mod on Start Craft 2 similar to this game.
15316,"A ton of fun, lots of synergies between cards and interesting ways to build decks"
15317,Dope
15318,At least 20% cooler than it looks.
15319,Like Clash Royale but for PC its a nice change just hope some cards dont break the game as they come out.  Make sure to Follow Twitch.tv/RelaxiGotThis Looking to become a partner one day.
15320,Because I think the enemies are bots
15321,Quick matches good sense of humor!
15322,"Easy to pick up and play!
Just fun"
15323,"An amusing, whimsically styled RTS that's simple and enjoyable."
15324,Pay to win. Straight off the bat coming up against players with OP decks that just smash you to bits. Shame cause it looked as though it could have been enjoyable.
15325,tits
15326,pretty fun. About 1 hour in and I mostly like that you can use any card in any deck
15327,11/10
15328,"For a free to play game, this is surprisingly very enjoyable.  Lots of content, and a fair degree of strategy too."
15329,"It's fun, mindless at times but fun"
15330,"The game is good fun with friends, straight forward but with a sense of depth"
15331,fun
15332,like it so far!
15333,nice to play form time
15334,Easy to play and fun for the community!
15335,everything that clash royale should of been. great game without feeling like you have to dig deep into your wallet to win. highly recommend.
15336,This game has become trash. The devs clearly do not care about it since the only way to win at it is to just do spam tactics and cheap cards like stormy and priestess combo is not nerfed.
15337,good game really chill
15338,Looking fun so far
15339,So far I love how its got my chat interacting to compete as a spectator in the game!
15340,"Pretty relaxed fun.
"
15341,"Really bad server issues. Connection breaks every 5-10 minutes! Wanted to recruit a card for 500 shards. Server breaks, card not in my deck. I try to buy it again. Again server breaks. I log out an in again and I Have bought the same card twice. This is total BS. Want my money back for premium account!"
15342,Fun so far
15343,"Pretty typical CCG, Tug o War style game. Very buggy and lots of server issues. Has a lot of tags it shouldn't, like a great many games these days. Worth playing a bit, but not for long."
15344,"i loved
"
15345,БАЛДЁЖ
15346,It's fun game
15347,"TL;DR: Game sucks, but its fun enough to keep playing while watching youtube.

The game's fun. But everything around the game is pretty crap. It is EXTREMELY stingy with rewards - the only way you're going to actually get enough cards to earn a decent amount of glory, or get the rare cards you actually care about, is through promo packs. If you want to do pure F2P, good fucking luck. The amount of gold you get per match is laughable - maybe 30 a win. Each token to roll for a new card costs 1000 gold. The only way you're going to get that much is through daily quests - the gold you get for actully playing the game might as well be nonexistant.
Players also disconnect frequently. Shit happens, I get it. Problem is, anytime anyone disconnects, YOU get a loss. That means you lose rank points, and a lot of the bonuses are tied to you keep going until you get three loses. Someone disconnects? Thats one mark aginst you. Too bad, fuck you."
15348,"It's actually quite a good game when it works...

- Unable to connect you, re-connect messages mid game, buttons sometimes dont show that they are working but they actually are eg find match doesn't highlight when clicked, then says found a match? game has loads of server bugs, these have been reported long ago but nothing done about them.

- Conquest guild battles put you against anything goes not just other people doing conquest deck builds

- Lots of candy crush BS going on from the main game,

- No test deck game type / option

- Game used to crash every time I first loaded each day, now it's not

- They nerf / change card capabilities because people loose to certain builds, each deck build that is strong in one thing is weak against another, sometimes they should not listen to the crybaby losers

- Match making can be all over the place, sometimes your up against someone nearly a rank above you or sometimes below you, there's a pattern on rank change

- Game types should be matched against other people playing that match type, not anything goes"
15349,"good game, i enjoyed it so far
keep goin.."
15350,"Super low floor, very high ceiling, fun all the way through!"
15351,"This game takes elements from LoL and Hearthstone and combines it into one game. 1v1 and 2v2. AI as stand in if MM cant find enugh humans. Lower ranks are AI only(up to about silver rank)
Like all other card games, how you build your deck + skill + luck determins how far you get.
Standard f2p stuff(spenders get stuff mutch faster and so on) but still fully playable in its free form.
Fast games(1-8 mins) and quite addicting the first days.


Edit 04/08.
You can add a more or less absence of balance in this game to the list of downsides, a list that you will discover as you play.

2v2 mode is clearly not supported by the devs as what is unbalanced in 1v1 becomes completely gamebroken in 2v2, and 2v2 is the only mode worth playing in the game.

Their first master released after the game was released on steam is allso broken beyond repair whitout any attempt of fixing it or remove it from the game to be repaired/remade.
If you never progress beyond Gold rank, the game is fine. Hit the ranks after Gold and it is cancer.
Becouse of the state of balance amongs the masters, the fact that there is no master restriction in 2v2 (both players on a team can use the same master making it a very frustrated, broken and no fun match to play) and in general no support balances intented for for 2v2 mode, i am altering my recommendation to No.
When half the content of the game is unplayable, you know the devs dont know what they are doing."
15352,Thumb up!
15353,"Came to this game because it's free to play. Got into it and played for hours. Money can be easily earned by completing quests and play matches. 2 free heroes per week, try it if you get bored in other games"
15354,:D
15355,quick personable and fun
15356,Pretty fun and enjoyable.
15357,OK
15358,Cool game
15359,Awesome
15360,Its fun and the rounds go quick
15361,It is good :) Nice graphics cool gameplay and cute emotes <3
15362,This game is awesome!!!
15363,actually a surprisingly good game.
15364,damn this game fun to play la
15365,"I still wanted to leave a review, eventough I only played 2.2 hours of this game. This is an amazing game and really balanced. The graphics are amazing, and 2v2 is a lot of fun (unless your teammate doesn't do anything)"
15366,"Great game, reminds me of Battle Forge. Love it"
15367,"Really simple fun card mechanics,"
15368,Pretty fun so far will give a update later.
15369,"game told me to leave a review if i liked the game so far, and i do"
15370,This game is awesome!
15371,"Coming from Hearthstone, this game is a pleasant surprise. I had three main concerns, but I can safely say this game blew away my expectations and grabbed my attention right away.

1. ""Is it Pay-To-Win?""
For me it's only day 2 and I've already managed to gather 50 cards out of 135 or so, and I've only bought 5-7 Power Tokens (a.k.a loot boxes). The game is fairly generous when it comes to rewards, especially now that you can grab Accursed Army DLC for free, the game just seems to throw virtual-money at you and tells you to go nuts with it. And that's before you take in account the free daily tokens, Twitch drops and shop special deals.

You have to unlock the in-game heroes with currency, but each week you get to try two heroes for free, so you can get the idea how each of them plays out (each has their own strength and weakness) and which ones you wanna unlock first.
There's also Daily Quests which you can re-roll at your leisure.

Short answer is: No, it definitely doesn't feel like P2W. If a certain card seems unfair, it's probably because you're not used to playing around it yet.

2. ""So what about the gameplay itself?""
Well, if you've come from Hearthstone or other CCG, the amount of RNG is rather minimal. Sure, there's few spells and Hero Perks that summons a random minion of certain Mana cost, but timing and skill are what really matters: This game has heavy emphasis on Rock-Paper-Scissor mechanic:
- Your opponent plays a big beefy dude? Summon a swarm of small dudes or Shock Lancers to stunlock it. 
- Your opponent tries to swarm you with little dudes? Play AoE bombadiers. 
- Your opponent plays lots of ranged units? Incubus and Prowler runs up to them and shreds them in no time.

Besides 1v1, the game also has 2v2 mode which opens up a plethora of options: Hero Perks synergize with one another and you can quick message your teammate to focus on upper or lower lane, and you can see which units/spells they're about to play and where. Overall it feels very fluid.

Average game lasts anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes, so you can play either short or long sessions at a time. The matches are fast-paced and eventful.

3. ""What about the deck building and draw-RNG then?""
Your deck contains 11 cards, you always have 4 cards in hand and the UI indicates which cards you're gonna ""draw"" next. So far I haven't had a single game where I felt like I lost because draw RNG screwed me over: When you lose a game, your opponent either had the specific counter deck and/or outplayed you.
If you're from HS and you got sick of seeing Aggro Hunter, Tempo Rogue or Murloc decks, rejoice: ""spam cheap trash and hope opponent doesn't clear it"" won't work in this game.

This game is a solid 8.5/10.
Definitely worth trying out, don't let the CCG tag fool you: This game is more of a MOBA & CCG hybrid than anything else. In this game, skill matters more than credit card and RNGesus."
15372,"I love the fact that you guys are so generous with powerful cards early on. Most free to play games give you complete and utter shit when you first start. Your rewards are powerful and satisfying from the start - but I still feel like I'm left wanting more! I love how you've combined MOBA, RTS and card game into one addicting package!"
15373,Fun game
15374,Great game
15375,daora
15376,"Love the game, unique in a lot of ways. Just don't like the ""watch these particular streamers"" type of promotional material because I don't have time to participate :("
15377,can see it being a huge game
15378,Good so far. Loved forced. Will Update soon.
15379,fun
15380,Great game
15381,very good
15382,"Awesome game, quick to pick up."
15383,its ok and fun.
15384,good addicting free
15385,"this game is way more fun than it has any right to be. If you've ever played tug of war warcraft/starcraft maps or Totally accurate battle simulator, it's kind of like that.

2021 edit: I've still gotten a lot of fun out of this game but I swear im not going to touch this game again, at least until Morelia's brokenness is fixed. Shes literally all anyone ever plays, at least in team comp. She wouldn't be that bad if there wasn't an absolutely broken skill that clones any unit on the battlefield. Yes, even Morelia's 8 mana (10 mana value) dragon. Really fun when some chinese guy keeps copying his legendaries all game. Oh, the dragon also has a ""mythic"" affix that claims there can only be one copy at a time on the battlefield. Whoops, so much for that."
15386,Fun Game!
15387,"Not usually a fan of card games but this is a step above. 

I'm completely addicted, and I haven't felt pressured once to pay real money. They give out cards like candy and I recently got a super cool legendary card I haven't even seen another player use.

I really suggest this game for anyone who enjoys strategy. 

P.S. If the devs ever see this, you have something really special here. I think the game took itself a little more serious you could have something that expands into esports. :)"
15388,Seems balanced and does not seem to be a pay to win
15389,An Interesting take on TCGs. A good change of pace from the norm.
15390,I fully recommend this game one of my favorites in my library i play it daily and it reminds me of i game i used to play a lot called clash royale and i love it so much best game 2019
15391,Extremely fun!
15392,This game could honestly be the start of something truly enjoyable :)
15393,"If you've played Clash Royale and enjoyed it, this game is right up your alley! It's fun and addictive with pretty decent graphics. It's also got a team battle mode if you want to dominate the ranks with your buddy!~"
15394,"It's fun and polished. Not sure how the balance is so far, but the moment to moment gameplay is gratifying and entertaining."
15395,Just make a Swarmer deck with one big cost minion. EZ 9/10
15396,Fun game with a really cool concept
15397,Basically Hearthstone and Clash Royal had a kid. You're battling with cards to counter your opponents cards to push for their tower. Overall it's really fun to play with plenty of decks to go for and not just one overall meta. You can play the game for 5min or become completely addicted to the game.
15398,Its fun and to the point!
15399,Great quick fun. Doesnt take much to be good.
15400,Fun
15401,"Decent game so far for only playing it for less than a hour, As of right now will update later though depending on how it keeps going."
15402,"so far this game very atractive, good combination card and rts battle"
15403,"I have played games like this in the past but i have to stay this might be the best i have played of a game like this. If you like these type of games then you will find this enjoyable. 

Great game for when you are in between games"
15404,fun
15405,Fun so far! Saw Day9 play it and wanted to try it out.
15406,"Game is really fun. Learning what minions counter what is cool. The tips are helpful (gainin mana advantage ect,,,). Its a simple game with a lot to learn. Looking forward to improving my game :)"
15407,"Playing with friends in this game is great!!!
"
15408,A better clash royale.
15409,Casual fun little game summoning minions to destroy the enemies tower.  Balance minion cost by speed of deployment and build a deck to take out your opponent!
15410,"The game is very Chaotic and addicting. The game is free so there is in-game purchases, but I am having fun playing it for free."
15411,So excited for team battles with friends
15412,"Looks like a mobile game, plays like a good game"
15413,its nice and easy
15414,"animated hearthstone with no turn based,
can build decks, cards with class&combos,
everything can be countered,
seems like play2win, not pay2win,
hope they will create more and more cards in future.

give it a chance"
15415,"Yep, I'm addicted."
15416,good game
15417,the game is fun and  easy to get into and don't feel pay to win.
15418,Fun game that is definitely worth trying out since its free
15419,Simple UI with possibilities for intense game play. Very exciting to see so far
15420,Fun and diverse enough for at least a few good hours of entertainment.
15421,Absolutely love the game.
15422,"Good fun, relaxed or as intense as you want it to be."
15423,This game is a ton of fun and the fact that it's free is just incredible
15424,While this game is really fun its held back by the fact that its a buggy unstable mess. Random disconnects aren't uncommon which if your doing any of the limited loss modes is just unacceptable. You'll get random errors when trying to just about anything except afking. If they can fix the Issues it would be an excellent game but having their servers just decide you randomly lose sucks.
15425,n1
15426,"As a Star Wars Force Arena refugee, I feel right at home."
15427,Good clean fun!
15428,because I interested in team battlle and I like to friendly fight :D
15429,The better Clash Royale.
15430,Dope
15431,Awesome game!
15432,Better version of Clash Royal
15433,Simple and enjoyable.
15434,"I like it, it is fun."
15435,Games fun to play at start feels like it has a very confusing shop setup but game mechanics are easy enough
15436,"What a fun little game!  It feels like Hearthstone meets Footman Wars from WC3.

You get a small deck of cards and play them with mana that rapidly regenerates.  

Counter your opponents troops and destroy their base to win!

It doesn't feel overly pay to win, as you can buy rubies to unlock more things.  But I beat a few people with bought things so it really doesn't seem to matter.  Find a solid strat and SENNND IT!

It's free....  What are you waiting for?..."
15437,fun
15438,"nice minion spawning game, reminds me of some old wc3 maps"
15439,It's like that one mobile game clash of clans or royal of clash? something like that but for computer and better.
15440,"So far this game has been really easy to pick up and play. The non pay to win structure makes it a lot of fun. For those that want to play a game like DOTA but feel it is just to complex, you should try this out! Very fun first hour!"
15441,"Is good
 
berry good"
15442,how to quit ?
15443,its a very simple and satisfying game. the color scheme is amazing and it doesn't take long to play matches.
15444,Excellent blend of RTS.
15445,ggez
15446,This is a fun and fast paced PC version of clash royale.  With less of a pay to win strategy to boot.
15447,The Team Battles are great quick fun!
15448,"I played this game quite some hours during the early access phase.
It is pretty fun and plays very well. The closest game I know would be the mobile game clash royale, while Minion Masters has no P2W aspect at all.
There is a small pay to skip aspect in this game, you can get some cards through tokens a bit earlier and build a better deck right when you start, but you get all the cards pretty quickly so you are not forced to pay for tokens.
Your cards don't get any stronger from leveling them, it just gives you some more points for a win, but in fight there is literally no difference in using a low or high rank card.

There are some Meta Decks which mostly changes with new cards and balance updates, but you can also get pretty far with some other decks."
15449,This is a good past timer and really fun duo is a great mode so that you and a friend or random can play to see the competition  and not sharing the mana is so good i can play what i feel is right and so can my partner
15450,"Fun game so far , refreshing take on the genre.
"
15451,"This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. It has came very far from it's previous updates and keeps getting better and better. It hits all of the sweet spots. Its casual while still being competitive, easy to pick up and learn, great humor, art style, strategy, playing with friends, playing against friends, playing solo, ranks, deck building, and so much more. Not to mention it's FREE! There is no P2W in this game, which is such an upside these days especially in the card/deck building online genre. There are some card combos that are super OP that need to be looked at but aren't game breaking in any way just annoying to deal with I.e. Stormy with Healer, and maybe 2 more. 9.5/10"
15452,"Fun and intuitive, I can see my self playing this game for a while."
15453,"Very fun, leveling cards doesnt impact their stats, only lets you play multiple copies in a deck"
15454,"simply fun
"
15455,Have you wanted to ever play clash royale? Well this game is that but fun
15456,love tug of war games since castle fight in wc3
15457,"this game is so adicting OMGGG
"
15458,If you like Hearthstone you will like this. Its polished and fast paced. Its not pay to win. Games  are fast and require some skill to master.
15459,"Refreshing strategy card game that its unique and different in this genre of card games. Enjoyable, fast paced action and easy to pick up and learn."
15460,"I think this is a very well made game. I like this style of game, but they are always made to be a mobile game and are often pay to win. This game feels like it is made for computer users and it gives a lot of ways to build your deck with out needing to spend money. One criticism I have is that when I went into team battles my team mate instantly left and I received a loss. I feel that adding a penalty for leaving early would take away from the fun of the game, but I do think that just because some random person that you queued with leaves you should not get a loss. Overall a very fun and addicting game; I will enjoy playing it even more."
15461,Good so far
15462,I enjoy this alot please keep up the good work and bring  content!
15463,Good balanced game play. For free to play doesnt feel like i need to pay to win
15464,"I like the gameplay, in theory. However, the game is so badly balanced, especially in draft mode, that it causes pure frustration instead of enjoyment."
15465,cool
15466,Very good game!!!
15467,"Great meme game, grab a buddy and have some easy fun"
15468,wow what a great game.
15469,Great game!
15470,Foontoostic
15471,its realy good game
15472,Great Game
15473,Quick and intense games. Great for people with not a lot of time on their hands as well and having a lot of spare time. The P2W aspect will probably be over-bearing after a while though.
15474,"Really cool game, addictive and challenging. Not bad for some dudes that had to carry their fridges to an abandoned room."
15475,ok
15476,"Hey i've only played a couple hours so far, but i've been really enjoying it. Its super beginner friendly and really easy to learn. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games. 
"
15477,This is a fun little card game with more field positioning strategy rather than efficient stats.
15478,Clash Royale fans prepare for your second round of digital crack.
15479,So simple yet so funn!!!!!
15480,Amazing Game
15481,"A fresh-feeling card game.
Extremely non-P2W.

Give it a whirl, bud."
15482,fun game
15483,good game
15484,"its a great game could go competitive

"
15485,fun game that evolves month to month. strategy like chess. can be free to play and be competitive
15486,"Fun and easy to pick up and play, but with a good amount of depth as well"
15487,"Never actually managed to play this game, game loads and all and connection error right of the bat, doesn't even let me see the menu, seems like some other people also have this problem and the developer is aware, seems like they haven't fixed it though.
can't really recommend a game if you can't even play it."
15488,"Very fast paced, reminds me of Plants vs. Zombies also like a Trading Card Game. VERY addicting game! :D"
15489,Is fun so far just poking around still trying new cards 3 dragon card op early game
15490,swell
15491,.
15492,"Son juegos rápidos, y es entretenido :D"
15493,quite fun!
15494,yeet
15495,its just bad
15496,Nice f2p;)
15497,"Very great fun time game, would greatly possibly recommend thi...thi... this fun time game to you; It's not pay to win which is a cringe, it has fun time gameplay, and intriguing progression."
15498,"Actually quite fun, something different."
15499,Really really addicting and fun game. Especially since it's free. Play it faggots!
15500,"awesome game, its very fair and beautiful
"
15501,"30minutes of fun with my dude, good times"
15502,Love the game mechanics and it's just so fun!
15503,"A new take on card games

The game is easy to get into. Minions you play live their own lives on the battlefield.
There maybe some balance issues, but the game is fairly new and developers seem active.
Well worth giving a shot!"
15504,Fun game
15505,well game
15506,Good af
15507,"It's a pay to win mess of a game. Using the free code I was given (bones and bravery) and the free bonus(accursed army), I've won 7 matches in a row against free players by barely trying. So if you want to pay money to win, here ya go. Otherwise, its gross and the underlying game beneath isn't good enough to fight through the layers and layers of free to play mechanics to get to. And those free bonuses? Not even enough to build a full deck. Still had to deal with roulette wheels and buying units for waaaaay too much grindable currency."
15508,pretty fun and easy to get into
15509,"I Like it, they give DLC's away for free :D"
15510,fast paced fun
15511,good
15512,fun gamee fast rounds
15513,Need More Estus
15514,Fun game!
15515,Having lots of fun getting to know the game.  Lots of cool minions mixing it up.  Smooth to play and looks great.
15516,fun time. play NOW
15517,Great game! i love the mix of card and action!
15518,...
15519,"Fun, concise, some actual depth to unit composition and timing.
Doesn't tend to to drag on or feel too BS."
15520,Great free game
15521,"good game indeed
"
15522,simple to understand
15523,good fun
15524,Reminds me of clash royale. It is a ton of fun.
15525,Cool game
15526,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME 
"
15527,Haven't played too long but has pretty solid game mechanics. Will update if i find out more
15528,"One of the few multi player arena style games I can stand. Matches can be as short as 2 minutes, if you got your deck lined up but most last 5-8. A good mix of avatars and a ton of fun spells. Some serious strategy and constant improvements!"
15529,This game is all the best parts of deckbuilding and all the fun parts of seeing your strategies come to life on the field
15530,pay to win. woohoo
15531,Great game to play when you want a challenge but also relaxing
15532,"Absolutely hate card games, but i LOVE this game, so far it has been nothing if not phenomenal"
15533,Its a gOOd card game kinda pay to win but easily avoidable
15534,good game
15535,fun until lvl 10
15536,"It's gucci, try it out!"
15537,Lots of fun!!!
15538,"Fast paced fun game that eases you through the learning curve,"
15539,It is a simple yet interactive game that has an air of experimentation like one would find in most deck building games yet the games are fast and meaningful. It is an easy game to pick up and there is a possibility to have some late game depth for replayability.
15540,It is fun!
15541,"Fun game, can be casual"
15542,Simple concept but with a large variety of unique units. Games are short but intense and fun.
15543,its a free game omegalul pretty cool
15544,The game i never knew i wanted to play until the moment i laid my eyes on it.
15545,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
15546,pretty fun so far
15547,Great game
15548,Great game easy to play and pick up
15549,"Very fun game, I approve!"
15550,"I've never played a competitive game that felt so truly to be a game of strategy. Reflexes and luck play only minimal roles, for the most part the skillset seems similiar to a TCG, but with the fast and exciting combat of a MOBA. Honestly one of the greatest competitive games ever made, don't under-estimate this gem it's going places."
15551,Simple fun game
15552,Lots of fun!
15553,"Fun game. Unique. I haven't quite concluded whether or not how much p2w is involved but it's a free game and I've already gotten a couple hours out of it, not a bad deal."
15554,i give this one like 8.5/10
15555,Great Game! Very fun
15556,fun
15557,Excelent!
15558,"Very nice game, lot of enjoyments"
15559,Seems pretty fun so far.  I am used to playing cards games on a semi competitive level and I have not played long enough to hate the game but still play.  When we reach that point thats when I know I'm hooked in.
15560,"Fun game, simple and complex at the same time"
15561,awesome
15562,It fun
15563,"this game is fun, now i can play clash royale on PC good jobh guys"
15564,Fun free game
15565,"I really enjoyed the two lane concept as well as being only able to play certain things at a certain time with the randomness of a deck concept like mtg, very fun! I would recommend this to my friends for sure."
15566,lit
15567,Fun times with friends!
15568,Great game!
15569,Easy to understand and a lot of depth
15570,"Unlike what i normally play, quite pleasant and not too hard to understand."
15571,"It's basically a better Clash Royale with less overtly p2win mechanics. 

Like any CCG, players who spend more will have a larger collection and, thus, more options when deckbuilding. However, unlike Clash Royale, the cards themselves do not get stronger as you aquire more copies, making the matches much more balanced. 

Plus, there are 2 DLC expansions avaible for free right now, so newer players can start with much better options than the avarage digital CCG.

The gameplay itself is pretty fun as well. I hope it stays on the right track :)"
15572,Game is Groot
15573,"This game is pretty cool, requires some amount of tactics and resource management, and has a pretty nice variety of ""toys"" to play with. I'm kind of excited to get deeper into it and see what people come up with deck-wise, as I see a lot of room for fun tribal varieties and super sketchy combo decks.
Not a traditional card game in that you use the cards to spawn units in real time that navigate the battlefield about as intelligently as you'd expect them to and there is definitely going to be an interesting meta about this game, though I'm assuming by now that there are people who have figured that out and dumped their money into it :D
But, as a free to play game, if you're just looking for something to kill an hour or two you should definitely give this game a try!"
15574,"Quite like it so far,minus the disconnect or two,great depth!"
15575,Fun to play hard to master
15576,This game good 1/10
15577,Easy to jump into and get started.
15578,"Game has cool loot/elo features, fast phased and relax game, i like so far"
15579,Better than hearthstone
15580,It's fun until you hit paywall.
15581,Great game!I'm really chilling here!Thanks
15582,simple yet enjoyable
15583,Big thing is that it is free. Matches don't take too long and there's a lot of different deck combinations you can come up with/use! I'm a big fan of clash royale and this game brings a whole realm of more customiztaion and gameplay in regards to strategies.
15584,"Pretty good game imo, another well done deckbuilding game"
15585,10/10 fun game easy to get into being free to play really made it worth the time to learn!
15586,"great game, free and i got it when the accursed dlc which is normally 14$ was free plays like hearthstone and almost like a tower defense moba thing"
15587,"Reminds me of a simplified version of Tower Wars from Warcraft 3 custom maps, with some deckbuilder aspects rolled in.  If you like that you'll probably like this.  The shop follows what I guess you would call the standard of predatory practices that exist in games like this now, so I would consider that a drawback, but its so ubiquitous I don't know that it is enough not to recommend the game."
15588,So far it's like better Clash Royale on PC
15589,always liked the games from this dev and this one aint an exception
15590,Just a great game tbh
15591,"I love this game. has amazing game play and the style makes the game even more fun to play. i give this game a solid 10/10.

I've only been playing it for 1 hour but still very addicting"
15592,very fun and fast game paste :)
15593,Early game is fun so far.
15594,Good
15595,Bas interesantna igra.Very good and intresting game - dynamic
15596,aWSOME MIX between clash royal and rest of good game
15597,What an annoying forced game...... deleted.
15598,LOTS OF FUN!!! AND 2V2 IS THE BEST!!! I ALWAYS WIN ;P
15599,Trash game. Devs always unbalance it each patch. Fix it next patch then make it worse somehow in following patch.
15600,"Its a fun game to play, and its easy to learn!"
15601,Nice easy game to learn but still entertaining to play!
15602,Fun Ass Game! I love it so much!
15603,Are these even real players?
15604,Been playing the game for about 70 mins now so far I have to say it is excellent! Especially loving the team battles so far! Applause to the devs for making such a great game :)
15605,"Good ass game
"
15606,bueno me gusta
15607,AWESOME GAME
15608,SIMPLE AND QUITE FUN SO FAR =)
15609,Simple gameplay that once you start getting into it you find much more complexity than anticipated.
15610,"It's a nice game, like castle clash but on PC."
15611,Awesome game.
15612,"i lost control over my life
"
15613,Solid game atm!
15614,"Just a Better Clash Royale ,Fun To play with or against Friend."
15615,yes
15616,games are quick and fun.
15617,"Great f2p fun, haven't made it high enough where i feel like needing to spend money."
15618,fun game
15619,This fun. Cant say anything else. Play it and u wont regret. its free anyway. Cheers
15620,"Easy to learn, fun fast, and overall well designed and optimized"
15621,"Compact , fast paced with just the right amount of depth for you to enjoy without burning too much of your brain."
15622,Hello there folks just played the game today i think its one of the best like common its the only game which is that fast paced  card game with action fight that needs that strategy for a tower defence so yes i recommend it its full of potential allready!!!! Check my channel on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoOdD1d8dks&t=1s%3Figr%3DVemonTVGr?igr=VemonTVGr i got some gameplay footage peace out and give it a try IT WORTHS
15623,"its aqesome
"
15624,Very good game! If you like strategy this one is a good try.
15625,It's a lot of fun for a free game. It's worth a try for free.
15626,very nice
15627,The mechanics of Clash Royale and the unfairness of Hearthstone. Essentially older players or players that put money into the game have a massive advantage until you manage to catch up.
15628,"This game is a clash royal clone. I like it. Try it if you are ok with a company selling your information.

Old Review: I like that this game doesn't make you wait and pay for stuff like Clash Royal does.

END OF REVIEW"
15629,"While the core of the game is ok and there seems to be a lot of content, the simple gameplay along with the random factor and the grind make it a glorified slot machine"
15630,Awsome fun
15631,"F2P game with pretty good progress even if you don't want to spend money on it but It also could be a great game if it had competent developers who actually try. The higher ranks (Master, GM) all have a few cheesy deck and master which makes it boring to play after a few matches regardless if you do the same or try your own decks. The most common mode 2v2 is ridiculously unbalanced. In its genre the game is better than any other similar game but I highly advise against spending a dime on it, play it for free until it has enough players but I would be surprised if the game could last long with how badly it is managed by the devs."
15632,"It's a very fun game and I love to play it. It is for people who like a challenge and like's a game where it is required to think a bit but not to much at the same time. I would really recommend this game for people who have played games like hearthstone or mtg (magic the gathering) because this is kinda the same but with slightly different rules like there isn't 
individual turns and stuff. Its also fun to build decks because there are different cards like spell cards or minion cards so you could forexample make a spell deck with some minions reacting to spells. The animations and graphics is also really good, cool, funny and awsome."
15633,great :)
15634,This game is the perfect combination between lol and Hearthstone.
15635,As a person with a lot of clash royale exsperice i rather play this game for the rest of my life
15636,"Great game. Easy to learn, plenty of action and very fast paced."
15637,kood game!
15638,good game
15639,"Great game, heartstone with animated fighting, but without the pay to win advantage!"
15640,Very quick to get into and checks so many of my boxes of what I am looking for in a game. 10/10
15641,"Pretty fun, seems to be keeping me interested well enough for it to not be grindy. addictive, simple game play and nice graphic style choices."
15642,"i like this game, but why so high GPU usage"
15643,super fun
15644,"Started playing it like any other F2P, this one caught my attention for 6 hours. Seems like a good start to something that could be even better. Only thing I am waiting on is newer units but like I said, i've just started and having matches that last from 1 min to 7 mins can be very fun, always thinking about how to improve for the next match.

6.5/10 worth playing
8/10 potential to be better we will see :)"
15645,Pretty neat take on spawn control games.
15646,Awesome and fun game!
15647,Good game
15648,"Interesting game, saw it and figured id give it a shot love to play league so thought a similar game with a faster pace would be fun to try. Mechanics are interesting still very new but seems it can get pretty in depth as well."
15649,Super fun!
15650,Fun and really simple and easy to get a hang of =)
15651,ITS FUCKING AMAZING
15652,good stuff
15653,"Fun game, fast paced and fairly simple to understand with a lot of depth it seems."
15654,"First impressions are very good!
No complaints so far."
15655,"Just a fun, simple, and nice looking game."
15656,GOOD GAME
15657,"Going to make it short but sweet - it's a great ""Pick-Up"" game to play a few quick rounds from time to time.  Fun gameplay, interesting cards, masters and strategies.  BUT, as with most multiplayer games, it's the community that ruins it.

If you play premade teams with your friends all the time you will do very well.  But if you solo, you can forget the 2v2 matches, which are actually one of the funnest parts of the game.  Between figting Premade teams (yes, there's still no separate queues despite it being a much loathed problem discussed many times over in the forums) and teammates that are simply either bad or quit, 2v2 is BROKEN.  

I enjoy the game enough to come back regularly for a round or two, but inevitably as a solo player I can't see this being more than something to play when I have 15 minutes on my hands to play a game.  

Worth playing, but Your mileage will vary depending on how social your playstyle is..."
15658,good game one of the best games i played
15659,"Love it.
"
15660,Awesome game
15661,"Fast, fun, addicting. I've played 10 matches so far and really enjoy it."
15662,fun to play and alot of free things =)
15663,great battle game card i've played so far
15664,this is surprising good
15665,easy fast fun
15666,fun
15667,"Seems fun, don't regret spending my time on it thus far."
15668,Easy to get into. Enough depth to stay interesting. Good game!
15669,"Fun game to play, well structured and easy to understand! Will be streaming this on my channel https://www.twitch.tv/ukyoungy1"
15670,Just started...FUN!!
15671,vry gd
15672,Excellent idea and a game worth to play
15673,Its ok
15674,The game is amazing fun. Easy to pick up and quick to get into. 10/10 would recommend. <3
15675,"So I come from a background of Clash Royale on mobile and this is just a perfect replacement on PC and consoles , much better and not p2w. Go for it and support the devs :)"
15676,good game 9/10
15677,good
15678,"Game is great, for a F2P, P2W game!"
15679,Played for a few hours and the game is pretty fun from the get go. First impression is that the game is polished and gives free stuff away.
15680,Зашел увидел победил
15681,Its something new and fresh and most of all enjoyable
15682,"It's pretty cool, a tad bit sad that i can't get my old Discord progress to the steam version but i can live with it.
Another thing is that i keep getting Errors saying timeout

"
15683,"Phenomenal game. One of the first competitive games I've got into in the last few years. It's like playing Tug O War in Starcraft but with a more simplified resource system. There is a lot of depth to how to really make your cards work for you in the best way possible as well. 

Easy to play but there is a lot of depth here. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do down the road. 

The best part is, this game is totally free to play as well. Plenty of ways to be able to make the cards you want without having to tug a slot machine for 3 hours, spending your life savings just to get a viable deck. Just for that alone, I am most likely going to be dropping some money on the game to support the devs for a proper free to play and 'lootbox' model."
15684,Stop advertising in my inventory.
15685,really cool game and if you know the background of the developer it is even cooler. Keep the cool work up
15686,"simple but fun and addictive...very impressed
"
15687,Is very fun game. I Like very much. Simple for my brain.
15688,Very good
15689,SERVER TIME OUT. EVERY. FCKING. TIME.
15690,Quite enjoyable
15691,"Awesome game so far, remind me of Battle Royal on mobile phone."
15692,Nice game! I recommend you to download and try it. It's 1 of the best games on Steam :) Good job BetaDwarf
15693,Love it
15694,Its simple enough to pick up and go
15695,the game is oddly funny and a very satisfying game to pass the time!!!
15696,"thx for the game
no need pay for pack
get free pack from game and alienware giveaway"
15697,Great card game!
15698,"Pay-to-win, snowbally."
15699,"[i]review possibly outdated due to several game updates[/i]

[h1][b]8/10[/b][/h1]
[b]It's actually a surprisingly good game.[/b]

It doesnt feel like merely a mobile game. While the basic gameplay is indeed simple, there seem to be a lot of intricacies regarding deckbuilding, positioning, timing, tactics and strategy.

For someone who has played a lot of Gwent, Hearthstone, Artifact, etc., but no Clash of Kings or Clash Royale, the gameplay is really fresh. The deckbuilding aspect is also very unusual. In games like Gwent and Hearthstone, a certain meta of two to five top tier netdecks settles a few weeks in from each release. Any deviation from these top decks is suboptimal and any tech choices are often a sacrifice in overall power or versatility. But balance seems to work different in Minion Masters. Every card is viable, given context. There is more emphasis on card use rather than pure deckbuilding and matchups. Certain cheesy decks can take you by surprise, but very rarely I've though ""I lost because he had a better deck"" or ""my deck is bad"", more often than not I lost due to poor strategical choices.

A commonly voiced concern is if this game is Pay to Win, but it seems to not be.
There is no direct way to gain advantage by paying real money. Any gameplay content is realistically unlockable by play. Much like in any card game, getting a full collection is an effort, either through a grind or by opening up your wallet, but it is doable and definitely does not involve several hundreds of hours or dollars. The game is generous for beginners, and after three days of playing, I've obtained about 90 out of 160ish cards. There are no essential cards that are particularly expensive and guarantee a severe advantage. In fact, my starting deck with a few adjustments has been the most powerful and reliable deck I've had so far.

Minion Masters misses out on some points due to the weird choice of art direction, flimsy and cluttered Main Menu and swarm of slightly frustrating errors (server issues and whatnot), but nevertheless it's a game worth your time."
15700,easy and not taking too much time to finish each match
15701,Its a fun f2p game but it has a ton of pay to win microtranactions in it
15702,I AM THE MASTER OF ALL THE MINIONS I AM A SKELETON AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY TOMBSTONES DO ALL I DO IS HIT QWER WHEN THEY POP UP AND HOPE I WIN A+++++++++++++++++
15703,Love it
15704,hearthstone without the snorefest
15705,Alot of potential
15706,Easy and fun. Lots of avenues to learn from and they push furthering your education about the game.
15707,Fun game. Chill. Worth a download.
15708,"Easy to pick up, way more fun and clean game play than 90% of similar mobile type games"
15709,"Great game - all the best aspects done well. Cards, Tower Defense and MOBA."
15710,"If you're a fan of Clash Royale and other such games you'll like this, solid mechanics so far and good troop diversity!"
15711,"oke
"
15712,Great game
15713,"A very fun game to play with your friends or solo, its basically Clash Royale for the PC with improved graphics and not pay-to-win, which is a big plus."
15714,"This is just out right fun, My daughters love the pink fella with his top hat and mustache."
15715,Recommended
15716,fun
15717,Мне очень нравится эта игра
15718,"vERY ADDICTIVE, EASY TO PLAY AND you dont lose very offen jajajaja nice matching"
15719,"Great game, reminds me of Clash Royale."
15720,Not ready for release. Fun concept but not very well balanced. Snowball effect in every game with no contention. UI is not very fitting for the game. Unfortunately none of these issues compare to the constant disconnects in every aspect of the game from queuing to simply opening a menu.
15721,"Played for a bit, so far so good.  Will update after I hit the paywall!"
15722,Dope
15723,Strategy games.
15724,i PWN NOOBS
15725,very fun!!!
15726,"Not to far into but the games are short and fun, great game if don't have hours of the day to spend gaming"
15727,"I was realyl surprised by how much I love this game. It is easy to learn, the characters are well made and diverse. I hope they keep it coming!"
15728,"Addictive good game but way too many frustrating defeat due to lag or disconnect.
Also I think there are too many bots which gets you win streak."
15729,"the game is fun because you need to think in advance. 

just one problem, there is no group chat in game"
15730,Awesome!!! great game to play with friends
15731,"I have never played a game like this before, this was very beginner friendly and doesn't hold your hand. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get into these types games and masters at these types of games."
15732,"If you know Clash of Clans, it's very familiar, yet it has some major uniques to it that makes it a great free to play game."
15733,Incredibly fun
15734,"Basically clash royale or whatever mobile game that has been cloned a million times. What make it better is increasing card tiers doesn't increase the power of it (less pay2win), and its coop mode is a lot of fun to play."
15735,Fun game
15736,"Servers are a bit spotty at the moment, but they did just launch, so I'm sure it'll get fixed. The game itself is fun though."
15737,Fun game so far
15738,Not bad so far
15739,So far so good! Has a pretty polished feel. Not sold on the streaming angle but I'm sure it will help keep this game in the lime light a bit longer and help it from being dead on launch.
15740,"If you like strategy games like Clash Royal, you'll love this game :)"
15741,"Feels like a great mix between hearthstone and Clash Royale (Haven't played it, but as far as I can tell, they stem from the same gene pool). Fun characters, solid voiceover, passable visuals, ragdoll on everything... needless to say, it's a wild ride that I won't be getting off of very soon."
15742,Great game!! Very fun to play. :D I m enjoying it very much.
15743,Good.
15744,"The game is fun very addicting and fun to play with your friends.
"
15745,"Yes, I am enjoying this game.  interested to see where it leads! I really, really enjoy co-op options.  

What I don't like is the fact I'm overwhelmed with all the options out of the gate."
15746,Cool
15747,It is the most bestest coolestest thing in the worlds evaaaaa!
15748,"fun game, wants to play more to see whats next, enjoyable battles"
15749,dope
15750,funny
15751,awesome game great graphics and game play
15752,"Its fast, and fun."
15753,Fun game
15754,:-)
15755,Love the game only wish there were fewer currencies to purchase more in game loot.
15756,great game top notch
15757,AWESOME GAME
15758,gud gaem
15759,i click and stuff happens. i like it
15760,Fun and easy to pick up. Nice bit of strategy without to high a learning curve. Quick addictive matches matching you against equally skilled/experienced opponents. I won my first 2 matches with starter cards! WOO HOO
15761,Yeet
15762,Great quick game! Lots of replay-ability!
15763,It is like hearthstone but good and without the bullshit
15764,"Clash Royal, but not pay to win and no chinks"
15765,Reminds me of an old Starcraft arcade game. Not of everything going on but the game is fun
15766,Nice game to pass time.  Minions designs are fun and well animated.
15767,Seems fun up to level 10. I can't tell if it becomes pay to win.
15768,addicted after 5 mins
15769,I liked being able to see top 150 GM so i could net deck. Top 20 isn't enough. But other then that the game is one of my favorite games out there.
15770,fun just like clash royale
15771,fast paced easy to learn simply put fun!
15772,Fun game to just pick up and play a few rounds
15773,Pretty fun so far!
15774,Pretty darn fun. It can be a little overwhelming visually at start but in the gameplay it's pretty clear what you can and cannot do. Very easy to just jump in and do enjoyable things. Definitely has depth and a lot to do. Seems pretty fair FTP so far.
15775,good game easy to get into hard to master
15776,Fun and pretty intuitive.
15777,"Seems fun so far and doe not look like it is pay to win, so that's good!"
15778,Pretty fun so far
15779,"If you liked clash of clans, this game is so much better. Also is very F2P friendly."
15780,Fun
15781,not a bad game realy fun wish the load time for the monsters was a bit faster but other then that im enjoying the game
15782,is fun? Yes!
15783,nice
15784,Fun and very smooth transition into multiplayer
15785,"Summon the things and stuff...and the stuff and things

It's clash royale; but actually good"
15786,"Took the mobile game formula. but made a PC game. It works pretty well, but possibly only because free to play seems very rewarding. I'm a card game addict, and this scratches the itch that hearthstone hasn't for a while, and artifact never did."
15787,"Game Plays just like that Clash of Clans, BUT there is so much more to it than that. With Champions helping out your minons and good Combos come out with different cards and Masters, I love this game as is."
15788,"cool game

edit 2020:

Too many pay to win players in high rank....

why.... :("
15789,"Good game, fun mechanics, really good intro"
15790,Dad came home and didn't have cigarettes
15791,simple yet deep. good for a relaxing time and a break from the more hard core games.
15792,SICK
15793,"First impressions, this is a fun fast-paced game with light strategy elements. I usually don't like PVP type games, but this one is so fast and straightforward I find myself not getting stressed at all. At the same time though, there is a remarkable amount of depth. Definitely feels like a simple to learn hard to master kinda thing. Regardless, it is F2P and makes for fun, short games. Definitely worth a look."
15794,You had me at Wood League.
15795,Good
15796,"I've only been playing for a about an hour, but while it's easy to pick up there is definitely depth to the tactics. I have yet to dig into the battle pass and paid content, but so far the free stuff is fun!"
15797,Easy to get into. Very fun so far
15798,Good game pretty fun to play casually
15799,Good stuff.
15800,pretty fun game blue golem op
15801,I can be the undead summoner I always dreamt of being
15802,Another phone game.  Similar to many out there.  It's a grind or pay to win however you want to look at it.  Same thing different day.
15803,i like this game more than clash royal. there is so much we can do on this game. i still have to explore more this game has to offer. keep up the good work
15804,"The simplicity of this is really appealing! But the paymodel is so frustraiting to be honest, it is confusing. And that's just mho but ""claptrap"" was the reason I turned down VO. Also english VO is weird. Also Really fun! :)"
15805,"Very easy to play
Easy to understand for casuals also.
Quite fun, considering that this game still requires some strategy planning although its quite a no-brainer.

There's decklist websites so I guess that makes this game pretty official.
Will recommend it to hordes of folks.
Must play."
15806,"muito bom
"
15807,awesome game great graphics~
15808,"The gameplay is quick and fun, with more depth than I initially thought. The tutorial system is really cool in that it slowly rolls things out."
15809,"Feels like battleforge, ive missed battle forge. Its also fast, fun and interactive."
15810,fun so far
15811,"Fun times, fun times. Really digging the game. Easy to get into, fun to play and I'm able to get in, have a few quick games fast and without trouble."
15812,Fun game
15813,easy to learn and motivating to play
15814,its good. Kills time
15815,Nice
15816,"Addictive, simple fun. Reminiscent of certain WC3 customs."
15817,fun game
15818,fun game
15819,"Very addictive game, with simple mechanic but still tactical and fun! 10+"
15820,"Fun game. Very casual, very easy to learn. A+ because it's free."
15821,NICE GAME TO ENJOY ALONE OR DUO WITH FRIEND
15822,Pretty fun
15823,Fun. like that Clash Of the Clans game but more realistic and less pressure to buy.
15824,xdxd seems fun
15825,it is good
15826,"really nice chil game
"
15827,"So far so good, fun game."
15828,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15829,"This game plays just as advertised. Pretty intense, enjoyable, looks very nice. The deck building element is fun too! There is some issues with errors at this point in time, but i expect that is just because of the influx of new players after release. So far the errors haven't actually ruined anything, just sort of elicit an ""aw"" reaction. Given that it's FTP, and they gave us 2 very tasty DLCs off the bat, i'm giving this game a big thumbs up...the developers obviously care about it very much, and the road to its creation was pretty epic. Therefore i can assume they're going to work hard to make sure their new baby is immaculate once they've sorted out these minor issues. Thanks to the guys at Betadwarf, and i look forward to grinding the heck out of Minion Masters!"
15830,Seems fun.
15831,"The game across as casual, and can be treated as so, but also seems to have significant depth so far! Very enjoyable, with great personality!"
15832,+1 for bridge capturing Kirby
15833,"A super fun free-to-play game! It is like Hearthstone in a lot of ways, but I find it much more fun and mindless. A lot of fun with friends and online team battles!

(edit) - PLEASE fix the servers! Playing ranked matches and then getting disconnected right before or after a win/loss is killing the experience and my rating! If this persists, then I'll be changing my thumbs up to a thumbs down followed by an uninstall!"
15834,great game!
15835,"*Reviewing this as of v1.0.3*

Outstanding, as a former professional MOBA and FPS games player and coach, this is getting me pretty comfortable except for some timeouts and connection problems in general. I really enjoy how for every level you get a reward, regardless of being insignificant or minimum; I find it something that maybe other videogames should apply as well, makes the gameplay way more didactic and lets the player gain pride of his advancement.
 Loving the art type, reminds me to Hi-Rez games, mostly SMITE. Can't talk about anything more, haven't played so much."
15836,great game i really enjoy the gameplay and how its set.
15837,Like Shartifart but actually fun. Also free.
15838,So far so good
15839,"Unfortunately this game crashes all the time I start it on a high end computer. Not playable at all
"
15840,I just love the concept :)
15841,"Fun and addicting gameplay, The characters and Graphics pop with me. I like it!"
15842,"ITs simples but quite a fun game
It has its faults but it is understandable with such a game"
15843,"Fun, fast-paced, awesome time killer."
15844,Simple and appealing!
15845,It's like Clash Royale for more strategic minds
15846,Fun fun fun woop!
15847,Gud game.
15848,super fun!
15849,"Was looking for a game to hold me over til classic wow, I really enjoy the execution of this game.  Reminds me of the old school MTG video game.  Would love more single player content even tho PvP is the main focus of the game, but besides that it rocks."
15850,"Great game so far, not hard to get to grips with and a lot of fun."
15851,g
15852,"Great game, really easy to get into (so far) unlike some of these card based games that I enjoy but find a bit mind blowing - quick to get games too. Good fun!"
15853,Great game so far (few hours in). I like that you can also buy all heroes for $20
15854,Great quick game! Lots of replay-ability!
15855,"fun game but is hangs every fucking second
"
15856,"Great game, if you like Clash Royale on steroids this is right up your alley."
15857,"It is a lot of fun, without being overwhelming"
15858,easy time killer.
15859,"If you liked Clash Royale on mobile, this is similar, but without the p2w side of it. Very fun!"
15860,"Game used to be good when it was not free to play, but after that it turned downhill

It feels like developers quit this game at this point.

I didnt play this game for year so I expected some new cards and maybe few masters. Well there were like 2 new cards and 0 masters.

Not working report system, 2v2 afkers are absolutely normal and developers are praysing them instead of punishing, constant visual bugs (minions sliding instead of walking, weird purple glitches when opening tokens, etc.)

New expansions are only bringing overpowered cards that make older ones absolutely useless. 
There is still non ranked game mode

I hope this game is going to end up like apb reloaded that ruined 2 companies and is about to kill 3d 
(game that is very, very, very slowly dying)"
15861,GAME'S FUN
15862,Just Amazing .........................
15863,Is fun to play ...and even when you loose you still get experience
15864,great
15865,Easy and fun to play! I love the references!
15866,awesome game!
15867,"Pretty great, especially the free content!"
15868,Pay to win
15869,This game fills the missing void you've been longing for. I made an in-game purchase just for the sheer support of the development team. This is how you release a game!
15870,feels alot like clash royale but better
15871,"fun and fast
"
15872,Very fun! Super awesome!
15873,5/5
15874,Simple to learn and fun.
15875,Card games feels like clash royale
15876,"no concede option
no chance to change name
stupid matches u dont know why u loose or win just feels so random"
15877,"Great game, fun to play, good mechanics, looks great."
15878,Update: Having played again after quite some time they seemed to have balanced the game a lot better. I can recommend giving it a try now.
15879,i like my boney bois 10/10
15880,"This game es muy bueno
"
15881,Really nice game. Simple and interesting
15882,just is so fun.thats is clash royal for pc:)
15883,"
Mixture of magic cards and dota... its good"
15884,Good game
15885,enjoyable
15886,"I see the strategy, loads of collectables, interesting mechanics, fast paced, feels fun to beat another human.."
15887,"fast paced, great looking and really enjoyable"
15888,The game is great fun and easy to get into. Hopefully keeps me interested. Good Game!
15889,Honestly I love the references this game has character where clash doesn't.
15890,So many cool features and Seeing guilty spark switch careers and find happiness is great.
15891,i mean its cerainly not a new kind of game but it def feels like its a bit more polished than others by far. I do like however that the minions have a set health so they cannot be upgraded or anything like the sort makes it kind of equal playing ground.
15892,pretty fun for free
15893,"An easy and addictive game, great for killing time"
15894,I win always
15895,"excellent strategy/card game, great free to play, recommend people try, wish player base was larger but they keep updating it and it gets more fun"
15896,No Linux Support
15897,"with roughly 1.3k hours registered game time I can only say that I like it

I've got it in one of the humble bundles (I think) a few years back - one of the games I thought I'd never touch.
Yes, they have bugs - but its a good game and the community is mostly nice

edit: 1.6k hours, battle passes keeps it entertaining. The game is not P2W - I have never paid an extra buck over what I got during the humble bundle."
15898,It's ok.
15899,"
Like Clash Royale, but with a little (good) added complexity."
15900,So far the game is quite enjoyable and makes you want to play more.
15901,a ok game to play a few h a day
15902,"Easy to learn, tricky to master - loads of fun and no need to buy anything.  Not pay to win at all."
15903,"Ну пока что нармес, не понятно только на сколько решает донат"
15904,its ice cold!
15905,Big scam. When you start they put you up against bots and very bad players.. after you spend money... they put you against people with god mode decks. Biggest scam game ever.
15906,A blast so far and def not p2w at all.
15907,"I really love this game i play it all the time great pass time wish they had it on phone also cuz id be on it 24/7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwbSJAGHojg"
15908,More addictive than any drug and I’ve tried them all.
15909,Its look like many stuff going be behind paying wall but if you want to play it casualy. Its fine game and relaxing for now on (review after 2 hours of playing
15910,"Loving that this has a 2v2 mode and you can strategize properly with a friend, seems to be still getting frequent updates and definitely not a p2w system that i see in place (cards don't get stronger based on the amount you have you can just put more than one in your deck at a time)"
15911,F2P gamebetter than clash royale :)
15912,very good game
15913,when i was younger i played clash royale and this is a copy it but better gafhics and on pc
15914,Really fun game so far. Can't wait to see all the units!
15915,"Easy to learn, fun and free to play :)"
15916,I AM NEW TO THE GAME AND ENJOYING IT SO FAR
15917,"I am impressed. Ive been playing this for like 30 minutes and I am already quite hooked,"
15918,its a very good multi player game i would recommend it to any one ok its got ingame transactions but now a days which games dont for free id give it a 8/10
15919,"The game is fast paced and engaging, seems like easy to learn but hard to master."
15920,nice
15921,Just Awesome!
15922,"This is a relatively simple game that has just enough to keep it exciting while also having a good element of skill available not just pure RNG. It is not P2W as many free games are, you can pay for in game stuff with $$$ however many of the good cards are cheap. You are able to earn coins, shards and rubies from playing matches, doing quests and achievements which will let you buy cards and tokens. A nice game to hop on and play a few matches right quick or to sink 12 hours into going for Grandmaster Rank."
15923,is coo i guess
15924,Aight
15925,"This game is very enjoyable! This is NOT a pay-to-win like other games we know that are for free... I just started this game today and already I found 3 Supreme cards out of chests!! This game is not lagging in anyway, it is very balanced when you play against other players."
15926,goodgame
15927,Skeleboners for days
15928,Alright game play and some decent deck building. Base hero and deck is actually pretty solid and can carry you to a decent rank. Once you get to platinum you start running into pay to win aspects.
15929,"With all the twitch streaming functions, looks like a winner for pro gamers and their fans.  Im not a huge MOBA fan(yet), not even sure with that genre entails other than I am utter crap at that other one, the big one that everyone plays.  Give MM a go, its free, funny and fun."
15930,"Great game, simmilar to clash royale. fun with friends"
15931,Good fun card game. Still has a few bugs but fun to play and carefully designed.
15932,"Simple concept, relative success available for F2P players."
15933,"So easy to pick up and play, a bunch of fun."
15934,A better version of Clash Royale.
15935,As a free to play game its very good. Its still a free to play game but its entertaining.
15936,Its a fking awesome game!!!
15937,"Fun game. I used to play tower defense games as a kid but this base rush/defense type is more enjoyable for some reason. Do try it out if you get the chance.
There are a lot of free packs you can get on the reddit forums for this game and i highly recommend you check that out.
Wish this had an android version instead of xbox tbh, it suits phones more than consoles."
15938,IDK how it is addictive! It's like a Defense Tower and Card game in one!
15939,"Wonder if this gonna get port to mobile. 
It fun, addictive gameplay esp when play with buddies 
the match is take 2-10 minute long 
"
15940,"Easy to learn, fun to play, but gets boring quickly. And once you quit, there isn't much that brings you back. The season resetting every month didn't help either. However, I would recommend giving it a couple of hours if you're into card games."
15941,Sick game
15942,"This is definitely unlike anything I've ever played before, it kind of reminds me of Heroes of Might & Magic, but overall the gameplay is very straightforward, fun and most of all enjoyable. Plus the graphics are decent for such an undemanding game. Has the potential of becoming a  big E-sports title."
15943,moce game
15944,"Polished game, nice so far!"
15945,"A fun and instantly accessable FTP game that feels like Hearthstone with a RTS upgrade. The learning curve is light, it's varied, colourful, and so far, it feels as if it's certainly lacking any PTW element as I'm getting pretty far on base unlocks alone (including the free pack available on the library)."
15946,cool little game with great potential!
15947,cool
15948,Pretty fun!
15949,NOT BAD GAME IT YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME TIME TO WASTE WITH YOUR KIDS OR WATEVER!
15950,Great game. Better if you play with friends so invite them to install the game and play.
15951,it was nice but why so many bugs?
15952,"Decided to try this game on a whim. End up playing for 7 hours straight lol
It's easy to get into and so far it doesn't seem pay to win."
15953,Pretty fun game. It's literally desktop Clash Royale lol
15954,good game
15955,fun game
15956,"awesum 
"
15957,"So far it's been pretty fun.  Seems to be able to appeal to a casual audience looking to kill time, and also a hardcore audience with many mechanics to consider."
15958,fun game!
15959,Fun and interesting game! Just getting into it so time will tell if it's worth buying the Masters pack.
15960,this games humor is great it feels so satisfying to play all around :D
15961,Great Game
15962,"Minion Masters had captivated me. I started making youtube videos and streaming this game.  Im really loving it. Its fun, co.plex and competitive. The Dev are humans and generous. Thanks."
15963,I like coop and
15964,Fun Game!
15965,Its Good
15966,"Saw Kripparian stream this on TwitchTV gave it a try and I've been enjoying it. It's not bad for the lower levels, but I'm sure it will get more challenging higher up. The death ray werewolf is pretty sweet and my favorite unit so far."
15967,Its great and a MASSIVE amount of fun
15968,A card game with minions! Lots of fun :)
15969,"The game apparently locks out the ability to exit/quit the game until you reach a certain level. Up to that point, you have to use Alt+F4 or similar method. Then you never have to start the game again."
15970,Really fun. Its like a mix of Clash Royale and League of Legends. For it being a free to play id recommend
15971,game is a great take on an undervalued model!
15972,so fun
15973,fun little game
15974,"its like clash royale but you dont have to spend money to upgrade ur f'n cards, and its on pc so its not a POS"
15975,free stuff sometimes
15976,game is decent servers are absolute shit
15977,it told me to do this and yeah
15978,Level 10 and great rewards and got a starter code so far not a p2p game but better yet a clash royal for PC instead <3
15979,Fun
15980,"So, I'm addicted to clash royale. If you don't know what that is it's a mobile game that's like an overhead view of this game. So, I love this already. Just a couple of hours in. I don't know how the card progression works so I might hate it in a little while but for now, I'm hooked. If it goes full on P2W I'll never play it again, just saying."
15981,This game gives me a murder boner
15982,"Just trying  the game for a few hours, but if they keep making improvements it will be a great strategy game.  I  hope they add more stuff and improve the server"
15983,"the game is fun to play need some strategy + combos and its not easy to master it :D
"
15984,Yeah. It's a good game. Big whoop.
15985,"Started playing for the first time tonight, and I love the strategy involved.  The big thing that puts this game apart from others is the progression.  You feel like there is a lot of content to keep playing for, yet it's not ""grinding""."
15986,awesome game. dont like the fact that the free keys they give you are for another game that costs 20$ at that. but the overall exp on the game has been a positive one for me. give it go !
15987,Im really liking how you can earn things outside of digging into your pocket all the time its nice wooot finally a game that doesent dig your wallet the whole time
15988,fun
15989,"its a fun game where you build army and attempt to stomp the enemy, if you like deck building games you should get it"
15990,"I really enjoy it. I played similar summon strategy games which I quite enjoyed. This game has great graphics, good strategy and wonderful interplay. There is no wait or energy requirement so the progress potential seems limitless."
15991,Good game.
15992,"game is good for the time i have played
"
15993,fun
15994,fun game
15995,highly relaxing yet keeps your attention
15996,"Whoever made this pile of shit, is a braindead retard."
15997,"Still too early to know for sure, but very slick and polished design so far.  Not sure if it is too money dependent yet... I'm only level 10... but a good start!"
15998,"Fast paced, nuanced gameplay. Great sound effects and voice over. This game has a ton of charm and is really easy to pick up and hit the ground running."
15999,"VERY GOOD
"
16000,This game is surprisingly addictive.  Let's see if it holds up over the long run.
16001,Just play it
16002,"It's quite F2P friendly, good fun."
16003,Horrible servers. Don't play it yet. You'll spend more time disconnecting and timing out than playing.
16004,Love it
16005,"frickin lit bois, get it, and then sell your kidneys for more m i n i o n s"
16006,"This game is awesome, even lets your stream interact with you. Who ever reads this i expect a follow @AmericanNinja on twitch"
16007,"
Great Game!"
16008,"fun so far, and i feel like its balanced enough so that it feels no stacked against me"
16009,badass
16010,"easy to play and to understand plus my left hand is broken atm....car accident, but i can play it with one hand not hard to figure out....great fun while im on medical leave thanks guys!"
16011,Its very easy to understand without loosing interesting strategies and most importantly it doesnt pressure you to buy anything and hands out rewards and almost every opportunity.
16012,Game seems fun. Bought the battle pass too. Not exactly a cheap game to play and there seems to be quite a high amount of pay to win from just looking through the store but that is not a concrete observation as more gameplay is required. The voice narrator in the game is so irritating and cringe worthy!
16013,"Good timewaster, not too greedy with unlocks like many others"
16014,"Pretty good game similar to Clash Royale, but like the fact that you have an avatar that influences the game and there are a lot more options to add to your deck as compared to Clash Royale."
16015,MMMmmmmmm acceptable.....
16016,"Just simple and easy to learn 
It's nice

"
16017,"Fun game for what it is.  Simple concept.  Does need more maps, and maybe variety of things in those maps.  Instead of just bridges, maybe have one where there is an area you fight over like King of the Hill, etc.  Not terribly pay to win, though it helps.  Less of a card game, and more of a strategy game, akin to arcade games on Starcraft II or Dota Autochess.

Will say, those who can't help themselves with shit like lootchests should stay away.  This is another game designed to prey on all the people who love gambling and opening chests and shit.  Pathetic capitalism at its finest."
16018,"Easy to learn, without being too over-simplified.Fast-paced, and fun."
16019,if you like clash royale or games like that you will like this game
16020,"fun game, unsure how deep the rabbit hole goes..."
16021,Remind of me of when Hearthstone just comes out!
16022,Très bien! Plein de récompenses. Avancement assez rapide pour le début. Reste à voir pour la suite. Espérant que ce n'est pas trop un pay to win kind of game. Thx
16023,Fun Game! Easy to play simple and enjoyable.
16024,Reminds me of the good old flash games. Do recommend.
16025,good
16026,"Really enjoyable,  so enjoyable in fact that my girlfriend left me! :)"
16027,Funny game
16028,simple fun and different
16029,Absolute trash game. Extremely P2W. Higher ranks are dominated by premade rush decks. PC SJW community.
16030,"i could see this game becoming an esports... similar gameplay to clash royale, but less frustrating for sure"
16031,"Got to level 10, been fun so far"
16032,"Fun casual game. This replaced Hearthstone in my rotation. Much more chill, and allows for a surprising amount of depth."
16033,Easy to start play. Nice early rewards. Fun to watch.
16034,Nice and fun !!!!
16035,Buenisimo juego
16036,"Lame, feels like another mobile game ported to pc."
16037,"Decent enough game,  plenty of mechanics and idea to keep the game going."
16038,Played for a awhile before it came to Steam. Glad to see it getting positive reviews as the community wasn't too populated back then. Dev's have definitely been putting in work on this game for awhile. Will update with 1.0 review later.
16039,"Easy learning curve, 5 minute games, hard to master. Great for short breaks."
16040,It's neat.
16041,cool game
16042,awesome game
16043,Game is neat so far. Will update.
16044,good game
16045,great game so far
16046,"This is a very fun and intuitive take on card games that fuses building a deck with live-action combat with AI-controlled minions. If you've ever played some card games in the StarCraft II Arcade, please come check this out!"

16055,MUITOP BOM
16056,:)
16057,"Dumbass little android game on PC but just as addictive. You collect dudes to send against the other guy's dudes so you can get more dudes to send against the other guy's dudes so you can get more dudes to send....

16072,"Games easy to pick up and play, learning curve is high but the gameplay is solid. Worth playing."
16073,very addictive
16074,"Nothing special feels like mobile, its a cool game to play with a friend when youre bored of all games, and I dont recommend because the servers are horrible, hard to buy power tokens, set to Ready to matchmake, game sometimes not connecting, server lagging at most times, I find myself restarting the game every 5 matches or less."
16075,...
16076,the battles are fun clash royal++ kinda
16077,"I like it, Its like summoners in WarCraft 3 FT. Think those players would like it. I like its fun game style too
Like pokemon
"
16078,Game is great
16079,"Developer cant think of game long term, every patch breaks things up. Always 2-3 decks, retarded meta."
16080,"really solid, fun and free2play. what else do you want? (its addictive so beware)."
16081,UwU
16082,"I love tug of war games and collectible card games, and the units seem to balance out the combat system making the options varied and effective depending on the player's style
great game"
16083,lvl 10...so far so good
16084,Great feeling to the game. Its smooth and creative. Maybe not for everyone but i suggest giving it a try.
16085,"Simple and easy to play. No card grinding for higher powered minions. All in all, an enjoyable PVP with short time frame matches."
16086,"When your ""Raft of Free"" comes lose, The Sharks appear.

P2W at it's worst."
16087,fun game ign 10/10
16088,Just to try it
16089,Seems cool thus far.  Simple and fun.  Kinda like a mini game.
16090,"Absolutely a blast to play, this free to play ccg is just that, FREE.There is a battlepass system but its only 9.99 so it is very worth getting. The art style is gorgeous, it is very easy to learn if youve played clash royale but with a lot more depth. Brilliant game"
16091,"Have only spent a few minutes playing  so far, but am definitely enjoying it!  Fast paced battles so far all under 5 minutes each"
16092,so far so good
16093,Fun time waster. Matches are pretty fast and low stakes.
16094,i used to play this game all the time but now for some reason it wont launch anymore
16095,"good game and fun enough
but need immediately to fix connection issue

--------------------------------------------------
fun become annoying becoz keep disconnect"
16096,Pretty entertaining first hour into the game; bringing mobile to PC lol
16097,Good game!
16098,"I got asked to do this review only an hour or so into playing so I cant go very deep. I'm always very sceptical towards clash royale clonse, but this one took the concept and did a good PC port of it."
16099,Very fun
16100,Pretty good.
16101,I love this game style
16102,"Pretty unique/interesting game - so far for sure grabs attention, wondering which direction the game goes!"
16103,"LIKE USE OF CARDS  USE OF PICK, GUARDS WELL WINS IN SHORT TIMELY WIN GAME PAYS GREAT  - AND USE OF HONEST PLAY BACK 
DISLIKES SO FAR CANT FIND ANY.."
16104,it's fun card game....and a bit of stategis
16105,Fun
16106,"Short, fun matches. Usually matches are over in under 5 minutes"
16107,its quick and fun
16108,"First saw about you guys on imgur. Favorite and forget, time goes by.........checking out free to play, and BAM. Double check for the weird studio name and yup. How could I not give it a try. Loving it so far, but a wee bit early for me to give a real review."
16109,free and fun. pretty simple.
16110,Fun hearthstoney feel
16111,"Not bad so far, will see if i have to update later."
16112,fun
16113,"Easy to pick up and play. Enjoyable and low stress multiplayer, which is rare."
16114,"This game is like a mash up of card games and RTS, it's really fun! There is also a two headed giant mode which is huge for me and my friend as we like to play together a lot. It's free right now but I'm thinking I'm going to give them some money because this is a great idea, and I would like to see it taken further :)"
16115,"Review date 26.5.2019
Good game. Played myself to platinum straight after starting the game. At Gold 1+ people really knew how to play the game.

Plusses:
NOT PAY TO WIN
Lanespawner game
Unique races / heros
Best time while playing Co-op.
Games can be really fast or max 10 mins and feel intensive from start to finish.
Campaign mode of some sorts.
Guilds

Minuses:
Solo playing becomes tedious after a while.
Games become repetetive

Suggestions:
Would like to see more RPG elements on the ""champions"". I want to be able to customize my gameplay to my style more. Give the champions perks maybe?


Will definately be back for this one when it evolves more. For now, I`ll skip it for sometime because during the time I spent in the game I was unable to communicate with anyone, thus being unable to get any gaming buds in the game. Shame... I really wouldve liked to play this game more. But Maybe later. :)"
16116,"Fun, add more cards :)
"
16117,"Minion management? Yes. Well built game? Yes. Great start? Hell yes.
I'm excited for more of this game."
16118,Very FUN!
16119,The game is nice and easy to play.
16120,Enjoyable card minion battler
16121,"Well, first of all I wasn't quiet sure if I'm gonna like the game or not. Usually I tend to  go right pass these  kind of games yet for some reason it cought my eyes so I downloaded it and ya all can bet I didn't regret it.

I feel like the cards are well balanced out and it really depends on your play style if you either win or loose.

So far I am on a winning streak more than a loosing one but  only because I'm patient.

The graphics of the game is the best, never change it seriously.

Character wise, I'm hoping to see more characters in the game though I'm yet to unlock my 1st champion. The tempo of the game feels just  right, not too rushy not too slow."
16122,Yes I am enjoying the game so far.
16123,yes :D
16124,YOU DID SO GOOD GUYS I LIKE THIS GAME
16125,rn its fun no feel  pay to win
16126,"Great game! Was really surprised by how fun it was. Will definetaly be playing it more in the days to come! If you've got nothing to do, give this game a go :)"
16127,Fun quick exciting!
16128,Great game :D
16129,love it
16130,I enjoy the fact that collecting cards is for the battle pass and not for leveling them up to do more damage. It is great to see that this game is balanced and not pay to win. I like the fact that there are cosmetic items that can be purchased. The hero system and cards are all interestingly made with fun tactic options. I would like to see different skins for the towers that the heroes sit on as well as more emotes :)
16131,I am really impressed how fun is this game so far.
16132,"its like clash royale but without the chinese spyware
10/10"
16133,"Easy to learn, fun."
16134,Pretty cool. Quick and easy to understand. Nothing too OP so far. SO FAR......
16135,"I rarely leave any reviews, But this game is very fun and has a great tempo."
16136,lots of fun
16137,"This game is so fun and exciting to play. Its not complicated at all and it feels so amazing to win. If you want a game that is easy to pick up and will leave you coming back and back and back, try this game."
16138,Awesome game!  Very entertaining!  :)
16139,It's nice.
16140,this game and how its done just wow
16141,Nice!
16142,"I find it pretty fun, not overly complicated but has enough depth in the deck making to keep it interesting."
16143,this game is very cool with their gameplay and design. however subtitles would be nice
16144,Very nice!
16145,good game
16146,Fun game. Can't wait to see how they continue to update.
16147,"Funny narator, funny card description, funny gameplay. What more do you want ?"
16148,Great Great game!
16149,This is a game that myself and my fiance have played since Beta:D It is just getting better and better:D
16150,Excelente
16151,"so far so good
"
16152,iz fun for now. remake of old sc2 custom map
16153,"Very fun game, seems to have good F2P model, quick games. Reminiscent of WC3/SC2 tower defense games, but with a CCG twist."
16154,"is good game eventho from non AAA developer, if you like clash royale, you should try this game.
my score 8/10 for overall"
16155,"While I love the game, I just cant give a thumbs up when the servers are constantly crashing, having timeouts or just bugging out how ever it wants.

Drafting sounded fun, but was never able to start one up, because I couldnt even draft a deck without the game telling me that ""there was a server info error"" than it reset my card picks and I just stayed in that infinite loop until the game freaked out and started to give me different cards for draft pick and finally crashed.

Multiplayer doesnt work half the time. You get disconnected from the main server a LOT of times. And yes, my internet connection is great anywhere else.

Also the games economy is kinda messed up too. 1 Supreme card (Epic rarity) costs 500 shards to create, while a legendary card costs 2000. WTF? You need to play like 50 something hours to be able to craft 1 legendary card if you are a free to play player. Thats EA style of grinding requirements. Most of the legendary's also pretty powerful. 

You get a bunch of bonuses left and right during your first 20 lvls, but after that it slows down a TON. And yes even with those bunch of rewards, you are only able to gather around 700 shards. 

Its a fun little game, but right now the servers are a joke, and if you want to make any progress you need to fork up some good money."
16156,"My suggestions for this company; 

*A lot of bugs still right there in game.. 
*Servers Stability..
*Balancing about matchmaking
*Premade teams joining random team matches
*Fix a lot of unbalanced cards
*Serious penalty for leavers
*Unranked queue
*More report options (Troll-Griefing etc)
*Players do not have to send you a demo. (For review complaints)
*More rewards for battlepass+experience (Dont be lazy and do not turn this game massive grinding)
*Make a website like popular decks etc. It should be official. People can check it and gives vote etc.
* More Achievements
* Game should be playing like A technique-based system. Not memorization

This game have potential. Do not fail please. If you read thanks..

Also you can check my channel : https://www.twitch.tv/blastryan"
16157,Fun and free to play. Reminds me of Clash Royale on the mobile.
16158,das Spiel gefällt mir sehr
16159,strangely addicting...
16160,It's fun so far
16161,"The battle is good and so far no one is trolling. Lots of options.
"
16162,"Pretty fun game, games are fast and exciting."
16163,"great game  really enjoying it
"
16164,"love it good fun
"
16165,This game is actually pretty fun so far
16166,"Came into this game expecting a shallow mobile game experience, but I am pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is very simple to learn but has a lot of depth under the surface. This is a great game with a quick pace and short matches. I definitely recommend it, and at the time of this review there is a free DLC on steam."
16167,fun maybe :D
16168,"So far, im quite liking this game. Easy control, cool characters and their animations, all looking great. Great work for making this game BetaDwarf! And anyway, i hope you guys will be a successfull game developer at the future! ^^"
16169,I have being playing 2 hours now. The animations are very good. it's easy to hand on. you can battle by yourself either team. It's not pay for win so far. wish it will never.
16170,I love this game so fun and works with my Twitch chat cannot ask for more!
16171,the game is fun for me so far :)
16172,A strategy game that is not too intense.
16173,Fun little game that is alot like Clash Royale but way less p2w :)
16174,"Fun so far, I'll update later"
16175,big skeleton i gib money
16176,Matchmaking is terrible.
16177,I like!
16178,Seems good enough so far
16179,"Addicting, fun, and ADDICTING!"
16180,Very addicted
16181,Nothing special
16182,Simple and enjoyable game
16183,wow really enjoying the game so far. it just sucks you in and you cant stop playing.
16184,its a quicky of the best sorts.
16185,"The Bad:
-Horrible/Outdated UI & Mobile game look-a-like. Absolutely not user-friendly.
-Unable to cancel game search sometimes so I am forced to join a match.
-I get weird server errors while exiting a match (even sometimes just at the main menu) even though everything works fine, all my rewards are processed and claimed.
-The audio quality is very poor and low.
-There is a suspicious webpage which was blocked by my Internet Security (No other game as ever done this. I demand an explanation from the developers) after starting the game for the very first time. (ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

The Good:
The graphics are great.
The idea and gameplay is very well executed.
Matchmaking is very quick as well as the game itself.
Cool variety with the heroes as well as the minions.
Hopefully the game will get revamped with the future updates cause it needs to be much more optimized.

P.S: Running alright (Medium FullHD) with Nvidia GeForce 740m. 
"
16186,"If you enjoyed clash royale, you will enjoy this!"
16187,wooohooo makes fun
16188,"The style is great, and each minion is good"
16189,"Interesting synthesis of a couple of common genres, the collectible card game mixed with mobile gaming rts (no control over units, they just walk forward and fight stuff they see). pretty decent tutorial, quick games, fairly easy to understand mechanics."
16190,I Like!
16191,great fun game especially to play with a friendhttps://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/489520#
16192,I dont normally play games like this but i have to say that its allot of fun.
16193,short and sweet! really fun game
16194,Very enjoyable game i really have fun playing it.its very simple and neat.Easy to understand + easy to play -> easily to have fun.
16195,So far seems fun maybe ill update later after i play a bit more
16196,nice
16197,Awesome game! Awesome idea! Very enjoying it:)
16198,Simple but fun
16199,"such a good game, didn't play so much but hope it won't be buytowin game"
16200,"Clash royale, but then on pc, its verry fun!"
16201,"simple , fast and non time consuming
"
16202,minion masters. great free game for fast battles with a card game feel but with real life summoning of life minions who battle other minions and player to. so dont just sit there give it a try.
16203,basically like an upgraded version of clash royale which is not a bad thing!
16204,good game no need to spend money to have fun great if you only have an hour to play
16205,"This game has been a good rendition of tower defense style combat games and I've enjoyed it so far, I'm just starting out and I really hope that this isn't pay to win like other games similar to it."
16206,"Awesome mechanics, enjoyable and fair."
16207,great game. must try!
16208,"Fun to play, easy to learn"
16209,Because its fun and good for spending time :D
16210,"game is good,but internet connection is so bad,i have been failed by this sometimes,please fix your network."
16211,"Addictive and fun game, definitely worth a try!"
16212,"Easy to learn game that embraces the idea of being a commander throwing spells and minions at their opponent which is common among fantasy-themed collectible/trading card games. Haven't gotten particularly deep in yet so I can't vouch for its lasting entertainment, but so far it's been a pleasurable experience. The team battles are also a fun way to tweak the gameplay."
16213,"Clash Royale on PC.
Actually not bad."
16214,"fun game, if you like clash royale"
16215,good
16216,good game
16217,Lots of fun!
16218,Nice and simple Game!
16219,"My younger brother's played the game for a while now, but I never really gave it a fair shake. Not for any real reason; just had a lot of other games I was devoting my time to. After seeing the free DLC offer, I figured I'd give it a shot. The game's a ton of fun, and the different strategies for building your deck combined with your choice of master are pretty cool. For a free game, I wasn't expecting to feel as good about how much my decisions impact the game as opposed to how much of my wallet I've emptied into it, but it's surprised me so far."
16220,good
16221,Fun Card Game. Great Concept. Needs more stuff or in-game features. But its fun like Clash Royale
16222,100/10
16223,"Simple, Strategic, VERY Time Consuming. So far balanced, if you lose one too many times, you just need a new loadout, worked out in the end. 

Start out with a Rusher Loadout, rush enemies hard with low cost yet decent minions"
16224,not bad of a game...
16225,"Fun time killing but full of errors,crashes,timeouts and bugs. Game is also rly badly optimized so it will most likely overheat you pc does not mater what components you have..."
16226,Good mix of card based real time action strategy
16227,I recommend this game
16228,"Long had I dreamed for a ccg that had it all. This does, in spades.

This is the one."
16229,"ok game, but they stream twitch on homepage and you can't turn it on. Screaming in pain asians is not fun."
16230,fun games... many card options nice combos. only playing an hour :-D
16231,Just great... Best royale game ever!
16232,The game is well balanced and properly setup.
16233,Nice game!
16234,love it.
16235,good
16236,its a nice game
16237,"gute animation sollte aber ein zusatz bonus system für partner spiele haben und einen story modus
ZB
Jeder Held hat eine Storyline die man durchspielen kann 60 missionen mit 3 verschiede Enden mit einem Karmischen system zb töte die wache oder betaübe oder vorbeischleichen"
16238,Not normally my style of game but I'm Loving this atm!! Worth a try if you are on the fence!
16239,"Awesome game a lot of fun and nice rewards :D
"
16240,"this game is awesome!
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Minion%20Mastershttps://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Minion%20Mastershttps://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Minion%20Masters"
16241,Havent had this much fun since Hearthstone release
16242,"Awesome game, I'm not into this kind of games ,I used to play only fps games but this one, I'm digging it :D"
16243,game makes a lot of fun :)
16244,Good free game
16245,Very fast paced and a lot of fun. It plays like a Clash Royale (mobile) type game. Easy to log on and play a couple matches or you can find yourself playing for hours.
16246,"Schnelle Spiele, viel Spaß!"
16247,It good game.
16248,"Easy to learn, great variety.  The loot box system has too much going on and interferes with play."
16249,Very quick initial progression and the gameplay is flashy and satisfying
16250,"Simple to grasp, fun to play, games are quick. After one hour I have no complaints. There are many cards I haven't seen however and there appears to be a lot of depth to the game's strategies."
16251,Fun so far and free
16252,Lets go!!!!
16253,"Eh, was fun for a few hours, but I quickly realised it's less about how you play your cards and more about how quickly you can throw a counter at something. There's no ""Oh, I'll save that card for later"" like most card games, meaning there is actually very little strategy. I won most games by playing a combination of three cards, Stun Lancers, Skeleton Horde and Daggerfall. Could probably be successful for quite a while with only those three cards in my deck"
16254,"awesome game and great tactics fun
"
16255,"I absolutely love this game. Very fun to play and it is easy to progress as a free to play. 
Although it is nice to support the devs."
16256,wonderful
16257,Fun and Fast matches I love this.
16258,"better than clash royale and most other card games that i've played, and i've just started playing it, so i'm expecting a lot more awesomeness from this game :)"
16259,Honestly this game is addicting and I will be streaming and playing this game constantly
16260,"Quick fun games, really like what this game has become."
16261,Clash Royale concept done right.
16262,"I play Clash Royal daily. If you enjoy that game then this game will click super fast. Its fun, immersive with headphones"
16263,"It's a fun game to pass the time with. Nothing too difficult to learn, really simple and that's a good thing!"
16264,"Good Game, Just give it a shot."
16265,Having tons of fun so far. It's like Clash Royale but without being  pay to win and with a ton more depth. It feels super generous with free progression - but I'm only 20ish levels in (and most f2p games are super generous when you start out).  Would give it an 8 out of 10. The biggest knock against it so far is that the servers seem very flaky. That may just be from an influx of new players (like me) who saw the free accursed expansion pack and decided to give it a go?
16266,"Hey dudes i got this game for free and im loving it its better than Clash Royale

It has decent graphics and what i love is the global chat now i can talk with strangers while waiting
"
16267,its pretty fun. reminds me of the magic the gathering game on original xbox. the user interface could be better and the servers are way over loaded right now. the matches are short which makes them stay exciting . hope for the game to have a larger variety of cards .
16268,This game is very enjoyable mostly because its quick and easy to pick up and learn. Its got a nice strategy and mechanics that most anyone can learn with in a few matches. its quite addictive to play and i might just keep coming back to play it on my down time
16269,"The best part about this game is, its FREE. It is amazing for being free, lots of fun and unique ways to play your ""cards"". It requires some thought process and is nice to get in and out of. The developers have done an amazing job. 5/7"
16270,interesting
16271,"fun game, and interesting"
16272,Pretty satisfying gameplay with the small hand and fast resource regen. havent tried many card combination but overall the first 6 or so games have been pretty decent.
16273,I don't know what I'm doin but I keep winning
16274,"So far I am enjoying it - I'll be more in-depth once I put hours behind, so far it's like a hearthstone/warcraft&starcraft character like feel. Only difference between this and hearthstone, its like a TD(Tower Defense) hearthstone and u can play with a team member. I like the concept so far, seems popular and good play & feel."
16275,"A unique combination of strategy and cards. Only played for a few hours, but from what I've seen, it's an easy to play, yet hard to master type of game. 10/10 would keep playing."
16276,"Very rewarding, no p2p and good strategies involved!"
16277,A
16278,Nice cool game
16279,"  A surprisingly robust game with good physical assets [ meaning visual and sound quality ]

  Can be played casually or competetive , rewards are frequent enough to play a few rounds each day 

  Overall very little grief to be had , friendly community , ease of matchmaking and interface elements 

  I recommend this for all ages but especially if you have friends to play with its less stressful than most other multiplayer games"
16280,"good game but optimize and make it feel less like cash grab
"
16281,"Very fun game, worth a download."
16282,"game is fun, i like team mode"
16283,"Good game, just sadly pay to win, newer and more cards = win.
I do recommend it for first few days, then just uninstall it."
16284,"Was actually suprised with how well this game plays.

100% worth checking out if you enjoy games like Clash Royale"
16285,it's very good
16286,bobo si aldrine
16287,Great fun... feels like the early days of playing league.   Simple concept lots of unlocks and overall very addictive fun.
16288,easy to pickup. nice quick matches
16289,like clash royale. so far haven't seen the money milking that plague that stupid game yet. don't know about the matchmaking fairness yet.
16290,very good gameplay. would recommend to all my frands
16291,ADDICTING AND ENGAGINGLY FUN
16292,Awesome!
16293,Great game well made and lots of fun so far :D very hopeful
16294,"Really fun and competitive strategy game. It's not too hard (at first), so the difficulty scales. So if you wanna try out easy strategy games, I recommend trying this game out :)"
16295,"Same guys who made Forced. Pretty cool, and a pretty fun mash-up between card battle and auto chess style genres."
16296,It's a fun mix of MTG/Hearthstone mixed with RTS elements. Fun game
16297,66666666666666666666
16298,"great gameplay, lots of fun!"
16299,"Quick, simple, just enough strategy."
16300,"it's fun, f2p friendly, cool aesthetic"
16301,"When you decide to give it a try for couple of hours, and find yourself staring at the screen and questioning why is it still bright outside, then realising, it is not 'still bright'... Quite an addictive piece of entertainment, otherwise very recommended :)"
16302,"So far so good! It scratch that itch or RTS and fast paced enjoyment. 
Sounds Design need to work more on the background music. We need more omph to get out blood pumping
For graphics, for 2019 - this game is looking solid.
For replay value - GOOD very good! Like that time i played Hearthstone.

i rate it 7/10. Needs improvement but its good. Need to work on its microtransaction. Some items are not worth the asking price."
16303,Awsome fun casual couch game with me bro.. louds of fun! must play Its FREE!!!
16304,"Awesome, Fun, Casual game. Competitive yet fun even if you lose."
16305,basically a less p2w version of clash royale (no levels as far as I can tell)
16306,"Loving this game so far..  If you enjoy Clash Royale type games this one is amazing.. it is a simple game concept/style but still executed very well! :) 

Thank you devs"
16307,"FUCKING SWEET GAME D00DZ! ez to pick up and very smooth, but seems to have the potential for a lot of depth in strategy"
16308,quick fun smash n bash clash and dash
16309,"Initial reaction is good fun. Seems like an easy to pick up and play, hard to master kind of game."
16310,Fun game. Easy to play but has depth
16311,"Fast paced and fun.  Great to play with friends, and also solo.  Thank you for making it free to play."
16312,Its very fun
16313,Great alternative to Clash Royale... far less reliance on leveling cards up through repeated purchases.
16314,Amazing gameplay! How is this free to play!?
16315,nice
16316,Nice game
16317,THIS GAME FUCKING ROCKS!
16318,Actually pretty fun
16319,"Pretty great game, the team battle feature sells it for me.. oh wait.. its free.  What you reading this for when you can just try it yourself?"
16320,fun game :)
16321,ive won 20 games in a row i am the best player
16322,Very simple game that is easy to learn and master. The developers are extremely generous with their content and are currently giving away two DLC packs for free.
16323,god tier game
16324,The game is fun and very enjoyable thus far.
16325,good little gem to play easy to pick up and quite fun .
16326,"i haven't lost, too good dard"
16327,"Quick and easy to pick up, deep enough to keep you engaged."
16328,yeeeeeeeeeeee
16329,Pretty fun game
16330,nice
16331,I have only played about an hour of this but enjoying the combinations you can do and fight against other players
16332,Yes
16333,Awesome
16334,So far a really funny strategic game with great graphics
16335,So far fun Game.  I am interested to see how this game builds up.
16336,It brings back memories when i first played clash royale and finally it is available in pc now
16337,"Just started to play, but good mechanics so far. Would like to see more info available for new players to understand how some of those mech's work though, besides that, fun, much like chess...easy to learn...easy to loose."
16338,WOOT!
16339,good so far
16340,yes
16341,lol fun
16342,"Minion Masters is great for a quick weird moba-card game. Some parts of it are best if you spend money but you can play it for free and still enjoy it. Like Hearthstone though, meta decks require you to either have luck or spend $. I've played a decent amount and still enjoy it after a year~ of gameplay. Continuing to play it makes the cost non existent and easily able to have access to every build."
16343,"It's free to play, reminds me a lot of Battle Royal, and I can see myself opening this up again"
16344,clash style game play fun enough as long as no pay to win ceiling. all looks good so far
16345,clash royale
16346,Fast paced and fun
16347,"Base game is alright. Just alright. From audio to video, from writing to mechanics, all of it feels decent. Not good, mind you.
The gameplay itself is satisfying enough. It all seems to work well enough. (If you can ignore the constant master server timeout error messages) That's just about where it stops.

All surrounding mechanics are teasers at best, many meant to confuse you, many more meant to manipulate you. Each and every single one of them taken from a plethora of the most popular facebook/mobile/p2w/money-grubbing games.

Layer upon layer of mostly useless shit convolute the otherwise decent core of the game. 
Gold, Power Tokens, Shards, Rubies. Battle Pass, Glory, different progression mechanics, none of them influencing anything other than giving access to basic game mechanics such as team battles and cosmetics. 
Thus, extremely unsatisfying. Many more mechanics are really unsatisfying outside of battle. And all of them are tailored into making you want to spend a bit on this, and a bit on that, ending up in dozens $ / month. 

Now don't get me wrong, there doesn't seem to be any specific P2W mechanics. Nothing that can influence a battle is locked to people who pay. But that doesn't mean there's a fair playing ground. People who do spend can end up with powerful, specialized decks right off the bat. They'll be fighting other newbies, who didn't spend and are limited to the starter cards and what few others they might have collected. I've experienced it myself just now, using Accursed and Voidborne DLC cards to win [strike]half a dozen matches in a row[/strike] at least two dozen matches in a row. Those were my first matches too. I fought different decks, not just the starter deck, and steamrolled them all. It's really mainly due to some of the powerful DLC cards. The only matches I've lost so far are in draft using random cards, and in expedition vs cheaty AI.

This is one of those games that walks the line between P2W or not, and it'll really depend on your definition of P2W. That said, I've seen way worse examples presented to have zero P2W elements.

Personally I don't mind the economy of the game. But it, combined with all these layers of nonsense trying to get you to spend on more nonsense... It's where I draw a line, and have done so many times before with plenty of these type games. 
In all honesty, I find it a despicable way of presenting your game. I read the 9 year betadwarf journey before playing Minion Masters, and it filled me with different positive feelings, including that these devs would likely be some stand-up guys, and I immediately expected to not find many of the mechanics I did end up finding only minutes later. Now I just feel like it's all part of their marketing, and the feelings of trust and respect after reading through their blog just turned into doubt.

Now all I can see is a bunch of devs cashing in on a successful project. In essence, there's nothing wrong with that. I just don't appreciate the methods."
16348,"Deck-building is not quite intuitive at first, but the tutorial shows a lot of love in creating an engaging setup without necessarily holding your hand--they prepare you well for getting set up."
16349,"good good 
"
16350,"Fun game. Strategic, but hard to play."
16351,ok
16352,"Game has a serious optimization issue.  Constantly causing hard shutdowns on my laptop due to overheating my GPU.  Even putting all settings at minimum and V sync on it would still trip my temperature sensors and cause forced shutdowns after 15-30 minutes of playtime.  I spend 4-7 hours a day gaming playing everything from WoWS to Conan Exiles to Ark, all on max settings at 60fps and this has never happened before.

My setup is an i7-4770, GTX 1050, 32GB RAM and I run the game on my SSD.  I cannot replicate this problem with any other game.  My advice would be to avoid this if you are experiencing the same issue as so many forced shutdowns due to heat buildup will eventually damage your board.  Fun game, but makes no sense why it stresses the GPU so hard."
16353,good
16354,"The narrators voice is annoying, and the game play feels slow and meh."
16355,Awesome game
16356,"Game is so laggy that it STALLS, and recovers many moons later.

The Arena will stop for up to 7-9 seconds without anything to do but worry the server just completely destroys your Timing. You need lots of timing in this game and this game literally STEALS this skill away from you. Uninstalled. *cries*

* Devs: REMOVE THE 3D ARENA - HAVE A DARK GREY BORING ARENA INSTEAD TO PLAY ON. This will help eye site issues with your BRIGHT WHITE snow arenas and lag. I have a RX 570 14nm and 7nm 3300x Zen2 - Why does your game lag so much it STALLS??"
16357,Great
16358,iz alight
16359,"bom jogo
"
16360,Fun game dynamics and the two vs two battles are well balanced.
16361,"Simple to learn, fun fast games. More depth than expected."
16362,"Quick, easy...like a super fast Battleforge. I miss Battleforge."
16363,I've been playing for 1 hour and at the moment I'm enjoying it a lot. I recommend it.
16364,Really pulls you into the game with the flashys
16365,"It's exciting! it's like that mobile game, but with hero perks twist and less p2w because the cards don't get upgrade"
16366,"Interesting, fun kinda relaxing competitive game."
16367,good game
16368,Hearthstone liked This
16369,After a year this game is still well balanced.  A deck made entirely out of starter cards is completely viable.  No pay to win shenanigans going on here.
16370,Good game
16371,Fun little game best enjoyed with a friends.
16372,S'aight
16373,played a few games time flies enjoying it alot!
16374,Always loved defense games!
16375,Easy to learn game and fun while no one knows the meta lol
16376,crazy fun
16377,Nice game ;)
16378,Brilliantly simple. Great features and graphics and well thought out game.
16379,Fun strategy game that has cute animations. kind of scratches that dota auto chess itch a bit
16380,"Honestly, only tried this because it was free and the reviews said it was good. They were not wrong. Quick and easy to get into and a fun concept. Good game to pick up and play when got some time to kill but not that much. Good visuals and sfx. Give it a shot!"
16381,A visual deck building pvp game. Fun!
16382,"Fun and quick games! My boyfriend recommended to me and I haven't stopped playing since. 
"
16383,"its a very simplistic spawn in monsters to fight however the main ""draw"" of the game is to control the two bridges to gain more XP than the enemy, however it seems like a mobile game that wants to grab all your money"
16384,Wonderful
16385,"My first thought when I got this game for free on Discord was that it was boring and, honestly, I couldn't be so wrong in my life. It does reminds me of Clash Royale and Clash of Clans with the fun included. It's a really good fast paced game with awesome developers as well."
16386,gg
16387,Really fun game more then I thought Hell Ya !!! Got go get back in to it bye. Hope to see you soon...
16388,fun game! a bit overwhelming at first but fun to get the hang of
16389,"great game.. why not just make it an arena without bridges tho?
"
16390,"Gg, fun with friends"
16391,love it
16392,"Feels like the result of an orgy between MTG, Hearthstone and any TD game.

Played just a few matches and in love with it already."
16393,"If you've played Clash Royale, it's like that, but you don't need to spend money to compete. People have gotten to the highest rank in the game with the starter deck, and commons are some of the strongest cards. It's also a PC and Xbox game. You can put money into the game if you want, but unless you want all the skins, you'll find $100 to have unlocked almost all game content. That being said, you can get a full collection for free, all the masters, and if you do well in ranks, you can get premium currency for skins and other stuff. Personally, I reached GM within a month of playing, and I had no legendaries in my decks BY CHOICE. Overall, this game is very fun, with the most complaints I hear about it being the plethora of bugs, usually involving entering and exiting ranked matches. However, these are not game-breaking and overall shouldn't keep you from trying out the game."
16394,This game feels very polished for a free game. Its similar to Clash Royale but better looking. It runs great and is a lot of fun. The quick matches make it so that I can pick it up play a few games and quit and only 10 or 15 minutes has gone by. I haven't dug too deep into balance and pay to win aspects but on the lower tier I am having a lot of fun
16395,Amazing game!! i like this 1
16396,First time playing game of this genre. and i must say its really fun!
16397,Fun so far.  Hoping it doesn't turn too grindy.
16398,"not pay to win, never the same game twice"
16399,10 / 10 it a good game :)
16400,"It's a fun and fast little game. I think there is still a bit of balancing to be made, but they should be able to work that out eventually."
16401,fun game graphics are really nice characters feel nice to play good fun game
16402,"A fun, intuitive evolution of the deck building genre."
16403,"GREAT LITTLE GAME , GREAT GRAPHICS"
16404,"Simple, free to play game and very funny voice overs."
16405,its cool :)
16406,"i like this game because is faster and funny, seems not be like a play to win game..."
16407,Not bad not bad
16408,HARİKA... BAŞKA BİR ŞEY DEMEYE GEREK YOK:...
16409,"Decent, not competitive or anything, but it's a PC version of clash royale so not bad"
16410,Nice quick battle game.  There isn't much to say though.  It is similar to many out there.
16411,Awesome game. Very addictive.
16412,Really Fun
16413,"its fun
"
16414,"It's free, it's fun."
16415,"Simple, intuitive and fast gameplay! Overall good :D"
16416,Great game fast paced card game with animated battles matched with tower defense .
16417,great game
16418,"Fun gameplay,fast games and short queues"
16419,nice game
16420,"Game is fun, not complicated and the devs seem to be great guys!"
16421,Great game
16422,"was kinda surprised by this game, it's actually very good. But still a bit buggy"
16423,That moment when you download a Free to Play game and its actually GOOD!
16424,"Really fun so far (level 10), don't know if it becomes more pay-to-win later."
16425,this is the best card game I've ever played so far holy crab i'm so addicted to this game frfr!
16426,"Very Fun. I like how your cards can rank up and stuff and how theres so many to collect. I like how your player level can increase so high too. I like rewards for lots of playing. This game is good. Thanks
"
16427,"loads of fun, good matchmaking, wide variety of units - it's free, just try it"
16428,"This is my ""Surprise of the Year Award"" for 2019. What is clearly inspired to a stupid phone game turned into a fantastic PC quick game with depth, polish and lots of fun. The best feature? 2v2, you and your friend against the world. Yes, please."
16429,This game is so sick! I love everything about it.
16430,good game
16431,"I don't tend to play turn based games, just not my cup of tea.. but this game is a little gem that dragged me in rather quickly. Very fluid when placing back to back, fun and quick matches (have yet to ever have an issue getting into a match, takes around 5 seconds tops). Free to play and no need to purchase anything with real cash. I believe you can buy items in the market but for me I'm not drawn in by market items and have had no issues whatsoever playing and winning without paying a dime towards the game. If you enjoy rapid turn based games, this is for you. If you don't enjoy turn based games, give it a shot you might just like this one. Now to the reward system they have in place... Great! Like I said previous without paying a dime towards this game their reward system is awesome and rewards you A LOT, whether it be spins for tokens, spins for cash, spins for cards, etc. The more you win matches the quicker the rewards, and the daily login rewards are the cherry on top. I'll be honest I do not play this game all day everyday (usually only about 20 mins at a time, because in 20 mins in this game you can play around 10-15 matches, matches lasting usually around 2 mins tops), but when I have played I've had a great time. Wish there was a voice chat or chat box during matches though but that is about all I can complain about.



9.8/10 

Definitely give it a try."
16432,nice game its funny play duo with your friends recommend
16433,Awesome game!
16434,Divertidisimo Juego muy Original!
16435,great game
16436,"So far good strategy involved.  Most fights against players have been fair.  Will be interested on what is available as my account grows
"
16437,fun
16438,Funny
16439,not bad
16440,Just fun
16441,ggwp
16442,"Great game so far.
People are comparing it to Clash Royale but its a far superiour product"
16443,very gud game recommend playing it if you got some brains
16444,The game is easy to pick up. The tool tips are good for teaching the basics. The rewards unlocked keep me interested and give me a sense of making progress.
16445,good
16446,look fantastic
16447,Really fun game. It's like clash royal on mobile
16448,awesome game
16449,"Really fun game, rather addicting."
16450,fun and simple!!
16451,"The game is great, dynamic and pretty. Love it.
Although I'd love it even more if there were 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 team matches, at least in a custom modes."
16452,1 hour in. Seems fun so far.
16453,"Fast paced, fun, and free. Good for a few rounds at a time or put in some hours and get really good at the game, it's fun and free either way. One part card game, one part strategy, and a hint of moba here from the team work and guarding your summoning tower. A good balanced mix of almost all the elements."
16454,This is nice!
16455,"Easy to learn, very hard to master. Think chess where playing the wrong card can ensure a loss. Very fast paced and surprisingly strategic. Good for all ages."
16456,"very fun ;D just waiting for it to be ruined and become p2w XD its gona happen slowly but surely XD
"
16457,Fun action packed full of dailies good way to kill a few minutes when you are bored and don't have a lot of time to game funny player interaction definitely worth a try
16458,"love it so far, would pay money for this. reminded me a little bit of wc3 custom map with 2 castles and minion spawning buildings."
16459,Really enjoying my time with this game so far. Try it out since it's free!
16460,"Started playing, decent game"
16461,"Lovely game, quite unique, I just love it :D"
16462,"Its a fun little tug of war game. Ive only played a few hours, but ill update once I get further into it."
16463,game really fun and i love the humer and art style is a big plus only lv 10 so far but i don't think ill drop this game for a min.
16464,a fun mindless game
16465,"Good game baby
"
16466,"Fast paced but at the same time leaves enough room for tactical decisions. Battles can last from 1 to 10 minutes (that i've seen)

Designs are cool and the game is humoured"
16467,Cool game
16468,Very goog game :) this game is more fun than clash royale :)))
16469,veri naic game
16470,Hela fun
16471,"this game is fun, easy to learn but hard to master. perfectly balanced. plus its free!"
16472,"Pretty simple game, a decent thing to just hop on and play for a bit."
16473,"Jogo rápido, bom e bonito"
16474,"So far this seems far more streamlined than most of it's contemporaries on Steam. This may seem a bit too fast paced for some old card game veterans, but I find it's faster speed to be very engaging. The tactics are fairly straight forward from the onset but that actually plays to it's strength as the learning curve is fairly small. Overall 8/10, this outpaces it's competitors by a mile. The only criticism I guess I have thus far is the cutesy art style is a bit much, but I get that's what the developers are going for."
16475,Engaging from the start!
16476,If they created a PC version of the classic phone card/brawler this would be it.
16477,doing reviews cuz i can
16478,Cool game so far just wondering how diverse it will be/stay :)0
16479,It counted as a loss for Mayhem when a person on the other team in a team battle never joined...
16480,awesome game. if you like clash royale this is pretty much just a better pc version of that
16481,"I did not think I would like this game but took a chance.
It is F2P so what the heck, might as well play it.
Fast paced interesting, and although I thought the art was not my kind of art style I am finding that the game defaults to ""ugly"" as a graphics setting.
I reset the graphics/visuals to ""Glorious"" and WOW totally different looking high quality game graphics!
Unfortunately, I had to turn the Visuals back down to ""Ugly"" to keep the game from crashing.
The game is rewarding in both enjoyment and game rewards.
Imagine ""Heroes of the Storm"" in an arena only a quarter of the size, but with your giant and non moveable minion master at your base and of course with minions and cards.
At first because I didnt know what I was doing I just kept playing cards as soon and as fast  as they spawned based on mana.
After awhile after I learned the cards I was then able to formulate when to play what.
You must manage your rubies, shards and gold carefully as you are tempted to use these in game currancies for so many things that you will miss the most important thing they are used for and that is season pases and tier rewards.

FINAL VERDICT:
Great game"
16482,"Its fast and Funny, a mix of MOBA, Tower defense & Card Game"
16483,Why you play the copy cat game ?
16484,So much better than clash royale. Finally a game that doesn't force you to spend money to enjoy it.
16485,gg
16486,Fantastic game for the casual or hardcore gamer.
16487,"This is just like Magic: Battlegrounds but modern and FTP. I personally haven't paid a single cent and I reach Diamond almost every season and I can afford the Battle Pass. I do play alot, however... ADDICTIVE 

Game could use more representation as the majority of characters who are human (or human-like) appear to be white and men. 

!!! BEWARE OF EXTREMELY SEXY INCUBUS !!!"
16488,Easy to learn and quick games.
16489,Fun Gameplay similar to Battle Royal where you send units on both sides recommend people buy I't i think its worth the money and its not pay2win
16490,relax games
16491,Amazing Game so much fun!
16492,fun mini game to waste hundreds of hours into
16493,"Clash Royal like game for PC, though not as grindey from what i can see."
16494,"This is not my type of gamin, but I watched sum vidz of it an decided to try it out.. im glad I did...
im enjoyin it alot.."
16495,"Very good RTS card game where there really is deck variety and you have to also know what you are doing rather than just copy the best decks.

Pros:
-Free to play friendly: you don't need some specific cards in order to have a fighting chance, getting some of the legendaries will take a while but they are usually not strictly stronger but rather more situational or have cool effects
-Strategy focused, the games are rarely decided based on the matchup, reacting to what your opponent does and playing with your strengths are the key
- MANY strategies available, two different games in 1v1 and 2v2 mode as the decks which win on another one don't usually fit the other so well
-Art and animations are really cool and sounds fit the game well
- Well designed reward structure that keeps you playing and coming back for more
- Many game modes which create variety
- Regular updates and ingame events

Cons:
- Quite a lot of disconnection errors and other possible bugs which can be annoying (EDIT: This is no longer the case, they fixed their problems)
- A few strategies which can feel a bit oppressive unless you are very familiar with how to counter those
- Sometimes random 2v2 matches seem to match with premade 2v2s, creating uneven playing fields"
16496,Great game.
16497,"it is just enjoyable, lets hope it doesn't get a grind"
16498,"Played a few games, seems like a good time waster that has a little bit of depth later on without being pay to win."
16499,"Even though this game has a great concept it fails to establish competitive matches.
Whoever crosses the line and kills first minion on enemy's field wins. Period. 100% of the time. The reason for this is that the EXP Boost given to the first kill is so dramatically high that the first one simply dominates the opponent with global shots and more cards. Seriously, this is ridiculous. It's very easy to win.

Do you suck at all games and want to feel like a winner even though you fail in life? Play Minion Masters, spam quick units once you reach 6 gems AND YOU WILL WIN FOR SURE."
16500,"nice game very fun and strategic

edit: for the nominations award badge"
16501,Fun time killer
16502,This game man! I tell you... I've installed it today and already have 6.5 hours of play time. I want my life back!
16503,It feels great!
16504,"Nice, but I fell like it's pay to win."
16505,Good game for relaxing well done
16506,"its cool
"
16507,"its an awesome little mini game, i do not have bad things to say"
16508,Goood
16509,"Pretty simple game, it's laid back while also allowing you to make moment to moment decisions that feel immediately rewarding or leave you feeling like, ""Why did I even do that?"""
16510,"Good F2P game reminiscent of my old Warcraft III days. It doesn't constantly shove P2W elements in your face and so far I haven't seen any evidence of P2W pubstomping so as long as that stays, this game is great."
16511,"Great Game!
Very fun to play with amazing visuals and great gameplay!

Will add to my curator sugestions positively for sure!"
16512,Fun game
16513,"amazing game, reminds me of clash royale so much"
16514,Reminds me of a starcraft mini game
16515,solid.
16516,good game  and easy to play.

16570,"ok this game is unplayable and jokes , how this bug even exist in first place ? its game breaking !!!!!! , during my match i get ( An error occured! Timeout Click Ok to return to the Menu ) then i click ok ( You left the game ) ?????????????? , i cannot connect and keep happening to me and lose matches that i was gonna win !!!!"
16571,Ok.
16572,Great play style for relaxed and interesting games!
16573,"This thing is fun. will quit at the slightest tinge of to ""Pay-to-win"" concept."
16574,WOW !! GREATNESS!!

16576,FUN AS FUCK. KEEP THE FREE SHIT COMIN
16577,fun and ez ;) Royal battle like but on pc!
16578,good stuff like totally
16579,"I had no idea what to expect when I pulled this down.   Some smart google fu scored me both of the starter packs for free.   I am REALLY enjoying it.  Games are fast and fun, it's not a huge time commitment and there is a deeper layer of strategy that gives the easy to learn hard to master vibe.

Very impressed!"
16580,"Great card/battle game, reminds me of castle clash but so much better"
16581,"This game is truely an enjoyment to play, Just started out and the players are excellent to me, helping me with my deck giving me tips and suggestions, this game is a great spin on turn based card games (with a 3D twist to it). I hope to keep liking the game further and hope more people play this as i hope it gets bigger soon!!"
16582,Good!
16583,is fun and simple
16584,"This game came out of NOWHERE. I know it's early for me to be reviewing it, and if something awful goes wrong with it I'll definitely update this review, but right now i'm blown away by the creativity. One of the biggest dealbreakers for a game like this is it being greedy with rewards, and this one feels like it struck a great balance between how hard you work and what you earn for it. 

Sure, the microtransactions letting you have Masters without working for them sucks, but thus far some don't seem overtly more powerful than any other. Being able to buy currency sucks, but it's F2P, what can you do. They have to make money somehow, and so far, I'm willing to say they deserve it."
16585,"I did not have high expectations for this game going in. But was I surprised by how addicting and fun this game really is. Fast paced, card based game play that keeps you on your toes and thinking about what your next move needs to be. Definitely one of the very few free to play games worth some of your time. Check it out."
16586,So far its fun and competitive and haven't spent any money yet. will update after more playtime
16587,never played anything like it before and its fun.
16588,"So far, besides the rare glitch, this is a pretty fun game. Look forward to see the progression as time goes on. Definitely worth a try."
16589,Great game coming from a Clash Royale fan. The master and its abilities adds a twist.
16590,"reminds me of a combination of hearthstone and battleforge. easy to get into, matches are quick. and don't feel compelled to spend any $$ to win."
16591,Enjoyable so far
16592,"Fun game. Reminds me of clash royale, but better."
16593,"its fun and not boring like most games
"
16594,it's  fun
16595,addicted...
16596,Great little idle game for when you don't want to sit up in your chair. Needs more content in my opinion.
16597,So Far so good... kind of rushed into the game...could use a bit more of a tutorial ... but games are fun... and eventually you will figure out what is going on

16609,super fun game. seems pretty balanced from what ive seen so far
16610,Pretty fast paced card game.  Decks are small so it's more about play than deck building.
16611,its ok
16612,DANKEST GAME ON STEAM RIGHT NOW would recommend this for all the homies! 10 out of 10 on KRAKEN REVIEWS
16613,Good game for free time and easy play ;]
16614,"Honestly loving it. I read a story about the developers on Imgur, and thought i'd try out the game. I love it. It's a combination of Moba and Clash Royale. It's exatly what i want out of a game, enough customization for diverse play, on top of Sweet skills, and my personal favorite, the ability to play tribal."

16643,this game are good nd fun
16644,Fun game.
16645,Clash Royale but without getting interrupted when bae calls.
16646,"Interesting game.I like the story of the studio behind it and gave it a try. Short fun for in-between. it got that mobile business model with loot boxes, but the first games were really enjoyable."
16647,FUn
16648,"After 125 hours playing while writting i can absoluttly recomend this game for people who love magic the gathering, heartstone or feria. Any Collectible trading card game really. 

Your card comes to life on a map in 1vs1 or 2vs player duells. 
Each game take about 2-5 min avarage, some games takes up to 8 min. Great for casual play or for people who cannot decicate to much time undisurbed. 

From i bought early accsess to realese for 5 euro, I had not spent any money on the ingame shop. 
The game was generous with ingame reward for winning and completing quests so, mabye more so than simuluar games. 

Its a deckbuilding game where you can choose different heroes with different abilities to command you deck. The cards come alliive on a 3d map with 2 lanes. Units placement and card comboes play a big role: as well as the paper, rock siccor part of the strategy. 

You start with some mana and gain more with time, each card cost mana. Will you rush a attack or wait and counter? what if both player wait untill maxiimum mana before they play any card? These are the questions you must answer in this awessome free to play game!"
16649,"pretty fun game. easy to learn, easy to understand. doesn't require you to develop 90 million strategies to win. if you're looking for something to play that kills time, keeps you entertained, and moves pretty quickly, this is your game."
16650,"Simple fun. Pick cards for your deck, place them on the map, enjoy carnage. Games are fast."
16651,"Great game, looks like playing a balanced clash royale, with enjoyable features and great characters design"
16652,"Very fun, well structured and quick strategy game.
Recommend to people that for whatever reason need a simple game that doesn't feel too easy or too much like you are being pulled in all directions."
16653,"Doesn't feel p2w at all.

At last a game with no card levels :)"
16654,"Very fun fast paced siege game, I enjoy it!"
16655,"I just started playing this game, and I love it. Specially the rag dolls, I'm getting addicted already. Keep up the work."
16656,I just love it
16657,Game is hella tight bros. Reminds me of clash royale but more dank. I like being able to place my minions wherever. Diverse champs. 11/10 would play again.
16658,"It's like someone took those flash ""RTS""es from the 2000s where you spawn dudemans from your base to counter the other dudemans and destroy their base, but fleshed out and with deckbuilding mechanics. Neat."
16659,Very Fun!
16660,"
 Fun game :) A little grindy however?
"
16661,"Awesome game, pretty fun to play, the decks can be built efficiently and doesn't seem to be p2w so far. 5/7 perfect score"
16662,really fun
16663,Love the graphics and mechanics so far.  Pick this one up.
16664,fun game
16665,This good game
16666,Basically a PC (and better) version of Clash of Clans
16667,Such a good game :)
16668,Really enjoying the strategy aspect of this game. Reminds me of Clash games.
16669,.
16670,ganz nett
16671,The game is really fun. Dev Team seems to have a lot of heart and love of the medium. Really generous with rewards. Not pay to win.
16672,"I picked this up after seeing the post on Imgur about free games, and I like it so far. It's kind of like a simplistic MTG with MOBA elements; the deckbuilding is straightforward enough, and while so far I've found success without a real strategy, I'm sure things can get technical later on."
16673,"Really Good Game, Requires Strategy and Voice Acting is Hilarious."
16674,its better than dayz
16675,"Cool little game, easy and fun way to pass the time."
16676,"Fun and easy to play game. It's not at all like a simple card game. Playing the right card at the right time and place means that you would have to think tactically with each match. You and your opponent could have the exact same deck and the match would still be decided by the one who skillfully used it. Luck is a lot less of a factor like in other card games like MTG or Hearthstone, so I'm really enjoying it so far."
16677,Enjoying the game so far and I love it. 10/10
16678,muito bom :D
16679,"Awesome game with loads of stuff to unlock. Easy to play, short games (+- 5 minutes) and very addicting! If you like the Orcs Must Die design style this game is for you."
16680,"Pretty fun game, similar to most CCG's but the multitude of spells & minions alongside lane control is extremely rewarding. Really nice seeing your minions stomp around the battlefield. 

Only 2 hours or so in but enjoying the game.

Worth a try 
7/10"
16681,really amazing
16682,"i like it so far , i didin't see a game quite like this one in a while and the free pack is a cherry on top of it"
16683,fun game :)
16684,Fun game
16685,very fun
16686,"fun fast paced
"
16687,"Great game, with simple and fun mechanics, easy to learn, but which take much longer to master. With so many different heroes and cards to play and game modes, there is a lot of gameplay variety."
16688,"Seems pretty great so far. Yes, it's not the first game of its type, but it takes it to a whole new level. PC play, good graphics, and no card levels. The aesthetics of the game are fun and interesting, I really like lots of the beastly aesthetics going on. It doesn't seem unfair to new players or those who don't want to spend a lot on upgrades."
16689,"Amazingly fun in the beginning - will be updating review on the mileage as i play more

So far amazing concept and immensely fun.. not very time consuming per match either which is a big plus although hotly contested matches can go a bit longer"
16690,"Pay to win, don't bother to download unless you plan on spending hundreds of dollars.  Can't even face A.I. with the garbage they hand out at start."
16691,"Sembra piuttosto divertente, devo capirne ancora la longevità!"
16692,"Pretty fun game, matches are action packed, don't take too long and very easy to learn.

Suggestions:
1.introduce voice chat
2.text chat in matches as well
3. filters in the card deck tab, so I can select ""view undecked cards"" and such filters would be great.

A bit more of user details so I know i'm playing with many people around the globe (steam user picture, etc)

A bit of performance issues when the game pans into a closeup of the team and enemies ( igot an i7 7700hq + gtx1060 6gig, 16gig ram) 
"
16693,its good becouse it is easy to play
16694,Nice Game
16695,Really fun game
16696,"EDIT:

At start I gave game good review. But...

Game could be good. But with current lags, disconnects and Time outs it's not.

EDIT:

Yet still I play this game, so Thumb up."
16697,I like it
16698,I love it
16699,"Love this game! :)
It's fun to play with friends! :)"
16700,This is awesome game with a lovely graphic and interesting gameplay) U can relax in this game for many hours! Enjoy this
16701,Take my money please.
16702,"Cool! recommended for kids.
"
16703,"Back when Clash Royale came out, I was in love with the game.  At least until I got to the Legendary rank and found myself smashing my head against people who had spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars (according to the drop percentages) to have powered up extremely rare cards.  From that point on, I decided to try to find a game similar in nature that didn’t ruin itself with a “Pay to Win” design.  Minion Masters fills that role perfectly, but will it last?

Abbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/Gmbhv5hzFdk

[h1]Set It and Forget It[/h1]
Minion Masters has a relatively straightforward premise for its core mechanic, but it involves a much deeper execution of strategy, timing, and deck building that ultimately make it fun to play.  When you’re actually in a battle, whether it’s against a single opponent or in a 2v2, your main task is playing cards mostly on your side of the battlefield.  Many cards will summon a unit that will march its way toward your opponent’s tower on the opposite side of the playing field via one of the two narrow bridges.  Their goal is to do the same with their cards and the units will usually fight one another in the process.   It’s very simple to do, which makes the game immediately appealing, but there are ultimately a lot more strategic layers to keep it engaging.

In order to place units, you need to spend the required mana cost.  Mana is gained periodically and is accumulated more quickly as the match progresses.   However, when deciding which card in your hand to play on the battlefield, the amount of mana available is only part of it.  You may want to save up more to play multiple cards that complement each other in quick succession.  Timing is also a consideration if you’re attempting to counter a card that someone else plays.  Another timing aspect to think about is the speed of the summoned unit, as placing a slow unit in the back of the battlefield may allow you to build up more forces around it by the time it reaches the bridge.  All of these factors and more play in to how you shape your strategy for each deck, and that’s not even counting spells that usually can be played across the entire battlefield.

[h1]Fantastic Decks and How to Build Them[/h1]
Building a deck is the other half of the path to victory, sharing equal value with strategic placement and timing.  You can play a mediocre deck well and find success, but at the higher levels, deck composition becomes a much more important part of winning matches.  Putting together a deck can be a daunting task, especially with a steady influx of new cards entering the game.  However, your starting cards and early common cards can build a quality deck that can be willed to victory if you take the time to learn to play the cards correctly.  

Generally, my goal in deck building is to establish a tactic – such as master-focusing cards like the Living Statue or Rammer – and build from there.  I make sure to leave enough room in my ten card slots to have a basic counter for the majority of cards people might throw at me.  For instance, you don’t want to be left without the ability to attack air units or else the first deck featuring one or two of those is going to wreck you.  Betadwarf’s efforts to add a variety of cards with unique mechanics has made it a lot more difficult to cover every possibility though.  Nonetheless, being able to adapt a deck you build to counter trends and popular deck designs can be the deciding factor in whether you’re moving up or down the ranks.

[h1]Too Many Queues Spoil the Broth[/h1]
One thing that concerns me is that, between 1v1, 2v2, Draft, Mayhem, and any other things people might be doing like deck building or playing against the handful of AI battles in Expeditions, the playerbase might get spread too thin.  Indie multiplayer-centric games are often a disaster from the beginning because of playerbase issues.  Some succeed for a time, but once the much smaller population gets bored, it starts a runaway cycle of exodus.  During the early access, there were times that the concurrent population was down to a couple hundred people and, while matches still happened, they were often against the same small group of people in your rank.    It has risen significantly since then, and I hope Xbox cross platform play bolsters it even more.  Having 1v1 as the core gameplay component will almost guarantee some level of gameplay for a long time though.  Requiring only two people makes it a lot easier to get things going as well.

[h1]A Long Road, A Bright Future[/h1]
Minion Masters had a long run in Early Access.  The developer, Betadwarf, has had a tough and storied past with the development of their previous two games as well.  I don’t know if they ever had doubts about how Minion Masters would turn out, but the hundreds of hours I’ve spent in it should stand strong in demonstrating how enjoyable and borderline addictive this game is.  Minion Masters isn’t alone in its genre crossing RTS/CCG design at this point, but it’s certainly the best version – easily beating what Clash Royale was at launch and certainly proving that “Pay to Win” is detrimental to design.  While it may still have a few hiccups to work out in card balance and performance (especially in 2v2), it’s easy for me to recommend this and I’ll certainly be adding to my many hours for the foreseeable future.

16705,very good game
16706,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Amazing game, you will love it. It reminds me of the old starcraft custom maps that I loved, but 100X more polished."
16707,It's pretty chill
16708,It is nice because gameplay is fast and easy to get in to
16709,overall fun game thats it really
16710,great
16711,"even after few seconds this got so addictive, i forget to take out the pizza"
16712,"Not far into playing, but as a fan of these kind of mobile games this is quite fun! It actually has a really fair business model that when your cards lvl up they don't get stronger, so new players can stand a chance against anybody."
16713,relaxing game..awesome
16714,GG
16715,You have to be level 7 to unlock the exit game button.
16716,EA since 2010. Enough said
16717,"Muito semelhante ao Clash royale , porem mais imersivo pela jogabilidade e diversidade de cartas e combos que podem ser formados"

16720,fun
16721,"amazing game, really enjoying the battles!"
16722,Fun casual game.. still trying out though
16723,This game rewards patience and well placed drops on the field. Glad i found out about this gem!
16724,Pretty Neat.
16725,"Can... not... stop... playing! It's a very fun and addicting game. Fresh concept, of like a - Tower Defense, tug-of-war mashup. Not pay to win, either! It's free - give it a try!"
16726,Cool game
16727,"I downloaded this game on the official launch day, it is a great take on a tug of war type system with good artwork and fun champions. The initial levels are fun to play and if it had a full and challenging PvE aspect it would definitely be a long standing part of my Steam collection. I am not one to get very competitive when playing and I can already see even at low ranks (platinum) there are ""super decks"" that are popping up. This will quickly make me lose interest in the game due to the fact I typically enjoy maximum deck diversity with no duplicate cards in a deck. I do like the overall presentation and gameplay and I recommend this game to folks that do enjoy a competitive online tug of war game, even if you have to play Meta Decks to rise to the top."
16728,veery nice
16729,"A whole new angel to RTS and Card games, which has been done epicly!"
16730,"Nice game but fix your server issues please. It would be nice not being disconnected after every single battle.... other than that, pretty decent copy of Clash Royal or whatever it was called."

16733,fun game nothing more
16734,"Game is fun, has a very good graphics. So far it is enjoyable, much better with friends for Team Battle! 4.5/5"
16735,Nice game so far!
16736,Holy moly
16737,"A+ , nuff said!

16738,nice=]
16739,"Awesome game!!! Congrats to the developers!! The best: The fast pace strategy with many many options. You can choose to build a balanced deck or a totally unbalanced one as long as your strategy supports it. Learning curve is fast, at least to a decent level, getting to become a top player is a different story."
16740,The graphic is great but it quite lag. The mechanic of the game quite unbalance. But still it free :v If you have a powerful computer then it may not as lag as I am.
16741,"Good game, but made by developers that just seem inexperienced with game design and consumer relationship management."
16742,Great game
16743,"Minion Masters is a 1v1/2v2 strategy/card game where both teams send autonomous units to attack the enemy's base, similar to the mobile game Clash Royale, or many Warcraft 3 maps like Castle Fight.

The game is one of the most generous digital ""card"" games, if you play a daily checklist of tasks which shouldn't take more than 30 minutes per day. 
To unlock all Masters (Hearthstone's Heroes), I had played 48 days logged on (tracked by login achievement), and 70 hours played.
You don't even need all the masters, as it's possible to climb to the highest ranks using very cheap decks and the default master!
I had obtained every single card for the deck used by a top 10 player by my second week on the game.

However, while the rewards are generous for those who make sure to play every day, it is less rewarding for short term grinding. If you're the type to play 12+ hours daily, you may get burnt out from feeling like you're not getting anything, as the gold gain outside of dailies isn't that high.
Regardless, rewards for grinding long sessions are still superior to the likes of giants like Hearthstone and Clash Royale, so give it a try if you're looking for for a game like Clash Royale, but hardly P2W by comparison.

Random Tip: Don't spend your rubies on ANYTHING except the battle pass if you're F2P, you can get every pass for free with some casual playing every other day."
16744,The more they try to balance it the more they ruin it :)
16745,"Great FTP game here! If you've played Clash Royale and enjoyed it, you'll love this title!"

16761,"Great game it's easy to play, and team battles are fun."
16762,Simple and quick way to have some fun.
16763,"the game is really strategic and depends mostly on how and when you position ur troops, thats what i found most addicting in this game"
16764,"It crashed my pc several times last year and now that I reinstalled it the same occurs.
I know there are ways to fix this on the user side but all the other games I own run fine so I have to blame the game."
16765,"quite a nice and fun game, is sure worth the try"
16766,Great diversity in the game style and much easier to play on comp rather than the traditional phone play style as well.
16767,quick easy and fun.
16768,Very enjoyable to play. Easy to understand.

16773,polished version of those wc3 maps..
16774,Love it!
16775,"I highly recommend this game for anyone who misses a great chess match. I was a high ranked US Chess player and I'm loving the games ability to combine cards with placement strategy. An advanced version of GO, if I could be so bold. 

I also love the work they are putting into the streaming community and added engagement with !throw. 

I'd like to see the game add !Throw Feces only because i miss it from Soiled Pants in Grim Dawn. :) 

Come check out my stream and let me know what you think.  I'm working on getting Twitch Partnership status and could use your help! :) www.twitch.tv/Gokurogami"
16776,Very fun and easy to learn game
16777,very fun early game. Feels fair
16778,"Its the PC version of clash royale, if you like that game you will most likely like this one"
16779,A Great fun strategic game! would recommend to others.
16780,quick simple and easy to learn
16781,its cool
16782,"The matchmaking in this game is beyond terrible. There's zero reason that the game should be forcing ques with huge rank disparity, for example coming off a losing streak with a buddy from last night(I'm Master 2 and he's Master 5) 5 games in a row we've gone up against nothing but double Grand Master teams. This should NEVER happen in a game that even remotely cares about the playerbase. I shouldn't be losing 70 points off those games either, especially with a HUGE disparity in actual rank. Fix the matchmaking and maybe you'll get better reviews.

Revision comments: The game still has not fixed the terrible matchmaking that hinders the overall enjoyability of the game. Queing with a partner is the same problem with disparities in ranks, queing with randoms in 2s will shove you with the same person over and over who has no clue how to deckbuild so you end up losing because the game refuses to pair you with somebody else. Wildcards ruin the game for solo play. I'm not sure why anyone bothers giving feedback as the developers clearly don't listen, included with their ptr testers."
16783,This is something. Good time killer is all it's good for though.
16784,fun with friends!
16785,This game is super fun!
16786,This game is what I dreamed of better than clash of clans and with 3D mobs this is totally AWESOME.
16787,Great game. Simple and Awesome.
16788,Its very COOL for me
16789,Good dumb fun.
16790,addicting af
16791,"WOULD be a good game, but they don't let you talk to teammates, only use vague shitty emotes. The result is that morons will hold all their small cards hoping for some big play and will lose every single match for you as a result. The game is also completely unbalanced and there are a few cards that simply have no counters. Don't bother investing; the game is shallow, uninspired, and rife with unnecessary microtransactions. But it is also fun in short doses.

If you could actually talk to your teammates i'd recommend the game. But that one thing is such a big deal that I would say nobody should play this game."
16792,"Great game. Really.
Played PUBG and Apex but now addicted this one :D
Never played any card games but this one is really interesting to play. This game has various strategies, great graphic and nice gameplay. No P2w because in my experience you can just put normal card in your deck to win any game. Got 8 different masters to play, a lot of cards (different kind of spell and minions) etc... Really amazing....

My wish for next update :
- New map with 3 bridges or different style 
- Leveling system for master 
- 3 vs 3 maybe?
- a LOT OF NEW CARDS :))

Great JOB Dev, my first favorite game in STEAM without thinking a lot to spend my money
"
16793,"Awesome game, very easy to play and fast paced
what made me keep coming back for this game is honestly the starter card you get are pretty useful, I won a lot of matches without feeling That I want to open chests or anything"
16794,"Great fun. Quick matches that can fit into a hectic day.
"
16795,Fun game with welcoming and teaching community. Devs are active in game and love and care about content creators and players!
16796,great income Defense substitute
16797,"got a good card that helps alot , would love another one :)"
16798,"I recommend this game in one way -- tell the GM's and Dev's everyday to fux off and quit rigging the Random Team Solo and quit the fuccing cry baby whiners - also dont cuss in this game so many crying bitches that are man boy child millienials who are monitors in the game - total fucking whinning baby boys - however in game you may have a chance in  play Team Premade's better get the right partner of you will lose a hell of a lot.
Rewards are totally crap most of the time as compared to the established players who are at the top of the board month after month for over a year get massive rewards - oh yeah game is highly stacked against the non paying player as well if your decks are new don't expect to win much in premade either!
- Token wheel when I press it to stop - well fuxing hey that is not what the pointer says I got it is something completely different but hey another part of the game that is rigged.
- Expedition kind of shitty rewards still have not figured out what Expeditions is supposed to accomplish in this game.
-game is still garbage to play - just not random team solo - complete fecal hole for lousy fuxing players.  In random team solo you will lose quite a bit in here to these facts:
None card players 
Shiitty very shiiiiiiiiiittty card placement players (they do not know game so you will have to carry the fuxtard)
Rigged a lot in random team solo as well for in game boots - how and why is anybodys' guess
-There are lots of whining little shiiits in here that will complain u wrote fart and have you banned - so if you cuss expect to get banned -- humm interesting if you operate on USA soil as a Corp/LLC/Co. of any kind you have to follow USA Constitution - last I checked cussing is not illegal in the USA - maybe a class action lawsuit is due at this point against the Dev's - Gm's would be a great class action lawsuit!
Closing game is garbage just remember lots of little millienial bitch boys in here that get brownie points for collusion to have people banned in chat - and last but not least -- FUCK YOU DEV'S FUCK U CRYING GM'S AND FUCK U WHINERS IN THE GAME FUCK THE FUCK OFF
PLay the Game if you like going against the establishment in the game top players month after month at the top no new names at the top for over a year garbage forget it matchups garbage missions garbage - game play rigged against the non paying player over time forget it move on shitttttttttttttttgame!"
16799,fun to pass the time
16800,Its A brilliant little casual game to unwind to.
16801,"Its a great game! learning how to counter enemy minion / cards with your own, learning to manage your mana, all good stuff. i recomend trying and its free!"
16802,"i get this game before this game become f2p i though this game near become dead game so developer of this game make this game become f2p but i misunderstand thou can play this game very quick thy don't wait for match very long from day i write this review i don't wait over 1-2 minute per match
this game is card game rule of this game is simple if thy play heartstone before thee will understand all rule of this game but one thing this game better heartstone is fight animation of monster heartstone don't have this system
if thou play this game and feel fun ye can buy dlc of this game or buy item in shop of game for developer of this game will have money for buy food
merit of this game
1.this game is f2p poverty player can have game for play
flaw of this game
1.bug in challenge mode after thou fight foe in challenge they give error message and i win other foe but i still don't fight with him and i don't get item from win foe
2.i found crash while play this game"

16806,"A very straightforward summoning/moba creep fighting game.
♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡
Pros~
- Has a short but very fun pve/single player mode. Will last for only an hour or so but it's fun and in the expert range it can get challenging.
- The only grinding is with having access to which tower defender you use. But in terms of cards... it's pretty open and there is no such thing as different card tiers or whatever. Your cards are all equal it's just a matter of fighting different tower defender classes if that makes sense. This is a lot~ more preferable than having to deal with different card tiers and all the hassle and grinding issues that come. Plus there are free rotations on the tower defenders so you'll have some variety until you unlock them all over time.
- Gameplay is really straightforward and in some ways is a fancy game of counters. Basically opponent plays x and you have to know how to best counter it with your cards and then they'll counter your counter and repeat. It's not hard to pick up but it definitely has a lot of depth for strategies and mastering.
- Mechanically very smooth and I appreciate the keyboard integration versus having to always move your mouse back and forth like in other similar games.
♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡
Cons~
- The menu UI is not only buggy but at times it's just simply confusing and messy. I think a normal menu UI would be more effective rather than the current idea of trying to make it all immersive with clicking on different buildings and then having icons scattered all over the place. It looks like a cheap mobile game visually with its menu.
- Games are sometimes too fast paced but maybe that's what the game is looking to be. But be wary games can end in 2 minutes and games won't go on for long.
- Combat is at times too fast to the point that it feels like on generating pushes and more on simple card vs card play. The creeps/minions will kill each other fairly quickly and so it creates a lot of need to just counter summon constantly versus ever having breathing room to for example stack up for a big creep wave summon etc.
- The map is a bit too small imo and that also is why games are so crunched and fast. It's like a summon = a fight already versus having the time for minions to travel a bit. That said the two lane idea is decent especially with the passive exp bridge control battles.
♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡
Overall~

Fun game and for those who like this genre I think this game has potential. It's a fun card/summoning game with the need to do constant decision making and calculations. Imo the game would benefit from a slightly bigger map or at least more added map variety in the long run. That would be interesting especially if route lengths are drastically different. For example... what happens on a map where there's a short route but then also a longer route? You could queue up units on the longer route or totally ignore it and rush the short point and hope to end the game before the long route inevitably becomes fully controlled and causes you to lose.

But great setup with decks and I appreciate the minimal grind necessary. It's hop in and just play and eventually you'll collect the rest of the tower guardians and cards."
16807,good fun times  happy
16808,"This game is fun and easy to play. God to try for free but might get bit addictive and end up as ""pay to win""."
16809,nice easy fun game
16810,"Easy to get in to.  So far doesn't seem to be pay to win, but I've really only been playing for an hour or so.
"
16811,"Minion Masters is a pretty simple mix of a card game with some ""RTS"" elements. It reminds on mobile games, but with more functions and a bigger focus on tactics. It's a good game, if you search for someting that you can play now and then, because each round only lasts a few minutes and its easy to get into it. 
It's not pay to win, you can get all cards also by winning games and collecting ingame currency and the ""normal"" cards are also often very good.

[b]7/10"
16812,Simple for Simple People.
16813,"A fun, casual game that utilizes deckbuilding and minion placement/timing skills. Relatively generous, pretty fun in small bursts, and frequent updates and events. Play time is short because I played a lot on the discord version and the accounts are separate."
16814,This is so much fun!
16815,Love that it's not turn based
16816,Cool
16817,So good so far... altrough i played a few games... so at higher level... could be tilted people :'D

Id recommend this game to everyone +++++"
16828,Love this game!
16829,"Crappy servers, takes forever to load anything. Game itself is not that bad, but until you get some proper servers i'm not even going to bother with this game."

Like orphans or re.tards maybe both ? Then this game is totally for you. First 100 game you will play with bots. Then you will play re.tards and autists all around the world thanks to Steam. And IT'S FREE. Enjoy."
16851,Simple and fun.
16852,"Loving this game, its kinda like Tower Defense but also not, different type of gameplay but super fun!"
16853,awesome game highly reccomend
16854,Fun so far
16855,"New F2P model is garbage. Wait a month every month to catch up to the meta or pay $10. These updates used to be further apart but cheaper and didn't have this P2W feeling.

The last season pass was shorter than normal but the price did not change. The cards released were too strong for their cost and they left it mostly overpowered until the season pass was over. They nerfed the cards when it became available for free players to earn, kept it overpowered while it was exclusive to paying players."
16856,"Es muy entretenido, pero la traducción al español deja bastante que desear. Conclusión , en inglés es un 7"
16857,"A very easy game to pick up and start.
However it seems like it might have some deeper aspects of play, i'll investigate by playing more.

Whatever it is, a very good game to pick up and relax with."
16858,"Ive played for approximately 20 minutes, but I am already hooked. Def gonna get addicted to this one,"
16859,Game is very good. It`s easy to learn and hard to master. Only thing that I do not enjoy is the voice acting. Brings back scary memories of 8 bit horror games.
16860,for free game is EPIC...  worth trying it and playing it...
16861,"Strong, unique mechanics, but could do with more impactful decisions; ie when you first place a card there should be a small delay before the creature can start attacking. otherwise a well polished game. 

Upgrades for card types to change their skins or mechanics? Something to allow particular card progression or synergy between cards etc would be good."
16862,"Be me.
Conquest for guild, 1 win (9k+ points), 1 loss in team battle.
Be away for 5 minutes, come back, queue to team battle again.
'you or your team mate have disconnected' -> DEFEAT! 1W:2L;
Quit game, run some CMD stuff to check packet loss on my 1 gigabit optic fiber ethernet connection (all good)...
Launch game.
Queue to team battle again.
'you or your team mate have disconnected' -> DEFEAT! 1W:3L;
There goes the EFFIN' cycle.

16864,just started seems fun.
16865,"Fun game, I like trying to make a good deck of cards. Cards are pretty."
16866,decent game
16867,"This game is easy to pickup and learn, best feature is the team battle. More games like this need a feature like that."
16868,"Fun game!
Try it once and you will have nothing to regret.
Enjoy!"
16869,"""Hands down, the best choice."" - Ravager the Hero from Minion Masters

Okay, honestly though, this game is super fun! Especially with a friend. I know that the screenshots might make it seem boring, but trust me, once you put in a few hours and learn the basic mechanics on how to win a game, you will be cruising with a win streak!

 Minion Masters is a fast paced game for people who enjoy strategy & card games. You can clearly see that the BetaDwarf devs are working hard on this game to make it even more fun & balanced. You can play this game however you desire. If you enjoy being competitive, awesome! You can earn an opportunity to participate in the monthly ""King Puff Cup Tournament"". If you enjoy a game just for the gameplay, also awesome! The expeditions, mayhem, & Draft Mode will be perfect for you to try out!

The in-game shop rotates daily & often times, you will get a good deal on an item, or even get some items for FREE!

Another good thing about this game is that you can get involved with Twitch streamers & their community who often stream Minion Masters to win Minion Masters giveaways (Dwarf Packs), or BetaDwarf emails you codes for in-game content. which is also super awesome for Minion Masters & the Twitch community.

The only bad thing(s) about this game is that some people can play total ""cheese"" decks, you cant really change your key binds, & that you can purchase Rubies with IRL money to get in-game content. (It is not really a pay-to-win, but more like a pay-to-gain)"
16870,So much fun. Addicted first game. 3 days into PC
16871,"Really nice game so far, I'm enjoying it."
16872,fun game
16873,"Great game for people like me that got bored with League Of Legends. 
Fun and fast paced....
The only downside is people with money to spend on items ""Can't really call them gamers"" can advance more quickly than real players that earn their rank and rewards."
16874,"Interesting so far not super stingy with the early loot which is nice will have to play more to judge how easy is to maintain a free to play status, but i have enjoyed what i have played so far"
16875,Fun.
16876,find ich gut
16877,"Great game. 
Cant say much, just started."
16878,yes
16879,"Very Funny and i´m totally banished xD
"
16880,it fun xd
16881,pretty good
16882,"Minion Masters for the most part is a relaxing time waster. The short matches and easy play style make it a nice game to just unwind playing. Paying for items does not grant you insta-win, and everything (cosmetics aside) can be unlocked by playing. I paid for a battle pass because I can and it didn't really do much, I unlocked more things quicker but I didn't become better nor did I regret it.

2v2 with a friend is good fun, whilst refining and perfecting your deck and strategies in 1v1 is also good fun.

Hearthstone with characters that run and attack each other.

It's free just try it!"
16883,"The game is fun to play and is still kinda playable on older hardware.
Waiting time for ranked matches mostly is between 1 and approximately 40 seconds and the matches don't take forever, so it's not too much of a pain in the S when playing with random players.
It's even working great on Linux with Proton/SteamPlay.
And after all, it's free to play."
16884,The game is really addicting and fun

16898,"A fun little time sink, as heroes and units get added you can see how well the dynamics start to evolve."
16899,Very fun game with deck building and nice 3d art and some tactics invovled. Unfortunatelly unbalanced.
16900,Don't pay any money for this game until the Devs stop changing it. You buy Rubies with money to buy cards etc or for each Season Pass which used to be Free. 1: Save your Gold and buy Spin Tokens. 1 Spin Token costs 1k Gold and gives 1 random card plus Blue Shards. 2: Use Blue Shards to unlock your favourite cards then max them out. Once maxed out you gain more Blue Shards every time you get the card. Keep doing that and you'll soon have a full deck...
16901,Good for when you are bored.
16902,It's a no from me!
16903,NIPNIOINO ITS FUN
16904,so far so good just started

16909,"Fuckin love this game, almost like heartstone but much funnier and way better :)
"
16910,"Love it!  when I finally decided to try Minion Masters out I was very skeptical at first, I had played a few games similar and it was just placing troops on the field and hoping for the best, However Minion Masters has a skill quality about it if you pay attention, it also helps to be lucky as well...lol...the one thing I am worried about is the pay to win aspect most games these days put out there, and while I understand that is how they pay for the game, I think it is a bit too much. My hope is that this game doesn't make it quite that bad and  gives everyone a chance to be on top. either way this game is a 8 out of 10, or 4 stars in my book."
16911,"Cool game, skay"
16912,so dank
16913,"clash royal with the pc privilege , i love this game <3"

16918,nice clansh royale
16919,Gr8 gem 8/8
16920,Every season it is the same: the devs introduce OP bullshit cards.
16921,"Minion Masters is a friendly and approachable deck-building game for quick pvp sessions without the baggage of its more serious brethren. This game is ridiculously easy to learn and you'll be slapping together your clown fiesta of a deck and smashing that ""Battle!"" button in no time.

However, you must not commit to a deep and meaningful relationship with Minion Masters. Like some people we dislike and won't mention their names but will pointedly think of them as we type, it definitely has noticeable flaws. But if you treat the game as a casual diversion that's meant to be enjoyed in small infrequent bites as opposed to cramming the entire thing in your mouth, then there is definitely a bit of fun to be had. 

Oh and try the 2 v 2. It's good.

[h1]7.5 / 10[/h1]"
16922,Awesome game. Worth a try.
16923,"A fun little game with a surprising amount of content.

Choose a master and build your deck of units to fight for you.

2v2 is probably my favorite, honestly.

Totally worth trying."
16924,"This game is a lot of fun , I enjoy it !!"
16925,Good stuff
16926,"Chill game buy still very competitive :D 
I enjoy it :D !"
16927,"Very sleek Arena Brawler which is a lot of fun, with streamer features, a very fair dlc and micropayment system, which doesn't try to trick you into bad decisions - if you already own something you buy in a pack, the system will compensate you. It's a card based game and you can obtain cards by buying card packs faster than through normal progression, you decide if thats bad. I dont care, because you dont need all cards to compete and its a common trading card system. The game is superpolished and fun with a huge long time motivation.

I suggest buying the master dlc, which is cheap and you get all current and future masters for free. Its basically the full-version of the game."

16945,Its fun.
16946,I love this game so far. Its free and I don't feel constantly pressured to buy coins or a battle pass. Which actually make it much more likely that I will in the future. I would compare it to Hearthstone or other card games. But it has more action. So far in the short time I have played I'd say A+
16947,Minion Masters is easy to learn and fun to play. I love it!
16948,"It's fun, it's fast, it's colourfull. Still in the lower league where it is ramming low level minions. So I'm excited to see what higher levels do."
16949,"The game is pretty fun, not p2w like clash rolyale."
16950,Quite fun.
16951,"The game with incredible potential is unique and addictive but beware! the developers are bad! first of all they have been killing the game for 2 years with a huge loss of players! the game could be e-sport with temporary game modes or new modes, nothing! just 2 cards per season with the battlepass, the developers are on another game, they don't listen to the opinions of the players and the community. The game took a wrong turn, whose fault is it? TO DEVELOPERS.
The developers don't care about the game and the community and more particularly the former players who keep the game alive and who invest themselves, ANY RESPECT? NO POLICY AND NO THANK YOU OR COMPENSATION for those who keep the game alive who would otherwise have been dead for a long time! RUN AWAY ! developers deserve nothing! the developers do not respect anything or anyone, no civility.


Be careful if you want to invest in improving the community and toxic behaviors on the game, there is a button to report these behaviors, but the developers do not appreciate that we use it wisely to try to improve the community!

Try to talk to them? impossible! as does getting active communities heard and rewarded. don't waste your time, they don't deserve it!

SHAME ON YOU DEVELOPMENT TEAM! you know very well what I am talking about.
Do not invest yourself, they will not see it and you will have no return and no thanks.
Cordially"

16964,Fun fast paced game! Love the style!
16965,i remember playing a shitty version of this game it was huge at the time on mobile where you had 2 lanes 3 towers. the main differnce is in the advancement in this game i dont have to get the same of cards to make them stronger they are just as strong as they are its free. and the heros as well. all set it apart yeah not bad. more lords hero blokes plz
16966,"-I had a private argument with the community manager on discord.

16970,"Seems interesting,  simple entertainment."
16971,"I don't really get why a lot of people are saying this game is P2W.

I haven't spent a single dime and have 141 out of the 155 cards there are (at the moment) in the game.

The ladder rewards you every time you achieve a new higher rank and it's reset every month or so: so you can get 100 rubies once a month just for climbing to gold and if you know some RTS game basics you can keep climbing up to diamond very easily.

Leveling up your account also rewards gold, shards and rubies.

This is a game where playing smart is better than grinding

Fast rts game, easy to grasp, hard to master.

16986,This game is brilliant!
16987,"A fun top-down, deckbuilding, hearthstone-like rts game. 
I've played for a little more than a week and I can say it felt balanced until I ranked up. I got to Silver Lvl 4, in basic public 1v1 games, where I started noticing my opponent playing cards that cost 2000 credits. THOSE cards were OP but, theoretically, you can buy them playing for free. It's one of those HUGE-timesinks that f2ps are known for.
 
I'd suggest if BetaDwarf wants to never worry about P2W tarnishing their rep., they'd make players pay a cheap price of 4.99 for the full game and BALANCE IT. I'd totally keep playing, but I've lost too many times now cause someone played an OP 2000-shard card. I can't wait 6 weeks, playing this as my ONLY game, just to get 1 2000-shard card when there's maybe 20ish of them in total that make ""fairness"" a dream. 


If you're a free player, I'll explain the currency and grind. 
-You earn gold the fastest and the best thing you can buy, for free, are Power gems(LOOT CRATES). Some daily challenges can land you a rare/supreme/orange Powercrate... so that's nice and fair. You know though, RNG... rares maybe land 15% of the time. Get it?
-You earn blue shards as a bonus from the powergems(15-green common card, 35-blue, 75-purple/orange cards) and save for whichever card you want to buy THEREFORE any card can be bought for free. Here's the grind-pacing: Play for an hour, you may earn 125 blue shards through challenges. 125 shards can buy you 1 blue card(anywhere from 2-mana cards, to 7-mana cards). You can buy common green cards for 35 shards... you'll earn those very fast. Took me 9-10ish hours for those. 
-NOW FOR CARDS THAT HAVE LONG GRINDING TO GET: The NICE ones are worth 2000 shards/???equivalent ruby amount as I've mentioned.
-You save rubies, primarily as I've observed, for Masters. They have passive attacks that you rely on to kill enemy-minions that win your card-fight-tradeoffs. The default guy is an archer that shoots arrows at enemies that cross the bridges, As you kill enemies you unlock perks in tiers that speed up the pace of the game until either your tower or your opponent's is destroyed. Stormbringer(Archer): 1(20xp): Global range of passive arrow shots, 2(60xp): Ranged units get 2+ range, 3(120xp): Double attack-rate for passive arrow shots. 
-LONG GRIND MASTERS: 1500 shards or 775 rubies. Rubies are earned very slowly and are obtained through powercrates but slower than shards. They're like rare shards.

If you can tolerate the following slow-a** currency build-up... then by all means play this, but remember that F2P games that do this to players suck all your time from playing other amazing games you may want to play. I said the expensive 2000-shard rare cards may've taken me 6 weeks to save for. It's a nice game, but I want a middle-thumb for this review, but I've played MWO, WoT, Card Hunters, Paladins, Hearthstone, Eternal, GW2, WoW... etc. and I can say I'd rather play ONE of those if they were full games with no in-game shops. Minion Masters is great; a great addition to unoriginal F2P games that make me want to pay them a full price purchase so they can balance this like games once were like. 

The F2P model has to die. BetaDwarf, just balance this and charge 4.99 for your simple game... and if you got ""a vision"" for a mmo-tcg or a tcg-rpg or a tcg-fps, then charge it for what it'd then be worth; Maybe 12.99. I'd love that type of growth, but F2P will limit Minion Masters from being anything pleasant and memorable. No one should ever pay maybe $30 for 1 master, when 15 years ago HALO 3 cost $50-60 around launch. A full game, not an in-game gun. I know Halo's a totally different genre of game here, but Halo was successful. Halo had a singular initial price, WoW was successful with a subscription price, Hearthstone is one good free tcg but imbalances have slowly made it another annoying f2p game...  just set a price and let us have fair fun.

-Anyways, new players, be warned. The devs will slowly add more 2000-shard cards to make your grind more annoying when you've earned all the normal stuff. They are extorting you to buy those cards with real money, and it won't fix anything. You want ALL the 2000-shard cards in an IMBALANCED TCG??? No, you shouldn't at least."
16988,gud
16989,"im good at it for now but ill probably get destroyed later so for now its pretty goob
"
16990,"Very fun and addictive game.  Highly recommend if you're a casual or competitive player.  The wacky decks are too funny,"
16991,This game focuses on the basic concept of using cheaper units to counter more expensive ones.  It has a very hands-off and visually attractive battle style which allows you to focus on making snap decisions to counter units.  Very quick learning curve.
16992,its very good if you read the game
16993,"Found the game in my steam inventory. Not sure what to think about it from the screenshots, I noticed TotalBiscuit had praised the game pretty generously. Being a big fan of TB (may he rest in peace), I decided to give the game a try while watching TB's video on it. 

I'm only abouy an hour in, but I love it. I played quite a bit of Clash Royale, but the Pay2Win business model with card leveling (which actually increased the stats of the cards) really turned me off from that game. Minion Masters doesn't have nonsense like that, and it plays very smoothly.

@The Devs: If you could port this game to the Nintendo Switch, I'd be playing this game so much. It seems like a match made in heaven."
16994,"Please don't ask me to review, but it's a fun game:)"
16995,"Minion Masters. Name a better video game. You can't. This game has it all. Nudity, puzzles, storyline, swearing, use of drugs, it has everything. Me and my friend have like 600 hours in this game and we are ranked top 5 in the world. I recommend."
16996,"playing with a friends, games alright, little repetative, with limited options for diversity in troops. [so far] im still low level. but still its a fun little game."
16997,"Good

16998,"Fucking broken game ! every battle i get killed by a guardian that protects everyone from being damaged,followed by an enchantress that heals everyone around him including that new stormy card that has too much range,damage and IS GETTING FUCKING HEALED BY THE ENCHANTRESSS. this is nonsense, i can play some day and win 98 % of my games and when i play in team, my team mates have no synergy at all, no combo whatsoever and most of all, dont play fucking cards and leaves in the middle of a game. thats not all... if your teammate leaves a battle, you AUTOMATICALLY LOOSE and cannot finish your battle... i have been loosing rank at 3 second of the start of a fight because the guy just simply disconected... i uninstalled paladins for the same kind of bug ! and the fact i keep playing with kids, for fuck sake put an age restriction or a game list they should have complete before gaming to precise strategy game !!! tired of playing with noobs. just played 10 game alone and won 9. and then played 2 game 2v2 and lost both . my team mate played 1-2 card then stopped playing for over a whole minute wasting over 10 mana. then I lost because he did FUCKING NOTHING... FUCKING TEAM MATES STAYS AT 10 MANA WITHOUT DOING A FUCKING THING ! MY FUCKING CARD FAILS TO PLAY AND MY MANA GET SPENT ANYWAY ! WOW... GG ... 1v1 = 99.9 % WIN. 2v2 = 100 % GAMES LOST ! FUCKING USELESS NOT ABLE TO GET RID OF A FUCKING SCRAT AND I SPIT FREAKIN FIRE EVERYWHERE. Criss de jeux de marde chaque caliss de fois que j'ouvre le jeu. pas une criss de fois que les teammate defende comme il faut. je me trouve pu bon a gagner, jme trouve bon a rester le plus longtemps avec mon teammate qui leaves the game. Bravo betadwarf, you suck at fixing your game and people who plays plays like my fucking grandma"
16999,"This game is  great.

The P2W haters are wrong: just download the client and take a look at the leaderboard tab. You will see the the exact builds of the best players. Nothing P2W.

I won a lot of cards and currencies for free that I still hold because I need to figure out how I will spend money on this game, not for getting better, but to thank the devs.

For a free game I got a lot of fun for free and I really feel guilty. 

- The best thing in this game is its price: it's free.
- No, the best thing in this game is its duration: 1-8 min => usually games are around 3-4 min. Even with a heavy schedule, one can squeeze a game here or there... And if you have more time you may fall in the ""just one more game syndrome"".
- No the best thing in this game is the limited randomness: with a deck of 10 cards, your combo is more likely to happen, and enemy rotation is more predicable.
- Yes the best thing in this game is the gameplay: when you are almost dead because the enemy surprised you once, but not twice and you clutched big time to victory!

Awesome game."
17000,"Stay clear of this pay2win garbage!!
Enjoy the game crashing after few games! Looks like game code done by monkeys with only 2 fingers.


Absolute total garbage game made by peasants for peasants. No wonder this garbage game has to be free2play business model. No one would play if MM required purchase."
17001,SHITS DOPE
17002,Great Game. it's a mix between a MOBA and a typical card game.
17003,"Funny and fast. Matches last between 2 to 4 minutes in general. that´s about the time i spend in WoT waiting for the round to start.. so .. 

it is  NOT p2w in my opinion, because you can earn everything for free. I played for a month now and collected over 50% of all available cards and did not pay a cent for cards."
17004,You got some spare time and wanna have fun ? ? ? Perfect game
17005,"there needs to be more free rubies in game, pretty much p2w at the moment since most items cost massive amounts of rubies you don't get as free player, also seasonal pass rewards more cards to players that spent rubies. there is no free ruby give away for you to buy your seasonal pass, rarity drops are bad and therefore eventually as a free player you will get screwed over, go enjoy playing something else better"
17006,very fun to play
17007,its kinda fun tbh. quick paced still seeing how it pans out so far fun
17008,"Well, after seeing the steam-charts, its easy to see why it has no population.  Though they have  ranking system, it is a cash grab game. Grinding for random spins on useless cards sucks. But if you have lots of cash, get those extra rare cards and win every time! It was fun until you hit the higher ranks and loss to unbalanced card decks.

UPDATE: Also note that there a lot of losers to deal with, there is no reporting feature and no penalty when they drop a match on you, causing you the loss. There is some that build crap decks to get their Glory count high, but useless as a teammate, as they are hoping for a carry."
17009,"Unlike many other games with this type of style, it opens up the ability to create different play styles, with different 'masters', a (Semi) wide variety of minions, and just the full customization of the game!"
17010,Fun little game if you dont have too much time to spare and just wanna play a few rounds. Would rate 8.5/10
17011,"Hey everybody,

This is essentially a deeper version of Clash Royale without any P2W mechanics like leveling cards to make them do more damage or have more HP. This is something that does not happen in this game, and instead of bland archers and a king at your tower you have a hero who levels up and gets abilities throughout the game.

You also have new ideas like unit interactions based on type of unit, XP management through holding the bridges and generally just cooler stuff going on.

I highly recommend it as a lighter, more fun RTS."
17012,This is a good game!

17026,I love playing Magic the Gathering and this is similar! It's supper fun to play!
17027,Game is pretty easy to learn. Games are short but i imagine they get longer the higher rank you go. Grab a friend and hop in together.
17028,Best P2W game I've ever played. 10/10 would spend money on the game!
17029,Easy to pick up and play for some relaxed minion mastering
17030,"Seems fun for a short while... and then you get your backside handed to you... almost every damn match, which leads me to believe that the matchmaker is garbage. Try it out (it is free after all), stop right in time and do not spend money you could use to support or even buy other games."
17031,its fun to play with a friend
17032,Basically Clash Royale but I can do ladder 2v2 which makes me super happy Q_Q
17033,A free game that tries to be a cash-grab of Hearthstone... Why would you?

17046,"good game
"
17047,fun game!
17048,"Thoroughly enjoyable game, and nothing else quite like it on steam.
Easy to get into, but has a real depth to it - you find yourself picking up new strategies by losing to better players, and can constantly refine your decks and play-style.  Early matches largely against bots to ease you in, but you will rapidly progress to the leagues where you will play vs active players in every match, and the difficulty jumps a notch.

This game is genuinely F2P, and you can get up to the top tiers of the game without needing to pay.
If you choose to pay, you can expect far more flexibility in your deck building options early on, and faster progression through battle passes etc, but cash does not increase your ability to win.

Has a small but very active community.
I love the fast paced, short matches on this - a game can be over in as little as 1 min, but a real slugging match could (rarely) last for 10.

Great fun solo or co-op.  The combination of real time + cards words really nicely.

Definitely recommend giving this a try for something different.
"
17049,It's a neat little thing ain't it.

dayly its beeing argued about it if it is,
new players say yes,
streamers moderators whales and veterans say no
i wonder why

they keep the game unbalanced
(i wonder why)

moderators are whining snowflakes with double standard
chat banning and warning to ban people like myself for saying stuff like in my case
this f**king troll (with the context that my teammate purposedly self destructed our units)
or people with names wich can be taken one way or the other
depending on interpretation

while at the same time people with names like Hitler, Black (or other) C**k etc
can straight insult one and not just get away with it but be the one to get you chat banned
(if they have a higher rank, whatever that might imply... i wonder why)

i even made a 2nd account and tried how it is when you buy some premium currency and registrate as a streamer
""somehow"" it ""feels like""

17068,"FIX GUILD CONQUEST

I'm not happy about leaving a review like this as MM used to be a good little game, however:



Each season brings new over-powered cards into the game (which pushes micro-transactions). I personally earn the ""special currency"" rubies via free2play methods, though it gets stale when every new card is overpowered.

The balance of particular cards are never fixed.

The balance of particular masters are also not balanced. Ratbo has become bottom tier, and Apep is not played in higher tiers (presumably due to issues like getting combustion as a free card from his perk way too often).

Guild conquest matches are severely rigged against your odds the moment you activate them and require you to play the game every day.

Matchmaking sometimes consistently pairs you with very very bad players in 2v2 even at the highest skill tier.

The GUI is not very well designed and makes you click all around the screen too many times simply to navigate around the game.

The game is poorly optimized and taxes CPU hardware too much.

In random 2v2 if your teammate leaves the match in any form (even an instant disconnect/crash) you take a loss to your rank. There has been zero implementation to remedy this punishment and repeat offenders and trolls do not get bans or anything.

In random 2v2 some players manage to reach high ranks from being carried by their teammate despite their lack of skill - often they run bad decks that have an average mana cost of around 7 instead of the general rule of thumb that is 3.5. You could play for fun and have a high win:loss ratio, but as soon as you have an important match (bordering the next rank and guild conquest) you get paired with these players.

Earning gold (the main currency) is far too slow. There is little incentive to keep playing when you don't gain anything and go down in rank when you lose. A small gold bonus would make losing streaks on bad days much more tolerable.

When the devs can stop the guild conquest algorithm from pairing you against unfair match-ups, I will remove my negative review. It is unbelievable that being in Grand Master (the highest tier) in both random and premade 2v2 consistently (top 100 at that) and one rank below that for 1v1 as a casual player, and then rank resetting down to Silver tier still gives you trouble every time you activate guild conquest. You can win 15 games in a row because you outclass the beginner players, but as soon as you press that button you lose three times in a row out of nowhere. This game should not induce the stress it does. It is a surprise that new players even bother to play nowadays with the unbalanced cards and match-ups.


This game is fun, but I worry about the direction the game is following at this point in time as of the past few weeks. If the devs could keep the game balanced and most of all make the matchmaking system better, I wouldn't have an issue. Please fix the guild conquest system. Generally matchmaking is very fast in normal matches, but guild conquest matchmaking takes a suspiciously long time in comparison. Rigging guild conquest is not fun. If you don't want players to get rewards that easily, then balance the rewards, don't make the matches unfair and unenjoyable.



*Edit*

Since the game became available on discord, and became free, the devs manipulated the meta into a pay to win design. Each season players are pushed into using the few OP cards until the game is stagnated with no fun in sight. Guild conquest is still horribly broken and it gets worse considering the amount of losses you take from the constant crashes this past month or so. I can't even close my game properly without force crashing it and waiting for it to disappear. I will not be changing my review back to a positive one, and the devs won't be seeing a single dollar from me.
Aaaaaaand now my decks have been deleted out of nowhere.."
17069,easy to learn. 2h and counting.
17070,"Nice game and especially NO pay to win! The 17th player in the global 1v1 Highscore has 6/10 cards that are beginner cards (cards that you can easily obtain or already have from the beginning). Considering this it shows that even beginner cards are still viable in the end-game and it depends on how you play the game, keep your objectives etc."
17071,"Just getting started.. Not a single loss this far, might be a game to play for a long time! :D"
17072,sad game :(
17073,A fun little combat card game. It is real-time instead of turn-based but you get the benefit of seeing your card actions instead of just cards on a table. There are some limitations but generally fun to play.
17074,Stopping now that have all the achievements.  Well done blend of card and strategy!
17075,"I like this game becouse:

17082,"great combination of moba, card game and tower defence"
17083,"surprisingly fun , better to play with friends"
17084,"The game is very enjoyable so far! I have played a lot of games in the genre and this is definitely one of the best! Minion Masters has much potential, especially if they manage to successfully port it on other platforms such as mobile and browser. I recommend developers to prioritize preserving balance and F2P model. Balance and fair mechanics is what truly makes an enjoyable experience. Recommended for every strategical mind! ;)"
17085,Maybe the best game i ever played this year!
17086,"nice

17100,very enjoyable.  matches don't last long and it's agenst others
17101,"This game feels so great!Can't stop playing it,fluid gameplay and in real time too,amazing"
17102,collecting cards is fun battle graphics are cool as long as you keep everyone on a level playing field it will be a great game
17103,funny and interesting little arena type
17104,Game seems fun and is free to play. Worth trying it out.
17105,"I played the game for 2 minutes. Upon noticing the fact that the game did not have an exit button, one can only assume that the developers are either:
a) did not think this through entirely
b) don't know how to make an exit button in a video games (it's 2019 and games have had exit buttons in a menu since the video games existed (as far as I have been alive 1980's)
c) are trying to suck you into some malicious in-escapable black hole of death from, which, you may never return again

gl hf, hope this helps

edit: I had to jump in-game for another 5 minutes in order to post my review, so unfortunately was also subjected to the fact that:
-the announcer is a stupid caricature with an extremely annoying/demeaning voice/tone
-the game animations are lackluster for something that has literally 0 real-time interaction beyond clicking a card
-I was able to instantly curse profanity into the general chat with (seemingly) no filters to protect innocent younglings from my bad-mouthed language
-the game seems like a lackluster clone of hearthstone, based on the same horrible matchmaking principles that keep you struggling along with just enough 'encouragement' (feeding you easy wins versus opponents handling a far inferior deck) to keep you playing, in hopes that you might get pissed off enough to spend money. 

Thanks, but I'll pass :)"
17106,"This is a very good game with no flaws and interesting gameplay that I will love and cherish forever please tell the developers ""good job sweet boys"" so they know how well they did"
17107,I love the interface. The game is smooth. I am really enjoying the game.
17108,"Great game, it has had it's issues but the devs work on everything, eventually. i would like to see people dealt for saying horrible things in the global chat"
17109,"Saw i had a gift of this game, gave it to random friend and installed it myself, now im addicted and this game is crack. Love the animations, a lot of what you get can be luck based so be warned,"

17121,"Cool game, nice graphics, a lot of loot, and I have no idea what Im doing so gg wp"
17122,Descent game it lacks powerful / longer matches but all in all a very good and well balanced game.
17123,thinking of gamers and what we want
17124,"So far for someone that never played this type of game, it's good. Kinda casual, but seems pretty hardcore on the higher tiers. Has built in broadcast, has a solid fanbase, I can't find anything bad about the game yet."
17125,"This is seriously a the PERFECT game for card game lovers. 

This game is seriously like magic the gathering and league of legends combined.
It's a lot of fun!! I highly recommend this for anybody into hearthstone or even any pc players really.

10/10"
17126,"This game is AWESOME. Super fun!!! I highly recommend it to card game players and top-down-style players as well as ""army-controlling-games"" players. Everything is achievable without paying real money and it has multiplayer and PvE! :-D   10/10"

17136,Really fun intuitive game.
17137,"Smooth controls, fun characters and enjoyable gameplay"
17138,nicmix of a trading card game and a tower building game.
17139,good quality game
17140,pretty good game !
17141,"Hearthstone and Single-Player League of Legends had a baby.
Worth checking out.



EDIT - I still think it's worth checking out, but the devs decided to add a ridiculous Master into the mix so I can't really see myself putting much more into the game."
17142,love it! simple but intense!
17143,FUN!
17144,"Nice game to chill awesome work guys! ;)
"
17145,vv
17146,Fun so far...
17147,"Decent game, got to diamond in a day. Once you get to diamond its all super powerful cards. Aka time to start paying money or stop playing."
17148,Great game fun with friends and very tough!
17149,"Clash Royale with a little more depth to it and not Pay to win, great game"
17150,Fun to play
17151,great fun game! not p2w..until now
17152,Way better than pay 2 win games on mobile.
17153,Challenging and very rewarding. Great for having fun
17154,addictive
17155,"I very love this game because the way that how the 2v2 works in this game is kinda fun. Would hope for more future content in this game. I wish we could play more 2v2 with some other mode with my friend here. Overall whether you lose or win in this game, it doesn't affect you much considering you are having much fun with the fast pace battle strategy genre style."
17156,in the 40 minutes i have played this i like it
17157,Good game!
17158,"Although the tiny community of players denies it up and down, and the developers themselves deny it, it's incontrovertible; this game is, like all TCGs, designed to suck your money. It just does it in a very gentle, gradual, inoffensive way. But it does it. Keep in mind that this is only relevant to its current incarnation. Hopefully the developers get take the blinders off. 

This game is fun as hell, and addictive, and free. But it has a minuscule audience. Why?

Here's a hint; If you have a deck that is absolutely killing it, you will invariably come up against a wall as you rank up. You'll be winning easily, an odd tough game here and there but nothing you can't handle, and then (always right after gaining a rank) you'll get squashed. 

Then you get to play 2 games or so in your former rank, and win like before...it feels fun and challenging but rewarding. Then you rank up again, and your handy dandy balanced deck is eaten alive by a Harbinger, a Colossus, a Red Golem, and a living statue backed up by a healer, That was my last game. And I swear, as it started the only thought I had was ""If he has double high HP minions, I am fucked"". 

Almost magically, the game delivered exactly that. My average game length of about 2-3 minutes was shortened to 1 minute 14 seconds. 

For the hell of it, I tried switching to a all-ranged minion deck with a Colossus next game I ranked up; my next opponent had 2 fireballs, a wall, melee minions (stun lancers too natch) and a laser turret. I never, ever see laser turrets in my games. Like, ever. Especially not one conveniently setup behind a delaying wall. Right in the path of my Colossus. Which I hadn't used in...gah, 20+ games. A wall, laser turret, AOE spells and melee minions seems pretty handy for killing a swarmy ranged/Colossus combo, doesn't it?

How conveeeeeeenient lol."
17159,Great game! only thing is my step son sucks!
17160,"This game is extremely fun and quick to get into and out. If you want to have a relaxing play, give it a go! It's a mini moba style game. Very addicting."
17161,Fookin nice
17162,Played few rounds and it seams as a fun game to play...there is a shop in game for real money but if its p2w ? idk...will find out :) would recommend to a friend.
17163,Fun game. Guild of xbowmen best card. Nerf irelia.
17164,just like clash royal
17165,Entretenio
17166,"I cant stop playing this game ...  I want to say this is the best free game i have played and IT'S NOT PAY TO WIN. i have been playing for a bit now and the game play is fast pace they update the game all the time 
"
17167,Awesome way to pass the time when needing mindless fun
17168,"i like the concept and the 2v2's are really fun seem balanced but i dont know to much about that but the game is very back an forth and enjoyable
"
17169,"Its fun , gives u a pc vibe to it , so its not like clash royale mobile games and whatever"
17170,enjoying it so far but have only played a couple hours
17171,"Minion masters is an excellent game in my opinion. It's being constantly developed and balanced, and new content is added at regular intervals. Battles tend to be quick and hectic, and I especially like the 2 vs 2 mode. I highly recommend it!"
17172,"I did not expect much from this game but I have to say that it is a lot of fun and I highly suggest that if you are even just a tad curious, download it and play it!  Its free so there is nothing to lose except hours of your time."
17173,good
17174,"easy to understand, wish there was a little less luck relent on getting cards, like having a few prebuilt decks that you could test out/buy for starting cards
"
17175,"It is fun, but I don't like the way this game forces me to write a review..."
17176,game told me to
17177,Very good game
17178,"Fun game, easy to learn."
17179,"Awesome game, ez to get into as well :)"
17180,Its good
17181,Good
17182,An AWESOME game and enjoy playing it a lot. Love it!
17183,games dope
17184,Dank
17185,Fun game melds a lot of different game styles together.
17186,great game pleasently suprised about the quality of all the menus the voices and the gameplay is fun and complex
17187,"Really fun and easy to get into and fairly high tempo for a ""card game""."
17188,"it's pretty good, games are fast, not too complicated, and regularly rewarding so you don't feel super pressured to throw money at the shop. also pretty balanced"
17189,"Surprisingly fun game, I'd give it a try if yu haven't yet"
17190,AWESOME FUN GAME PLAYING WITH A FRIEND 8/10
17191,интересная игра
17192,"play 1v1.
99% of teammates are toxic shitheads"
17193,IT IS AN EPIC GAME WELL I LOVE IT
17194,Honestly. The most fun I've had in one of these kind of games.
17195,"easy, fun and exciting..simple"
17196,good litle game
17197,it's a fun game to pass time
17198,Fun game got my hours worth easy to pick up reached diamond 1 in like 5 days of playing. You can also earn every card in game without spending any actual money. Fun to play 2 v 2's with friends as well.
17199,"This game is quick to grasp and seems to have some depth. I enjoy the quick matches, and when I do get a longer one it feels really good. So far I have enjoyed it."
17200,"Much like clash royale mechanics , as you may of read in the other reviews. However, A lot more balanced and you don't need a lot of high tier/legendary cards to turn a match over in your favor."
17201,is fun i likey
17202,"Is really interactive,i like the mechanics ,animations,strategy based and fast decisions.There is not much left to be changed or updated for now ,lets enjoy the game peeps."
17203,It's alright. Nothing hugely special but a good game to sit back and relax to.
17204,nice game
17205,"PSA Warning: 
This game can ruin your life. 
More addictive than crack!

Easy to learn hard to master makes this game a perfect 5 of 7"
17206,yes
17207,yeeeeeeeeeet
17208,"pretty good game so far, will edit after more time in"
17209,If you liked Clash Royale this is pretty much that just better. The monetization in this game makes me wonder why I ever even bothered with Clash at all. So nice getting a card and not having to level it. The Masters and Bridge mechanics make the game more than just a slug-fest. I recommend it highly. 7/10 - Perfect Score.
17210,good
17211,"1) a lot of imbalance and devs refuse/lazy to make good balance (whole community agree about some broken cards being broken and no changes for months or fake changes like -10 dmg)

2) useless/fake updates which change nothing important

3) a lot of RNG in matchmaking (every month grandmasters are deranked to gold)

4) p2w or frustrating grind (hundreds of hours to get decent number of legendary cards)

5) using fake players (bots) in low ranks to make you feel like a skillful player

6) no options to mute/avoid toxic players in game

7) bugs not fixed for months"
17212,so fun and have good time chill and play
17213,"Minion Masters is basically a MOBA-ultralight, which sounds a lot more boring than it actually is. Quite the contrary, the game has a lot of depth with it's sheer bulk of minions, abilities and combos. A really great 1v1 or 2v2 game which kind of reminds of deck-building games, without really being one.

Monetization is also done in an acceptable degree, meaning there's no infinite grind and very good progression as well as a very addictive style of gameplay.

Probably one of the best F2P games I have played in the last couple of years, being both a fan of MOBA games as well as deck-builders.

And while overly cartooney, the art design isn't anything to scoff at either. So all in all, a brilliant game, for free."
17214,"So I played ""Clash Royale"" for a while, mostly to just play with friends but this game... I'm loving it as it's quite fun and polished even in its early stages. The game size isn't too big either so just give it a try and see for yourself."
17215,"This game it's a hidden gem, it's very addictive and fun to play, specially with a friend. The fact that is a hybrid of deckbuilder, MOBA, and tower-defense it's awesome. The game it's not pay 2 win at all, you can definitely outplay anyone (even a pay2win player) if you really know what you are doing. Progression in this game it's fun and rewarding.

So if you like  MOBA's, and tower-defense games give this game a try you won't regret it."
17216,"Mixed feeling about this game.

Pros:
-Engaging gameplay
-Really fun strategies

Cons:
-Seriously imbalanced, sometimes unplayable, not healthy
-Too much grinding until all masters are available for you to play (my opinion)
-Ranked system is broken completely

After DLC which gives you Collosus went free, pretty much every opponent you will face, is gonna run cheap, brainless strategy: play Collosus, play Healer, play Rage, win.

Not fun at all."
17217,"You're never going to get higher than plat. No matter what deck you play no matter how good you think you are. Plat is the highest you will ever get. Most of you won't even get past silver. So if you're in it for rank/competitive stop now. Unless you feel like investing over $500 then you might have a chance, but most likely not. If your'e in it to just have fun. its a good game to play for an hour or two. Being at low rank(bronze) is the most fun part of this game. You get to just go with it and play stuff. After gold rank its just not fun and becomes a pay to win game."
17218, i enjoy this game is very fun and easy to play
17219,Fun!
17220,.
17221,fun hybrid ftp romp with a generous reward system.
17222,Great game im having a lot of fun
17223,"I've been playing quite a lot of Minion Masters lately. While you get stuff unlocked pretty quickly at first, it slows down at around 5-10 hours of gameplay. After that you have to wait for expeditions and special modes for days and you only get 1 daily for around 1-3k gold per day. You get some rewards for a profile level up, but the profile leveling starts to take much longer - at level 50, a level always requires 10m experience (AFAIK) and I'm getting around 500-610 xp per second (1.8-2.2m/h) at level 27. I can already see the slower progression.

The blue and red currency that you get from power tokens, achievements and rank-ups comes at a slow rate, and so do the gold rewards for each game played. You need to play around 20 to 40 games in order to get 1k gold.

Blue currency buys you heroes, cards and card promotions. Red currency buys heroes, skins, arenas and power tokens, while gold buys you skins, cards on daily promotions (about 3-16k depending on rarity), power tokens (1k each), draft tickets (750) and mayhem runs (?).
 
A Power token gives you some blue and red currency and a card of random rarity (higher rarity = lower chance). Random indeed, it's most likely going to be something Common you own already. You can't sell the extra and rather your new card is added to your ""Glory"" by a very small amount. The rewards from glory are small from the beginning, only giving some power tokens for a small reward each time. While glory adds to your battle pass experience gain rate (and battle pass experience per pass level is always the same), I think it requires too much time investment to be made use of as an F2P player.

Many of the achievements low rewards in general and the one asking you to use a free token x amount of times is just too much - the reward for that is very small and only available around once every 23-24 hours.

The game is fun to play, but playing it competitively and unlocking most or all cards will take a long while. While I already have 73/151 cards and 4/8 masters after 11 hours, I think I will need another 11 hours to up that to 5/8 masters and 78-80/151 cards...the next unlocks taking longer and longer as an F2P. The chances for getting new unlocks or currency to buy masters is just that low.

I recommend playing the game co-operatively (Team Battle) with a friend for some time.

Edit: After reaching Master 4 in Team Battle at level 34 with 90/150 cards and 5 champions on me, I have noticed that certain legendary cards that cost the most to craft (or buy for premium currency) make f2p matches unbalanced. After all, not having a tank with an aoe shield ability makes it easy for your minions to get sniped with stormbringers full arena range. In the same way, not having a 3 mana legendary that gets shield, rage and frenzy when a spell is cast.. is bad, when some players have many of them in their deck. Just recruiting one costs 2000 shards --- and that will take way too long. Decks are better built for offensive heroes and combo decks, as just taking damage from stormbringers autoattacks on a more defensive hero or build makes it much harder to win trades.

Also, you barely gain any gold from matches later on.

Although I've never had a fully optimal build, it's because of the lack of balance and speed of unlocking new cards that I'm now done with this game."
17224,"I Need to be clear on this. The only reason i ever tried this game in the first place because it was free. The first 50 or so hours it seemed to be pretty fun and i joined a guild for the friends and rewards that came with it.  That being said, here are my pro's and con's.

PRO'S
#1 Free game! with free DLC!
#2 Game play and setup are easy to understand.
#3 easy to find people to play matches with.
#4 Guilds are easy to join and guild conquest can earn free items.
#5 Fun minions and animations (rag doll) etc.
#6 Some players and guild masters are actually cool. (Most are toads though)

CON'S
#1 Toxic community chat! 
#2 Hard to private message most players as a lot use symbols in names so you can not get a hold of them at all.
#3 The worst gamer names ever! people using profanities for names and generally being douche bags.
#4 Chat does not even work half of the time!
#5 Every game patch makes the game worse to play or even log in at all!
#6 random disconnects! This happens all the time! 
#7 Game will force a loss on you for another player not joining the match!
#8 Sometimes you log in and cards that you already owned will vanish never to be seen again!
#9 Most Twitch tv players are obnoxious and cancerous tools! (rank #1 player Dulcis) (Bad attitude from this guy and he even went on a rant and bashed the developers and moderators in-game yet still plays because he is good at nothing else)
#10 If you can even get the game to connect you can expect a random DC in the next half an hour!

I could say more about how this game is generally bad  and needs serious upgrading but you can figure it out yourselves if you dare play it.
In all honesty i could never recommend this game as it can give you a bigger headache than listening to your wife run her mouth!       Enjoy! or not! As of now i am uninstalling."
17225,"Pluses:
- very quick gameplay, games take little time and you can play many of them
- interesting rules that promote both thoughtful deckbuilding/plays and good reflex: bridge control, countering, cycling, etc.
- unique, fun card design - e.g. my favorites are Scrat Tank and Bahra, both of which have abiities no other card has. They are also nicely themed, e.g. Scotty and his cry or Troubadour taunting with annoying music
- 2v2 possibility, playing with a friend is always great
- clans, could be better implemented, but also quite unique in games related to collecting cards - they increase the social aspect of the game quite a lot
- quite fast F2P progression, especially if you watch Twitch streams
- decent balance, sometimes problematic, but in general many cards are playable and you can reach GM - highest non-competitive rank - with more or less basic deck. Biggest problem - wildcards
- funny art with nice, consistent themes, e.g. lovely Puffs that have nice emotes or Scrats that are weak on their own but like big machinery
- many useful features other big games like Gwent somehow can't introduce for a long time - spectator mode, replays

Minuses:
- worst matchmaker out of all CCGs I've played - obligatory ~200 games vs bots on early ranks in all modes and bots are terrible, very grindy ladder where time matters more than skill, premade 2v2s GM+Wood get bad/mediocre opponents which GM can often beat alone, premade 2v2s could be matched with randos (nt sure if fixed, wasn't in patch notes)
- no mobile version
- not enough regular advertising
- could use more achievements

Overall it's very addictive and I recommend it to both RTS and card game fans."
17226,no
17227,"It is fun my friends like it also.   I like it more than Heartstone.  Not totally the same game, but I start off with fare chance."
17228,its like clash royal very fun
17229,Great game!! Plays easy but remains challenging.
17230,Fun game!
17231,great
17232,"Great Game, Better than Clash Royale.

Pros:
Not P2W, if even P2W its very little
Cards don't level up like in clash causing you to spend tons of gold/gems
Ranking System
Fast games

Cons:
Matchmaking is a bit off - In terms of rank difference
Some cards could be balanced better
Could add a new hero, or buff some
Game is kinda easy - Made it to Master rank within less of a week of playing

Overall, good game."
17233,Played this game +200h and I still like it.
17234,"nice
10/10 fun with friends"
17235,"Well, better than Artifact that's for sure, and cheaper"
17236,Never thought i'd like the game. Installed it to play with friends. Had an absolute blast playing. Always great when a game surprises you so much it actually leaves you a bit speechless.
17237,"The game is not released yet, so comparing to other digital card games it lacks variety of cards and decks, but even with the limited selection it looks very very promising.
It takes best parts from RTS and CCG genres and provides surprisingly deep and exciting gameplay. First 20 hours when you climb through low ranks are amazing but somewhere in the middle of Platinum division you might notice that your skills and experience from other CCG like Magic and ES Legends are not working. 
At this stage I've almost decided to quit but then I realized that Minion master is REALLY UNIQUE add requires deeper understanding of the process than I thought.
If you like mindless clicking, shooting and spamming - this game is not for you, but if you are looking for an intelligent chess-like PvP with beautiful design and animation - don't hesitate to try it."
17238,Having lots of fun! Definitely would recommend!
17239,Fun game Easy to get into and play the battles are fast and decisive 2V2 is the best when you have a team member to talk to and out think you're opponets.
17240,"easy and fun to play
"
17241,"Solid game so far. Reminds me of clash of clans,  but a bit more production value.

Will update when I have played it abit more."
17242,Seems fun so far
17243,Fun and fair business model.
17244,"At first I thought this game was just another clone of Clash Royale and those sort of games. However, what I realized was that this game is addicting as hell! It has a simplistic approach to how to works so that anyone can easily understand it, while also being extremely strategic! There are so many cards to choose from that it keeps the gameplay fresh, while the art style can make it look appealing on any computer out there. By the way this game gives out so much loot, unlike other games where you're forced to wait hours or even days on end for a few cards :/

Props to the team behind this: It's a mastapeece"
17245,"According to older players the rate at which cards are nerfed its infuriatingly slow.
So im not gonna wait 3 years for cards like Shieldguard, Stormy or God Long All Mighty Xiao to be properly balanced.

The game was enjoyable and my road to Grand Master was smoth, the game its completely free to play and paying doesnt give real advantages since the ammount of usable cards is low.

That's one of my problems with the game: There are cards that are so incredibly situational or straight up trolling to play with.
And its not like 5 or 10, there are dozens of cards that never see the light of day.
Altough there is some variety to choose from so its not too much of an issue.
What truly bugged me and the reason i leave the game is the fact that cards used by 80% of the top 50 of the players are brutally strong and leave no room for counterplay or mana advantage (a mechanic in which you erase an enemy minion for a lower cost than the enemy had to pay for summoning it).
This game its kinda like a more interactive chest and certain units have no reasonable strategy or way to play around them.

Since older players dont say good things about balance (and since i keep getting destroyed by a single card that makes the game really unfun) i dont see a reason to play something that i dont enjoy.
It was a really nice experience to play a game with such a peculiar mashup of genres i have to admit.
But the genre of CG seems to be cursed and every single one of them that i played with, ended up sickening me.
Minion Masters isnt the exception (Slay the Spire is the exception what a good card game).
I have many other games on my library that i could be playing or starting for the first time so why would i be here playing something that i barely enjoy."
17246,Thumbs up
17247,"love  the  game  im having  a  blast   and  the  macanics  are  great
"
17248,The game is pretty dope. If you like Clash Royale this game adds a dope twist to it. Try it out. =]
17249,Great
17250,At the moment this game is probably best at what it does
17251,2
17252,guuud
17253,not bad
17254,"Pretty neat, little bit pay-to-win at first, unless you play 2-3 weeks without paying, than you'll be able to make a good deck from free rewards.

Edit: 189 hours in, completed all achievments, pretty fun game still."
17255,not too shabby
17256,vfbvhfg
17257,Simple concept with great depth of customization. Easy to learn and hard to master.
17258,"I cannot recommend  this game enough.

Yes it is like Clash Royale but at the same time it has a different flavour to it. Units are unique, deckbuilding is way more complex if you want it to be (there is unit race synergy) you get heroes from the getgo , wich changes the way every card plays and you can still use all the cards in the roster (no card restrictions depending on race) and the most important part it's incredibly easy on the wallet, no card levels and no p2w whatsoever. If this comes out on Android I'll drop Clash Royale on an instant even if I've been playing it fot 3 years and spent at least 120 dollars on it.
The only thing I dislike about this game is the fact that I heard from it 3 years after the release.

TL.DR:

-Super f2p, actually it's the best f2p game I've seen on the genre.
-Run's smooth as silk on any PC and still has beautiful graphics.
-Heroes and cards are diverse and unique.
-Easy to learn, hard to master depending on your playstyle.
-Think of it of a better Clash Royale, a mixture of the old Warcraft 3 map Castle Fight and Hearthstone."
17259,its a nice game and it dosen need much space in your pc
17260,Verry fun and cool concept nice to have some of that wc3 feeling
17261,"Look enjoyable and a good free to play (maybe play to win...)

Anyway, it's just 30 mins play right now....
I'll get back after 2-3 hrs play"
17262,"I won so many consecutive games by such a wide margin for so many hours of ranked play that it was suspicious. I suspect the game is programmed to pit you against bots disguised as players until you hit Silver, just so you win more. It would fit in with the rest of the early game design, which is to shower you with undeserved compliments and bright lights. When you level up the announcer literally says, ""Oh yeah, that number just went up!"" The designers know that they're manipulating your brain.

At the end of the day, this is a free to play game that does nothing interesting. It's basically Clash Royale, but a little less pay to win. If you were addicted to Clash Royale, back away from this game. It will do you no good. If you enjoyed Clash Royale and thought it added to your life in a meaningful way, maybe this game is for you."
17263,"Game is fun, but ultimately the grind is the same as any other ""collectible"" game (card or whatever else you wanna call it).  Top ""decks"" have legendaries and often purchased heroes, and at some point you just won't be as competitive without them.  

So grind it out or pay up, suckers!

No thanks guys, I've already got a few of those that are, simply put, more rewarding."
17264,"so far so god
"
17265,"This game reminds of Clash Royale on iOS. I love everything about it. Coming in as a new player, the tips and tricks were a great guide to get me on the right path to Victory. I enjoy the art work and graphics of this game as well. If you guys like strategy and awesome warfare, this game is for you. Its A+"
17266,"Cool graphics, unique playstyle. Overall fun so far."
17267,this is a great card battle game combined with the essence of tower defense game. various cards with unique ability allow us to create multiple strategy even in the middle of a battle. very recommended strategy game.
17268,"So I happened upon this game purely by chance with their free Voidborne stuff give away. Was like h-uh, free stuff.. never seen this game.. i'll try it out. Turns out I -really- enjoy this game."
17269,Fun
17270,yeah good stuff
17271,"This game is amazing! It is very much a free to play game with basic decks ruling the top leaderboards! I love the balance of this game, that is true. But even more then that I love the constant updates! The game updates every 14 days :) try Minion Masters, I promise it will get you hooked!!!!"
17272,"5 STARS * * * * * this game is so good and amazing i have never ever literally ever partaken in such an amazing game such as this!!! I will recommend this to all of my friends, I hope they join me in 2v2!"
17273,"Best game ever!


Ruined by stupid devs who dont understand what made this game initially great. Got streamlined for brainless consumers and the last bit of creativity in deckbuildung got destroyed with the wildcard rework. Fucking losers."
17274,Great Game! Very fun and quick matches.
17275,Hella fun game with a simple learning curve. Its easy to pick up and hard to master. Only a week in and I love it.
17276,yes
17277,"Simple, Fun."
17278,THis is a fun game where yoU put minIoNS DOWn and FIght
17279,"So when you first start playing MM you'll find a fun, silly themed game of men and monsters and machines fighting.  Fun little 1-7 minutes blasts of silly combat.  You'll spin for cards and probably have a good time.

Then you'll start to progress up the ladder as you find card you like that are actually good.  By the time you have a decent grasp of the game you'll hit diamond/masters at which point you'll realise the game has stopped being fun.  

This is because despite a roster of over 150 cards you'll over ever see 15-20 at most of them ever again.  There are balance issues running through the core of the game that are still ongoing.  There a selection of cards that are simply better than their peers so by the time you get to a serious rank that's all you'll see people spamming.  By the time you've played this enough that you can already tell what cards are coming next because it's the same as the last 10 matches you'll lose interest all together.

I'd love to recommend it but with such a stale and limited meta i simply cant suggest dropping money on this when there are much better games of it's ilk out there."
17280,is good fun mane
17281,"It's been Early Access for 3 years, and there's still not a quit. I've been here for 4 days, help."
17282,"Esse jogo é Muito Divertido, principalmente quando você joga no 2x2 com um amigo."
17283,"Like castle fight plus hearthstone, pretty fun and very polished"
17284,What can I say except your welcome?
17285,pretty guud
17286,great game
17287,"I just returned to this game (lvl 5), I have no idea how to play. I'm always getting this message : Please Select a full deck but I have no idea what it means. Bad, very bad UI. Uninstalling it."
17288,Pretty fun to start with.  Games are quick and have a number of choices to make.  Liking the early game.
17289,wow this game is addictive as hell ... love it <3
17290,Nice game
17291,"like the minions' design, as well as the possible strategies available for the decks you can build"
17292,Good time sink.

17295,A good game to pass the time when you don't want something that takes a lot of effort or commitment for each game.

17301,Awesome Fun! Similar to Clash Royale
17302,"Nice, fast gameplay."
17303,"Edit:  Update: The game has become pretty unbalanced and I have since uninstalled.



I'm a pretty low-key gamer, but this game is really fun!

It's quite graphics intensive, believe it or not, so if you have an older pc, like I do, some of the features may not work for you."

17310,Fun and easy... just like all the women in my life. Thanks mom!... I mean... thanks Minion Masters!
17311,Pretty fun game!
17312,Game reminds me of many mobile games but is fair play for those who don't wish to pay. It's possible to not pay to win.
17313,NiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiCE! This is a pretty cool game to chill out on if you're into mobas and dont have a lot of time to play... or a ton of time and wanna grind the heck out of it.
17314,It's super simplistic fun! I love it.
17315,Is good game!
17316,good game and fun. good job
17317,Best RTS game ever ! And totaly Free :)
17318,Great community and features with VERY nice music
17319,easy
17320,I loved your first game that minion masters is based on and this is the same flavour but a competitive game which is awesome. I love the card aspect and the different heroes. I dont really understand how the battle pass works so maybe a tiny bit more explanation in that aspect would be great during the introduction
17321,The games is very easy to get into and the action is exciting.
17322,"Quite possibly the best Goldilocks game... not too difficult, not too easy... not too fast, not too slow...

Very high quality game!"

17324,Quick. Fun. Amazing.
17325,Fast paced yet deep enough to play over and over again
17326,"Very fun game to chill with a friend, easy gameplay and a lot of fights with your Minions :D"
17327,"10 /:/ 10

Really comfortable mechanics, polished design graphically, as well in gameplay and progression system! Clearly made by people who enjoy playing games and most of all, making them. 

Tons of fun, highly recommend it!"
17328,"Oyun gerçekten çok güzel herkesin oynayabileceğini düşünüyorum.Herkesin en azından denemesi gerek,müzikler gerçekten çok iyi kapladığı alan ise okadar da fazla değil ideal diyebiliriz herkese şiddetle tavsiye ederim. :)"

17333,Seems fun so far
17334,"This feels and plays A LOT like Clash Royale. I was interested in this because of Clash R and Highly recommend it.

But, this sort of game isn't up everyone's alley and not everyone will enjoy it."
17335,"just ok, not bad"
17336,"Fantastic game, seems to be well balanced. Mechanics are solid. My personal favourite part of it is the fact that matches are quick.

17337,"Very user friendly, easy to understand, fun to play. Character designs are simple but decent and rewards vary and are frequent."
17338,I press buttons I win
17339,"This game is a lot of fun to play, especially with a friend. However, it is easily playable solo and there are many modes that can only be done solo. You can easily purchase all masters without buying the game (I have four of the nine and I can buy more) and I have unlocked many of the good cards without spending a dime. The game is constantly being updated and cards are being balanced. Overall I have a lot of fun playing it and recommend it (I mean, it's free so why not?)"
17340,"Good game i like tug of wars, fast paced for now will see how it goes in higher tiers"
17341,Really great take on a card game!
17342,Very fun to play with a friend.  Highly recommend it.

no gas like for real for real!"
17344,"SOOOO much fun inexpensive, team playing great graphics"
17345,"Very fun so far. I've played these types of games before Clash Royale and the Star Wars one. I like that you cant buff up your cards like the previous games, so there is more of an even playing field. 

"
17346,nice game
17347,"easy and fun to play, would recommend it to anyone"
17348,"Pretty fun, simple concept with a lot of possibilities. So far I just wish you could pick your starting hero rather then getting the stormranger but hopefully i get the supplies quickly"
17349,"This is basically a mobile game ported to PC.  If you like that type of thing it's fine, if a bit pay-to-win.  I was happy to subscribe to their newsletter for the offer of loot.  Little did I know they were primarily interested in data mining me, my Steam account and the like.  I was happy to get their newsletter, but not happy to be the subject of a data-mining probe.  Pass."
17350,Fun multiplayer game with depth in the card system.  Its not dota but good for playing between big games.
17351,very good
17352,nice card game for now... still new here... will give another review later
17353,Nice Game!
17354,"[h1]Minion Masters - A better Clash Royale?[/h1]

You might say, ""[i]another one of these Multiplayer-Tower-Defense-Games[/i]"", [b]but you better watch your mouth![/b]
Minion Masters takes this genre and adds great graphics, many cards, and with it, various strategies, as well as the ability to choose a hero, who has different abilities to support your minions on the battlefield!

In short:
★★★★★ Fun (50%)
★★★★★ Graphics (10%)
★★★★☆ Sounds (10%)
★★★☆☆ Polishment (30%)
★★★★☆ Overall (4,3★)

[b]Fun:[/b]
Alright, so, I agree: Other people might not give a full five stars for the fun of this gem - uh - game, it depends on you and if you like the genre! I, for myself, can say that I had alot of fun!

You basically play a hero, to be more precise: a Minion Master, who spawns minions to let them fight for victory. Which basically means that they fight to destroy the enemy tower, or die trying. The various amount of different cards and the seemingly endless card-combinations make this game quite attractive for competetive players!
You'll be put into leagues, so there is a matchmaking in this game, which will make you face enemies, who are (hopefully) around your skill-level.

What really boosts the fun is that the game doesn't support the levelling up of your cards, you'll never fight a level 9 dragon, while yours is still stuck at level 4. matter of fact: The balancing of this game is basically great, there are enough ground and air units and also enough buildings.

The only things that actually count negative towards the Fun are the bugs, but yeah, more of that in the [i]Polishment[/i]-Section!


[b]Graphics:[/b]
Graphics are not really important for this kind of game, as long as you can distinguish the different units you have basically done a good job!

But that wasn't enough for [i]BetaDwarf[/i]! They actually implented great graphics to this game, and released a graphic overhaul, after they worked enough on the polishment (see ""Update 60 - Looks matter"").


[b]Sounds:[/b]
Sounds don't really serve a big purpose in Minion Masters. They basically just work towards the authencity of the battlefield, and imho it does a bit of a difference!

But what actually gives the game an extra pluspoint in sounds is the commentator, who gets triggered at the beginning, at the end and in the running game, if something important/amazing happened.


[b]Polishment:[/b]
So yeah, this game offers quite a bit already:
- Guilds (and special events for these)
- Mayham-Mode
- Matchmaking (1v1 and 2v2)
- Expeditions
- Single-Player-Mode

Updates are coming in regular intervalls and they improve the polishment of the games in many regards: Balancing, additional modes, overhauls, etc.!


[b]Overall:[/b]
To sum it up: This game is great, if you liked Clash Royale and wanna try out another Multiplayer-Tower-Defense-Game on the PC with more cards, better balancing and (imh) better graphics, try this one, you probably won't get disappointed!

Also, it's free right now!"
17355,awesome game
17356,Pretty fun. Tempting for P2W but F2P is definitely still viable.
17357,"Fun for a day, then you realize how broken some cards are and you can't obtain them in a reasonable time in game without spending money."
17358,good
17359,"Good game, not p2w and easy to learn."
17360,"Here's my review after reaching master league (easier than what you'd think):
It's one of these actually good F2P games out there.

Apart from the insufferable commentator voice, the badly designed UI and some uninspired stuff (mainly around character and mob design) it plays like a breeze, is pretty fun and rewarding given its simplicity, and has a ton of depth.
Like all online card games it requires a lot of grind if you want to get the deck of your dreams without opening your wallet.
Respectful F2P business model, doesn't affect the card balance as much as games like hearthstone, and doesn't put pressure on you to buy anything.

Matches are very quick, 2v2 is awesome and matchmaking is almost instant. Take it easy and you'll have a great time.

If you want to take it a bit more seriously:
Ranks are league-like (+ wooden and stone leagues)
Diamond and above, expect super strong meta decks with abundant use of stuff like stormy (+support card), xiao long, demon brothers, harbinger, shield golem. Lots and lots of ravagers and mords with their very annoying perks.
Play a kamikaze rammer apep deck for guaranteed hilarity."
17361,10/10 except for king puff. we dont talk about him
17362,fast interestsing and you can team up / pvp
17363,"Five outta five. 
Great fun when you just wanna play something relaxing."
17364,very enjoyable game
17365,pretty fun with quick matches
17366,"This type of game is for retards.

Play Might & Magic if you want to play something like this.

This is android garbage for noobs or retards.

No stratergy no planing just boring and pointless gameplay!"
17367,Very well made game you don't find games this well crafted as Minion Masters. i just love this kind of tug of war; and i must say this game is really fun to play and looks amazing and i do really enjoy the voice acting keep up the great work BetaDwarf.
17368,"fun game im glad it was free for a bit 
"
17369,not necessary 'buying gold' dependant ..you can earn it easily
17370,"fun easy game, throw minions at your enemies, save up for big damage minions or swarm your foe with horde of smaller weaker minions"
17371,"The game itself is great fun, my reason for not recommending is due to the fact that i've had several high value cards just disappear forcing me to waste shards re-making them, I reported one such event on the discussion page along with sending a review regarding it ingame and have heard absolutely nothing from the devs.

Get it, but don't spend any real money on it until the game is fixed."
17372,This game looks like a phone game but its not on a phone.
17373,Absolutely addictive :) Fast-paced and fun
17374,Very fun game style. Loving it so far.
17375,If you have proton it works straight out of the box with proton 4.2!
17376,Nice CCG + RTS. Kinda relaxing and cute.
17377,Amazingly simple to get into and have fun
17378,"23 hours in this is my verdict.

Pros:
It is free
Better then Clash royale
Exp system is fun and intresting
Hero system is intresting
Fun

Cons:
The game suffers from balance issues, Some cards needs to be more expensive, some need to have less health exe. A perfect example is the storm cloud. Either you can cast a 4 mana spell that creates a chain lighting or you can get a minion that attacks by using that spell for one more. I understand in principle this is meant as a choice but much like the Guild gates in mtg the potential small value is not worth the trade off. 

Overall it is a good and fun game however. I hope that the developers take care of some of the balance issues because one of the reasons I liked this game so much is that unlike clash royale I won´t be beat by someone with better cards than me. 
8/10

Also inb4 get gud. I am Plat 1 in solo and Master in team."
17379,"A very interesting game. Easy to learn, still learning some tricks. Overall fun."
17380,the game is currently dead and outdated.
17381,Pretty fun and satisfying. Great for when u wanna take it easy.
17382,"Must play.
"
17383,"In short, this is a good game. 
The dev team keeps on adding new features, new masters and new cards. 
It is not necessary to build an all-legend-card-set to achieve the Master tier. 
The queue time to find a match is less than 1 minute, normally, less than 30~40 secs. 
Again, this is a good game."
17384,first cardgame i actually enjoy
17385,"Very enjoyable!
Helpful UI and fun and engaging gameplay."
17386,"its a friendly copmpotition for other to play 

i would recamond
"
17387,"Very fun game! If siege competitive games are your thing, this game is pretty awesome.
It's updated really regularly so there's always something new.
They love giving extra to their players!
Streaming it has a lot of cool features, and the streamers I've met from this game have been nothing but helpful and nice.
Graphics are decent and music is nice.
A lot to do between ranked, normal play, duo play, and other games modes as well!"
17388,Its ok.
17389,Quick fun gameplay
17390,FUN AF
17391,"Simple, Fast, Fun."
17392,Relaxing free game
17393,Very fun and easy to to get used to. Works great with an Xbox One Wired Controller.
17394,NICE AS FK
17395,Spam
17396,"Good game so far. Mechanics has always won me more games in this than ""OP"" decks."
17397,"I found this title quite entertaining to begin with.  The ability to earn ingame currencies and cards arrived periodically to keep things moving along.  Matchmaking proved a generally smooth interaction, with ranked tiers that played rather simple until Silver and beyond.  

As I leveled up, and continued to stack my deck, I began seeing certain items and gimmicks used repeatedly that proved difficult to match or counter.  If I keep grinding, I will obtain these cards as well I kept telling myself; however, as I continued to play, the loot drops became less and less.  As of this writing, my progress forward has become hindered by the inability to match up against a superior deck.  

I had entertained the concept of chipping in for the battle pass to support the title.  However, the ingame store is loaded with options for high tier cards and items just a micro-transaction away.  Why grind towards a card when you can just buy it outright?  *Whispers the ingame store* 

In truth, I have played many of these types of games, I love the concept, and I enjoyed my brief time here; that said, it falls into the same entrapments of similar titles within this genre:  Addictive, easy to catch onto with a moderate learning curve that ""at first"" rewards skill over luck, and finally, Pay To Win.  Players Beware of this model, there is always someone with more money to spend than you.  ""Always"".  

As I said. I enjoyed it; just as I have several others in this genre.  An unfortunate factor, mainly because virtually all of these types of games I have played so far leave me frustrated and bitter by the developer's choice of marketing.  Avoid this game if you find yourself in a similar position towards card based titles.  


tl;dr:

Neat little game,
Rewards for play slow to a trickle shortly after you get into the swing of things.
Pay to Win on obvious display."
17398,"awesome
"
17399,"fun, easy to get into and, f2p friendly."
17400,It's Clash Royale but there has to be a winner and offense is encouraged.
17401,So far the game has been a lot of fun.  Interesting interface and loads to choose from as the way of minions go.
17402,"This is great fun !
The game is very easy and intuitive at start. It seems like it's very easy to get into and quite hard and challenging to master from what I've heard. And that's exactly the type of games that I like and enjoy the most.
If you are looking for a time sink, without any strings attached - this is for you. If you're looking for something to master and try to be the best at - this is for you."
17403,ITS A GREAT GAME LUV IT!!!
17404,Addicting. Can't wait to see this game grow.
17405,Fun. Simple. Cool synergies!
17406,"Love it, it's a lot of fun."
17407,SOO FUN
17408,"RTS lite.  Very fun,"
17409,Great game pretty much Clash Royale for PC. Very fun to play! I highly recommend it
17410,Awesome game! keep up the good work!
17411,"I'm not sure which genre this game falls into. Tower defense, card game, strategy... It most closely resembles Clash Royale, but is better in practically every way, so I'm reluctant about comparing them. It has minion, structure and spell cards like CR but they don't get more powerful as you unlock more, you just get more exp after the match for having alot of duplicates. It has a very good f2p model, not pay to win; this becomes apparent when you look at the decks of the top ranking players, most of them only have one or two legendary cards which can be put in any type of deck, the rest of them are easy to come by. The game is easy to understand, the strategies become more advanced as you progress through ranks so you won't be overwhelmed as a new player. There is profile progression with rewards, ranking system etc. Has a 1v1 and 2v2 option and ocasional events. Art style is very nice, has plenty of settings for low end pcs. Overall a very good game, definetly worth checking out."
17412,"This game is fun, Card based games, yugioh style but you can see your minions move along :)"
17413,"The game is kind of addictive, the art style is amazing and ... it's free to play :)"
17414,it is a fun little time killer
17415,"fast paced ! fun as hell
"
17416,"This game is pretty good, i actually liked it, but there is one problem. When someone disconnects in a team battle even if it is you or someone else, you will always lose, and i dont think thats fair tbh. I remember spending 30 min or so in a match, we were on 1200 health and they only had 300 health, BUT my teammate disconnected, and i ended up losing and lost points, and that pissed me off. So my point is, why not replace people that disconnects with bots instead? I mean that's a win win right there. Its not much, but its better that nothing right?"
17417,Awesome and addictive. I'm waiting for for the new contents and features
17418,gg
17419,"Easy to play, clean interface, unique characters, love the humour."
17420,"One of the most generous f2p games out right now. Also has a good sized, friendly community."
17421,good
17422,better than clash royal
17423,"it's a fun mobile game, however the current game really unstable, game keeping freeze every few minute, so the basic game play fully with freeze screen.

the core battle are fun, but you don't really own any micro control to command your troop, which leave you troop AI fight and die in the clumsy way waste it, hope there some basic control order for you to deeply plan the strategy option, like command the ranger to stay on point to prevent enemy push, or call melee troops rush the enemy base.

the least it's the current game mode with variety low,which easy get bored , there only two mode: 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, and that all the game you get to choice, which it's actually a shame for this game, personal hope for large group of team fight battle,the final thing are the mod, if the developer open the mod community this game would be insane, with many of maps and news update every moment,it's sure triple the fun this games for sure.

get the free DLC from game, with return have many reward from ranked match."
17424,pretty good
17425,It's Quick Easy Fun.
17426,GREAT FUN!!
17427,good game
17428,"Not gonna lie. Thought this game was stupid when I saw the description. I've been playing it for a hour or so now. Not too shabby!
Edit: Hadn't lost until I played today. I have not won again..."
17429,Fix your fucking game.
17430,realy fun pvp
17431,game seems fun
17432,"Simple, yet fun."
17433,gg
17434,"super fun and easy to get into :)
"
17435,Fun relaxing game.  Easy to learn and very addictive!
17436,"so fun and cool , 
seem like clash royale for adult"
17437,enjoyable
17438,I do not lose to 10 level thats weird :P
17439,So far I'm enjoying the game
17440,gg
17441,ggez
17442,"The developers should be given more credit on this. 

You might think that this is just another PC version of Clash Royal, but it's not. It's so much more better. Prices are bearable to buy/craft new minions (at least in my opinion) and the game is generous in giving you free stuff/rewards."
17443,"Simple, yet surprisingly interesting and fun. However clearly pay to win so i can't recommend it to everyone."
17444,This game is a lot of fun
17445,"Its Fun, Intro Is great. Something fun and easy to kill time with."
17446,The whole point of the game is to frustrate you into buying pay 2 win stuff. This game would have been amazing if it cost 30 dollars and had only cosmetic in game purchases.
17447,"It's a fun game to play alone or with a friend. Easy to learn, hard to master and overall i'm very satisfied with how the game is."
17448,"A game that looks mobile at first glance, but is actually very well made and feature rich.
The gameplay is simple to learn, yet hard to master."
17449,nice game
17450,It's cute
17451,"good fair pvp so far and even co op pvp battles. if u use tactics u can win instead of throwing RL gold in the game
"
17452,"cool game, chill, downloaded due to 2v2 coop feature to play with friend"
17453,cool game
17454,"Why is this fun and Clash Royal is not? 

Who cares!? Play this!"
17455,wait a free game that you dont need to spent shit amount of money on it to rank up?i take it
17456,A quality clone of Clash Royale on PC. The main distinction so far is: can't see any pay to win yet.
17457,Game is a blast to play. Have enjoyed and recommend for some strategy fun.
17458,absolutly amazing!
17459,"Recomended
"
17460,Nice Game play
17461,"I have apraxia and can only use one hand, but the slow pace allows for real-time decision-making that would otherwise be impractical. Accessible, fun, and free~"
17462,casual and fun ! keep it up !
17463,"Why you asking me to leave a review one hour into the game? That seems like a cheap way to get positive reviews before any grinding happens. But yes, so far quite fun always liked these type of games."
17464,The subscription to the news letter is a scam.
17465,very good strategy game
17466,"Seriously a pretty damn good game, I enjoy playing it on the side a good amount! Give it a try its free."
17467,"game is meh
way to grindy for f2p
pay2win is this game"
17468,"Great game early on, haven't reached higher tiers yet, probably pay to win like Clash Royale..."
17469,I would be pretty stoked if this game caught on with the hearthstone/dota crowd. Something here for both crowds.
17470,Is okay.
17471,cool game
17472,Been playing the mobile game Battle Royale for years. Similar game but with more features. I do like the first impression of the game.
17473,"Fun....for the first couple of days or so. It loses it's zest pretty fast. The games you play blend in as there is little in the way of deck variance it seems. This game could be so much more I feel...

If you want to kill 3 days or so of time, you got nothing to lose, it's free. But after that, don't expect much"
17474,Fun game
17475,Solid game play thus far. Simple to understand but engaging and challenging enough to get satisfaction from winning.
17476,"very easy to learn. has micro transactions but without screwing those unwilling to pay or shoving them in your face constantly.

enjoying a lot. 

mostly wish it had some way for 3 friends to play together since it is always 1v1 or 2v2."
17477,This game is Titties!
17478,GG
17479,"A suprising fresh breath of air. dont let the the simple appearance throw you off, this game is a great time :). plenty of variety and it's really fun to play :)."
17480,"simple, fun, and very rewarding."
17481,"New experience, cool theme and commentator and fun play style and strategies"
17482,nice
17483,The deck building game for everyone. really really fun and easy to get into
17484,"I'm do not Recommended This game at all, Just because of the foolish policy issues that my country's IP has been blocked.
"
17485,Warcrafts 3's Castle War with Cards
17486,"Fácil de entender, rápido, colorido, diverso, ágil y gratis!!!!"
17487,It's a fun way to kill time
17488,"loads of fun, rather simple at the start but get harder the higher in lvl you get..."
17489,sick
17490,"They tried going with a smite format on loyalty, which is amazing (though it costs 20$ CAD, 1 for the premium membership and another for all future champions); but as a CCG, its strongly a hit and miss for people. Also wasn't prominently made as a, 'sit down and marathon' type of game, so there is very little motive to play beyond the dailies unless you wish to burn yourself out. 

decent game overall though."
17491,Great game! So far so fun.
17492,for all the clash of clans players out there try this out its really fun
17493,"this is soooooooooooo! muuch fun  i look forwd to see what come up
lol soooso drunk
i love this game   
"
17494,"Brilliant design so far. Imagine hearthstone's simple mechanics with dota's timing. Intuitive and fluid, stable client. Genuinely impressive."
17495,"first hour of play has been interesting and fun.  I've experienced a bug where some of my cards disappear.  Looking at the bug report forum this seems to be a semi common problem.  

The game-play is fun but this bug is really annoying.  Hopefully this will be fixed (3/18/2019)"
17496,I like how i can just pick it up and play for a little bit.
17497,Nice mix of cards / levelling / strategy
17498,"simple game, quick grasp even my 4 years old like it"
17499,Pretty fun so far.
17500,Pretty fun minion battling F2P game
17501,"great game, enjoying it to the fullest."
17502,its lit my dude
17503,11/10 I just love the game so much. the details are amazing and the gameplay its self is just awesome.
17504,Its fun good to pass time
17505,The game is a lot more luck based than people like to admit.
17506,very easy to play and fun
17507,"Brilliantly Fun and rewarding, with no pay to win as far as I can tell. Great Game!"
17508,"Fun, interactive game"
17509,Fun and easy to play with quick rounds!
17510,Its ok.
17511,nice game
17512,COol!
17513,A PC version of clash royale. PLEASE COMPANY< PLEASE< PORT TO PHONE ASAAPPP
17514,clash royale but 10x better
17515,"Despite what the game claims to be, it is just a Clash Royale clone. It's not a strategy (calling it a strategy is an insult), it's not a MOBA (something having progression system during a match is not MOBA), and it's definitely not a tower defense (having a static object that shoots and visually represents a ""tower"" is not a tower defense). The only thing you are allowed to do in this game is spend your statically generated mana on 1. units, 2. units that can't move and have expiration timer, 3. cards that summon more units, deal damage or buff or debuff units in a very simplistic way that have no effect outside of unit combat (spells). Of course, there are always exceptions for every rule, but those cards definitely do not change essence of the gameplay in any way, or are simply not played (for a very simple reason). Units you summon immediately run towards the enemy base and either engage in a simplistic combat with enemy units they meet on their way or die after dealing little bit of damage to the enemy base (every base has a basic damage dealing attack). That's it. Literally. The game itself is setup that way: you start with a random 4 cards hand from your deck (and it is the maximum and only hand size), every time you play a card you immediately draw a new one in it's place (and it is the only way to see a new card in your hand), you play your cards by spending mana (the only resource in this game), which you get extremely fast at a set speed (there are a couple of cards in the game which break that rule, otherwise it will be the only speed you will gain your mana at and the only way to get it). Another part of the game is passive abilities of your summoner, which you aquire automatically over time at a set speed (XP), but can speed it up significantly by ""controling"" one or both of the bridges, which happens immediately after a unit under your control reaches said bridge and the bridge is free of enemy units (you keep control ater your unit left the bridge but was the last one to stand on it). After all of that said, we can aknowledge few things:
1. There are no mechanics in the game that allow you to manipulate or affect in any way your deck, your hand, mana, XP.
2. There are no mechanics that allow you to ""control"" a bridge outside of you having to regularly put units on the ground.
3. Unit combat and cards that are not units themselves are extremely primitive: units have health, attack damage, attack speed, attack range (melee or ranged), movement speed and a basic classification by ground and flying units (melee units can't attack flying units), ""building"" units are the same units just without ability to move and with the expiration timer, while absolute most of spells either summon units, deal direct damage or put some sort of simple debuff or buff (+50% damage is one of them, for example); that's literally it.
No cool abilities, no cool combos, no nothing."
17516,"Fun game, reminds me of Castle Fight custom map on WC3.
"
17517,i liked clash of clans so this game is fun to kill time while im watching tournaments
17518,Good
17519,Great game all I can say
17520,"This Game is great fun, i love the fast pace and the cool cards. There is a lot of content you can get for free and its easy to get cards. Beware game is very addicting because its fun to play with friends ans foes alike!"
17521,surprisingly addictive. A good pick up and play that doesn't take itself too seriously.
17522,"highly recommend, noobfriendly and extremely fun!"
17523,its fun
17524,A bit fun and for laid back game yet feels slow or clumsy a bit still fun in its own way.
17525,so fun thanks for the game
17526,great game
17527,eh i dont like that they monetized the season passes but it looks like a more polished version of clash royale
17528,"Fun for the people who were longing for a duelling game in the style of the good old Warcraft III custom maps, where you spam waves of minions against other players bases (Castle TD, Legion TD etc).

Made by the guys behind FORCED on steam. 
A pleasant experience!"
17529,Nice game. I like the voice acting.
17530,SO GUT
17531,"I have 30mins in the game so far, and its asking me to review, I would perfer it wait till like 3 hours in or so, but I do like it, its kinda the type of game that I want to play when I want to play something relaxing
"
17532,best game on the world
17533,Best game in this genre I played thus far!
17534,"Fun card type game with unit mechanics. Really cool. Try it. You might like it.
"
17535,So far so good.
17536,Super fun! i love that i can play with mates 2 to 4 is so good! makes for a really fun LAN
17537,Fun
17538,"Super addictive never know what card will come out of a box at you, clean AI even cleaner tower defence game and have yet to even try to 2v2 option so excited. One of the better tower MOBA defence games solo-ing rather than team battles like vainglory. Mix of heartstone and a moba."
17539,"simple game to learn, but fun and challenging!"
17540,fun game
17541,nice game not so boring like some other games more cards to come!
17542,"Cool game, it's a bit of a MOBA light, but with a lot of the negatives of MOBA's addressed, like the trash talking, griefing, well, I guess the lack of community and chat is the biggest strong point as it doesn't allow for hurt feelings to way over extend like the usual MOBAs."
17543,"It is a simple game that reminds me of kingdom clash.
"
17544,Awesome game!!! 10/10
17545,pretty decent for it's genre
17546,GOOD
17547,Ganz cool ist wi clash royal auf dem handy
17548,Nice
17549,"Easy to learn, packed with action! Interface is responsive and beautiful, nice work!"
17550,pretty fun take on the card game
17551,v good v fun.
17552,good
17553,"Pretty fun, getting some nice YU-GI-OH style GOTCHA plays."
17554,awsome game
17555,Decent blend of deck building and lane battling.
17556,"fun, easy to learn and actually rewarding"
17557,"AMAZING GAME
"
17558,"A great card game with plenty of action and strategy going on unlike other ones where only card stats come into equation. 1v1, 2v2 mods, guilds with plenty of rewards for playing, awesome."
17559,muito bom
17560,Nice game :)
17561,Best game in it's kind
17562,GAME FREEZES/Freezes  doesn't register your clickes or ANYTHING if you try and change visuals/graphics mid match FIX THIS PLEASE!  really basic shit here guys
17563,"Minion Masters is a lot of fun, with very interesting tactics, good deck building, and enough rewards to keep playing even with P2W."
17564,Amazaing game I enjoy it :D
17565,"1A Spiel, top Umsetzung für den PC, erinnert natürlich stark an clash royale etc., aber macht gut Laune!"
17566,Clash royale on steroids
17567,"I used to like this game a lot, as my 1800+ hours would attest. The latest patches have ruined it. It's not the least bit fun anymore. I haven't touched the game for three months. 

I used to have a positive review here, but keeping it that way would have been dishonest. Feel like I have to do my part to bring the percentage score down or else BetaDwarf will get the wrong impression that they're doing a good job."
17568,"If clash royale and LoL had a crippled baby, this would be the result."
17569,Easy to pick up and play a few matches in a short amount of time. Depth without overloading you right out of the gate. Can't wait to see where it goes over time.
17570,fun
17571,"game good

more free stuff pls"
17572,its simple but has a thrill
17573,Great game!
17574,im enjoying it
17575,fun clash royale type game
17576,Fun. Straight forward and easy to play
17577,fun af
17578,Finaly a good game. Not pay to win. Just fair.
17579,"wow such clash much royale, very trading"
17580,"Simple, Intuitive, and fun."
17581,"Generous with depth, options and rewards this game is well made and anyone can play with ease with the simple controls. Im addicted GJ much fun."
17582,"Loving this game, really easy to get started and learn (like 2 minutes) but there is clearly a lot of depth.

"
17583,AMAZING! The strategy component is insane. I love the concept of seeing an animated representation of a cards abilities.
17584,Fun Game
17585,Game seems fun so far. Haven't run into the P2W wall yet.
17586,nice game
17587,"Fast games, good fun"
17588,"Fun Stuff. Obviously took inspiration from CR but has some solo content and don't need to grind to update troops. Only complaint is that my game freezes for a few seconds whenever a hero levels up in game.

Great game!"
17589,"Casual fun, easy to learn."
17590,so far so good
17591,easy and fun
17592,awesome and cool game
17593,it's a mobile game with a shitty cash shop. the usual.
17594,Fun
17595,Awesome free game
17596,gg
17597,Fun and easy to learn but with the challenges of deck building and competitive game play
17598,nice
17599,Good card game / tower defence.
17600,I'm really liking this game!
17601,It's similar to Clash Royale. I like it enough.
17602,Love Love Love
17603,"good rewards, fun pace takes some planning to do well."
17604,This game is fun because i dont lose as much as i could be in Hearthstone
17605,its fun xd
17606,divertidirijillo
17607,great game! lots of events that happen weekly and has great gameplay. highly recommend to anyone who likes clash royale and other games like that.
17608,Fun
17609,It is very simple and fun to play
17610,Satisfying!
17611,Pretty cool. Love the gameplay of 2 v 2.
17612,its a cool game.
17613,Muy entretenido y balanceado por el momento
17614,Its fun and easy to play quick and easy to understand.
17615,Its pretty good
17616,Fun
17617,nice game
17618,Fun and easy to pick up!
17619,Awesome
17620,"Here's why you should play this game

-Fun
-Free"
17621,"These dip Sh||1t developers don't know how to put a QUIT button in the [esc] menu... instead right at the bottom of the menu is a green button called [feedback] that links to a shi|tty google form (because again being dipsh|it developers the idea of actually providing a feedback form on there own website would be hard work, so they use gooble sh|t products)  

Anyway game shouldn't be on Steam, any company that thinks it's ok to use 'Dark Patterns' in UI/UX standards to keep people in game and making it more of a hassle to close a game is a no go for me, you might find that more common practice on the Google crapstore because they themselves use dark patterns to trick and fool end users.. because they are scum.. Anyway Valve need to start dealing with these developers!.. 1/5 stars.. don't waste your time kids... also contains stupid crates gimmicks with animations no one gives a fduck about watching after the nth time!  Game is ultimately easy and mindlessly boring, maybe that's your thing and what you'd like to play, I certainly won't fault it on what it does in that gameplay area and graphics for it, but dark patterns.. fudck off."
17622,could use a bit more explanations of features but is fun so far
17623,is good game very funny
17624,nice game. i think. kind of like clash royale (to be honest same) but since i love clash royale playing it on pc is something cool. i guess. try it
17625,"Discord support games and I love discord and it's community so I'll 100% support this game! This games feels exactly as the mobile game ""Clash Royale"" does and I thoroughly enjoyed that game and am having a ton of fun on this game as well."
17626,Pay 2 Win
17627,"Just the first hour in and it's been intriguing enough to keep me going.  It clearly shows how it contains pay to win mechanics for deck building, but I believe the matchmaking will do their best to match up equal power levels which turns it back into a skill/knowledge based game.

I'll put in another hour and see how I feel.  So many games call for so much of our time these days..."
17628,"Very nice, has smooth graphics and seems rather competitive without being annoying. I would definitely recommend."
17629,Having a blast! I'm really glad I tried it.
17630,:)
17631,It's fun and challenging.
17632,GOOD GAME SO FAR
17633,the  game is great
17634,very fun game
17635,"How do you lose me in under 10 minutes? Have painfully awful gameplay, give no game exit and pray I don't know how to use alt+tab or alt+enter.
Also, a basic bitch voice modulator isn't cruise control for game design.

Get Fucked."
17636,this game is very cool its make me so happy <3 thanks
17637,Yes
17638,"Good Game, Almost like Clash Royale"
17639,great game pretty graphics and sounds master mined game with awesome reword system
17640,likey likey
17641,"So the game prompted me if I liked the game, I clicked Yes and led me to here, its so far its good, I like the 2v2, I wish they will make a larger map for a 4v4 ot even 5v5, this could go to becomming a LCS game if they do it right, Right now tho I see upgrade for units, that tells me it might go towards a pay to win, will see the late game, so far its new a fresh of the game."
17642,Cool one.
17643,"An amazing game! great way to kill time, would recommend it to all gamers"
17644,from what ive played thus far it works well tho obviously the game could use some optimization and maybe some clarity on how to use the shard system and what not. also a use for gold other than just buying power stones would be nice aside from that this is basically hearthstone and clash royale having a baby
17645,Fun af game. Love itttt
17646,"well done sidways clash royale.  for those who like similar gameplay, go for it."
17647,Yes...
17648,addicting game
17649,THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN ITS LIKE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS ANF CLASH ROYAL TOGTHER AND NOT ANOYING
17650,.
17651,It's quite enjoyable. :D
17652,great
17653,good game
17654,Great Game! fast matchmaking :D
17655,"Quite good, didn't expect it. Clash Royale with more things added to it"
17656,"A player-versus-player game that combines real-time strategy, tower defense, and deck-building card game mechanics with beautiful art to wonderful effect. 

Rarely do you see games of its genre offer controller support, yet Minion Masters gave it the attention it needed to serve as an example to others. 

The game is easy to pick up, and even for players like me who usually steer away from games that require the regular upkeep and singular focus on a small number of games to remain competitive that so many online PvP games demand, this game kept me engaged and feeling like I could face a fair share of its challenges. I suspect this reveals some solid match-making happening behind the scenes."
17657,i love this game!
17658,Love it so far. A game made with a smile.
17659,nice game
17660,great game
17661,like clash royale pc sofar this game is so goodddddddddddddd
17662,fun game
17663,Good little timekiller with possibly some depth. We'll see.
17664,It's pretty good!
17665,Pour le moment c'est fun
17666,"Simple yet complex.. Card collecting, quick(ish) battles, super addicting fun."
17667,BALLER
17668,"Lots of fun, variety, and yes, you are very tempted to spend cash, but it's worth it.It's a card game brought to life that adds its own blend of strategy as well -"
17669,This game reminds me of one of my favorite original Xbox games Magic The Gathering: Battlegrounds it brings back a lot of nostalgia and new fun experiences. I recommend you give this game a try it is good fun.
17670,"Great game, fun to play while watching streamers play for bonus rewards."
17671,Honestly didn't expect much but so far it's enjoyable quick 1-6 minute games and its not that p2w
17672,"Fun addictive game and nice design for the minions and masters
"
17673,"Honestly, i haven't had this much fun in a while. Immediately from the start, I felt intrigued with the game and was ready to put some hours in. So that's what I'm gonna do. I'll be updating this if anything feels broken in the higher ELO, but otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend this game."
17674,pretty sweet game easy to get into
17675,"Simple and easy game, even though it's early access it seems pretty good so far. But i feel very limited in gameplay in my opinion."
17676,great
17677,Fun and addicting!
17678,Super fun game to play with friends or Solo. Reminds me a lot of hearthstone only in 3D.
17679,good stuff
17680,Rewarding gameplay
17681,Fun and easy.
17682,Enjoying the game so far. Seems to have lots of depth and is easy to learn.
17683,"Game fun, is free, play if thats the kind of things that suits you"
17684,It's better in early access than Clash Royale is as a finished product.
17685,fun to pass time
17686,"First time review here, what to say quick fun addicting game get it and enjoy enough said."
17687,AWESOME game pretty easy to get into and super addictive!!!
17688,unique take on moba but dont pull this review ur game now stuff
17689,Easy to understand and get into doesnt seem pay to win and deffinitely fast paced and fun
17690,yes
17691,Very fun game that has some nail biting moments and some good humor. 9/10
17692,Great game to pick up and play. There's not too much of a learning curve from what I can tell. Perfect to waste a quick few minutes if you're pressed on time too.
17693,"pros:
- decent game mechanics
cons:
- has a [b]massive[/b] problem with people intentionally abandoning/throwing matches without consequences, especially in diamond/master/grandmaster leagues
- leaving game open for more than an hour leads to huge frame drops, effectively causing temporary blindness every 20 seconds due to bad memory management
- their solution to having a 100% unmoderated chat was to add mentally disabled chat moderators handing out punishments to randoms while completely ignoring actual offenders"
17694,"Good game, nice an smooth game play. Many diff chars."
17695,"I haven't played the game that much, but so far it seems like a pretty cool game! The tutorial helps a lot, and is a skill based game and mind predicting gameplay. Ranking system is nice, as well as all the different cool items and scrolls you can get! I reccommend to at least try this game and see if you like it!"
17696,"Minion Masters is a minion summoning game, similar to games of old like Tower Wars, Summoner Wars and Clash Royale. You control 1 out of 11 possible Masters. The objective of the game is to destroy your opponent's Master before they destroy yours. 

Gameplay-wise, just use a mouse with/without QWER. You have a deck of cards made of minions and spells. At any point of time you will have 4 cards in your hand. 

Resources. Mana is constantly fed to you. Once you have enough mana, you can cast a card for its mana cost. 

There are 2 bridges on the map, top and bottom. If you capture a bridge, your Master will gain XP.  Gaining XP will allow your Master to level up and gain new special cards or special passives, thereby making it easier to win.

There are 11 Masters. Diona, King Puff, Milloween‎, Mordar, Morellia, Ratbo, Ravager, Settsu, Stormbringer, Volco. Each one has their own play style. Each of them has to be unlocked using Shards or Rubies.

Cards come in the form of 18 Buildings, 64 Spells and 128 Minions. Buildings don't move but give some ability. Spells are cast and require travel time as delay. Minions are creatures which can be classified into melee, ranged and flying.

06/03/20: Still as messy with multiple modes instead of 1 core mode. For some strange reason, devs can't integrate all their modes into 1 cohesive campaign. There's an intro, adventure, challenge, solo play, team play, etc 

Conclusion, this would have been a Yes if not for the P2W system and convoluted modes like Battle Pass and Mayhem. Just focus on your core mechanic. It's like Clash Royale on your mobile.

Note: Minion Masters is made by Beta Dwarf, a game developer in Denmark. They've made Forced, Forced Showdown and Minion Masters. Funded by London Venture Partners, Makers Fund, 1Up Ventures and Everblue Management. They attack a society epidemic; loneliness.

Beta Dwarf started in Copenhagen with a small group squatting in a university classroom for 7 months, getting discovered and moving in together for 3 years. Through a Kickstarter, a private bank loan and perseverance, they released FORCED, selling 500,000+ copies. They have since reached millions of players with Minion Masters.

[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]
1. Easy to Play
Just wait for the mana to build up and drop your units on the corresponding tile.

[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]
1. Pay To Win
$200.50 for 20,000 rubies. Please no. Spend it to unlock Masters, cards and XP.

2. Unnecessary Modes
Battle Pass and Mayhem mode is wasted. Battle Pass doesn't do anything, it's still a battle but you have to move dudes on a hexgrid before you fight. As for Mayhem, you might as well turn those modes into Master abilities.

3. Only 11 Masters
Way too few to generate sufficient combinations for depth."
17697,awesome
17698,"Can't connect to profile server.

Running as admin. Not firewalled, I know what I'm doing here.

Can see people talking in chat (and they tried to help too but it didn't work)
They told me server is not down. 
Checked server status.
Online.

I simply cannot connect. This doesn't mean that this is a bad game, but since the amount of game content I can access is 1 error and a live chat, that's the game for me, so it sucks.

Edit: I was going to try downloading again but I was looking at the screenshots and videos and this is clearly just Clash Royale."
17699,Very fun game with great mechanics and beautiful graphics
17700,"Loving the game so far. In the ever growing team based multiplayer game design, this gives fresh 1v1 gameplay"
17701,It's real easy and dope. Something if I turn off global chat every time can let my younger sibling play.
17702,sort of a combination between Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm. REally fun game
17703,"This game is really freaking good. Get it while it's hot.

It's fast-paced, fun, and has a ton of different modes. Get a friend in on it for even more excitement. You're still reading? C'mon dude, this game is free, and, like, [i]really freaking good[/i]."
17704,"it's so simple, yet so fun and addictive. spamming units so u still have a sense of control yet they fight as they please so u feel more like a commander than actually playing many units. it's high paced which i rlly love and yet so simple u pick it up through the first half game. i highly recommend anyone to dl this and challenge me :D :P
"
17705,fun game. very much like clash royale.

17719,"waow... i like it... i recommend it...
because of this battle royale is the best for me....
it is the real deal. it looks like chess game.
5*5 or 10/10
also it is better than pubg or fortnite, therefore i play clash royale...
so you can understand me, i hate dota, lol, cs:go.... and etc."
17720,good game
17721,other than a bad experience with my first team battle when my partner dc and i receive a loss. its been good.
17722,Addictive and easy to win in the beginning:)
17723,So much fun

"
17725,nice and addictive game
17726,"Loving it ! 

Just for a quick fun if long matches isn't your style, or while waiting for your other AAA games to download. 

Give it a go, it's free  :)"
17727,"Clash royale PC
Didnt pay long enough to confirm if it gets unreasonably grindy"
17728,very fun game
17729,"Looks fun so far. Fairly easy too.

EDIT: after playing for a awhile i get different bugs and crashes. Also very grindy. Thought i liked it , I really dont though..."
17730,so far they got the mix right and this game seems to be my next time sink
17731,"Simple, casual or competitive, fun"
17732,this game consumes my discord life
17733,"Fast and fun, still learning but the game puts you right in the action no waiting! That's always a positive!"
17734,great game
17735,"Games fun and easy to learn, not a pay to win good shit."

17737,this game is so rewarding and challenging at the same time. i love it.
17738,"Very easy to get into. Simple yet fun game mechanics. For somebody who plays a lot of Clash Royale, it's got a very similar feel. 

The Battle Pass is a nice edition as well. 

Just fun and addicting!"
17739,"Great fun for no cost.  I'm yet to spend anything on the game and play pretty casually, and I just reached Grand Master rank.
They keep it interesting with rewarding daily/weekly quests and missions, monthly ladder climbs, new cards, season passes, etc."
17740,Great Strat game.
17741,good game
17742,+
17743,Just like a PC Version of Clash Royale :)
17744,Really good fun but with the DLC I expect it will become pay-to-win
17745,"Good game, keeps crashing though.

AMD 1800X, Vega 64"
17746,Easy to learn and intuitive.And i like deckbuilding games.
17747,GAME GUD.
17748,"Do you like microtransactions? How about microtransactions? If that's not your thing, then how about a few microtransactions. They also have microtransactions, and even micotransactions! Spoiler alert - there are microtransactions.

Microtransactions."
17749,"funny :)

17750,"Nice game, nice mechanics and fun overall"
17751,fun fast gameplay
17752,"Fun, simple. havent gotten too far into ranked but to it has given me a few hours of fun. worth for a free game any day"
17753,Pretty sweet game
17754,"Such a fun, unique game! And the $14.99 VoidBorne DLC is free right now! Highly recconended!"
17755,"A rather quick and rather fun zerg-rush-simulator where you pelt the enemy to death with various monsters and spells. It's at least very fun at the start, unsure of late game."
17756,"fun, competitve, in a way pay to win as u can buy minions but still u can have fun without spending money in it."
17757,Really fun game!  Deck building and simple but with enough complexity so that not everyone are clones of each other.
17758,It's a decent fun game even if it seems a bit disconnected from being able to engage with other players. I like the funny narrator.
17759,I like
17760,"Really fun and addictive game , if you like something like clash of clans this is the game you should play , really easy to learn really fun"

17764,Fun game! reminds me of star wars force arena! love the graphics
17765,"Overall, love the game, great looks and particle effects. However, a more detailed guide on how to use the mechanics of the game would be a drastic improvement."
17766,good
17767,It's fast paced and good fun.
17768,"This game is very fun so far! It's a nice take on the genre.
The graphics are gorgeous and the puffs are adorable~
I highly recommend trying it out!"
17769,the game progress isn't saved
17770,Nice work
17771,"I've just started, its basically Clash Royale but expanded. Exactly what I was looking for :)"
17772,fun game

17795,GG
17796,Minions OP
17797,Well thought out challenges and rewards system. Easy to learn.
17798,so much fun reminds me of clash royale def worth getting
17799,very cool game
17800,Fun game. Good graphics. 10/10
17801,"Early to tell yet, but game is great so far."
17802,muito bom... excelente pra passar o tempo
17803,i like this game although this game is intresting and make work hard buy
17804,awesome game
17805,"pretty cool tug of war game. lot of the content is paywall to unlock, but you can play for the most part without paying."
17806,"Fun Game,  Easy to learn and fun coop"
17807,LOVE IT
17808,"Simple and effective, doesn't seem predatory"
17809,Recently started and can see the addiction effect. Simple to play and good fun. :)
17810,"The game is a great time killer. Once you start playing people that know what they are doing you feel lost but thats part of the fun, you want to understand deck builds just as well. my only ""complaint"" is that the menu is a bit busy, way to much stuff going on; i feel like i need to click on everything after a match."
17811,fun and easy to play
17812,"Game has a shit community. Top players intentionally show shit decks on ladder so new players get screwed crafting the wrong stuff. Sincerely regret spending money on this game feeling completely scammed.  

played time thus far is a complete waste would have to sink money in to make up for what was wasted thank's shit community you successfully pushed away a new player."
17813,nice game
17814,this game is a lot like south park phone destroyer only it's better because you can have team battles. it's fun and addictive.
17815,cool time killer
17816,"Just played a few games and I have got to admit it's so fun so far. I'm on a winning streak, maybe that's why. xD"
17817,nice pvp game
17818,"good game, shame it doesn't have sp"
17819,Very fun and relaxing game. Very fast matches.
17820,-
17821,fun! clash royale for PC and better!
17822,I liked the new take on traditional tcg's
17823,Quick pvp fun
17824,"Very fun visually super appealing to the eye, the sound so awesome i feel like I am part of ation with the announcer always talking to me awesome game will update with pros and con at later time"
17825,just like clash of royale but on pc
17826,"very well polished game for early access, very much like your mobile clash royale type game but better. look forward to future content and competitions/events that this game will probably have. also more cards/different creatures will no doubt be added. if you like a challenge and like pvp arena type games then you will love it"
17827,"Fun as hell. Taking all the various tired mechanics and smashing them all together in a way that is fluid, fun and - most importantly - intuitive. Killing it."
17828,"A buddy and I who usually play SC2, hearthstone, and LoL found a game that meets in the middle."
17829,"Is good game! like magic but with strats like it
"
17830,da
17831,"Easy, enjoyable. Not sure what I'm even doing but oh well"
17832,"i may not have alot of hours or so in this game but it is actually really fun, i recommand it, if you like clash royal you would totally like this game"
17833,A pretty fun F2P game that has good progression and isn't cancer like every other MOBA.
17834,"ehh its ok 

5/5"
17835,"Great game, Attention grabbing. If you liked clash royale you will clearly love this."
17836,Very fun and easy to play.
17837,I love this danish F2P game it's so awesome!
17838,"ITS GRRREAAAT
"
17839,"Very fun game, very simple, you can get all technical if you want, or if like me, just throw a bunch of random cards together then go for it.

I got to Plat so far just with a random deck.

I bought the  'buy all masters' and the 'premium upgrade' DLC - about $40 all up, just to support the game.
I felt like i was having fun and have already played 12 hours so far, so here, have some money.

TBH im stupid as hell at those clash royal ?clash of clans? what ever that game is scares me and im crap at it. this game is really fun and easy"
17840,It's a bit like Clash Royale but liking it so far!
17841,really fun game
17842,It is fun!
17843,Its similar to Clash royale in mechanics but deeper and not as annoying :)
17844,"Great game, simple at the core with so many types of cards and strats."
17845,pretty addictive gameplay
17846,"Good game, im the best"
17847,GOOD GAME
17848,"A game that doesn't require too much. Gives a lot of interesting ways to play and win. So far, no P2W sighted."
17849,Fun Good Game.
17850,This game is a best true strategy game i've ever seen in my life. You can make your own strategy to win the matches and get the best and that's the biggest plus of this game. I'm still new player in this game and that's the reason why i can't tell much but i'm pretty sure that after playing more and more i will be able to say more. For now i'm really enjoying this game (so obv give it a try)
17851,cool game!
17852,"its clash royale for when my phone is dead, also the gore and king tower strats adds an extra element to the clash royale game style"
17853,"Intresting progression system, still haven't played enough in order to decide whether or not the rng is directing you towards microtransactions. The game is very entertaining and i hope more people give it a chance.  All in all, can't wait to enter full launch :)"
17854,Amazing!
17855,"Yeah its fucking Clash and Duelyst pretty good,"
17856,I play this with my wife and it is fun
17857,Awesome game!
17858,"Simple, fun, the caster is amusing, just perfect to spend some time if ya bored."
17859,"really cool game, especially with the free dlc"
17860,:
17861,Clash Royale but actually good
17862,I like this kind of gameplay
17863,Good
17864,A great strategy game that can get really intense. No issues so far. Something that is really easy to pick up and play when you don't have a lot of time. Fun dialogue and smooth graphics. If you've ever played clash royale then you're in for a treat.
17865,Good enough
17866,"This is the alternative MOBA experience I have been looking for, for a while.
Deckbuilding is essential, but not too deep, so that most time will be spent on the battlefield. 
It does feel a little clunky in the UI, with features spread out on different panels so it feels like going through every room in your house for one task."
17867,feels like magic the gathering on steroids i love it ^.^
17868,Very awesome game unlike any other card games
17869,Fun game and its free pick it up!
17870,"Really enjoying this game,"
17871,"Honestly this games just so much fun in terms of how great the cards play out and how great the arena plays a big effect in the battle and the special characteristics each tower guard has, I play Clash Royale and can agree that this is the desktop ""clone"" to play and dedicate yourself in as much as Clash Royale. I've seen the reviews and comments saying this is a P2W game, which I highly disagree with. Ive gotten pretty far in a span of an hour or two, and enjoy every second of it. Go ahead and pickup this game for a great strategically thinking time."
17872,Same gerne with Clash Royale but much more tactics that could applied. So far I have no down point to the gameplay and the graphic. Good to know this game and have a play ;)
17873,meh free
17874,"In this game, I actually accepted the ""rate the game"" notification because this game is really fun. If clash royale and hearthstone had a baby."
17875,"easy to get into. matches can be done quickly and tempo is nice. animations are great and you dont have to wait long for ques at all
"
17876,really fun! great game!
17877,Yeah games pretty good
17878,"This battle arena type game is really fun! I just wish the map were *slightly* larger with maybe a central area, or several, to fight over even with 1-2 players.  Great fun so far though!"
17879,I like it alot
17880,"Great game
"
17881,Полчаса поиграть вполне можно.
17882,Love the game <3
17883,"Just started playing, so far so good. No pay to win as far as I can tell. Been going against people with different fancy masters and using the base one I'm still winning pretty easily. Strategy seems important."
17884,its pretty fun simple and i can just get in and play. its fair and doesnt seem inbalanced so im happy with it.
17885,not bad
17886,"its ok fast paced and free so far i don't see a microtransaction soft lock

EDIT:
after 5 hours i found the soft cap levels don't go up fast so not many new cards coming in
unless you buy them 
+-25-30 gold ea win and a card costs 1000-15000 gold 
daily quest/spin give more but it's still only daily 
i cant se any normal way unless grinding for a retarded long time to unlock more masters unless u buy them
its fun for a short time thanks to the free dlc u get but if u dont got that i can't recommend"
17887,pretty cool graphics
17888,"It's a game, and I'm playing. Hell yea."
17889,Very fun! and reminds me of some of characters tower defence in warcraft 3 era!
17890,Fun game so far
17891,A decent time sink of a game. Worth a try.
17892,"One of the best killing time yet fun games to play.
Easy game through and well developed game

Totally recommended!"
17893,Awesome game
17894,left click
17895,Fun! Thanks for this amazing game. Keep it up
17896,"It's Free, didn't expect much. 
It's basically like any RTS Arcade game where you throw minions at one another. Only here you choose a summoner with abilities and traits and your summoning choices in-game are limited by card draw RNG and mana that slowly replenishes.
Also, you put a deck together between games to determine what you can summon. 
It has a Ladder that you can climb and so far I've gotten into a game pretty quickly.  

Pretty Awesome so far. Graphics and sound are great too."
17897,ntaps
17898,I enjoyed playin it!
17899,"have played battle royal before on the mobile so the gameplay wasnt new. Still looks promising.

Note: Would love to have an auto deck builder capability."
17900,Pretty cool!
17901,nice game full automatic minion
17902,awsome
17903,Well tbh i'm really enjoying the game it is not that RNG based type of game that you expect it is about how you manage your own economy. So far so good plus its free dlc this week so join now uys
17904,game is addicting and has great replayability.
17905,Grab  it it's Free!
17906,Better than Clash Royale
17907,"Hey, that's pretty good!"
17908,"The game is really fun , fast paced , fast rounded , simple and not raging ! Keep up !"
17909,"I like to play it with my brother, but not alone! Pretty good game."
17910,It is a good game
17911,"game is great
"
17912,"gr8 game  get it get get it
"
17913,nice
17914,good  it is very delicious
17915,GG
17916,Fun Game
17917,Seems fun
17918,Clash but on pc defs good time waster game :)
17919,Not original but great game especially the graphics
17920,"NICE GAME,More Ai battle,pls"
17921,Very fun to play
17922,i have no idea whats going on but like it ;0
17923,its the best!!!
17924,"This game is basically a modification of Clash Royale with more magics and different mechanic. There also battle pass like how Fortnite do their things.


Pros:

+ I love the idea of capturing bridges to get extra xp which will activate perks that every character has;
+ Different character has different skill perk that makes this game more strategic;
+ The Twitch booster helps streamer (like me) got more chance to being discovered by new viewers.

Cont:

- It is quite confusing how is the precentage of each card in the ""lootbox"";
- I only found rank match;
- The game is not balance with Mana Frenzy mechanic;
- You can troll someone in the team match by just playing for 30 seconds then dc-ing yourself, it will makes your team lose then your teammate that actually want to rank up will lose 70 rank point.


In the end, this is a good game with more simple play mechanic but I'm not going to continue the play until they fix some stuffs (especially cont number 3 & 4).

Hope this will help."
17925,Fun game
17926,"I am  dota 2 player .Now also  Minion Masters fan.Love this game a lot.
"
17927,Cool GAME
17928,The Game it was epic fun to play!
17929,"I really recomend this game if you like strategy, and cards
The game makes you play with a bit of thinking just like in hearthstone, but with a bit more chalange, it is fun and I like the graphics, I just started playing it currently, but I love it"
17930,great game!
17931,"Just my quick 2cents.  7/10 *Updated rated 6.5/10 tops*

So Far I would rate it 6.70/10 for what it is, which means for sure above average, but nothing great, and couple things hold it back.

I have reached Gold without issue with the very Starting Deck, so it currently (as typing this) is far from P2W.

**1 the issues you may find though is once you reach level ~22 (which you can do in a day) you get jack all for rewards outside of events and daily and unless you got great luck expect a ton of duplicates and low grade with far to little ""dust""/currency to make up for that (Though this is how every card game is, hard for them to not be). 

But I do think this game kind of takes it both to far and yet generous compared to some like achievments are beyond grindy and somewhat a joke (example: recruit 100cost get 10 back or win 100ranked matches get a non noticable amount of rubies), but you get access to everything non cosmetic(in this so far cosmetics are no big) overall even if you have to wait a day to recharge or more for hero rotation (other then a few cards which are not needed to win, but req. either a massive grind or real $ again normal and understandable).

2nd big issue you may find is it Massively simple, there very little to it, kind of like a Heartstone for the total lax there a little timing needed as to when/where to place cards and that it, can't really currently make gimmick decks, no big combos, no hardcore need to plan ahead, expect to see similar send army builds very often with little thought (though expect to lose if the other player does time placements) etc...

Best part again though is currently it far from P2W and other then the useless """"legendary"""" dragon nest card so far it overall balanced to point you can reach Gold ranked with just starter deck. (though I bet if someone used all the top 2 tier cards they would have massive advantage, but idk).

*Update: There are some cards that are superior and of course on top of if add enough of them will make for easy win quite often. So very tiny P2W at some point for a bit. (Hard to escape this though as again kind of how card games are).

*Update* Can reach Plat. still with some luck with Starter Deck (A proper try hard deck will likely Wreck you and will 110% need a good teammate for duo), The *tiny* P2W mentioned above still slightly true, but overall play enough and be skilled enough and it barely noticeable - a few hours when you inbetween earning and having spent all earnings (remember keep rubies for battlepass don't waist them).
**Also it kind of dumbing down some things and selling a couple more things both understandable and easy to have opinion on, but would -.2 at least so now 6.5/7."
17932,"I used to be addicted to clash royale, until they started making lvling the cards even more of a chore.
This game is the perfect replacement and a better subsitute for those kinds of games in general.
Highly reccomend this game !"
17933,game is real fun and a nice mix of tower defense and card builds
17934,"Not going to lie, originally downloaded the game to try it because it was giving away an almost 20$ dlc so I figured I'd try it out. Has been the best baked couple hours I've had all day. And I've been baked all day >.>

Would Recomend"
17935,"Real time 1v1 or 2v2, deckbuilding, minions are varied, games are fast paced, rewards new players well."
17936,"The matchmaking is clearly not random.
Devs also lied about bots for a long time, so dont trust what they say."
17937,"Streamlined, easy to pick up, so far fun"
17938,Good Gameplay
17939,fun quick games.
17940,Good one
17941,Good start.
17942,"fast pace easy too get into i am loving the art style its a great  take on 
the tower defence games
"
17943,This game is really simple and fun!. what a blast....
17944,"After playing  a few games so far, I'm happy to say I'm very pleased with what I've got to try out. Game runs smooth as butter, getting matches seems to be pretty fast. and I love the spin it puts on this type of game, Hopefully It continues to be as good as Its been so far. Note this is only early access but it looks so promising def rec. in its current state"
17945,"So far so good. Easy to get in to, I'm sure it will be difficult to master. I will update my review after playing quite a bit more.
"
17946,"Fun, simple to get into, easy to do!"
17947,Pretty fun game that you can play on and off
17948,"Nice Game, Try it out."
17949,Playful and enjoyably fun
17950,GREAT!
17951,Really fun
17952,Easy to learn with some deep strategy. Like the 2v2 option
17953,funny game
17954,dank
17955,Pretty great game after 45 minutes of play.
17956,good game id recomend it. its kinda likeclash royal but i find it more enjoyable.
17957,Seems like a pretty good game i recommend it to other ppl. Team battle is fun too
17958,its pretty good.
17959,"It's a relaxed game,offers quick gratification,but has an in-depth skill floor-skill ceiling to it,and offers a more interactive/engaging feeling than hearth stone,but you don't play the characters you summon,and so its more relaxed than if you were playing characters like them in an mmorpg, in short its less chaotic. Due to the cast there's different team/solo compositions. character/deck team/solo compositions that one can use to engage the game with. Along with that,its a free to play game that has reasonable Premium content unique in design,cute design for the currency,and well polished,and the rewards being good makes players opt in more to want to purchase,and support the devs :D"
17960,"Alright alright alright! Let's see what we got...

Colossus in the horizon!"
17961,I enjoy it this game
17962,"The game is simple, easy to understand. The commentary is engaging, makes it more fun. There are many possibilities for deck building.
"
17963,It's polished Clash Royal
17964,Fun game
17965,"A free-to-play game that ( so far ) has no Pay2Win elements beyond normal card game shit ( buying card packs, etc )

Yes legendary cards are stronger but there are very clear tradeoffs and no unit is perfect. This game is a sort of dueling tower defense ( 1v1 or 2v2 ) where your deck determines everything and there are layers of strategy. Making a deck that can respond to enemy threats and be enough of a threat to pressure your opponent is 100% a more viable strategy than simply slapping in every epic or legendary you get.

The game is in beta, ive had a total of maybe 2 crashes at the end of matches. Overall, decent strategy without relying too much on twitch reflexes."
17966,"Its a nice game to play, great and easy intro.
Very helpfull loot for beginners."
17967,Fun.
17968,"tug of war f2p, like a good WC3 map"
17969,"crap combat type card game, no way to quit"
17970,"Fun game, easy to get into. Playing with a friend makes it a lot of fun. Fast paced and tense all the way through! Good game"
17971,"Simple, basic game yet it's very enjoyable to run it with friends."
17972,Simple and fun game play that rewards strategic players.
17973,i like this
17974,"Fun team game, quick and easy to pick up. real easy to get into as well however it seems pay to win for later.

follow up game updates too quickly to be a free player. Core game play is fun but catch up will require you to payout..."
17975,"Definitely a great game, really good smooth graphics too"
17976,"At first i thought it was a carbon copy of Supercell's Clash Royale, but this game is way funnier, and has better graphics too !
It also has 2v2 ranked matches, and the diversity of the masters and minions is well done.

Maybe the game still needs some balancing (the golem/stunning lancers combo is way too powerful)
But hey, this is a very nice discovery !"
17977,when you dont clash royale anymore so MINION MASTERS~!!!
17978,"Albert Einstein once said, ""Any fool can complicate a thing.  It takes a measure of genius to simplify it.""

Minion Masters is simple, fun, free, and addictive.  It's not turn-based.  You don't have to constantly click around to tell your minions where to go and what to target.  You play your cards onto the board, and let the minions do the rest.

...Seriously, it's only slightly more complicated than that.  I suggest you try it for yourself and see what all the hype is about."
17979,nice and friendly game to relax the matches are fast depends ur rank well is cool
17980,"Only just picked this up today, but it's got a simplicity and accessibility that's making it supremely enjoyable."
17981,I'm doing this for the free loot
17982,Short and sweet matches.  Cute art design. Simple tactics which seem like they will evolve with further card advantage
17983,Fairly good time waster
17984,"BEST GAME OF THIS KIND EVER MADE!
I REALLY RECOMEND, ITS REALY FUN AND COMPETITIVE!"
17985,"English / Spanish

18003,"Nice game, graphics are good, gameplay is good , overall fun game."
18004,Game is free and easy. Not much else to say.

18006,I think bigger map would be an improvement.
18007,"If you love casual play, this can be your charm."
18008,"5 different kinds of currency all of which are buyable, the constant you unlocked this pay us to unlock more of this, it is very very very fp2 bullshit. same feeling as other where you can tell over 90% of the time in the first minute if your going to win or lose, but it will take another 6  minutes to complete wasting your time.

base game good but the amount of bs makes it very very unpleasant"
18009,god
18010,"Fresh, fun, spicy, yah."
18011,This game is fun many happies

18017,"Fun game, quick to learn , fast paced and you can create very interesting strategies with the card system"
18018,"after 2 hours I can tell this game is worth the 0€ I paid for it. 
If it wasn´t free would had paid about 10€ ez for it if I had known it. No game to compare with , cardgame and minionfighting in one ! what u want more ?  get it now !  online pvp !  guilds !"
18019,cool game
18020,"WOW THIS GAME IS AWESOME HELL YEAH
"
18021,"Pretty great game, mixes the feel of your traditional trading card game with tower defense/RTS tactics. Would like to see more dynamic spells that affect the field, or a campaign/conquest mode."
18022,just fun to play
18023,great game and not p2w at all
18024,cool game ;)
18025,"crossbreed between MOBA, TCG and lane defense; quite fun"
18026,"Game is addictive, and balanced, and fun. Has a skill element to it. Haven't even had to use the free gold to buy cards and I'm enjoying it, and I think that is saying a lot."
18027,pretty good
18028,"Cool,Easy,Simple and Pefect!"
18029,Really fun!
18030,Seems like a fun little game :)
18031,"Jogo bonitinho, mecanica legalzinha, progressão legal"
18032,"For the most part, it is a fun competitive game. I used to play a card-collecting tower-defense flash game series called Epic War, and it's very reminiscent to that (on the off-chance that someone reading this has played Epic war 2 and/or 3 lol), except it's a top-down perspective and a bit more nuanced. I mainly play random Team Battle. For a very simplistic competitive free-to-play game, it's pretty good.

Oh, it might also be important to note that on first boot-up with a fresh account, it kicks you right into a tutorial match.



Pros:

- A nice overview interface on start-up that gives you a rundown of most of the things you could be concerned about: your daily, the news and updates, etc.

- Quick to jump into a game, quick to finish a game— especially in the early stages of playing the game at low ranks, games go by super quickly if you have good gaming sense: like 3 or 4 minutes tops until Silver or Gold. But even then, if you've got the experience of master or grandmaster, games won't be difficult or long until maybe platinum or on the chance you run into another seasoned veteran climbing up the ranks again. Queues are quick, as well. I don't think I ever waited in queue for a minute or over.

- Quick to take up. I didn't find the various minions and the stats too overwhelming to remember or the mechanics difficult to gain a grasp on. It also didn't take me long to figure out viable strategies, counters, and whatnot. You'll constantly find people in chat bragging about how easy the game is— and that's true, up until you reach the pinnacle.

- Pleasurable aesthetics. I might differ from most in this department since I usually have a lower standard of what I think are pretty graphics, but this game meets those. Sounds and audio are fun. HUD and interfaces aren't anything to complain about. All around, I think. No complains about any design, as far as I can think of. There's a moderate amount of customization available for skins and whatnot, like your master's skin, the playfield, emotes, etc. Paid, of course, with a few unlocks through leveling and the occasional for-gold purchase in the shop that cycles daily.

- Match replays are saved automatically locally on your computer.

- Some variety of stuff to do:
  + There's premade or random 1v1, 2v2 (Team Battles), a draft pick mode where you select among a random set of masters and minions and go at it until you lose three matches, and some other game modes that cycle through days at a time which also close off after you lose three matches. There's a map exploration that cycles, too, where you explore a small hexagon-tiled map and battle NPC opponents here and real players there to unlock a smidgen   of gold and an in-season card unlock token if you win.
  + Dailies and achievements integrated in the game, of course. There's a Battle Pass and player level ranking system that rewards completion of matches and wins. A lot of the goodies to be gained from the Battle Pass have require a paid service to get the full rewards, though. Every day, their shop cycles through stuff you can purchase with the more common currency in gold that you can win meager amounts of from matches that allow you a chance at new cards.
  + Guilds are a thing. Joining one is highly recommended to gain rewards. You get to join in an effort to level up the guild by winning 1v1s or 2v2s without losing three times-- I think up to six times before it caps your participation. These guild events also temporarily unlock cards for all guild members to use, which grant bonus points for somethink if they're used in the matches.



Cons:

- The first time I reviewed this game, I got into how the quick come-up through the ranks grinds (pun intended) to a halt at master because that's where the meta and the tried-and-true strategies appear. And, it was frustrating to me at first because I lacked not only the cards to replicate them, but also cards to counter them. However, I don't think it's quite fair to say the game is ""pay-to-win"" as I did and as I agreed with others on. I still think that the very core starting deck without promotion-based giveaway expansions is very lackluster and you can only get so far with them before you just cannot do much about the versatility of masters and minions you'll face.
But, I think of it as not unlike other games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty. You'll start at rank 0, and maybe you joined at a much later time than the other experienced players did. Now you only have the starting equipment while everyone else has swanky s**t. You're going to have to deal with the ""new player experience"" and lacking the unlocks you want, but you'll eventually get here... in a long while after, unless you buy those expansions. But you can definitely get by with just a few variations of cards and reach GM with just those.

- Speaking of communication, it's a fast-paced game, which I understand. However, the only form of communication during matches are four pings (exclamation mark, sword for offense, thumbs up, and an 'x' to signify ""wtf r u doin"" or ""i don screwed up"" sort of deal) and  ""meme emote"" pop-ups. Again, I don't know if allowing typing in-game would help or hurt (it might hurt if people are too busy typing away in a game where every second is crucial). Still, it's something to consider

- Losses aren't recorded on record in your stats (at least, they're not shown). I can appreciate what this does, but being a competitive person I'd like to see my win/loss ratio instead of just the wins.

- Can't see people's profiles through right-click menus from chat nor in guild.

- Announcer dude is flamboyant af. Makes me feel a bit wary of ever playing this in front of people with the audio on lol but it takes just a bit of time to habituate to him

- If you get a disconnection/relog message immediately after you win and you want to complete your dailies, you'd best manually relog so your wins actually count towards the objectives-- otherwise, they'll go unnoticed and won't be tracked. Also, if your teammate disconnects, you'll lose the game on the spot. Don't know another solution to deal with ""oh shit, we're losing— I need to disconnect to avoid losing!"", though

Overall, this is a nifty little game to pick up if you're looking for something simple to screw around with friends or just on your own up. Just know that there is going to be a place in time where your cards might not be sufficient, and you'll just have to grind through and hope for the unlocks."
18033,"Well, so far the game is fast-paced and doesn't seem to require a ton of thought. There's a few interesting mechanics and interactions that have made it fun so far, however, I've found opponents that have a lot of cards that do things I am unfamiliar with and am not sure what the game could do better to introduce those mechanics. I feel like the tutorial should be expanded a bit to familiarize players with any and all mechanics that cards can have and give at least one example of an interaction of each mechanic, but I guess that's a lot to ask, and that the tutorial would last about an hr if executed that way. The default tutorial is fine, but some optional stuff afterward would be welcomed by newer players I think."
18034,Fun game
18035,fun simple game
18036,"Great overall experience, fun to play and very fast game mechanics. Easy to learn and quick to progress and unlock things. No P2W aspect so its a 4.6/5 from me."
18037,Awesome

"
18060,"Pretty fun. Great to play with a friend.
"
18061,its kinda intresting
18062,This should be a phone game.
18063,Amazing and game killing game!
18064,"Honestly got this game because it was free but had a great time, so many rewards and so fun to play especially with friends, would definitely recommend and can't wait to see what's to come for this game!"
18065,"As a MTG fan, the deck building aspect clinched it for me. Never played a moba before so didnt know what to expect there but its worth a gander. Give it a go."
18066,"I wish I could link my Steam and Discord accounts.
I also wish I could friend people in game by name.

*edit 10/2020
They no longer support Discord, so they transitioned to Steam.
It was awkward and I lost my decks.
Besides my decks, I have no way to know how much I've lost in the transfer.

I love this game but I feel so sad. I've wanted a port to Steam for a long time, but I didn't want to loose my stuff! I was level 80 for crying out loud, and I loved those decks. I can't even open the Discord to note what my decks were.

*edit 11/23/2020
I'm pretty sure the transfer from Discord to Steam broke my ability to get achievements.
Their promised update is also insulting, there are so many ways to balance a game with paid rewards and they chose a bad option... I don't mind that they want money, they have to eat too. Except they're pulling from the game to make it happen.
Honestly my review is going to change to not recommended soon..."
18067,^-^ lots of fun
18068,I am having fun against computers so far.
18069,This is fun! I think the deck construction is good and the matches seem relatively fair (early on anyways). I get a tiny bit of slowdown sometimes but it doesn't really affect anything. Super work devs!
18070,This game is like good version of clash royale and its a nice game to stream too
18071,Super fun game.  There are a million different strategies you could concoct to win...or lose.  :)
18072,like clash of clans but not effected by cash as much it seems.
18073,"If you've played games like clash royal, this game will be easy to pick up for you. It is friendly with its free to play users, specifically rewarding those who follow and actually play the game free DLC content and daily bonuses. As for the gameplay, the card concepts are interesting and vary in complexity however game balance is somewhat unstable though the devs do a pretty good job when it comes to actively balancing cards and making tweaks. All in all, its free so go try it out and see if its for you."
18074,"If Hearthstone were a tower defense.  
Still not sure where some of the rules are, but most of it's been pretty intuitive."
18075,"Very nice game. Good, easy UI. Really easy to start playing. You don't need to start by reading about things, but get in the action head first and learn the basics. Looks ok. The announcer voice could use some improvement, that's about the only thing about this game I can nit pick about after the first hour of play."
18076,Not a fan of these card games BUT LOVE this one!  not like any other iv ever played before!!
18077,Great game! More add ons and game mode
18078,So much fun
18079,Very cool gameplay and videos
18080,pretty fun
18081,Easy to play - optimized well - awesome art - addicting.
18082,"Minion Masters is a strategy card game with beautiful artwork and an amazing community.
I will give my full description of the game and my opinions at the end of this review!

Pros:
Deck building 
Artwork
Gameplay
Matchmaking

Cons:
Rough Start (explanation at end)
Card Leveling (again at the end)

This game is amazing it has everything you look for in a strategy game. The deck building system is awesome it makes for some amazing synergies. The rough start I talk about is the game may feel pay to win but really its not you can get everything free. The Card leveling doesn't do anything but bump up how fast you push the battle pass nothing more. (at least that means there's balance.)"
18083,A really great game that is easy to understand and play
18084,Free and amusing so far
18085,not bad
18086,great game i like it
18087,"All I'm going to say is that if you want to play something fun, without being pay to win, this is the game for you!"
18088,This is a pretty fun game. I would recommend people check it out to see what they think.
18089,I tried the game while free and have really enjoyed my time with it. Having a lot of fun with my friends would recommand!
18090,"Incredible, too bad i haven`t heard of this game earlier. Alot of fun, if you have friends - even more when you team up."
18091,GJ.nice game for  killing time
18092,"Got it free as part of the promotion, but after the first hour i feel it is a cool game. It is certainly good for having fun for a few minutes. I don't know about broken deck or such things yet but i think it has a future."
18093,I love this game! :)
18094,Is very good
18095,Quick fun time waster ;/
18096,Good game
18097,"This is an amazing game, graphics, gameplay and sound is perfect. Just. Wonderful."
18098,Gr8 Gamu
18099,"addictive and a great time killer!
"
18100,Hooked me instantly!
18101,Love the game on first try and I am interested in playing on so please give the Battle Pass on sale :)
18102,interesting so far.....
18103,"Very good game, similar to Clash Royale except there is only 1 tower instead of 3, and it's horizontal instead of vertical. You also get 10 cards per deck instead of 8. It is also not pay to win, so it's nothing like Clash Royale."
18104,I am really enjoying the game not a huge learning curve lots of fun.
18105,"Not all that big on MOBA style games, but its pretty fun"
18106,Played it for a bit. Very nice casual game. Not sure if some cards are op tho
18107,noice
18108,"1- it's free 
2- it's good 
3- can't wait for the competitve matches"
18109,"sh.t Developer do not care about balancing...they make a new Master, OP and leave it..."
18110,"Great game 
Really relaxing , but can be competitive. 
Really nice graphical style 
Its free.. 

10/10 
Is less cancerous than Clash Royale 
If you play Clash and are any good at it, you'll smash people in this at first."
18111,"Cool game. A dinamic card game style, where u battle solo or duo against other players.
Collect minions, spells and strutuctures to dominate the battle field.
Dinamic and very quick matches are a nice feature of this game."
18112,Fast-paced action.
18113,Maybe you can add some balancing on cards.
18114,"have only Played this game for a couple of hours here are my initial thoughts:
In short this game is ""Clash Royal"" but better! ;D
and here is why:
1. your ""kings"" are not useless range creeps, you have several ""masters"" they have several skills and you need to build your deck around the master
2. grind is much more limited! you don't have to play for 1 week straight to only to get 1 card maxed out! cards power will not change once you have them, there is also a system like hearthstone dust stuff, i think it was called crystals here, its a currency item that lets you make the cards that you are missing.
3. micro transaction prices make sense and they won't affect the game that much
4. player base is still rather new so new players will have a good game experience (you can start winning from first hour if you think a bit! don't have to go mega hardcore and read online guides,  go find a match and start having fun!)
5. game design and production quality is solid!

still could use some improvements though, specially in info-UI part, as a new player there was a lot of thing that i was not sure about and i expected to right click on anything and see an info panel, maybe even mid match ;D it's PC so we are not limited by smartphone restrictions."
18115,"Nice concept and visual

Plz emphasis on tips and tricks to play game more effectively"
18116,"Totally recommend, played this on discord. Wonderful game."
18117,This is a well designed game which can be played on any device really and is good fun and wastes a lot of time. LOVING IT!!!!!!
18118,Clash Royale but more balanced and you can play with a partner in one team. Very nice.
18119,this game is well made easy to get into and great fun.
18120,Great fun and doesn't seem to much of the pay-to-win mentality thus far. If you enjoy hearthstone / auto-chess then this is for you!
18121,Very good game.

18151,Absolutely incredible action gameplay! Perfect mix of Clash Royale and Hearthstone! Feels well balanced and so much fun
18152,RTS*CGI + WC3 Castle Fight = this
18153,not bad...
18154,6/10
18155,"What can i say, as a newbie i played a few PvP games and ran into other newbies. I can't be sure they weren't bots, but at least it's fun at this point."
18156,is very good
18157,BEST GAME! SOME OF THE CARD DESCRIPTIONS ARE FUNNY AND THE GAMEPLAY IS GOOD TOO
18158,This game is fun
18159,"I realy enjoy this game :D, much to learn and fun to play"
18160,It is simple and fun to play...it's very quick...i like the concept..have a potential vibe....if they could pull off a 5 vs 5 map without getting lag then i very recommend this game
18161,"Very nice game, highly recommendable, go for it! :-)"
18162,game steal and copy lol hero terran from sc and from d3 demon hunter plus game breake law usign hazard for pay to win cheast whit randoem stuf so hazard witch overwatch did get  law problem and they need change it game ar made for phone to tiny to be game plus its bornign and pay to win they us all games heros in it if they go to police they lost  for stealign copy right and game ar bornign as hell!
18163,Well designed game. Pretty fun and with multiplayer battles!
18164,Nice and smooth game. Just gives a lot of fun and no need for time to invest.
18165,"Fun times, but some things could be streamlined. Open multiple chests at once, different hero animations for two of the same on one team. Good times :)"
18166,I watched Kripparian play a few games and that got me hooked. The game has a nice pace -- it's not too hectic. Exactly the type of game I want right now.
18167,Good game so far.
18168,"I'm being disconneted from the game where my opponent's hp 100
"
18169,good game
18170,"Simple, quick and funny."
18171,really fun
18172,It asked me to post a review like a mobile game. Take that for what you will
18173,Awesome game fun to play for short bursts or even if only 5 min to spare
18174,Fun game. A mix between Moba and card game.
18175,Play now!
18176,"This game is gold dude, try it out."
18177,"You can't go wrong as a dev as long people like those games where the winner is determined in the very first minute of the game. This game's layout makes it almost impossible to comeback once your enemy starts to overpower you. Based on random, it favors the more skilled player with perk mechanic. It also doesn't give a single duck about new players as the only tutorial you get are 3 matches against dumb AI. There is enough free space in the UI to denote at least the attack type and HP of the units, but they preferred the RTFM way. All in all, it's far too complex for a no brainer and far too underdeveloped for a serious competitive game."
18178,Super fain !
18179,nice..
18180,  very good
18181,Surprisingly fun gj so far.
18182,To start I got the game when it was free. It is an easy to understand game  so far. I'm sure with more time I will have a deeper understanding of proper strategy.
18183,"good game
"
18184,"Good Game, much download :D"
18185,Amusing game thus far. With absolutely no money spent it has been enjoyable.
18186,fun game
18187,not bad
18188,Fun
18189,if it was not free i wont get a chance to try this out and recommend ppl to play it
18190,"love the game play simple and easy,battle and go one to the next with grate units and nice combo its like clash of kings only better ^^ over all a must for all tower-DF players"
18191,"Simple mechanics, so far played only a while, but see some depth in this game."
18192,"Happened to see Sinobii stream and decided to give the game a go, i'm enjoying it and love how quick things move!"
18193,amusing time killer
18194,GOOD FUN GAME
18195,"Man, this game is soo addicitve atm. Alot of games have time consuming battles but this has  minimal. 2-6min and done. Support devs!"
18196,Pretty good game
18197,its pretty fun though
18198,"clash royale, but 5x better."
18199,"It's a copy cat of Clash Royale.  It's fun.  And it's free.  After 30 minutes, I'm probably done with it because it already seems like more of the same."
18200,"This is addicting, especially with friends"
18201,"Why am I leaving a negative review for a game I played for almost 400 hours? Well, this game is good and it has potential to be a great hit, but this company's business model is dishonest and it negativelly affects gameplay too much. This is how these developers make a ""free to play"" game viable:

1. They release a super overpowered and clearly broken feature (example: new card, new master etc);
2. If you want to use this new overpowered feature right now, you will probably have to spend real money;
3. If you didn't buy this new feature, you'll keep losing over and over again, because the game is unbalanced and broken;
4. After 1 or 2 months, developers ""fix"" this new feature, to ""balance"" the game once again;
5. After a few weeks, a new super overpowered feature is released and the cycle restart.

I don't mind paying for a free to play game. Actually, I did. I have 3 DLCs in my library, if you check. And yes, I paid real money for a super overpowered feature, but it had no fun to me. It was like beating an old man to the ground with a baseball bat. I am a competitive player and I like a fair play. I hate when someone has an advantage, even when I am the one who has the advantage. So, if you want a good, fair and competitive game, not a pay-to-win scam, go play something else, like Dota Underlords."
18202,Extremely intuitive
18203,Good game.
18204,Great!!! Much better than crash royal!!
18205,"nice mechanics and addictive :D
good for time killing ^^
"
18206,pretty fun and self explaining
18207,Just play it
18208,good game
18209,"This game is pretty fun actually! It looks like Clash Royale but PC version, I'd recommend it to anyone that played that game and people who like strategy games!"
18210,good combo of tower and cards.
18211,I love this game because i love the way the combat was and multiplayer. I LOVE IT! *gives the game 5 stars*
18212,"Just a quick, fun game with seemingly plenty of depth."
18213,"Fun and Strategic game, Clash Royale Style"
18214,"The game loads too slowly, especially compared to other games in a very similar vein as this one. Games take long to get into (as in the wait period to get into the match itself). Could use with more instructions on how different things work (like chests, different currencies, mechanics etc.). Otherwise I'm enjoying it. Pretty fun"
18215,"So far im loving it, The micro transactions are a shame but given that I got this game for free plus its DLC i think its absolutly worth trying out. Its a really fun game."
18216,"Just started. Have not played card based games before. Easy enough to pick up and begin learn. Winning much is another thing, but I am enjoying it so far."
18217,"its fun 
"
18218,c chill
18219,Enjoyable and easy to learn. A better version of Clash Royale in my opinion. Love it!
18220,this game is addicting ! and it is simple to play
18221,great game
18222,"awsome game. Good dinamics, good graphics and over all super funny to  play!"
18223,"Great interactive game, lots of fun with quick games that really put the pressure on."
18224,"Simple and easy,"
18225,"8/10

just another of these games just like the card ones. 

nothing new but a perfect money-grab game.

this is not a pay to win, what you actually pay its for slots and other things like exp and gold buff, but nothing more than that.

the game its simple. stick to cards whit 1* to 5* to win in long term battles because minions of low mana consumption will get you more far away than a 9 mana card.

the game after some plays became boring and repetitive.

its a good game, but i don't recommend it for people who want to enjoy different type of experiences playing and this one its just repetitive."
18226,I like this game. It's pretty good. You shoot and boot and sometimes you scoot! It's amazing!
18227,PvP battle cards no P2W
18228,Good
18229,"played many mobas. this is quick and easy to learn and looks very nice and the sounds are great.
as with many mobas though it is not without its drawbacks. i like to play single player and i do not know if there is much single player content. there of course is pay aspects of this as well. would be nice if there was one game that there was no pay store and everything was earned through game play but i fear those day are gone. over all this is a easy game to play and a good time burner and nothing more at least for me.
over all great job on the game itself the devs should be proud

***UPDATE***
everything i said above is true but...after  you have played awhile you start to see a strat evolve.
once you start hitting gold ranks you start seeing what i call cheese, you play  cards that take mana. you earn mana on a timer, so the cheese is if  you remember games like  star craft . you would make a ton of small things to invade and win. same thing here you build a deck of lower cost mana and boom more troops then can be handled if you do not get enough cards of low mana yourself. there is your cheese in this game. overall its a nice game ut due to the lack of real players it is not worth the time or effort to play. now if ppl would play it like a real say chess match it would be fine but they wont so what is the point of getting higher end cards to never use them and just cheese your way through. i played till i was almost diamond then started seeing this, i simply do not have enough low mana cards to compete with what they have so it is an uninstall for me"
18230,Simple but deep.
18231,its fun enough an hour in.  no way im playing against real people though as i am jack stomping fools in the wood league.  im not this type of player who dominates like this in any game ever.  havent lost a game in wood league yet.  11/10 would get a false sense of power again.
18232,"A well developed tower game!  I created a guide for this game that will be a bit more informative then a simple review ...

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2359053081"
18233,"It reminds me of game called Battle Forge. Very enjoyable, kinda miss this game."
18234,"absolutely love the quick to the action style, jumped right in and am having a blast!"
18235,"'Funny' and tactical game with easy to learn mechanics. The combat is colorful and refreshing but also challenging at the same time. I like the harmless humor as well as the harmless combat animations (very restorative after all the blood and violence in other games...)

It's free to play, so I recommend to give it a try."
18236,im playing with myh besetest fwendes and its fun
18237,"Addictive and fun to play alone or with friends!
It's quite easy to farm gold and build new decks.
The variety of game modes such don't bore you at all.
And it's freaking FREE!"
18238,"Reminds me a lot of battle royale but better
"
18239,"game is good, can be annoying, but overall its very well done"
18240,"This game is amazingly fun, free, and NOT a lazy cash grab!  Support it!!"
18241,made well
18242,Tower defense/ strat game.  Haven't been playing long so I don't know all the ins and outs but so far it seems cool.  Will add to this when I have played more.
18243,its good.
18244,Good Game
18245,"it's fun, and it's free.
why not give it a try?"
18246,Just what i was looking for.
18247,My first ever time at a MOBA game so far i like it a lot fun simple good graphics!
18248,awsome
18249,Profile Server Unavailable (1-28) i won't change it until i not need using vpn to play game...
18250,"Usually never leave reviews, but this game has forced my hand. It is great, not just because of how awesome of a card game it is, but because they do things that almost no gaming company does, they give out free content, INCLUDING DLC's thats how you know they care about their player-base."
18251,Haven't played for long but seems like a cool game
18252,"Great change of pace game.  A mix of Balloon meets Art of War.
"
18253,"Pretty fun so far ! (Only about an hour into it, but it wanted me to leave a review.)"
18254,"fun and addictive, with an interesting community.

"
18255,Fun game overal
18256,Game is fun. I enjoy it. Not a bad time.
18257,"New game that i actually enjoy playing, awesome. It's connection of league of legends/hearthstone and tower building. Great idea."
18258,"fun at the start but after diamond the gameplay is just boring as f***, the same meta cards, the same playstyles, you can't really experiment with the deck, the game has a descent amount of cards but tbh you'll only use 10 or so, im voting up because the game has a lot of potential, even if the gameplay is quite restricted by the meta they can change that easily, a greater amount of cards and a lot of balance will bring this game from the shadows"
18259,Fun and addictive. Easy to play and have many options as leveling.
18260,"yeah, lots to click on ...even though i am no fan of the magic stuff  or card games (but cant say no to a free weekend ). ..on second thoughts the magic is not something i would put in front of  young kiddies ...imho      but the play is enjoyable"
18261,Fun and stratigic
18262,me gusta el juego porque tiene variedad de clases y es mas completo que otros
18263,"The game is freaking awesome, but 2 things to note:
Please do not bombard me with so many rewards, and do something about the UI. It's extremely cluttered."
18264,Casual
18265,"Solid, great game... another genre than dota, and more enjoyable too... give it a try"
18266,It's alot more fun then I thought it was gonna be.
18267,Fun stratedgy game with many different cards with unique abilities.
18268,"It's fast! It's fun! It's Minion Masters!

1/15/22 Edit: Updated name to be correct"
18269,"hey man pretty godo game :) I have won every time with my buddy Nextlevelnick!
I recommend it for team battle!"
18270,sofarsogud
18271,its a fun game
18272,Awesome
18273,"Honestly it was just very fun. Kept me excited, made me think, and I just like card games and tower defense so this works for both. =)"
18274,"Simple, great visuals, and fast paced. Been looking for a game like this to play between work and homework."
18275,I forgot how much I enjoyed that popular mobile game from a few years ago (is it still popular? who knows) and now am so happy this is a thing.
18276,A lot of fun so far
18277,I got to say that this game has a very good rating. The game should be for 3+
18278,"Weird, different - fun so far..."
18279,"It is a very nice game, i received it for free. It's like Clash Royale but better"
18280,"Fun little game to fill the time. Rounds dont take very long, so it is good for between work or other games."
18281,I enjoy this game
18282,Fun.
18283,Easy to learn fun to master.
18284,"Solied game
"
18285,"When in Doubt, Claws Out! 

Mittenz 2020, y'all!"
18286,Ez4ENCE
18287,pretty good. its crash royal on your pc without all that pay to to win shit that makes royal horrible. worth playing if your looking for something free to play.
18288,goodbye clash royale
18289,"Addictive.  Games are relatively quick(10-15 minutes), and it seems to be balanced.  Definitely recommend."
18290,"Only been a few minutes - ten or so matches - but fun, fast paced without being frenetic.  The matches are close, so the designers are good at making matches.  Most certainly worth a try!"
18291,not bad
18292,Very fun game to play
18293,Good game and not pay 2 win
18294,"super fun, easy to understand, hard to master it (unless you are a card game veteran who played mtg, legends, castle clash)"
18295,"I started playing this game this morning and so far from what I've played, it has charm and character.
I thought it be like another one of those dull mobile phone games but this game doesn't really feel like its shoving my face with ""Hey! Buy this with real money to get good! NOW!"" I don't really get that vibe from this game at all.
If anything, this game is fun as a pass time. Don't know what to play if you're bored but not committed to something longterm? Then play this."
18296,its fun and addictive
18297,Very fast paced and entertaining. Feels wel balanced so far
18298,"Solid, well executed clash like.  No complaints."
18299,Simple but enjoyable game. But being simple doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lot of strategy behind
18300,"Addictive as hell and fun to boot, great playing co-op with a buddy and the micro transactions aren't absurdly priced like most games. come for the freebeeis, stay for the succubi."
18301,"I don't think I've really played a game like this before. It's got combination of collectible cards, tower defense, real-time strategy, and a certain pick-up-and-play-ability. I jumped into this partly because it was free and also there was an offer for free dlc, so I figured ""Why not?"" - I'm glad I did."
18302,"Well, I like this game not only because it's free, but because of interesting idea and realisation."
18303,good little game..very rock paper scissors.....its definetly a gatcha type game. Team battles are cool
18304,"This game is absolutely simply amazing! I never played such a good card-based royale game (Sorry Clash Royale), I would highly reccomend it to friends and gamers!"
18305,"Quick, easy too play and lot's of fun. Just wish decks could be a bit bigger for better card variety."
18306,Seems good so far.
18307,Fun with Friends!
18308,A fun little lane based game.
18309,"Simple fun card/moba strategy game, haven't experienced p2w yet, just stupid mistakes I could have overcome with more practice. Free dlc event, no brainer to pick it up"
18310,awesome
18311,fun and fast
18312,Chill and fun game!
18313,"fun click strategy game.
Contrary to what some people say this game is not Pay to win... by a long shot.
everything in the game can be unlocked by just playing and earning tokens which you can buy power tokens that give you more cards and shards(another currency) you can use shards to even unlock other Masters....   the game, as a strategy game can get intense -you can play solo or on a 2 player team... either pre selected team mate or let the game pair you up.. like anything you just need to take your time and learn how things work- this includes earning tokens and shards and cards.. If you do not have patience then yes- you will feel like you need to pay money to unlock things quicker... unlocking extra Masters does not give you an advantage-you can still easily win with the first Master they give you.. a ranged bow man."
18314,"Nice game, simple and ez.
I hope everyone enjoys the game."
18315,"Brilliant, entertaining and simple game. I can see this HUGE in the Esports arena!"
18316,not bad i guess
18317,it gut
18318,!
18319,Very good game
18320,Top notch chest-opening simulator. The way it makes you wait a few milliseconds to claim your prize after you click on each of the chests is really something special! I also enjoy that one has to earn the right to have an actual exit game button... (maybe it comes in a level 7 chest?)
18321,gg
18322,good game 👌.
18323,very fun game easy to play
18324,good!!
18325,"Got it because it was free for the weekend..... But now I actually enjoy it a lot. Still learning some of the mechanics, might adjust review later, but right now, absolutely grab it while it's free."
18326,very easy to start plenty of things to do in the game time flys past
18327,this game is easy play but hard to master.
18328,its similar to clash royale
18329,Like a better clash royale
18330,Nice fun game based on tower defence !
18331,Good

18333,Its good F2P Caste Strike game!
18334,tHIS IS SUCH AN ENJOYABLE GAMES SO FAR
18335,"Love the fact that the games are really short and intense, really scratches an itch for me"
18336,habe es heute angefangen zu spielen und muss sagen es macht mir spaß ist ausgeglichen und doch ansprechend und fordent
18337,"Eh, it's pretty fun. some of the cards aren't really worth their cost though."
18338,Fun to play with friends and good for spending time
18339,Fast and good game. Definetly enjoyable
18340,nice game is fun hope it is not pay to win
18341,"Really enjoyable game, fast paced and very funny.
You must try it :D"
18342,It's like Clash Royale but on PC.
18343,Its fast paced but there are times where they can last a decent time and there's lots of cool cards
18344,great game everything is done perfectly easy to learn
18345,"game is fun, granted i just started but the game is simple to learn and you catch on really quick. only thing i am not liking so far is how to unlock characters without paying money. but as long as you have a decent deck you can play with any master (character)"
18346,Gg
18347,GGWP
18348,cz its fun!
18349,Love it <3 a must play
18350,"Simple - fun, rinse and repeat."
18351,Good Game kep the god work :)

18353,"awesome game ,"
18354,"Fun gameplay, the team battle ia a blast to play with friends!"
18355,"fun game, simple and easy to learn"
18356,its nice for a free game
18357,"NIce game well played,,,"
18358,enjoying the game so far.  :)
18359,"Get it, it's good and it's free."
18360,"I enjoyed the game so far. It's all great fun and it is quite simple to get started. once you play your first game and get the hang of it, you can't stop playing!! Good job. I cant wait to see if there are going to be more masters to choose from."
18361,easy and interesting
18362,Very fun
18363,just started playing and i've been enjoying every moment of it
18364,its fun
18365,Cool game and strait rules
18366,Nice game to kill a bit of time. I liked it overall.
18367,I FEEL LIKE THE WORLD WILL NEVER DIE
18368,good game
18369,"Straightfoward enough. Entertaining, Matches are quick. Numbers go up. Excellent F2P value so far."
18370,Fun
18371,"it's a good game,i'm enjoy this!! XD"
18372,"Simple,quick,has it's own style and charms. The character  voicelines need a bit more variety I think,but the game looks and plays realy well so far."
18373,nice game
18374,Have only just started playing but the amount of polish and awesome game-play (so far) has got me loving the game!
18375,Seems fresh and familiar at the same time
18376,Pretty unique card game.  I really like the real time aspect!
18377,"Is it a pay-to-win? Yes, but then again, almost every game today is. But this one is good. You can pay to get nice cards but you still need to know how to play them, otherwise they are worthless. I recommend this game cuz its fun to play, interesting AND fast-paced... so, there you go, play it :D"
18378,fun phone game
18379,Smooth and simple game with easy enough to understand basics... Havent played long enough to tell you how the long you can keep playing but I'm enjoying what im playing so far
18380,
18381,"well... i guess it just fine... never really liked card games, but this is kinda addictive."
18382,"Ok, this shit is fun, i hate playing solo online and i hate card games, but this one has 2v2 and its really good, try it out.

Edit: Many, many hours later, im still hooked on it, just want to clarify that this is most definitely not p2w and you get plenty of free things."
18383,I have been looking a long while for a game I can chill and play when I don't have to much time. Have had hearthstone for that for a long while until I found Minion Masters. Great fun and easy to learn to play! recommend 100%
18384,It's dope
18385,"Great little game to pass the time, its how Dota 2 was in beta a good game before they killed it, lets hope this doesn't go the same way."
18386,"Great game so for.

Eliminates a few things I do not like in:
Card games: i.e. who starts have an advantage and waiting for oponent to play his/her round.
Moba: Buying/constructing/equiping things during the match.

Fast paced, lot of things to strive for. I like it so far."
18387,It's cool and fun game.
18388,"great game so far, I enjoy as I was played Clash royale and I find it very similar.

Recommended :)"
18389,"Awesome game!
Just try it! you will know why!"
18390,"I initially left a very positive review for this game. It really is awesome when it works well. However, server issues really seem to be hampering the experience.

Loosing a conquest battle before it even begins due to a 'disconnected' team mate right at the start of a battle is simply very unfair and incredibly frustrating.

I've spent a lot of time and money on this game but I will not continue to support these broken mechanics. 

Sadly deleted, along with the £100 or more I've spent upgrading my cards :/"
18391,"Clash Royal style game, quick matches and satisfying gameplay.
Played a bit so far and enjoying.

Good progression system."
18392,Clash Royale on PC
18393,"Great game, lots of free cards when you start, not to pushy in getting you to buy things."
18394,驚くばかり
18395,Do you like tactical card games but hate how slow their pacing usually is? Then boy do I have a game for you
18396,"оооооочень затягивает, даже, учитывая ранний доступ"
18397,this game is gooooddd
18398,This game so Fuck*ng awesome!!
18399,"Enjoying the game so far; giving this review when it prompted me to. Quick, fun, good card/mana elements, nice easy graphics. I like my 9 mana boss chappy. Team game was also fun!"
18400,"Great game, Ilike it so much ,Irecommend you to play"
18401,"Fun and straight-forward RTS!

Devs are very chill and communicative, DLC just straight up goes free (because they're that nice)."
18402,"great game, well designed, good variation of characters and game styles..
wish it was less pay 2 win style tho. couldve been great without all the streamers benefits."
18403,(Y)
18404,Really a funny game
18405,"when not stuck in main menu, it's a great game"
18406,better that clash royale
18407,Batles are short makes it good for having a little time is adictive
18408,awesome! Puff them all :3
18409,"I played this game some time back, but it was fun to play, easy to learn and pretty balanced for free to play game. I personally would try it out its free and you won't lose anything playing it."
18410,A card game that allows me to play with my friends? I'm IN!
18411,"Fun so far... fast going, hope its not pay to win"
18412,"Nice, liking the teambattles!"
18413,"just hit level 10 - been playing for about an hour. very addictive.
great deck building and easy to level cards. you can pay for the battlepass if you wish and one could argue that its pay to win. 

again saying this im only level 10 so ill edit my review if needed later on. 

overall.... great FTP game and well worth the time."
18414,yes i would i played for a long time it forces you to stargise.
18415,"Great addictive and fun game, also a DLC is free for a limited time."
18416,Fun game also with friends and so much free content.
18417,Simple and Fun ! 1 Match can be below 3 Minutes ! But its still Time Killing game !
18418,It's fun to me. I hope it does not get ruined by heavy p2w down the line.
18419,muh fun
18420,Game is rlly cool coz u have guild and u van team up!
18421,funny and great game
18422,"After some time played reached silver rank and achieved 9 wins in arena, problem is some cards are overpowered and i keep only seeing Ravager literally stomping everyone, got pretty boring pretty fast too"
18423,Dont usually like trading card type games
18424,Pretty sweet game!
18425,"I love this game to bits! Quick match making, quick matches (1 min-8 min per), and some really intense think on your feet action. Toxicity, thankfully, is minimal. You're bound to run into the guy who critiques your match in global chat afterwards (there is a mute player option) or one that uses in game emotes just right so you know that he's more than a bit salty. You can build your deck entirely by just playing, you don't have to spend a dime. 

Also, which I feel is huge, the devs/mods are always in their discord channel and in game chat. The level of communication that they consistently maintain is seriously awesome. When the servers go down for maintenance or a hot fix, they are always in discord keeping us updated on the status. Also, their start up story is endearing.

My 2 cents: Try the game. It is highly probable that you will fall in love. If not, you've lost nothing. 

P.s. Pls give us wizard puff avatar, betadwarf. <3"
18426,Nice and easy to play :D
18427,"Time killer fast matches silly game but fun.
"
18428,"The greatest game ever created.
Period."
18429,I like it
18430,"fast paced and short games, quite fun with the combos up till now
"
18431,Pretty simple and fun
18432,"The deckbuilding is easy ( never played deckbuilder games before), the characters are great, both visually and their attributes. Spells are satisfying as hell too. Teamplay is really fun. It's a nice free coop game. Might spend some money on it too if i get more hooked. :)"
18433,"Rubbish, what good it has comes from stealing from Hearthstone and mobas, but fells really low when comes to ballance... see a lot of crappy decks with 3 card of the same type that just keep pushing without you getting a counter card. Some cards like chain lightning can clear the entire board.... or soldiers that stun through immunity... Free to play is worth playing but not a dime as quality gameplay has still a long way to go."
18434,Easy to use and playable
18435,This game is AWESOME!! >.<
18436,The game requires you to be intuitive rather than just smashing buttons. pretty fun so far.
18437,It's easy to start but hard to stop.
18438,Firstly i would like to say i am a big fan of MMORPG  and trading card game. this game is the game that i am looking for easy understanding fun and match with the people who love strategy game but busy with their career or business. PS. i want to support the developer team you guys are amazing cheers
18439,"The game is actually fun! On top of being a free to play game. The game provides a well paced action, and strategy that comes from the deck, your placement on the field, and also, a small part with which master you are using.

The first set of cards that is provided to you seems to be competitive enough, but I'm still low level and new to the game to judge further. I'll update this review when I have more experience with the game. So far so good!"
18440,SO FAR SO GOOD... easy 2 get into.. so far seems polished.. fun
18441,"Decent game, just started."
18442,its a fun diffrent take on mixing many other games but still is fun
18443,Dope
18444,"Its a fun game
"
18445,The game is so great. I like it.
18446,fun
18447,Yea bro great game
18448,"super fast paced, lots of fun even if you lose, would recommend to anyone looking for a quick fix"
18449,"Good game!
Kinda like a game from Finland.
One is on PC and the other one is on phone.
Get it better dudes!"
18450,Very fun and simply!
18451,"Simplified version of the obvious mobile original. Filled with F2P strategies and presents ingame rewards such as ""supreme chests"" as unlocking parts of the game instead of you know, actual rewards. To the developer. Unlocking game mechanics or playing the game is not a reward. In its current state, I would not recommend the game."
18452,Fun Game
18453,Good game!
18454,"Well executed concept, hope the card game remain balanced for as long as possible .... review after just an hour so first impression is that is cool card game."
18455,an addicting game
18456,is good
18457,so far soo good !
18458,-
18459,Fun little time waster. Nice art style and varied characters and cards. Worth a try.
18460,"It is a unique type of game, i love the overall usage of the pvp i recommend it to anyone that wants to have fun either competitive or relaxing."
18461,"If Hearthstone and League of Legends had a baby, this would be that game. It's fun and quick to learn and would make a nice game for the tablet and mobile platforms."
18462,"enjoyable, strategic one man moba... has toxin team? play this!

or you could just enjoy simple and fast games where you just wanna beat some scrubs up and finally get out of Wood 5...

10/10"
18463,"ayy it asked me to, games lit"
18464,"Easy to learn hard to master. Cool game, anybody can get into it, frankly didn't had high hopes but it's fun, trust me !"
18465,"Cool idea, a real time collectible card game, and its done well.  Intuitive, hard to put down, can't wait to try doubles with a friend."
18466,This game fun!
18467,"great game over-all, balanced, tactical
needs better skins tho rather than colour/color changes"
18468,"Plays like a typical smartphone base/ TD game. Enjoyable, at least for the first 2 hours"
18469,"To be true i am really enjoying this game i would so tell other people about it , it's really fun it's very well putt together."
18470,"A good take on the deck builder. Real time strategy by playing one of 4 cards in your hand. Cards have an energy requirement, energy is gained passively over time. A PVP real time Slay the Spire."
18471,"Loving it so far! Am I going to play it religiously like all of my FPT phone games? Probably not, but I'm most likely never deleting this from my steam library, lmao."
18472,Doesn't seem to have any P2W elements except for card and minion acquisition. Good variety of card options allow for the better strategist to win.
18473,Not much of a tutorial but the game play is fast and deck building strategies are there.
18474,enjoyed
18475,Great free to play game. Generous reward system with quests and challenges.
18476,Many Minions Such War Very WOOOW
18477,It's alright.
18478,"Very good game, Lot of work put into and I enjoy it"
18479,"Ever play Clash Royal? This is Clash Royal. This game belongs on the app store, not steam. This is a game that you already know if you like it or not. I for one don't, sure it's a fine game but, it's exactly what it's based off of; an app game. This game can only keep you entertained for so long until it gets boring. But hey, free DLC so there is that... I feel bad for anyone who would spend actual money on this cash grab."
18480,"This game is not bad, and dare I say, original, AFAIK."
18481,Good game for free for quick games
18482," I love how it feels like a RTS/RPG/tug a war game. Very very fun, and what makes it even better is no pay walls so far im only in the begining but I can play with my friends and gain access to a number of kool things. BIG plus is I am a streamer ( https://www.twitch.tv/shadowsambition ) So seeing my viewers in the stands cheering me on or being goofy is wonderful. These are the reasons I am liking this game atm. Im only a few hours in. Good times with friends ."
18483,"Really enjoying this game so far. I've been wanting to play a rts card-based game and this has been scratching that itch. Totally recommend it, as it is also a lot of fun with the 2v2s and playing with a friend!"
18484,"Very enjoyable game, it reminds me of yu gi oh, and a little bit of magic the gathering.
"
18485,A very nice game if you're looking to relax and/or play something that doesn't involve lots of button presses. You can play this game entirely with only a mouse. Very easy to get into and seems like there's definitely room to improve on personal skill with the deck building and when to use different cards.
18486,ok
18487,Good Beatiful Game
18488,Awesome game! excellent in game rewards system and walkthrough. Fun for all ages and skill.
18489,good
18490,Good game been playing maybe an hour so far will update in a week once i learn mechanics and leave a more detailed review
18491,"The game comes with an outstanding tutorial and while you develop your account, more and more features become available, so you can learn playing it step by step. A round lasts for about 2-5 minutes and is perfect for a little fun in between. If you want to play longer, nothing keeps you from doing so. Guilds for social and fight support are a great thing and there are lots of possibilities for configuration of your gameplay. Absolutely recommended!"
18492,"A fun, fast paced card game with RTS elements, in which opposing teams of one to two players face eachother off in a duel.
Summon minions and cast spells to gain an advantage against your opponents and destroy the enemy tower to win.

The game is F2P and there's minimal pay to win! Once you obtain a card, any upgrades to it just increase its glory value.

Glory is a resource used for Battle Passes, Guild Conquest, etc.
Ultimately this means that if you have enough copies of a card to use it and up to two wild cards in your deck (extra copies) any extras just improve your glory, not the card's power.

With this in mind, Minon Masters is a game that rewards proper play as opposed to just buying cards and upgrading them.
Highly recommended for anyone that liked Clash Royale or card games and wants to experience a competitive card game experience."
18493,"What can I say? Much better than Hearstone and other games of this type. This game is NOT pay2win and is fun to play, all depends on your skill really :)"
18494,fun so far
18495,Not giving me anger issuses...  yes?
18496,Very fun so far a good mix of MOB Anad reminds me a bit of MTGO int he good old days :)
18497,"Very good game, short queue times due to large player base, matches are actually fun. All around 10/10 game I definitely recommend it."
18498,"The developers continue to throw free content at you, with countless codes (via-email) to redeem more free content in-game. Other developers should take notes."
18499,Good shit yo
18500,f2p and addictive game .. what else do you want
18501,"It has lanes, masters and minions, but it's not a MOBA.
It has cards, stats and deckbuilding, but it's not a TCG.
It has units, micro and macro management, but it's not an RTS.

It's like Clash Royale, but actually good and very F2P friendly."
18502,"This Game is shit , new its fucking free... 5$ lose =("
18503,"buen juego, facil de jugar"
18504,"Lustig, kurzweilig, kostenlos, ... bisher keine Gegner..."
18505,Not been playing long but so far its a fun game and its nice to look at too with good animations.
18506,its like clash of clans but way more fun ive been enjoying it so far and i hope you do too
18507,seems fair
18508,"/\420/\ Love this game! Full of content, plenty of opportunity to gain a bunch of new cards for free! Got a bunch of my friends hooked! Game makes you want to keep playing until it's wayyy to late into the night haha. Guilds are now active too! Check out ours in the NA region, /\420/\ is the name and it's exactly what you need! Hope this helps you guys choose this game to play regardless!"
18509,"[h1]Micropayments[/h1]
The game turned into a grinding machine for ingame-currency. You can buy the currency for up to 99€. Everything you do is ""rewarded"" with shiny chests, tokens and roulette wheels. A few cards (minions) have been overpowered for a long time now. If you want full access to the expiring ""quests"" (gain xp and rewards (chests, tokens, cards, shiny shit)) you gotta pay real money. 
tl;dr: cheap  excitement, repetitive and boring."
18510,"Apparently after multiple years in Alpha/Beta there is still no in game chat, there are no ways to indicate to your team-mate which cards to use, why, etc. There is a major lack of CONTROL basically in this game, especially when it comes to dual queues. 

I still cannot mute people despite spammed messages throughout the discussion pages and online stating that I can... and many people are having problems with this.

There are a sleugh of things that need work, and despite my absolute love and enjoyment for this semi-card type game over ALL OTHERS I still need more attention by the developers to the AREAS which need it most/have been plagued for the longest time.

I am attempting here as I always will to be infinitely fair, but be infinitely harsh when the time comes and things have not progressed well. I have also sent multitudes of 'Feedbacks' and made many discussion chats both in and out of steam, and they unfortunately echo so many points from previous players.

I am continuing to play this game... but a lack of chat as the first major problem is MOST LIKELY going to cause my slow withdrawal from this game as I am someone who likes to enjoy both solo and team aspects to a game.

Before I finish this amendment... truly this game is fantastic, and it has potential in so many regards. Even after losing a genuine game, I am not dismayed or swayed beyond measure. The only aspect of losing, even sometimes winning that truly disgusts me is that there is no form of communication between players, and that this makes this game in some ways worse than Dota/SCII, etc. in that people can only learn from themselves or almost mindless chatting in discussion groups... which is truly horrible for a game's future.


Below is an earlier review... the Above which you have just read is an amendment.


Really quite enjoying the lax environment of the game... It's intense when you want it to be, or when interesting character/troop combinations come up.

Would like for chat to be a bit easier in this game... perhaps even in the simple form of notifying your ally which hero/troop you're going to play, which unit type to focus on in which lane, etc.

Really hoping I'll continue to enjoy the game as it progresses... yes progresses not 'evolves' since evolution is a word with a very particular meaning. The developers will progress the game, and I'm hoping with more play I'll be able to give some good or at the very least 'interesting' directional advice for the game."
18511,"Great game fair grind and like clash royal 
the versatility is amazing and the matching seems fair so far"
18512,was never into mobas but this game is amazing
18513,My friend showed me the game. we use to always play card games so this is fun
18514,"fun game, not complicated"
18515,"Jumped right into the game with no problems , virtually no learning curve and quite an entertaining game. ^^"
18516,"Fast, simple, fun game with a friendly business model and design"
18517,very nice game
18518,"One of those games where you think you have the 'perfect' deck, and then you get outsmarted.  So many ways to play this game and newbie friendly too."
18519,good game
18520,Fun Game!!!
18521,Fairly fun but could use a bit more balance. so far minion spamming has done me well will play more and report findings
18522,"It's refreshing to see this type of game without the same bullshit progression system that ruins the experience.

Similar gameplay is similar to Clash Royal / Brawl of the ages with quite a few twists.  The controls are super responsive.  The polish is really good.

And it's quite refreshing to see this type of free to play game without the same bullshit progression system that ruins the whole experience where you get stuck behind a paywall."
18523,it is a fun game that can be played casually
18524,I rely enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed the battles with other players even though I am just learning the game. I would recommend this game to others.
18525,fun fast paced enteertaining
18526,"If you like strategy games, then you will enjoy this. However, this game does use a F2P model and has implemented many changes since early access, and one of those was adding a Battle Pass system. This made the already slow progression system even slower, and consequently the game is not worth your time unless you are invested in it. This also highlights one fatal flaw with the game and that is there is no casual mode, in other words you are always playing for Glory and the community is quite toxic [b][u](seriously, this is one of the most toxic communities of all time, avoid like the plague if you can't handle it)[/u][/b] . Moderators are self-righteous and useless. More moderation needs to be put in place, however it doesn't look like this will happen anytime soon as through first hand experience, I know that the devs simply don't care, their responses to reports are basically ""if you are upset just ignore it"", I have screenshot proof of this, definitely pro-toxicity cancer..

Edit (12/04/2019): Balancing is just horrible in recent updates, as it seems the devs are desperate to reinforce their P2W model, now that the game has become F2P. What a waste for those of us who have spent hundreds (or even thousands) of hours playing

Edit (31/08/2019): Balancing is to the point where I just play the game and unlock whatever is new and then just wait until next update, was a really fun game, but I have lost all desire to play it full time. If you check on SteamCharts you will see that lots of others have the same idea, which is why the player count will only spike during new seasons. Also thanks for increasing Battle Pass price to encourage dirty F2P model...

Edit (11/09/2019): Another balance update, did the devs actually improve anything? Nope the meta is still who can stall, spam or stun the best... Given up on balance at this point...


Edit (03/04/2020): Finally the game has had some balance changes that everyone agrees with, not ready to recommend this game just yet, but we'll see what happens in future updates.

Edit (03/05/2020): Devs nerfed the only anti-spam card in the game... Game is gonna reach dying phase soon, 10/10 devs

Edit (05/01/2021): Way too grindy don't even play this anymore, I do however keep nabbing the -100% discount DLC each update.

Edit (04/11/2021): Thought I'd play again for a week after almost a year, nothing has changed, game is dying and will die, just a matter of time...

This is probably my last update to this review, I've been very extensive."
18527,Yeet
18528,Good Strategy game!
18529,"A nice quick little time waster of a game! 

Got 5 mins? You got time for a game!

It also seems rather polished for its relatively sudden appearance but this is like after what an hour of playing, I'll see how long my interest holds."
18530,"the game asked me to leave a review,that is the only reason i am typing right now. it even opened me the review window, how nice of it.i have less than 1 hour in the game right now, so i dont even know it the game is good, it seem fine till now"
18531,Fun f2p game with really good balance
18532,Sicky game m8
18533,awesome game!
18534,"The queues are short, the games are fun.  What else is there to say?"
18535,"Fast paced, fun game! Playing right off the bat kinda throws one right into the game! Fun! :-)
"
18536,"It's great! Quick easy to learn, still needs more cards/creature but awesome game for quick fun."
18537,Fast paced and always moving. I am enjoying so far and really like how the twitch streaming is integrated into the game.
18538,This is a pretty fun game that has some good strategy and deck building mechanics. There seem to be a ton of new creatures and spells and learning the different aspects of each is really neat.
18539,I was recommended this game by a friend. They were right! This game is great. I will be grinding the ladder and streaming this very soon. Check it out for yourself!
18540,"After 2.5 hours on this game I can absolutely say this is the most magnificent, mind blowing experience I have ever had in a gaming arena. I can only compare this to a lucid LSD trip which I took in peru with my shaman. I will recommend this game to anyone who has joy in life, as it will truly lead you on the path to the one true god."
18541,fun with friends.  Not sure how i would feel with out friends but entertaining none the less.
18542,Dope.
18543,nice game for f2p
18544,The game is really fun
18545,Great game and nice to play it free! thanks a lot!
18546,"People are saying this game is pay to win, It's slightly grindy due to the number of cards there is, but you can't pay for cards, or shards for that manner. (Which is used to unlock cards, or even masters.)

It's a free to play game, so naturally there's going to be some micros.

It hella could be a lot worse, let me tell you that. You can ONLY get what's in the shop, or you can buy masters with in-game currency that you can earn from opening power tokens. (Which can be obtained in the shop for 1,000 coins each, or multiple for some other amount. You can earn coins by completing daily quests, just playing the game.

They give out FREE DLC ($15 worth), Every time a new season comes out. so even if you do spend money on the game, you'll be getting some of it back.

Now for the gameplay,

Addicting, fun, smooth, occasionally funny, intense, you'll be on the edge of your seat in close matches! Several and several of cards to choose from, (My favorite is probably Xiao long, smol dragon is very adorable.)

I highly recommend this game, the devs care about us and the game very much. Can't wait to see what comes out in future! <3

PS. Let me say that the DLC may seem a steep price to begin with, but keep in mind pretty much ALL of the DLC was free at one point. Following the game with give you more free stuff! I don't recommend missing it. :}"
18547,GREAT SO FAR
18548,"[h1]Minion Masters: [/h1]

Minion Masters is a game like ""Clash Royale"" fast-paced game, where you have cards on your Deck and you have to destroy the enemy's tower.
There are 4 ""types"" of cards:
1* - Minions: Ground allies that deal damage to other enemy minions or focus on buildings only.
2* - Flying Minions: They fly, and they deal damage to ground and flying enemy minions; some ground minions don't deal damage to flying minions, but some do.
3* - Spells: Cards that deal damage to enemy minions, or heal your allies, if you use them right, you could win, if you use them wrong, you could lose, they are pretty good to defend and to make a strong push.
4* - Buildings: They don't move, they say on the field for a certain amount of time, they deal damage to enemy minions, they are pretty good to defend your Master.
(remember, every card costs mana, here and there are some cards that costs 0 mana).
-
The most important thing that you have to do is protect your Master, if your Master dies, you lose. The Master has 3000 HP (health points) and they attack enemy minions. You can unlock different Masters with game currency.
-
Different Masters have different skills, which are unlocked in a match with XP, that you get by controlling bridges (if the bridge has a blue light, you are controlling it).
The ""Skill Tree"" is:
Master Skill 1, Master Skill 2, Master Skill 3 and MANA FRENZY, which is the best in my opinion, every XP you get is turned into Mana, to summon the cards that i talked about earlier, and oh boi, it gets fast...
-
Deck:
Deck is a group of 10 cards selected by your own hands to use in the battle field, i can't say too much about it because everyone has their own play style.
(I like to play with a balanced deck.)
-
Minion Masters is a very addicting game and i really recommend it.
10/10.

[u][i] insolent passer-by [/i][/u]"
18549,well game is nice and exciting i enjoyed it how ever i think there is some balance to be made project is promissing but its easy to mess it up since noone will like unfair battles also there is some complains about card infos for example there is not written that healing card works only in my side of field i tought since its not attacking i can use it anywhere in field about microtransactions no there is no pay to winn anything so far can be claimed in game without spending money but yea there will come some say its hard grind well dont like game dont play it :) i personaly liked it it would be cool if they could let us set minions to be deffensive or offensive i think this game needs this aspect but in overall its prety nice at start well propobly wont like if loose like 10 times in a row :) but thats how its :) it haves my recomendations so faar
18550,veddy good veddy fawn i mek good tyme on dees

18559,The Interaction with viewers is awesome :) Great Game !
18560,"Better Than "" CLASH ROYALE ""

Need more optimization for matchmaking system !

Fun And Respected For A Free to play game !

"
18561,Nice game and pretty addictive ! I started today and now i'm level 10 and can't stop to play ..help pls !
18562,Seems like a fun game
18563,"Excellent game.

Mechanically similiar to Clash Royale, but it's extremely F2P friendly and it's not a P2W game at all.  The gameplay of live action card battles is extremely fun.

Even better, at high skill levels, no legendaries are necessary in any decks, as the majority of them are very situational and not say, the ""backbone"" of decks like in hearthstone where you need to spend to compete on an even playing field.

This is also the most fun 2v2 format you will ever find in a card game.

I only started playing the game about a month ago, but the game has had constant updates throughout it's launch.

1 - There are a handful of ways that Minion Masters is FAR, FAR more F2P friendly than Clash Royale, which is a P2W game.

1.1 - First of all, the ""leveling system"" in Minion Masters doesn't give your cards any power at all.  When you obtain a duplicate copy of a card you already own, the level of the card only increases the ""Glory"" that you earn.

""Glory"" simply gives you more points for the ""Battle Pass,"" which has absolutely nothing to deal with power.  If you're unfamiliar with ""Battle passes,""  basically, you earn rewards faster when you play the game.  Unlike some games, the Battle Pass is available to everyone for free.  If you choose to pay some in-game currency, (which isn't unreasonable to earn free), you get the rewards faster plus some additional rewards.

1.2 In Clash Royale, you need multple copies of a card to level it, and as soon as you level the card, it becomes stronger.   In Minion Masters,  XXX card is always going to have 15 hp and 5 damage, regardless of the level, where in Clash Royale, the experienced player who has spent a lot or played a lot to earn cards is going to have 16 hp and deal 6 damage, ect.

In Minion Masters, all the cards are exactly the same, regardless of whether you've spent a ton of $$$ or not, or are a brand new player or experienced.

*It's skill based in how well you play, how well you understand the different units, how well you cast your spells, and how and when you positionally deploy your units.*

1.3 The other way in that Minion Masters is very F2P friendly is that the developers are extremely generous with giving away in-game rewards.  For example, there is currently a free ""DLC"" that gives a legendary card, a handful of tokens, various in-game currencies, and other stuff like an emote or a skin.  This DLC is listed as $14.99 (USD), but for a temporary time, it's 100% FREE for any and everyone.

I've only played for less than 3 months , and I've seen a great amount of ""free"" stuff like this.

I also wanted to add that every day, there are free rewards just for logging in (it's either gold or rubies, two types of in-game currency).   The shop has various different items on sale daily, including sometimes having 100% free additional rewards, like sometimes emotes/skins/additional currency/100% free cards.

Premium currency is extremely generous and easy to earn also, it's tedious/difficult to explain, but you'd simply have to take my word for that.   


1.5  Finally, I would argue that Minion Masters is much more f2P friendly than many other games because in this game, Legendary (and Epic aka Supreme) cards are often situational and not overpowered.  There are many common and rare cards that are extremely strong and prevalent in the META.

If you're familiar with Hearthstone, Legendary cards form the ""Backbone"" of decks in that game.  Having Legendaries enables the synergies that decks are based around and built around.

In Minion Masters, this is absolutely not true at all.  Legendaries are very situational, and if one were to build a deck filled with legendary/supreme cards, it would be unbalanced and very bad.

You can both climb the ladder and be on the top of the leaderboards without spending.

Just like any other card game or even MOBA with different characters, one can argue that games like this are ""pay to compete,"" or say, pay (or for most people, simply play and earn) to be on an even playing field.  But it isn't P2W like Clash Royale where you literally get stronger, upgraded cards.




2 - The game is monetized in a few different ways.

First, there are two packs you can purchase straight up.  Both give you small bonuses of One gives you lifetime access to all the Masters (hero types), and the other one increases in-game currency you own.  You can read about them here - https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/489520/

If you've already purchased Masters, and you purchase the upgrade with real money, they will refund you any in-game currency spent.  That's incredible and very consumer friendly for a developer to do so.

The second is you can purchase in-game ""premium"" currency directly for cash.  I've mentioned that it's very easy to earn, but you can purchase it.

You can use these to buy anything, whether they're cosmetics or cards.

3 - That guy's complaint about the in-game premium currency isn't specifically limited to minion masters.  It's a legitimate complaint, but it's essentially in industry standard in gaming, whether mobile, console, or PC.

League of Legends, Microsoft Points, Apex Legends, and pretty much every single company that sells premium currency is like that.

As for the ""slot"" machine mechanic, his complaint is that when you open a ""Token"" (basically a random card pack in this game), there's a graphic that looks like a an arrow that spins around a wheel.  The animation slows down, and sometimes teases like you it was really close to opening a legendary.

This is also a common practice in gaming these days, where games are designed to hook people.  While I do think that it can be deceiving, I also think that you're an idiot if you actually sit through this stupid, casino like animation and think it makes a different.  You can just click twice and instantly open your card pack, and it's not like it makes a difference.

To me, these are unfair complaints about Minion Masters when they should be directed at the gaming industry as a whole, and I was more than happy to support this small indie dev team.

 I also purchased a pack for a steam friend as a gift and  bought in-game currency because I really wanted to give my money to them."

18610,"ez, fun, enjoyable, great time killer!"
18611,"Started playing because of a friend, enjoying zerg rush tactics. FOR THE SWAAAARM"
18612,"I've played all the way up to Diamond and it's not a bad game at all but I just can't see myself trying to get my friends or anybody for that matter to get this game. It's a long and very grind fest game if you don't spend real money and it's not so fun after an couple of hours. The game was very refreshing but it takes far too long to collect rubies and shards that's it fucking horrible and the coin isn't that bad in grinding terms but it's not good either. You basically spend days with the same cards because of how long it takes just to get new ones and this is very subjective depending on how much you can play a day and how you play a game. I've seen people play games for a month and get nothing done like at all. All in all once you get all the free cards and spend a few rubies and shards on some cheap ones the rest will take ages to grind and I don't want my shit handed to me on a silver platter but the game is very pay to win and just too much of a grind for a card game. I don't mind a good grind in a mmorpg when you have thousands of things to do but there is only so many decks you really enjoy that it wont last long and you want to blow your fucking head off by then. Game is solid, its fun, its unique, its refreshing but it's just pay to win out the ass unless you wanna spend months with the same deck."
18613,"This is pay to win in its purest form In the upper ranks. I grinded up to diamond 1 with my buddy then we hit a brick fucking wall of Grand master Whales getting free wins for their silver buddies. I would see 4 or 5 legendaries on every grand master and for the most part it was almost identical decks ( shaman werewolf, Xiu long the stupid fucking dragon, invisible scrat sniper)  The grind is just fucking aweful I played for over 20 hours and barely had enough currency to get one master.

If they dont cap the amount of legendaries you can put in your deck or something to that effect there is no hope for this game. I have to uninstal because I got tired of getting slapped in the face by neck beard wallets.

Edit: Now at the diamond wall I see most a lot of people using a mana hack, accelerating how fast their mana is regenerating. Constantly I see duo's casting 20+ mana cards in a 2v2 in the span of 2 or 3 seconds, all the while spamming emotes. They know they are cheating and getting away with it.

I have played enough to see the back and forth tug of war over the bridges when I am against another team that has the same mana regen as I do. Many times I would spend 5 mana on my succubus to have it kill 10 or even 15 mana worth of cards but they just keep spamming cards. Even when I gain a mana advantage they still have mana to summon more creatures AND cast fireballs and chainlightnings, many times they just cast the spells and hit nothing just to troll. It is painfully obvious when the enemy is cheating but beta dwarf does nothing. 

The gameplay is exceptional and for some odd reason there isn't many quality 2v2 card based games on the market right now. 2v2 is the sole reason why me and my buddy keep playing. If MTG arena brought back 2 headed giant I would drop this game and never look back. As it stands right now we complete dailies and then move onto another game. Even then when we reach that diamond perma mana frenzy wall its hard to complete them. Many times we have to turn to the other 2 modes to knock out the quests."
18614,awsome game
18615,"nice game..... nice graphic.... 

1up : love the announcer but it should have more dialog, the animation for every minion and the heroes was smooth.... 
2up : the team battle make the gameplay much more versatile and tactical.... of course u need chemistry between both player..to make it much more enjoyable
3up : good matchmaking.... most of the time it match me with the same level of experience.... 
0.5up : good selection of the minion give and xp gain for heroes by conquering the bridge might be the only original idea....

1.5down : way to similar to few games out there..... it's like combining heartstone & clash royale.....but it's still have that original feel for this games....

3.5up/5up
personally enjoyed this game and would recommend it to other players that love this type genre..... yes i will feel so familiar but still has it's own originality..."
18616,<3
18617,"Fun and entertaining even if you only have a ouple of minutes to play :)

still in early access...so a few bugs remain and sometimes the server loses connection"
18618,No balance at all... Broken crap FTW
18619,Pretty good first impressions! Hopefully they implement a fast way to get to the battle pass :P
18620,A fun strategy game with out the boredom.
18621,"Very fun, well balanced and quick to pick up!"
18622,This game is fun and very interactive
18623,Pretty fun and nuanced.
18624,Great Free to play game with no feeling of pay to win :)
18625,"This is totally Clash Royale for PC flipped horizontally. If you're addicted to Clash Royale on Android, this game will easily satisfy you. I haven't spent a penny as of yet and don't believe I need to. It's all about finding your style of play. You can't go wrong with the price either  :P"
18626,3
18627,seems fun.
18628,its so fun
18629,Clash Royale done right

18645,is good
18646,Like it! its fun and fast paced
18647,quite Fun
18648,"Minion Masters is a pretty good versus game. It gets updates frequently and every time I boot it up I tend to see people chatting so it seems to also have players too.

It's not my kind of game, but I can see that it's got quality.

I just boot it up every now and then to do the daily Resource Token just for giggles."
18649,Lmao fun
18650,"This game is good even though I haven't played anything. Trust me, I just wanted the cards, but I know what I'm talking about."
18651,Thumbs down
18652,"If you like Clash Royale then you will love this game. 
"
18653,just getting started but a great concept so far! i enjoy the 2v2 mode personally
18654,"Simple, low-commitment game that is great for relaxing and unwinding. Also can get competitive and keep you thinking about theorycrafting and strategy outside the game."
18655,"MTG meets ""tower defense"" complete with seasons that act as time-boxed expansions to the base set.  If you enjoy other deck-building games like Dominion, Ascension, Legendary, etc, it plays in a similar way as well.

Build the deck outside of the rounds and then use those cards to summon minions or towers and cast spells of varying mana levels to take out your opponent(s).  1v1 and 2v2 for PvP and a couple interesting takes on a story/adventure mode and a ""sealed box"" experience as well.

This game has been a blast so far!  The longest rounds have yet to break 10 mins, so it doesn't feel like you're trapped forever when something goes really well (or badly).  The deck variety has been encouraging as well!

It's worth noting I haven't spent any real $$$ to purchase any of the MTX and haven't felt like my decks have lacked or suffered."
18656,"Only a few games in but Really Enjoying game game thus far. Shall update later....
"
18657,"You all know what? Minion Masters is an action-packed brawler, full of unique challenges and entertaining game play — My words. The game's soundtrack and visuals are fun and colorful (some times even epileptic colorful, but only some times) alongside nearly balanced combat mechanics (too luck-based, but of course like a certain serpent once said: “LUCK ISS A SSSKILL!”). I can say one thing for sure, Minion Masters is a fun brawler that will shape up to be even more engaging in time as the developers continue to expand and grow the online world. And No it is Not like “Clash Royale” but on your computer (STFU!)."
18658,"Player friendly, interactive and quite capturing in gameplay. Graphics are a tad cartoonish but it fits with the game design, can't wait to see where it goes. 

Fully recommend"
18659,Great graphics! Fun play! Always different! Great game!
18660,"Lots of Fun!! They took Hearthstone to the next level by making the cards turn into live action characters. oh, and its Free. =)"
18661,Hell yeah brotha! yeeee haaaaw!
18662,Great fun & even good for twitch streamers!
18663,"Its pretty fun so far, we will see where higher levels get us"
18664,this game is awesome!!! we needed a real free to play card moba! and this one delivers.
18665,"After marking 200+ hours in the game, I decided to share my opinion: the game is definitely worth that at least try it, and not just watch the video and move on.
Obvious advantages:
1) Short sessions;
2) Fast matchmaking;
3) Quite a good balance of cards (an obvious disbalance after patches fix quickly, but patchnote sometimes comes much later than the hot-fix itself)
4) Multiple game modes (Solo, Duo, Draft, Mayhem)
5) Frequent championships
6) The developers are very democratic (I would say even generous) in matters of monetization. For all the time of I play game I paid about $ 10, while now I have 8 of 10 heroes, skins for each of them, from ~ 160 cards to the full collection there are not enough 12, which are not critical for me right now
7) Addictive gameplay. For the successful game are important ""economy"", microcontrol, tactics, overall strategy
8) The game is constantly evolving.

What I would like to see in the game else:
1) New playing fields (not skins, namely the map)
2) More game modes"
18666,amazing
18667,otimo game
18668,"This Game is my new Muse.  I've never been a big player of card games but Minion Masters is so much more.  Its got moba like aspect, Tower Defense and Card Game.   I'm always building new strategies and decks.  I look forward to where this game will go!"
18669,"so far so good im afraid of pay to win dont be a copy cat....... i like what you have here so far,keep it up
"
18670,I like this game. Its pretty good. I've played alot of games in my day and this one is pretty good.
18671,Fun game with some decent strategy. Bring a friend for co-op!
18672,"I get bored in write review, but give It a chance to MM at least 5 hours of your useless life"
18673,"Really fun game. Easy to play, hard to master. Not P2W at all, very new player friendly with easy access to cards. It's free and the devs to a great job with updates and new cards."
18674,pew pew pew pew pew
18675,It is a fun game to play. You can use various strategies.
18676,"blood imps into colossus

> instakilled


10/10"
18677,"It's still the most generous F2P I've ever played, but far less than it used to be.
Still great arena strategy game with quick matches.
Still no redundant cards in the deck building system, even with all the regular updates.
But sadly they have decided to remove 3/4ths of the game in the upcoming ""remaster"" including content that was payed for."
18678,It's pretty cool. love the art style.
18679,nice game
18680,fun and neat and gay af i enjoy it
18681,nice game
18682,simple and fun.
18683,Great pick up and put down game.
18684,nice game jaja lol
18685,"Fun Strategic Deck Building RTS... like Yugioh, but with the weeaboo nonsense."
18686,"I have to say that I love this game.

I don't agree with the idead that this is a P2W game.... I have climbed into Grand Master crafting all my cards just playing the game with intelligence. First season I joined, I climbed in two weeks into master only with 65% of the card pool.
With this in mind, the only thing you need for grinding in this game, is creativity, nice ideas, and skill. 

Users that think this game is P2W game, don't have the necessary knowledge and/or skill needed to climb ranks successfully. 

I have played towers games/MOBA/decbuilder games before, I have been playing Clash Royale like 2 years... this is really a P2W game because level cards grant you better stats of your units. However in this game, level cards only grant you more EXP to advance faster in the Battle Pass, which only gives you more gold/cards. That's why I loved this game, because you just need skill and have fun to climb in the rank system.  Also it gives you a lot of different tools to create funny strategies. 

Not only is Rock/Paper/Scissors style, positioning is a key factor to victory, also understanding how the bridges works and when to make pressure to go ahead with the level experience for your master.

So, if you decide to buy rubies in this game, you only are going to have more exp/gold, and/or simple cosmetics.

After all this time playing I have decided to buy both DLC in order to thanks developers such funny and creative game.

CONS:

- I hope they can add more people to the team in the future, so they can add 12 or 24 cards every expansion instead of 6.

- Also a better UI that shows ranking of users and statistics. Thinking now in Starcraft 2 multiplayer system, you could enter in any userprofile, watch his progression in rank, favourite race, ration victories, etc. I hope they add more feature like this in the future. 

-They should add 3v3, would be hilarious."
18687,this is a good entertainer... fun to watch... simple but challenging
18688,"100 hours in and I have to say this is a top notch game. I've never payed money that went towards anything except a couple skins I liked for my favorite master. I've reached diamond league [edit: Master league] in a variety of game modes. I am really happy at how the most common and free cards are very useful, and how every strategy has some sort of counter strategy that defeats it. The team responsible for this game appear to be doing a great job.

+ Quick matchmaking in all modes.
+ Great real-time competitive feel without high stress.
+ All in-game currency types can be earned for free.
+ Achievements unlock rewards.
+ Large variety of play styles are viable.
+ New cards are not overpowered.
+ Deckbuilding and learning to play is very easy.
+ Replays automatically saved and viewable with good controls.
+ Easy and fun to spectate friends' games
+ Good art and overall style

- One of the achievements I earned didn't trigger the reward properly, but not a big deal.
- On two occasions the decks I put together got lost and I had to remember what cards I put together. Again, not a big deal. Decks are only 10 cards.

Everything in this game has a way to counter it, but you can't counter everything at once. There is a lot of skill to timing, placement, and mana management. My advice is to add a way to counter a couple of the most common minions that trouble you, and don't worry about the more oddball strategies because you'll still move up overall."
18689,"fun game
easy time waster that hasnt got boring yet"
18690,"Very interactive GAmeplay. I enjoy lots
"
18691,Very easy game to pick up and play
18692,"Lot of fun, easy to pick up. Me and the old lady enjoying it so far :)"
18693,cool
18694,Very fun
18695,Very good!
18696,"Amazing gameplay, nonsensical characters to add good humor, also the sheer possibilities in deck building is absolutely promising.   10/10 would recommend for any rts/ccg player."
18697,I've been looking for a game like this for a while. If you ever played Magic The Gathering Arena for the original Xbox then this game is just like it
18698,"Posted because they told me to. Fun game, but I haven't lost. Not sure if I am facing EZ mode bots or if I'm a god at this game. Grain of salt, folks. Grain of salt."
18699,"Fun game very similar to the mobile Clash Royale, I like that the cards can be leveled but aren't locked behind a rank wall.  Also leveling/buying the cards in this game can be done with an earned game currency so it feels much more competitive, you aren't going to be waiting for chests to slowly unlock or any of that garbage either..  There are still some pay to win elements though I feel like it is better handled in this game and being a free player is not a burden.  It also seems like the Developers have a good grasp of doing fun events in game.

Ironically because of the less pressure to pay for things in this game I supported it a little more than the average free to play game.  Keep it up devs, liking it."
18700,Great so far.
18701,It's awesome and fun!
18702,its really fun and is easy to learn
18703,Great game.
18704,"cute, easy to learn and free. theres actually a surprising amount to plan when playing I like it"
18705,"Excellent game, quick progression and I love controlling minions. Seems fun- strategy rewards the player."
18706,"I love this game!It's a online,RTS with other players to play attacks and stratagy.
"
18707,"Overall Recommendation: TAKE A PASS, for now

*Cant recommend the game, but  supposedly still in testing ( it appears its been there for quite some time). The imbalance in cards and cheese factor with exploiting these is bad. Hopefully its addressed.

GOOD:
-Initially enjoyed the game, for a ""free to play"" model.
-Largish community, not a long wait time to get going.
-Some diversity in play types.
-Developers seem somewhat invested in the game.
-System requirements to be playable not ridiculous.

BAD:
-Far from balanced. Overpowered (and worthless) cards/masters. Exploits rampant the higher you go.
-It's ""free"" but really pay to play.  Spend more and you get to run with the exploit big dogs. The days of paying a respectable cost, once, for a full, good, game are over.
-Game mechanics flaws. Disconnected from game or ally quits, immediate loss. Rewards unethical behavior. Opponents force you out of a game they are losing, somehow. Allies quit when the win isn't fast enough.
-Overpriced, low value, in game ""currency"".
-Card purchases (via tokens) random, same junk repeats constantly. (Draft a minor bypass here).
-In game reference material virtually non-existent. There are still some things I have no clue about.

FINAL THOUGHTS: After investing a respectable amount of time with the game, it's quick to load up and jump into a match, but I play less often for shorter amounts of time. Ultimately, I hate this type of business model, where it is never truly finished, with endless updates, and they intentionally force you behind unless you keep pumping in money."
18708,I like dis game. Much better than League.
18709,very cool game
18710,"The game is fun and easy to pick up, some skills require timing and correct deck building. Great game to relax with!"
18711,"TLDR: P2W ... Rather than being standard pay-to-win games, where $10-50 or more would be a big advantage, this game requires you spend $100s to win - so there are less of them out there, but you literally cannot win in the top-tiers where they all compete. It's also very buggy, poorly optimised and has a bad MM-ing system. Avoid."
18712,"This game is so much fun, I would totally recommend trying this game out if your into card games, this is basically clash royal on PC and I LOVE IT!!!!!!"
18713,The game is really fun for being in beta. I like the fact that you don't have to spend money to play but it does help. The store refreshes every day so it's easy to get the things you need to keep up with the peps that spend monies. With that being said: I found the ranking system is unbalanced. It's easy to climb but you can tell when someone has spent money. It's a solid 7 out of 10. Time will tell if the dev team will break it or make it.
18714,Easy to learn but I can tell there's a lot of potential at mastering it.  Pretty fun.
18715,"Fun game, i play with my friends and we own."
18716,its very addictive
18717,Relax and Fun
18718,Good game. Just 4 fun.
18719,"If you've ever played Clash Royale:
This is the same concept but with more depth, WAY less P2W and fun 2vs2-battles.

While you don't start with all cards right away the grind to get the ones you want is fast and painless. The rewards for simply playing are very generous and many of the starter and low-cost cards are top tier. ""Upgrading"" cards is still a thing, but it doesn't make the cards any stronger, it only helps to progress in the Battle Pass (and gives you up to 3 copies of a specific card per deck).

If you liked the concept of Clash Royale and similiar games but were put off by its P2W aspects or its lack of depth then this might be the game for you.

EDIT: After the ""Quest for Mountainshaper""-Update I can say this:
The rubies (premium currency) you get in the Battle Pass have been greatly reduced so it's more difficult to go from one Battle Pass to the next as an F2P like you could before. The game is still pretty good and definitely more ""yay"" than ""nay"" but I wanted to mention this anyway."
18720,"This game is easy to pick up, matches are fast, the art is really pleasing to look at. The best feature is that it is free."
18721,Fun game!
18722,Highly addictive and fun game that is guaranteed to draw you in.
18723,very nice game. i play with my best dota friend through 15 years and this takes us back to the times of line tower war etc in wc3. I love this. thANK YOU.
18724,its fun
18725,Reminds me of Battle Forge
18726,Neat so far
18727,Fun enjoyable game
18728,"Love it, great gameplay. so far I've gone in solo and done random matching. I find most people are friendly, there's no real in game chat - this is probably a good thing gets people to pay more attention to what's happening and work as a team. Server connectivity is mostly good (this could be improved).

I like that what you pay for are mostly cosmetics (and masters of course, which are balanced). sure you have to find your cards and build your decks, still, this is more skill than pay. I would support it!"
18729,Yeah it's a mobile game for PC but atleast it's fun... SO far
18730,"Fun gameplay that allows you to work against and with people.  Interested to see how it plays later, but for now it is a good time killer."
18731,Was searching for something like Clash Royale. I just started but I am really liking it right now.
18732,Very fun game!
18733,"This game is just fun , not pay2win , everything is good."
18734,Game's relaxing simple and nice :)
18735,"best td game
"
18736,Very fun!!! Highly recommend
18737,"this game is turning out too be more a pay too win.
 Now its no fun, people in team play just leav cuz there is no penalty for leaving ore beaing a ***hole and evrytime there is a update i lose more and more of my card so im out for the time being"
18738,good game
18739,"Fun animations, great card and minion design, easy to pick up gameplay but room to master it in depth, and does not feel pay to win so far. Keep going :)"
18740,"[i]Minion Masters[/i] is full of dumb cunt teammates having a wank over their waifu while sending out one minion per minute and, when they finally do make a choice, they play the best minions to let the other team win. I made it to team Masters division in my first month of play, I've seen a lot of stupid decisions and a lot of amazing synergy during random matches. Unless you have a prepared team and you're easily tilted then stick to single player. [i]Minion Masters[/i] is a fun game for short periods. The free-to-play aspect is quite reasonable and, if you're patient, you can unlock a whole lot of paid content for free. Learn your counters."
18741,"A mix of Clash Royale with Cards straight out of Hearthstone. If you enjoy fun, you should get this game. :)
Shoutouts to Beta Dwarf for making such a cool Game.

Pros:
-100+ Unique Cards to chose from (142 right now)
-Intuitive and balanced Gameplay
-Unique Mechanics for this Game Genre
-10 Masters to choose from each with their own set of skills (and skins :3 )
-Many creative ways to play the game
-A Very good HUD and GUI
-A Better Interface than Clash Royale in 2v2 fights
-Very good Streaming Support (Twitch) as well as a great Discord and Steam Community
-Cute Dragons

Cons:
-Sadly not as many players as Clash Royale
-It takes a while to get the cards you want without the Premium upgrade (But heck it's just 20 bucks, which you would easily spend on Clash Royale. In Contrast to that you can see it as an optional price you can pay for the game which is still less than you'd spend on a polished game like this)
-still in early access (Looking forward to the full game :) )

Overall it's a great game everyone should have in their Steam / Disord library."
18742,Pretty GOod
18743,"Great game, and free. Worth checking out"
18744,"Fun game, super addictive. Seems like a lot of micro transactions, but ive been getting by just fine F2P. Haven't played long, will update if I hit a pay wall.
"
18745,Pretty damn fun and entertaining
18746,"Fun, quick, and easy.  Similar to Clash Royale."
18747,Reminds me of Clash Royale and loved that mobile game
18748,"Very fast paced and quite a lot more fun than hearthstone, the added feature of minions almost makes it part-RTS as opposed to just being a normal card game."
18749,"Nice nice niceeeeeee
Haven't found interesting game to play in like 2 years . Finnaly something nice
Im not actual Developer its just a name"
18750,Nice little tactical PVP game
18751,is gud
18752,"Great

18753,"very aproachable as a new player, fun lets see where this goes"
18754,It's simple and easy to use
18755,Friend recomended. fun
18756,Regular and unispired Clash Royale clone (from Android). 5/10.
18757,2v2 is fun
18758,FUN AND GOOD GAME
18759,"This game is actually pretty addicting, got invited by a friend and ive been enjoying it."
18760,very nice
18761,"This is a shameless rip off of Clash Royale which came out a year before this. The gameplay is smooth, and it feels high quality, but it doesn't take much to see through the facade and realse that you win at this game by spending real money on microtransactions, 'chances' at better cards and having rarer/higher level cards than your opponents. It's a shame, considering the heart-wrenching BetaDwarf story (http://forcedthegame.com/story/), but I guess money is more attractive than originality."
18762,It's quite fun actually.
18763,Pretty fun
18764,"This is a very fun multiplayer game that mixes tower defense, collectible card games and strategy all in one. Collect cards, build a deck, and then your goal is to destroy the base on the other side of the map by dropping units onto the map from the cards dealt to you in your hand. It is a simple game to learn, but hard to master. Lots of free rewards are given out by the devs all the time that score you plenty of in game loot. The game keeps getting new content from beta til now a few years after it first appeared on steam. You can battle it out 1v1 or 2v2, so playing with friends can be a blast. The game is well polished at this point, performs well, there  is no reason to not try this game, it is free, go for it!!"

18766,good
18767,"It's a fun game, but is pretty static. It's not a game I'd spend hours at a time playing, but a few games here and there makes for a good time. It is easy to pick up, very straight forward, and has a fair amount of humor in it."
18768,Fun game especially for free
18769,"Best Game Ever
"
18770,"Great game, free to play and very enjoyable"
18771,"Cool game, glad it's free"
18772,Pretty sick game.

18774,Good game i have fun with my friend
18775,good game
18776,7 year olds playing clash royale but for pc
18777,Very fun game with fast que times and explosive gameplay that will keep you on your toes. AMAZING GAME!
18778,"Really has hooked me on the interesting concepts. I like how you have to control bridges, it really has made the game more of an area control which is alot of fun."
18779,FUN AND LOOK GREAT
18780,"Starcraft light!, Its awesome!"
18781,"game is pretty good, easy to play and understand."
18782,"Fun and interesting game that combines the best features of card, moba, and fast battle pvp."
18783,"I love games like this and this is so well made for a PC game, captures your attention is funny and really explains everything you need to know step by step for beginers!"
18784,Very enjoyable game it is really nice.Thank you for the experience!
18785,great
18786,I love this game its really great and u can play with friends
18787,Clash Royale
18788,"fun fast pace-game , so far i cant get enough of it"
18789,"good game, like clash royale."
18790,nice graphics and funny gameplay
18791,"I purchased this some time ago as a 2 for 1 deal.  Turns out to be a fairly solid game.  The card selection could use some diversity, and I'm not crazy about their gem/shard structure for acquiring other items in game, but the gameplay is solid and a good time with friends.  Take your time, strategize your deck composition, and enjoy.  It's certainly worth a look -"
18792,Game is fun. Game is free.
18793,"free to play = 1 card per day if you play over 10 matches
for legendary cards free hahahahahaha"
18794,Super fun!
18795,Nice and very adictive game!
18796,love this game...... better that clash royal ;-)
18797,:D
18798,"Free game with good content, worth to pay for some extra stuff."
18799,Good game.
18800,Great game. easy to learn.  Havging lots of fun playing it so far.
18801,Seems like an addictive game!
18802,"It's literally a mobile game. Clash Royale. Daily Missions, pay to win, etc."
18803,Pretty damn fun for a free game.
18804,"It's Ok, for a co-op card-game tower defense hybrid."
18805,BIG FUN I LIKE TINY MONSTERS.
18806,Just and absolute blast!
18807,"So far, so good. Enjoyable card based gameplay with fast games."
18808,"Game is great but the developer ""Betadwarf"" sucks. They somehow manage to make the game worse with every single patch they release."
18809,"Great game, easy mechanics and a lot of fun!"
18810,Fun little game
18811,Era o que estava procurando para passar o tempo...
18812,"I have to say I wasn't expecting much when my friend told me to play this game but it's really excellent. It's F2P, what are you, saving your gigs? Download it and play it already!"
18813,Combines elements from different styles of games I enjoy into one.  So far you don't have to spend money to compete.
18814,"good gam,e

"
18815,Nice casual game
18816,Fun quick matches
18817,gg
18818,Fun game i like the game mechanics but morellia still needs to be nerfed. i would wait untill she's acrually nerfed properly or untill new champions can rival her
18819,gg... i love broken game lol
18820,Quick paced and fun. It's a break from the everyday BR's and MOBA's .
18821,nice game
18822,Fun Game
18823,"Amazing game. Easy to learn hard to master/combo/counter play. it is free to play. Unlike most games where you need to spend money to unlock certain items or masters in this case because of ""X"" type of currency(rubies} to only get items with that currency(pay wall). Gold nets you power tokens which get you shards and that can unlock any card and any master. Its very fun and super addicting."
18824,FUn fun
18825,"Please keep in mind I'm an absolutely f2p player.

This game is great.  It surprisingly deep strategically.  The source of depth comes from the following design decisions

1) Ground vs flying minions & ranged vs melee minions.  Ground melee minions can only attack other ground minions.  All other minion types can attack any other minion type.  Generally, ground minions are beefier than flying ones, and melee minions are beefier than ranged ones.  Combined with the range and movement speed stat this creates for a variety of options to attack and counter attack.

2) Different Masters.  There are now 10 different masters that each have unique play styles.  The unique abilities are their attack, buffs given to minions, and unique cards that are added to their deck.  The diversity is very good.

3) Board and bridge control.  There are two bridges which give experience to the master when controlled.  This unlocks extra perks.  It's important to control the bridges, but it's also important to realize when you can't control a bridge and temporarily give it up.  As such the board placement of minions is very important to achieve this, both in timing and position.

F2p players can make it quite far.  My deck consists of 5 starter cards, 1 common, 2 supremes, and 2 legendaries.  You get a couple of free legendaries, and supreme cards drop at a decent rate, or can be crafted without too much hassle.  The starter cards are really stong, and legendary spam won't take you too far in this game, which is huge.

Seasons are a month long.  I usually only play just enough to finish the dailies, the first season that I played, there only two weeks left, but I still managed to make it to diamond in teams(2v2) and platinum in solo(1v1).  The second season, which wasn't finished yet when I wrote this review, I made it to masters in teams and diamond in solo.  Making it to masters does require some grinding, so you'll probably need play an additional dozen games or so  for like 4 or 5 days beyond what is needed for your dailies.

Obviously, I haven't played at every level, so I can't really say too much about most of masters and up, but from what I've seen it's fantastic.   Ultimately time is the biggest constraint for a casual like from making it further up the ladder.

I highly recommend the game, it's fun yet deep at its core."
18826,So far so good. What I enjoy about any game it doesnt feel unbalanced and over all its fun. I can see some strength in numbers but once you aquire  some high tier cards they can last a little better against hordes. plus it brings some strategy when playing with a friend where I may utilize higher cost cards while he uses lower cost.
18827,"Unique take on the card genre, currently there seems to be a lot of grind to get the cards/characters you want to play but maybe there is something else in the game I haven't seen yet"
18828,it's easy to play and fun
18829,Pretty interesting take on a card game enjoying it so far.
18830,Guchos muchos
18831,"basically horizontal clash royale with more cards and less modes so pretty fun! game is not pay to win at all. very balanced game and good community

EDIT: bunch of new modes added. still fun and being updated!"
18832,Very fun headed in a good direction do play it and be merry
18833,"this is just like that mobile game but not shit 

this has awesome graphics
Smooth animations
and is just genrally a really fun game aad the team mode makes it even more fun"
18834,Fun strategy game
18835,"Quick and easy to learn.  Very simple game surprisingly fun!  Its free! And now Im addicted! Lots of fre stuff! 
 Check it out: http://minionmastersthegame.com/referral/?ref=POM8"
18836,Long time haven't played such fun and relaxing game :)
18837,"It's like Clash Royale, but isn't on your stupid ass phone."
18838,"If your looking for a strategy minion arena. This is the game for you.
I played other strategy games and this is one of the unique I've tried.

"
18839,"Very fun its like a card game but the cards do stuff, great stragety love it."
18840,"very fun free game , excellent devs"
18841," I believe that while many other games are fun, this one has a unique feel that is different from many other games.

First off I'd like to say that this game isn't an FPS. Which is what I usually play, from my standpoint this is a very great game.

Game Review - 9/10 becuz tseries. 

Have a nice day."
18842,super fun game will have alot of hours on it
18843,"If you're reading this, download this game now."
18844,FAB
18845,muy dinamico!!!! excelente
18846,"""I'll just go one more round...""

5 rounds later and my burger has gone cold, I think I like this game.

Think I might go one more round..."
18847,Fun with friends.
18848,Reminds me of modding in Warframe. I can do this type of game for long amounts of time too. I like Minion Masters.
18849,"Very simple and fast-paced game with the appearance of the mobile game Clash Royale.

It is a game, that is very easy to handle for anyone, but you must be able to think as quickly as possible. What is also very beneficial for you in this game is a fact, that you are able to win a game even without paying a cent, not like in Hearthstone.

Games are mostly short and quick, so If you hurry somewhere, but you still have a time to spare, this is the best option to play. Approximate duration of the games is about 1:30 to 3 minutes. 

The game contains around 150 cards, making it a huge range of possible deck creations. They are also depending on the ""master"" or character, as you may say, who can, with good card choices, create a deadly combo for any opponent you face.

The game concerns four game modes - Draft, 1v1, 2v2 and an Expedition. The most interesting to play would be the 1v1 and 2v2, where you can competitively climb up the ladder of ranks from Wood League up to the world's best rank, Grand Master. Expedition consists of quests, which, nonetheless, still guide you to the 1v1 or 2v2. 

With a very modest description I will move to the possitive and negative aspects. 

[h1][u]Possitive aspects[/u][/h1]
- Time-saving games
- Not a pay-to-win game
- Approximately 140 cards to play
- 4 game modes in total
- Very simple to handle
- Skin customisation of masters and maps
- Likeable game menu and comfortable gameplay
- Small size of game data in the computer 

[h1][u]Negative aspects[/u][/h1]
- Less experienced players might find ""tanky"" cards way too strong

I personally did not see a negative thing in this game and in that way I can recommend it."
18850,"Cool game, can you tell me how activate dlc tho?"
18851,good game. has a lot of potential. wish there were more cards and classes.
18852,very good
18853,"This is an amazing game, so polished for an early acess game. If only the rest of the EAG's were this well looked after."
18854,Best Tawer-defense game
18855,"Immediately addictive for card/RPG players, just started playing and I already know I'm gonna put way too much time into this game :D"
18856,Simply entertaining
18857,Fun. Reminds me of clash
18858,Pretty fun so far but I'm not very far into it just yet. Will update review once I'm more experienced.
18859,nice and chill game
18860,Meh it was fun but could be better.
18861,"This game is quite enjoyable. It's a simple yet challenging game!
Kind of similar to the game Clash Royale on Mobile Phones, but in my opinion as I played Clash Royale, they're not the same at all. And I like Minion Masters so far.."
18862,quick easy and fun with some skill needed
18863,"fun game
"
18864,AWEO)MS
18865,Really fun and a perfect alternative when you get bored of hearthstone. :)
18866,"Highly addictive once you learn how to play. I have chicken that I baked, and it's getting cold because I can't quit this."
18867,"Haven't played much as of now, so don't know any meta or ""pro"" strats etc, but seems like some pretty casual fun."
18868,All 30 minutes I've played before they asked for a review have been fun
18869,love card games
18870,Can't play from iran. It hangs on the first loading page and says: can't connect to the server. So not recommending cause of the hates.
18871,"Really nice tutorial, teaches you the rope, and finally a simple game that is enjoyable and has a truly working UI. I like it a lot."
18872,"im not much of a review write but, i must say this game is very easy to pick up with the right mindset and it's actually rather fun. doesn't involve a lot of learning, pretty straight forward. tutorial is rather short but teaches you what you need to know. 3/5 fantastic"
18873,"easy to pick up, fun game. A combo of deckbuilding and lane strategy. the twitch integration is really cool too."
18874,A very good game to play with crazy friends
18875,awesome gameplay real strategic game
18876,"Surprisingly good little competitive strategy game :) 

Players create a small deck of 10 cards which can be units, buildings and spells, then send them to battle it out on a small board with two bridges that give a bonus for controlling them. 

There are many cards and Masters (heroes/classes) and it seems to give decent rewards even for free players.

It is probably more suited to mobiles but it's still fun to play on PC."
18877,Fun game. Lots of great rewards. Dopamine Treadmill here we go!
18878,It's to fun
18879,very nice game
18880,"Its a pretty fast pace game, but not too complicated to jump right in. id give it for performance, graphics, and off the wall humor a 4 out of 5. Worth the time, just dont take it too seriously and have some fun."
18881,"its amazing tim killer to be honest
"
18882,Great free to play game. I almost have the entire collection minus a few legendaries and plenty of resources for anything else. I spent 5 dollars to buy rubies to get the battlepass quicker and now have enough rubies saved up to get the next one and will probably never spend another sent on this game. I might though to support the devs cause this game is awesome.
18883,"- If you tried many times playing team duels on solo queue like me, then congratulations you got cancer.
- Ranking system is nonexistent. Playerbase is toxic and/or 8 year old console players who don't know how to play the game.
- Devs ignoring game breaking bugs, glitches and feature requests. 
- They make new OP cards every season and make stupid excuses for not fixing them for a long time.
- They use bots to cover dwindling player numbers.
- Insane grind. Very much in the psychological addiction territory. (Which is a cardinal sin IMO)
- Possible cheaters, lots of griefers and to troll players they even put a fake ""report player"" button.
- They try to look like ""good guys"" by giving away their newest DLC for free first week of release but remember if they didn't do this everybody would realize this game is Pay to Win. Free players can only grind like crazy everyday (and lose matches most of the time) to even start competing with other players.
- I got my first ban on steam forums after all these years just because I was pointing out the frustrations I had with this game so yeah they're not very tolerant to criticism."
18884,"Pay 2 win TCG Game by Real-Time Battlefield Warfare. Whoever has the fattest wallet, wins the match. DUH! Do not recommend."
18885,I enjoy a good free to play baabaaaay - great fun and does what is says - deck building and some champ strat go into it so it makes it fun.
18886,better than clash royal
18887,"league of legends meets hearthstone, but simple and fun :)"
18888,"Pay2Win like any other Card game, didn´t expect nothing else BUT the devs have no clue about how to balance their cards. There are ridiculously overpowerd cards wich are so cheap to play while others are expensive as fuck and useless. If you have 200 bucks to throw away go on play it and have fun. Anyone else should play other card games like Hearthstone, Magic or Gwent. Those are Pay2Win aswell but atleast the devs know what they are doing in terms of balance and the amound of useful stuff you get for your money.

Game is flooded with chinese people now. So your game will run at 5-15fps and heaving a chinese teammate equals as a loose. Shitgame"
18889,its a fun new kinda of card game
18890,"Pretty impressed with this overall. Quite polished already, progression feels really good, and I haven't felt the need to buy anything at all yet. And thank God there's no card upgrading like Clash Royale because that woulda made this game insta-bad. I will say though that the friend referral system is absolute garbage, and the rewards are horrendous."
18891,"Love this game, easy to get into and addicting. Fun fast paced action with an awesome rewarding system that keeps you wanting more. Good stuff."
18892,:)
18893,Actually a pretty fun lane based strategy game that is free to play
18894,"For a start. This is better than any mobile game ever experienced
"
18895,"GOOD FAST GAME
"
18896,:^)
18897,A great fast strategy game!
18898,It's so awesome game to have so much fun.
18899,"Honestly this games Animation quality sucks. It looks terrible. 

And that's quite sad. Because its an amazingly fun game. The gameplay of Minion Masters is so fun,

Me and my bestfriend Nightmare play it together often in its 2v2 mode. 


It honestly looks like a terrible game but I enjoy it greatly. 

Its a great strategy tower offense/defense game, I would highly recommend this to a friend. 

Of course they would play single player for a bit until they could keep up with myself or other friends who played the game. Get good cards and finally have fun with friends."
18900,Games fun. I like the pace and its not incredibly challenging and easy to get into.
18901,Enjoy it so far. Reminds me of Clash Royale. Has good depth and polish from what I have seen thus far. Give it a shot if you like deckbuilding and quick PvP matches. Will update in the future as I play more!
18902,Simple game simple fun.
18903,"game is nice, can't tell why tho."
18904,fun and easy to play.
18905,This game is going to take my time away from everything else... and that's a good thing.
18906,GREAT GAM
18907,Good graphics and nice gameplay
18908,Pretty nice game and its free
18909,"This game is NOT p2w, which makes it almost perfect by today's standards. It's fun and simple, but because it's so simple there's a lot of hidden depth and strategies behind it, love it"
18910,Great sense of humor. Super cute.
18911,"Fast & interesting fun game, good for quick game!"
18912,Honestly Awesome Game ive enjoyed without spending a penny.
18913,"good game to play with friends or solo
"
18914,Great gameplay with interesting characters. The progression system is fairly nice. Definitely recommend
18915,"saw it, played it, loved it. =P"
18916,good game
18917,"Very early first time review. Enjoyed clash royale as a way to waste time, but without trying to brag I found that I would hit a wall. Meaning I would play well, but eventually climb too high for my cards to be effective. That was due to cards leveling in power due to how many of them you had. What this meant was people with money to wipe their ass with could win, despite missplays, due to their cards being straight up better than yours in a side by side comparison. If you had the literal exact same deck, and had the exact same draws, you lost because their guys we're stronger. This game so far lacks that. I am by no means a god tier player, but I find that I don't lose due to my cards coming up short in a side by side comparison, but rather that I messed up. Wether that was in playing wrong, or bringing a deck too weak to certain enemies, or an infinite number of reasons, I found that I could trace the loss to something I could control.

Is this game perfect? No. I have notciced a few money grubbing stuff lifted from Fortnite, but overall a great take on the genre, and one that I will re-review when I have enough time to either re-affirm, or counter these points. Not to discredit everything I just said but the issues I levied with Clash Royale did not surface till I was several hours deep."
18918,cool
18919,It's cool
18920,"Refreshing game so far, new mechanics and even tho it looks like clash royale it's not, it's much more fun to play.

Give it a try"
18921,I like dis.
18922,havent played much yet but its incredibly fun so far
18923,es un buen juego bases muy fasil y estrategias basica espero que se complique y que haigan mas bariedad de cartas.
18924,IT FUN
18925,This game is so fun and unique. I and my friend enjoy it very much!
18926,Nice
18927,"Fun game, interesting"
18928,Nice Game
18929,"Nice game, Nice playstyle. 10/10 u should try it out"
18930,Nice
18931,kruta
18932,This is intense
18933,"it is a quick fun game no stress to play right now simple game 
"
18934,"as much as i want to give this game positive acclaim, i cant. i was hoping to find something that was better than clash royale, due to its pay to win system and the necessity of clan rewards, but no luck here; while there are new classes and mechanics in the game, like different masters, game progression, no card leveling system to avoid pay to win, and more, the system is super rewarding to gem cashiers, and the balancing here is pretty bad, if not worse. tanky units are very very powerful, and with a stunner to back them up it's a pain in the ass to deal with, and the very setup could easily break apart your tower. not to mention, legendaries. legendary units are so dang powerful, like that 3 mana dragon that attacks like an AIM, and the Colossus, which is such a pain to kill, and its counters are not very usable at any other different situation. there is even a youtube video of someone wrecking teams apart by using just the cleaver and rammer, two bulky high damage units,  and they dont even need to look back to keep themselves alive, since the two are just that powerful. they haven't seemed to notice this dilemma either; the new lycantropy ability is very strong, being able to shortcut a powerful unit across the field, and its legionnaires are very tough; it's like being able to send a pack of slow moving elite barbarians. and there aren't many versatile counters to it, unless if your deck bends so much towards that direction.

it was fun at the start, but as you go, the systems flaws were very evident and damaging. you may think i'm unskilled, but you can see the flaws for yourself; it's at least free for all players. but for those wanting to go deep... better places can be found."
18935,pretty fun.. just started.. level 10.. i can smoke and play.. key factors in the life of an old pothead
18936,"At first I thought this was just another card game, but I was wrong. I have found myself really being drawn in by this game. Very addictive!"
18937,GJ nice game
18938,Great Fun.
18939," i have a few friends playing this and doodlebag told me to try it out i might like it so i went and got the game and giving it a shot i love it so far im still learning the game im streaming my every steps of the game i hope to play some more even play with doodlebag 
"
18940,"Game:Used to be fun but it went way of what it was, unbalanced.
Gameplay:Unbalanced
P2W: 100% Now.
Servers: are crappy so expect lag and disconnections left and right
2v2 games can be annoying couse if your partner disconnects you get a loss and if it happens several times it affects your ranking.


I do not recomend this game at all anymore."
18941,"matches are fast, and game is fun
"
18942,"it's simple, has nice graphics and it's fun"
18943,"Just started to play, and for a free game I haveto say it's really addictive. No need to spend any money, and like I said, they do make you want to keep on playing, and come back."
18944,"good character and great palyer flexibility
"
18945,very fun game
18946,"Do you like money? No? 

Well then i have the game for you, Minion Masters!.
The first litteral Pay to Win game iv seen in a long time, dont like grinding? go ahead buy your way to the top in this heavily unbalanced attempt at cashing in on the TCG genre. 
Cant get the card you want? Dont you worry your master will win the game for you.

How did you ruin a game that was perfectly fine during paid access beta?"
18947,it's cool
18948,"Great combination of game types for a quick (or long) play session.

Not too intrusive with ingame purchase pushing. I havent played long enough to know if it becomes pay to win near the top tier. I will update if it goes that route.

Update :

I have just reached platinum level in 1v1 Battles after alot of hours in and I can say the game is very enjoyable and definately not too intrusive with purchases.

There is a store which you can use to buy offers, specials and tokens (used to 'spin' and get new cards) using one of the three games currency, gold, shards and rubies.
Your initial play going through the achievements and challenges will net you more than enough gold, shards and rubies to get more cards, or unlock a master and even get some of the specials all without spending money.

The gameplay is highly dependant on having good cards, or good combinations of cards. These cards are usually not avialable through the shard 'recruitment' option which means they need to be obtained using tokens.   If you have bad luck and don't get any good cards this initial influx of currency the game gives you slows down to a trickle later on.

I would suggest that if you play through the initial 'tournament' and like how the game plays, and think you could play it for a few hours more if you get some good cards to mess with, get the premium upgrade straight away.  This increases the amount of currency you get from rewards, which will pay off greatly in the first few hours of play, where the game throws it at you. Not to mention giving you a boatload of currency up front which will allow you to take 20+ spins and a few specials from the store along with recruiting or upgrading cards."
18949,Fun clash royale type game with interesteing characters and in depth deckbuilding
18950,Easy to play fun and has stratagy.
18951,Great game so far
18952,"It's pretty balanced, but not so that it's unwinnable. Graphics Gorgeous
"
18953,Great game
18954,fun fast paced strategy game
18955,A+
18956,awesome game
18957,"MUST BE THE BEST CARD GAME WITH GREAT FIGHTING ACTION TO, IT A MUST IF YOUR A FIGHTING GAME PLAYER."
18958,Pretty good so far
18959,It's a great game! VERY ADDICTIVE!!!!
18960,its good..
18961,TOTALLY WORTH A TRY
18962,Way better than I expected but no 21:9 support for 2560x1080 :P
18963,"Friend got me to play it, it seems like a fun co-op game so far, but I just learned that bundle keys that I purchased for this were invalidated by the developer/publisher when it went free to play, that was a disappointing move that will anger the purchaser every time, I buy extra copies of bundles when I can afford it to give to friends and do key drops... They could've easily turned these keys into some token package they gave you some chests or _SOMETHING_ instead it seems like they ripped everyone off who paid for this game in any way before it went f2p? Again, very disappointing, no token reward, no early supporter thank you, just a whole bunch of keys I paid for invalidated. 

Invalidating the keys people paid for is a very bad business practice and makes you seem like a very untrustworthy company."
18964,Its great game. So addictive!
18965,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1]

[quote] PLEASE NOTE: This review is/was written when this game was in/is still in Early Access. Think twice before buying/playing this game [/quote]

Minion Masters is a game developed and published by BetaDwarf, the same people behind the FORCED series

The game is somewhat fun if sometimes broken, not entirely and it's a game I'd personally would not sink hours into but for people who like this type of gameplay, then this game could be the game for you

The graphics are nice, the music is also really nice and the voice acting is, surprsingly, really good

Mion Masters is an okay game in it's current state, nothing special, the game might not be fun for people who have never played card game-esque games before or take no interest in genre, this game may not be entirely enjoyable

However, if you like card games and would like a different take on the gameplay then this may be the game for you
 
[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]

[*] None"
18966,simple clean enjoying game for me
18967,"Easy to pick up and they actually give currency that usually costs money if you're really against PTW games, as long as you're willing to grind.

Overall 9/10"
18968,:) <3
18969,ez game :) .
18970,"Awesome game! Totally reccomend it, alot of awesome creatures and spells, nice animations and constant content updates!

Cheers!
+ Beautiful graphics!"
18971,"The hypocritical marxist system of banning people from chat for ""verbal abuse"" is disgusting. Only particular things pass for offensive according to BetaDwarf. Don't think just because you're offended that it counts as verbal abuse. People can insult you, your intelligence, your religion and pretty well anything they want, as long as they don't use certain phrases or words. So whether you were ""verbally abused"" or not, really makes no difference. 

There's also no way to chat to your opponent, because let's face it, nobody ever wants to tell their opponent EXACTLY what they think of them. No no, betadwarf needs to make sure you can't be a big meanie to the precious little snowflakes. Oh and don't even think of calling someone their ethnicity. I mean, you can probably get away with calling someone american, but you better not call them chinese, even if they are chinese, because that's racist apparently.

On top of this marxist attempt at thought policing, the game itself utilizes terrible rng to incentivise purchases of premium content."
18972,"Seems enjoyable so far, but I'm only doing the challenges (PvE) to learn the game. Sort of a twist on a deck buildling/collector game with some tower defense built in, you're instead using the different cards (based on mana, and when you play one it's immediately replaced - mana builds up over time) to summon different types of creatures to help with your tower defense. Spells as well for your ""master"" (the being that represents you in the game - each of which has it's own unique bonuses) to cast to help with combat, and even some buildings that can be constructed. Definitely a lot more to unlock yet, but well worth a try!"
18973,DOTA and Clash Royal mixed together
18974,Great fun!
18975,"The commentary in the background is awesome. It hypes up the battles. 
I'd recommend it to anyone who loves playing card games that action packed.
Steamed potato 7.5/10🍠"
18976,"Pro's 
+ game plays well and fluently.
+ makes fun
+ nice graphic
+ many different cards
+ game gets regular patches
Contra
- unbalanced as fuck
- new cards are exaggeratedly strong.
- bad nerfs
- too expensive prices than you like to put money in.
- some heroes are too strong
- fireball and magmastorm is a way to op and everyone plays the shit continuously as well as beam of doom
- ranked system is not balanced"
18977,"This game has good potential.  Even if you put money in you arent always going to win.  They seem to care and keep up with meta blanaces and fixes.  I hope to see more things added such as new game modes, cards, and masters.  The community is also pretty good overall."
18978,"really fast, really fun, very unique"
18979,"I'ts so clean and fun, love it so far :) Super chill!"
18980,"Love this game have it for so long and always comeback.
Updates regularly and even more often now with the battle passes (should be a little cheaper or reward more of the money back at later stages but its ok)
Matchmaking is always fast and the meta is diverse 
lots of content for this kind of game 
10/10 would recomend good job"
18981,"Great game, good mechanics, addictive as can be. Will be playing this for days."
18982,"OMG !! I love this game , no more chances !!! Great Game , thanks"
18983,Really fun time waster especially with friends
18984,"I've played the game for 4 hour straight and i'd say i did enjoy myself until i get into higher leagues with players that obviously spent more in real cash and got some pay to win legendary cards if only the devs can tone it down it will be way more fun, until then ill change my review if they do something about it."
18985,Fun little game.
18986,good to pick up and go
18987,feels good man
18988,Very fun game!
18989,.........
18990,"Fun game. I would write more, but I just want to keep playing!"
18991,Greeat Game would recomend 10/10
18992,"Amazingly original game, competitive trickery. Not a card game in traditional sense but a DUEL game like chess."
18993,1 hour in ...hmm i like thats its fast and like no time to wait for games.. a little too straight forward though.... its free ;wish there were diffrent boards though.
18994,Just a flat out fun game. 10/10
18995,Very fun game with different modes. It is mostly a grind but a blend of tower defense with cards. I really like this game and you should play it!
18996,lustig
18997,Decent
18998,"Pretty nice competetive game ,with no need to donate.
PS: me and a lot of other players will be glad to play this on mobile phones.It is finally something better than Clash..."
18999,"I don't know how to get in contact with the developers on how to report a bug I just experienced with recieving the free power token for joining the steam group. I have a screen shot and an explanation for what happened, but I cannot find a place to report the bug and how to recreate it for testing purposes.
"
19000,fun game so far mix of a bunch of genres I like
19001,stun lancers bae
19002,it is very good game :)
19003,"Its a fun RTS/TCG , I'm really liking the character perks."
19004,"I LOVE this game
Reminds me of Clash Royal but....better.

Highly recommend"
19005,"Fun game, good devs!"
19006,Great game!
19007,"There are some bugs here and there but it's beta. It's been really great so far.
When you are spectating someone, it glitches sometimes and loops you around the end of the game. To get out of the loop, you either have to keep looping or restart the game.
Another glitch is when you are done spectating someone, an error message keeps popping up to remind you that you are done spectating. Need to restart the game as well on that one.
As of now, willing to buy the game when it's done being beta."
19008,Fun with friends and easy to learn
19009,"I'm becoming unsocial just in 1 hour. Do not download if you have job to get done, family to see and life to live..."
19010,"Very cool game, especially the 2vs2 part is awesome if you duo with a friend ;)"
19011,I've been enjoying this game.
19012,Really fun game. Looking forward to more masters and cards.
19013,So far not bad
19014,Fun and better than that Clash Royale mobile crap
19015,A fun and easy to understand game! Great competitive fun between friends!
19016,"gud game 4 free, plz play now"
19017,its alright
19018,Nice game
19019,nice game
19020,gg
19021,easy chill fun game to learn and and play with a friend
19022,"super Fun game really fun would recommend it to anyone had a blast playing it with a firend all night intill it crashed around 6 am smt,"
19023,Fun. Easy. Addictive
19024,"Was procrastinating on playing this, I must say, it is ratehr enjoyable and fun to play, huge fan of tug of war and card games similiar to this on both mobile and pc, and this is on my list of top 2, considering that the second is no longer active and was shut down. a must play indeed."
19025,"I think its a fun game to play! Fast games, strategy is important and i dont feel its a p2w game if your not planning to play competitive! give it time and it will give you the cards you want! i started playing 2 days ago and already got 3 legendaries and some good epics!"
19026,It's ok.
19027,"Fun and silly in tone.  Games can be very swingy, so even if you're down to 5 health you can still pull off a win."
19028,engaging.
19029,GG
19030,"its a pretty fun game kinda wish there was voice chat tho.. :) other than that great game
"
19031,Jogo mó da hora
19032,As long as it doesn't become a pay to win game its't great! Very good!
19033,"The game is ""too free""
No, it`s not. It`s just poorly managed.

Go back to putting some real effort into Content and Balance, and you'll have your ""Financially sustainable Minion Masters"""
19034,Geras game labai panasus i clash royale tik truputi patobulintas :)
19035,Fun and Easy.
19036,Really great game very innovative.  It makes card games more fun and interactive plus it picks up the pace to them which i think is a lot more fun.  Incredible game.
19037,pretty fun game! even tho still lack in some aspect like reconnecting problem
19038,"its pretty fun,  free to play AND you dont -have- to spend money at all. 

good time waster.
"
19039,estou  gostando pq sou retardado e tenho problemas serios e minha familia me odeia belo jogo feliz 2019
19040,"Fast paced, easy to learn, divers possibilities. So far i thoroughly enjoy the game!"
19041,This is a pretty fun game .. reminds me alot of the mobile game clash royale
19042,it is like clash royale except funner and less toxic
19043,"Very fun game, I enoy it!"
19044,Sad but P2W. after gold you can't do anything :S
19045,Similar to some of the old Warcraft 3 online games.
19046,Very fun would recommend to all players that love mobas but not the 40 minute games quick and easy and alot to do
19047,"Fun and simple game. Worth checking out, I'm only a little bit into it but it's got me intrigued so far. Games can last kinda long if both opponents are aware of what they're doing and have a decent deck. Games go fast if you know what you're doing. Sorta luck based game but I feel like there is definite strategy when it comes to using your power."
19048,Quick to get into and quite polished for how little ive heard of it.
19049,Surprisingly fun. especially with a buddy
19050,Fun game but feels clunky between rounds and jumping around in the menu. Please take away the cutscenes and passive loading time.
19051,Nice game
19052,i like this type of game
19053,Love this game and it's free...  Dev's are very active and so is the community.  Fun fast paced action so you can play a game and have some fun then stop playing... Or keep playing over and over again.  ;)
19054,Probably fun for people who like RNG oriented low-skill Pay-To-Win clicker games.
19055,"fast paced, easy to get into"
19056,Awsome!
19057,.
19058,The game is good they asked me for a review so I am giving them one.
19059,Much better than Clash Royale
19060,Really fun and no need to spend if you don't want. Devs are very generous.  Well done.
19061,"some strat required, overall good fun to go in with streamers on twitch and participate in chat. VERY ACTIVE RIGHT NOW! no wait times for matches"
19062,Has to improve a lot...
19063,"Tight up friendship real quick
"
19064,Pretty simple. I think i can sleep and play this in same time.
19065,1337
19066,Easy to jump-in and play. I already have others who want to 2v2. The game mechanics are clear and the stratyegies seem endless. I look forward to future development and am already thinking about buying the expansion. Thanks for this great game.
19067,"FREE! But not only free, it's fun and well-balanced. I will continue playing and recommending!"
19068,"
So far its fun cant speak much of balance tho i doubt f2p players can get far."
19069,"i got this game for free but i cant check the little box that says you got the game for free, wtf is this doO doO"
19070,"It's simple, funny, and a good twist to deck building games."
19071,cool
19072,Is gud
19073,So far from what I've played its very fun the random aspects of the mana and the card pools means no 2 matches are the same.
19074,Funny.
19075,Chilling. <3
19076,df
19077,amazing game
19078,very good
19079,is 3 star maybe 4 star but feels like i need to spend money at some point... i don't like that feeling.
19080,"Great game, just lay down cards and win"
19081,great mechanics for a game of this type love it
19082,"Reminds me of TD in Warcraft 3, mixed with unit counters. Lots of fun!"
19083,"Pretty fun. I like it so far. I'd say to add more skins... more characters... I think if the game continues this way, people will pay for ""skins"" just like in league of legend. But nothing else. Keep it free if you want more players to play.. and perhaps, pay for skins later on. Good stuff.

However, there seems to be an issue with the ""EXPEDITION"" option as each time I move to a new tile, the game crashes all the time.  I have my resolution at the lowest.. and it still crashes.. so I think EXPEDITION needs some fixing. But apart from that, the game is pretty addictive. I see myself playing this game a lot.. well, that is if there is no "" pay to play"" cards option comes in. I remember another game, forgot which one.. but, people would spend real money on ""legendary"" cards and... well.. people who had no money.. would die faster and people start losing interest since only the ""pay to play"" players were having fun...so less players... 

so be careful on that option.. if you want more players to spend money on your game.. it has to be on ""balanced"" gameplay... otherwise, I will lose interest and play something else. I don't mind paying for skins only. ( even if it's expensive but not too expensive ) as long as the gameplay is balanced for everyone... not just those with ""legendary cards"" purchased. Cheers"
19084,"Great game, large variety of cards and heros with each their own skills."
19085,"Great game!
It reminds me of a dota mode i played years ago.
"
19086,"Basically a clone of a mobile game we all known and can name.
With a wee twist to it.

Going F2P will have helped the number of players to play against, but all the Pay2Win mechanics that came along with it don't help."
19087,fun
19088,I've always loved deck building games but this has an MOBA kinda feel to it which adds to the excitement and adrenaline. There is so much potential for this and it's really clean so far for a relatively new game.
19089,is a really good and addictive game and really fun recomend to everyone
19090,fun quick mana based game
19091,"balanced so far game, it is pretty fun. I could see myself enjoying this game as it continues to change and progress. !"
19092,"Good, simple game. Some of the cards 'seem' useless, but likely have play value for decks that just don't match my play style. Matches are quick, so it's a neat game to hop on and just play a few rounds before bed or something.

I will say that I'm disappointed there aren't more Masters. Yes, there are 9, but I do not think all 9 are 'good.' Again, they might just not fit my playstyle. But having played them all (except one), I only see about 5 that make much sense to me. I also see, in matchmaking, some not getting played hardly at all.

Rewarding leveling, lots of 'free' content. Not play to win, though free to play. I bought the game before it went free to play - 20 bucks. It was worth it then, it would still be worth it now.

"
19093,"I mean, this game is lit as fuck. Stop asking me to fucking do reviews I'm tryina play you bitch."
19094,"Funny, easy to play. Worth to play!"
19095,Fun game
19096,good
19097,"I've just started, so take it with a grain of salt, but thus far I love how strategy oriented this game is with a lot of variations depending on both Master and minions. Different minions counter different ones, but you also have to take into account the different energy costs of the units. A great strategy game with short rounds that can each feel unique."
19098,so fun
19099,That one starcraft warcraft map you liked. Its like a moba cardgame rts. So simple and so fun.
19100,Awesome little time waster and just a lot of fun! Can see myself spending a lot of time in Minion Masters and my viewers seem to love it also.
19101,Fun
19102,"Great so far, only an hour or so in and already I can see the potential.
Only wish is that you could micro the individual minions, but I guess that's part of the strategy"
19103,okay cool plz make balance overall card :D fast game not boring
19104,"really fun games especialy playin with friends, keep this game alive i am sure this game will be a great one"
19105,AMAZING Game super fun to play :D
19106,Its a fun free stategy game I would recomend it to a friend.
19107,Clash Royale but better lel
19108,"Nice game so far. Nice optic and sound. Easy gameplay. Good tutorial.

EDIT:
After playing a few hours it's clear that it's p2w. And because the game has some pretty hefty balance issues with some imba cards, it just makes it worse."
19109,Definitely very fun.
19110,P2W - Bahra
19111,"I like the game, it is fun. It seems like you can pay to win. The only thing I dislike is they copy the battle pass system you see in games like fortnite. Unlike fortnite you are unable to get enough in game currency from buying the battle pass to buy it again next season. Games like fortnite have the pass cost 10 dollars, and you will make enough in that season to purchase the next seasons if you complete it."
19112,"this game is so fun, i am having so much fun in this game. The reason that this game is so fun, is because it is hilarious because it's fun. I am drunk."
19113,Minion Masters is a delightfuly fun and humorous title that plays half like hearth stone half like tower defense game. It hits all the itches i need to scratch
19114,"10/10 Crossbow Dudes. Strong? No, but good friends."
19115,I had this game in my inventory and it is much better than I expected.
19116,i love it
19117,<3
19118,Good game!
19119,p2w
19120,"Its not bad, actually kinda fun."
19121,Good game i we played
19122,Easy to learn game that is fun to get into.
19123,funny
19124,Entertaining little time waster. I would recommend.
19125,This game is easy to pick up and very fun. Worth spending some coin to support them.
19126,"I highly recommend this game to Yu-Gi-Oh! players or players alike.
This game seems like a time-based Yu-Gi-Oh! game, except for the ""mana"". (Points required to summon characters)

Fun and free!"
19127,Pretty Fun
19128,"Minion Masters has a fantastic formula for a deep strategy game that doesn't require an enormous amount of time to play.  Unfortunately, there are some pay to win issues.  It doesn't seems like anything is locked out, but it'll take some time to have access to all of the cool ideas they've come up with.  In the mean time, people with bigger pockets will be able to take advantage of those premium elements to beat you in ladder games.  If you're looking for a game to reward your growth in skill and knowledge, play something else.  If you're looking for a casual pvp game, this is it."
19129,"Can't say as I suspected this game as going to be any good, but wow this is fun!  Cards that just summon monsters who have it with one another, how great is that.  The variety of monsters and spells will definitely allow for quite a lot of strategies to play around with too I can tell."
19130,Fun and easy 2nd screen game
19131,"This game is great and I will 100% recommend it to anyone. It is free after all, and not to mention that it is not a P2W game either. Of course, since this is the case then the game is a type game to earn shards to collect cards. But the tiers are pretty fair, lower tier cards costing at around 50-150 shards and then the more bigger tier cards cost around 500-2000 shards. The bigger figure indicates [i] Legendary [/i] cards, which is totally fair. Not to mention that there are plenty of daily challenges and achievements to collect in order to gain rubies and gold. As such then you better get your grinding hats on. The lower tier cards are very useful and strong within their own right, and as the meta changes you often find those same starting cards within a deck and you'll be shocked at how useful they are, it's all about experimenting and finding the best mix when building up a deck.

The game also has a very active Competitive scene and has the tournaments livestreamed on the KingPuffCup channel which you can click on and check out for yourself. The next tournament starts this month as well too, so keep an eye out on that as well.

Try the game, and stick with it. There are plenty of guides, tips and tricks on YouTube for you to check out as well if you need help, or want a brief guide on how to deck build. With all that being said, I hope you join the community in this game and have fun while doing so.

[quote=Anonymous] this game had potential until the developers got money hungry!
everytime they add new cards they are overpowered compared to the current balance. [/quote]

Not true at all, and even if the new cards are overpowered then they get nerfed pretty quick. The game works in a rock, paper, scissors way. You can always counter a unit or card with another, that's how it is. I can do it easily, so don't let this particular review discourage you. The only advice for me to give anyone is this; Watch out for spam decks! They will out number you very quickly!"
19132,Fun after an hour or so we will see in say 5 - 10
19133,If you dont do drugs...and wanted to see what crack is like....download this game and youll be addicted to it for life....
19134,its great and addicting
19135,"Tons of fun so far, nice visuals and simple yet hard to master gameplay."
19136,Lots of fun solo or with a buddy
19137,"Quite a fun game, the action/card game gameplay works very well.  Matches are fast paced and rewards come often."
19138,Really easy to learn for new gamers!
19139,"Perfect game to play while listening to a podcast;

It reminds me of an old Warcraft 3 mod, Castle Fight. 
The core mechaninc of defending your base is there, but you don't have to worry about base building.

I can't say if it's pay-to-win or not, it doesn't feel like it to me, and I did not buy any decks.
"
19140,Great fast paced strategy game - reminds me a lot of Magic the Gathering: Battlegrounds which I absolutely loved. The Online PVP format and improved deck building and ranking systems only improve on the formula originating in MTG: Battlegrounds. Plus - Free!
19141,Really fun and easy to pick up
19142,like
19143,"good atuff
"
19144,"The game is quite fun. Its not remotely pay to win like people continue to say in chat, those are mostly low tier players. I found this game very enjoyable to play in my free time or just to kill time in general. 

Con: There should be a better report system in this game do to people spamming their twitch stream 24/7 or the simple fact that some people have insanely offensive/racist names (some people also purposly throw games). Chat in game always cry about a certain card being op when every card in this game can be countered by several other cards. I hit diamond 1 solo and master 2 in team match up in my first 20 hours in game (no i have not spent even 1$ on this game). After that i grinded to grandmaster and ended up grandmaster rank 164 in about 60 hours total of game time. The game is enjoyable but if you plan on getting great rewards for your rank then think again. End of season my grandmaster rank only got me about 200 rubies which is less then 2$ worth of rubies and only 2k gold, it also placed me in silver division so i got knocked down by 6 ranks which doesnt bug me but the rewards does kill it. Its also a bit annoying that there is no normal mode. You have to play rank mode only so you cant test out your decks before hand


Pro: The thing most enjoyable about this game is the matchs generally only last between 2-8mins so your not stuck with bad teammates for very long and it totally reminds me of magic the gathering battleground (from xbox). Solo was ok but i found Teams (with randoms) much more fun cause you never know what your partners deck is gonna be and if your a good player who is in sync your partner might actually add you later on and you could do a premade team rank instead (which happens often when your diamond or higher). The community does talk often but they usually cry/argue. 

As much as i did enjoy this game im gonna give it a negative review for now because most of the time people are whining and argue  and the rewards end season are trash. The game is early access though these things may change and if they do i shall return to it. I will only suggest this game if you literally have nothing better to do cause its a great way to kill time"
19145,"fun mechanics, great visuals, fast matches"
19146,Quick and fun
19147,very fun
19148,good and addicting
19149,Little minions are BALLIN!!!!
19150,great game
19151,"This game is mindless fun, it's even better with a friend that you can coordinate with."
19152,"Enjoy playing this game. Very Addictive!!
"
19153,"The game is using mechanichs of clash royale,but it will be more easier for people,who plays games with those mechanichs not so long."
19154,Fun
19155,Peace of cake!
19156,Great Game!!
19157,Super fun and very engaging!
19158,"Really joyful game. There is no pay2win and card balance seems ok. Game is very unique, it fills the niche that Battleforge servers shutdown created."
19159,good in all ways..... think of bigger group modes like a 4v4 Top down moba but keep the card genre
19160,"Final Review: Game is laggy and buggy and has only gotten worse over time. It's like they're trying to do too much with these updates. Also they cut all the Battle Pass and other events time way down, so for someone like me who doesn't have all day everyday to play, it's just annoying. If you're going to have timed events in the game then make sure you're game works during that timed event. I tried to log in today and, after already having updated the game, Minion Masters tells me my game is out of date still, we'll see if it takes them 12+ hours to fix this issue too.

---------------------------------------

After all my hard spent time I'm greeted with an error stating that my account is already logged in and I cannot play. No way to contact support other than Discord (I don't have a Facebook or Twitter and they don't have a support button on the website or an email listed), and the support or mods on Discord are asleep or nonexistent at the time of a huge update.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Great game, it's free, it's fun, and it's not pay to win. Yes some cards are obviously much stronger than others and certain decks will absolutely dominate newer ones without the good cards, but I've yet to spend a single dollar and I unlocked the battle pass and got tons of supreme and legendary cards. I play with my friend and he has gotten a lot as well, and his good cards are way different than mine, but we both have a lot of fun. If you are looking for a fun game that's a mix of hearthstone meets tower defense, then you're in luck."
19161,Awesome Pc Clash royale <3 XDD
19162,yeah it's good
19163,so far so good
19164,"This game beats getting kicked in the nuts!
"
19165,I love this game it is great gotta go so bye
19166,nice
19167,Do you forget the quit game option? I had to alt-f4 out. Fun game otherwise.
19168,easy to play quite addictive good fun playing casually definatly worth playing
19169,fun game
19170,"This is a fun combination of deck builder, tower defense and moba."
19171,"Great game, very f2p friendly."
19172,pay to  win
19173,"Rock, paper, scissors... me like this one"
19174,"First time I saw this game, I immediately clicked IGNORED. Then I found this gameplay on Youtube by chance and I was like what the hell, it looks amazing. I go back to Steam and looked for this game. What amazed me is how simple it looks yet how deep it is to master. The graphics is both cute and stunning. The announcer voice can be annoying but luckily he is not over intruding throughout the game. There is still Gacha aspect of the game but so far, I don't find myself having disadvantage. The match can be either fair or sometime punishing but overall I'd have to say, the game is FUN! Try it out."
19175,Good Game! Fun time!
19176,"Great game easy to play hard to master=) the speed of new content growth is also nice, Enjoy! =D
"
19177,Good !
19178,nice and solid game
19179,card game with 2v2 mode
19180,really addicting
19181,.
19182,Pretty fun stuff. Try it if you like clash royale.
19183,its so fun!
19184,This game is fun and entertaining.
19185,This game is fun. It's got more depth than just spawning minions in lanes like it looked like to me. Where you spawn them and which minions you choose and how you place them all come into play. There is more field play than I thought there would be. The game looks really good though its fun enough im usually too busy to look.
19186,Simple but fun.
19187,"just plane fun
"
19188,"The game told me to write a review while I was playing. I said no cause I wanted to play more, so now that I have stopped for a moment I am writing this review. I think this game is a lot of fun and easy to pick up, but with a surprising amount of depth to how you can play. I recommend it."
19189,very good game if you have good cards
19190,"Reminds me of magic a tiny bit, bit of tower defence, and has its own uniqe twists that make the game not just a simple copy past from other's."
19191,"Great, if you're looking for a quiet afternoon without frying your brain too much. Can literally be played with one hand."
19192,Funny game.
19193,"Store page mentions coop. After first tutorial battles I see no way to actually check for pve battles even or hell... can't even find a quit button. I guess I have to pay for that too eventually?

Well, I would say it could be a fun game if it was a tad less... stupid? Like let me choose what I want to do."
19194,"This game is good. Tried it becuase Kriapparian.... best action rpg gamer ever.... But yea, this game is fun. And its free. Very good non-p2w mechanics. 
Your deck is 10 cards out of 100~ something, 4 come up at a time and you place them on the battlefield.  Hold the middle bridges for a boost, and destroy the enemy.   Simple but complex at the same time."
19195,QUICK MATCHES
19196,Actually a fun little game.  Great to pick up and play with friends.
19197,"An esay to learn hard to master type of game and It's not ""pay to win""."
19198,good game simple and fast
19199,reel good
19200,Goods
19201,"Great game! free! must try it, so much fun"
19202,Amazing ftp game
19203,"No spam, no win"
19204,"Pretty good. Simple, quick, fun matches."
19205,Nice little free game
19206,"I cannot compare this game to any other real time card game, because this is my first and I haven't played card games much before this except Heartstone (turn based), so these are not comparable. 

Game is fun but can be very frustrating, because it's a card game. You can't choose order of cards, those are randomly chosen at the beginning of the match. Overall this game is fun to kill time for hour or 2."
19207,"Great game keep up the good work :)
I have played similar game like Clash Royale and etc
and i can say Minions Masters is way better"
19208,this thing so good it got me off the zoinkies
19209,very fun to play
19210,awesome addictive time waster
19211,good stratagy game honestly fun with friends and family
19212,"nice game 
"
19213,Love this game. Recommend it to all my buddies. Fun to play and I stream it all the time. Need more friends to play with me  but fun by yourself as well.
19214,Straight ballin
19215,nice game
19216,I'm enjoying this format of game.
19217,Haven't played long but game plays at a decent pace!
19218,Quick and fun not P2W.
19219,"fun game, game is fun"
19220,"Excellent tactical game.  Quite pleasant for a FTP - a purist could complain that there is a pay-to-win aspect but only a relatively thin one - once all the ""cards""/minions are collected once there is no in-game benefit to whales for pushing more money into the system.  There is a pleasant variety of play modes and the team game is particularly exciting.   I dunno if I'll keep playing this daily, but I expect it will be in my favs for a long time."
19221,The game is Nice
19222,it's fun
19223,"I've played it far too long to not say yeah.
Aggro range juggling is big here."
19224,Loving the game so far. Free to play too but of course I want to buy all the extras but can't afford :'(
19225,"Queue times really low 2018 December. Around 5-15 seconds
This game is a bit like Clash Royale turned 90 degrees. 
Anyone who enjoys this game should also try Legion TD"
19226,*clac*noice
19227,Great game.
19228,enjoyable upgraded flash game. very worth for free
19229,I am the beast I worship.
19230,"Seems fun so far. Easy to pick up. Great for team play, and if you team up with a friend, there is a separate ranking system for that, so you don't have to worry about being higher rank than your friend really. I stream this sometimes and its really fun, as it even gives your chat little toons IN GAME. Only gripe I have is that the Premium upgrade and All Masters DLCs seem a bit on the pricey side, but they aren't required anyways. And on a side note, my wife loves the cute graphics and simple (yet complex) gameplay."
19231,This is a really unique and interesting take on the whole card game genre. I do recommend
19232,pretty good if you like clash royal style games and all the masters have good enough abilities to be played and team battle make for some crazy combos
19233,"In this game, everything is built around the donation, no donation, you will not be able to play normally. Bad gameplay, bad soundtrack, bad balance, toxic community. Don't even start playing unless you're ready to give away a few thousand every month.

--------------------------------------

В этой игре все строится вокруг доната, нет доната, ты не сможешь нормально играть. Плохой геймплей, плохой саундтрек, плохой баланс, токсичное комьюнити. Даже не начинайте играть, если не будете готовы ежемесячно отдавать несколько тысяч."
19234,just plain old fun
19235,Pretty decent little game =)
19236,Simply amazing
19237,"Game works great on Linux. It is a fun game where you can quickly level up. It is a cross between League of Legends and Hearthstone. In the beginning, you need to play a couple of bot games to unlock multiplayer and then friend play.

19238,"Not bad but every season new unbalanced cards coming and leaving old cards mostly useless. Everyone was spamming harbinger, after everyone spammed crystal archers and escort, there was a time everyone had dragonball in their deck because it was most broken thing and they nerfed too much afterwards, now it's wolf among us. Dragonball meta was the worst thing in the game, nearly every deck was rush deck.

 But generally speaking game forces you to play around specific cards too much, it's always been like this. If some cards are unbalanced, then all you can do is put them in your deck so you can be even. There was scott meta, prowler meta, upgraded prowler meta... All we can do was put them in our deck too so that we can play.

 2v2 is unbalanced and I don't think they'll fix it any time soon, since problem is with the hero skills. They have to make different hero skills for 2v2 or I don't see anyway they are gonna get fixed. All the hours I put in this game, I learned to counter broken or just let it go when a broken combo is against me.

 I don't really think that game is p2w, far from that actually. I nearly never use legendary cards in any of my deck and I can easily go into Grand Master with some grind. But to understand a cards weakness, best way is using them in your deck so, having every card is always a plus.  Btw, I nearly have all the cards in the game and I never bought anything with real money.

 Other than these factors, game is okay overall, there are not much competitive games that I could really enjoy playing for this long. But after sometime it feels really linear, every season/meta you only see 10-20 cards being played in total. And mostly people just take 2 or 3 of the broken cards and fill the rest of their deck with basic cards.

Edit: I firstly gave it a thumbs up, but I'm fed up with broken metas, they just can't do this, every update it's same. And you can only play 2-3 heroes per update, others just don't work like the cards."
19239,highly addictive. Great gameplay with cute graphics makes this game stand out of others with simillar genre. Great for y'all who love strategy
19240,it's a fun game if you can duo with someone!
19241,its fun
19242,It's more fun then clash royale
19243,I loveit.. I can watch netflix and chill
19244,E PICA O JOGUIN
19245,"Would rather compete in the pain olympics.

Most unbalanced game i've ever played and I've played hearthstone for a long time."
19246,A funny strategic game!
19247,"its fast paced and fun. you might be confused on what to to the first time if youve never played card games but hey! you'll get the hang of it, and most important of all the match making is fast, very fast which is a huge ++, for now at least"
19248,Refreshing gameplay!
19249,A fun little Moba fast and relaxing cant find much to complain so far will add info if things change.
19250,I like puffs
19251,"i can backflip for 8 days straight 
"
19252,"Fun game, stress free."
19253,fast easy Enjoyable game ^_^ awesome tacticks and more fun if you got some friend to play with
19254,"i only played like a few games but its nice fast and colourfull gameplay. 
i did this review due to the games request to do so right away when u reach lvl 10.

hf gl its nice so far."
19255,"The game is simple enough to pick up and fun enough to keep you playing, letting you build your own decks around you masters adds a certain amount of strategy to the game as well. All around I'm enjoying it so far."
19256,"Like clash royale, on a smaller map."
19257,"Yo, this game...is fucking awesome!
It's really simple, addictive, fun, and most importantly practically no queue times.
I've so far had a dozen games or so with the longest queue time being 23 seconds, where most are like less than 5 seconds, the only ""Early Access"" game I actually respect so far."
19258,"Well im not gonna lie the game is really really similar to clash royale, but in my opinion this game is much more fun than clash royale. The games are longer and it has some unique things like heroes ,expeditions, draft, EXP system in game. It's a cool game 8/10 IGN"
19259,"Real-time combat adds some interesting twists to traditional collectible card games.  Nice vibe, well thought out cards, balanced."
19260,"This game is pretty cool, its refreshing"
19261,This game is awsome and free check it out!
19262,"Excellent game, competitive varied, make a lot of friends, frustrate pros (play bad while they play goo hohohoho)"
19263,very addictive
19264,Fun basic game. Could get repetitive after a few days. But overall enjoyable.
19265,Love this game. Not p2w or anything. Play on 3 different systems!
19266,"Awesome game, very addictive!"
19267,nice
19268,Fine game!
19269,"Have Many more hours logged in game on discord launcher under the same ign. I enjoy streaming this game, as there are streamer keys you can give to the community. And hey, I am playing the game anyways, why not mine keys :D . The game is fast paced card game where location, timing, and sheer luck combine for an exciting average range 1.5-5 minute battle. And Unlike many other online battle games after a 2 minute match it is hard to feel too invested or emotional. All around enjoyable game. Could use a bit of balancing and determining what is a combo and what is an exploit. Even if the community as a whole, would frown upon those things, the game would feel a lot more attractive."
19270,its ok
19271,I love this game a little slow at the start but keep at it and you will be rewarded.
19272,this game is so amazing
19273,"More depth than I was expecting, the vast amount of minons to be summoned makes it unique and fun each time."
19274,This game has a good variety of units and its gameplay is well designed.
19275,"Only played till level 10 so far but i am really enjyoing it, good combat, good card art and a very smooth game style. Well worth the play and i can't wait to play more"
19276,So far very fun to play around with 2v2s seem super fun with a friend and would reccomend that if you have a dedicated buddy 1v1 is fun but feels less casual or maybe thats just me being competitive but either way i have a good 1st impression and hopes this game doesnt become P2W or anything like that spread the word!!!
19277,"great game, but does take some farming not alot which is good overall i reccomend it :)"
19278,"I like the game.  It's a more casual RTS version of Hearthstone but probably with more frustration.

I've been playing it for a few months now.  It's easy to get into but RNG is definitely not your friend in this game at all.  Matchmaking is a complete joke. 

[Rant] For weeks on end the majority of players were just spaming Stormbringer (Archer) master and his perk made playing against a duo of him really annoying.  More recently, players just spam high HP targets as their first card so it's hard to combat that at the start of a match if Rngsus hates you.  Things like Living Status, Colossus, and Brutus are downright annoying.  Pair that with with the stun lancers and you're pretty much screwed.  Despite Apep and King Puff being able to make themselves immune to damage via totem / bridge ownership, the spearmen will still stun you though it. Thus rendering you completely useless until you can get units out to kill the spear guys.  It's complete crap.  At this point I feel like the game isn't about strategy and more about who can abuse stupid things that the devs don't seemingly care about.

I played for hours a day and even after getting a ton of season tokens, I never got the legendary cards from the Crystal season via tokens BUT I've gotten 10+ of each of the common / rare cards - Often getting the same card 2-5 times in a row.  This season is really no different.  I bought the battle pass and got a legendary card first go, but everything since then has been common / rare and I've gotten a ton of those now too.

More recently, players are either leaving matches on puporse or disconnecting and instead of being able to continue to play the team battle by yourself, you automatically lose.  I've had it happen to me multiple times when we're literally 20 hp from winning w/ a giant wave actively attacking their base and my teammte DCs and I lose.  There is no way to report players in game.

Minions are also pretty stupid.  They'll be attacking non-priority minions over priority ones, even if they were placed down right next to the priority ones.  If a unit is already out on the field and you place one right by it, the fielded unit will be able to targetthe newly placed unit before the actual animation for placing finishes and it gives an unfair advantage.
[/Rant]

Anyway...

PROS:
Free game
Very Casual
Easy to get cards
Games don't usually last more than 5 min
Free in-game items almost every day via the store

CONS:
Relatively unbalanced
Rubies are overpriced
No player report system in game
Can't play with / against multiple friends
Horrible RNG for obtaining cards via Season and Power tokens
Getting blue shards for some cards can get extremely grindy unless there is an event
Too many currencies (Free token, Season Token, Power Token, Blue Shards, Rubies, Gold)
BS RNG for starting hand cards - At least half my cards were low cost and it started me w/ all of my high cost cards in most my games.

They have some stuff to work out but I would still recommend the game. Play it w/ a friend to help reduce frustration."
19279,"One of the first time I delete a game, played it for 2 hours and at start it's so easy that it's boring, then you get against the ""pay2win"" people with almost always the same op stuff and an abusive utilisation of flying unit that are way too op early destroying any fun you could have

Probably a nice game at high elo but at start it clearly s***

""Well it's free"", until you get mad and pay to win of course"
19280,Great game you should play it
19281,"Highly addicting, enjoyable game!"
19282,"reminds me od clash royale and dota together, its fun :)"
19283,"The game is early access! It will have big balance changes!! If you spend money on some card. After some changes. You will find you have to buy another card to get some compatible deck. 

I lose all my interest in this game after I find I lack 2-3 major legend card in this time. The game can't balance the major cards is rolling. I think the company is trying to ""balance"" all the legend cards in a roll like the weekly heroes to make you have to buy all the legend cards."
19284,Decent game to play on your down time!
19285,"Minions of Masters and Masters of Minions!  True fun every time I logon.  Some paywalls, buy rubies with cash to buy other things, but you can earn rubies also (good luck).  Free Stuff everyday. I don't think it is pay to win, but I also don't see my lack of opening my wallet hurting my enjoyment over almost 200 hours of gametime."
19286,"Battle in this fast-paced hybrid of deckbuilder, MOBA, and tower-defense.

+ Innovative gameplay
+ Free to play
+ Deck building

- Overpowered new cards
"
19287,this is an amazing game and it's free to play i don't know why it didin't pop up in free to play games but when somebody recommended this game i fell in love with this game.
19288,"This is a great take on the formula of game where you send units down a lane towards the enemy. Adding more complex strategy, cards, and team fights makes even more added fun. At a free to play cost, you can't pass this one up!"
19289,y e s
19290,is good
19291,"What started off as a fun free to play game has like so many others been corrupted by greed.

This game was amazing, so much fun to play, you could spend money to get some cards but you didn't have to buy them to win matches. As new cards have been added this has changed and now if you don't spend money then you get destroyed by those who did. I took a break for a couple of weeks, came back today with a deck that won most games and got destroyed in every single match

I would recommend avoiding this unless you are prepared to sink a lot of money into this game."
19292,"fun 
fun"
19293,its interesting for a card game.
19294,great game
19295,not bad
19296,"Fairly straight forward fort-lane game with a good rock-paper-scissors of low value-high speed to high value-high power cards.

So far, pretty good."
19297,Great mix of RTS and card mechanics. One of the best implementations of this blend that I've encountered!
19298,"GREAT GAME!
"
19299,"Good game, but it's too unoptimized that I can no longer play it on my laptop without randomly crashing mid game ever since the changes from 2 years ago. Even people with decent graphics cards are saying how poorly the game is optimized. Doesn't seem like a priority for the small company."
19300,Its like if crack was a computer game
19301,"Fun game but unless you get a ton of shards there will be tons of players that stomp you because they have all the op cards. You can however go very far with mediocre cards, and even beginner cards, if you understand how to play the game properly. Worth game but slightly p2w. 

Also buff Ravager"
19302,"Great game , the best game Ive everd played"
19303,"I've been playing Hearthstone since the beginning, but now this one is taking over... Definately the greatest tower defence game I've played !"
19304,"Have always enjoyed Trading Card game. Minion Masters combines deck building with MOBA/Tower Defense type of gameplay. Currently at Level 10 and enjoying it so far. Curious about how much different strategies can be used due to the deck building. Very accessible, easy to learn but you can tell that there is alot of depth. Highly recommended."
19305,Great casual fun!
19306,"Nice game, not P2W."
19307,"Really good game, usual updates, a discord server, friendly devs, good fun. This is one of those games that I think ""I'll be addicted to this for a day or two, then get bored and move on."" but it really isnt that. This is the kind of game that you can keep coming back to and never get bored of it.

My only complaint WOULD of been that it costs money therefore neglects a lot of possible players, but, turns out it had become F2P which is great! Didn't receive anything but avatars for purchasing the game when it did cost money, but I dont really care about that. Great game, why not try it, it's free afterall."
19308,This game is tooo awesome!!
19309,"Play just fine before the update. After your goddamn update (1GB), the game CRASHING NON-STOP. DEV you just ruin not only your game but also my game (and my teammate game)."
19310,"The game is simple, fast, and satisfying."
19311,"Similiar to Clash Royale, but a very greater game and now its FTP i will gurantee you its not P2W,like many others i bought like a 10.000 rubies at start and now i dont know where to spend it.I appreciate the developers for making such a great game.Lastly if you played any games like Clash Royale you ll like it."
19312,yes
19313,Quick and funny
19314,Easy going and friendly
19315,super fun right off the bat
19316,is original and fun also great commentry :D
19317,Won 5 times in a row. First time I could do legal rape. Pretty gr8.
19318,Its free and has rats that do cool attacks and stuff   10/10 would play again .
19319,fun so far worth trying
19320,"This is a great game. Endless tactics, with hrs of fun. Not pay to win at all. Its actually free to play. You get alot rewards after just 1 day of playing this game. 10/10 IMHO, would recommend this game to any one"
19321,Simple and great the more monsters and cotent they add will only improve this game not downgrade it.
19322,"So far, it's been a pretty enjoyable game. Easy to learn and so far the grind/pay-to-win aspect as been reasonable."
19323,This is a good game for me :D
19324,"This game is a poor knock off of a mobile title called Clash Royal. If you like these kinds of games, look elsewhere. There is no balance with regards to deck building and the matchmaking system is still pretty rough. I played several days and have a high win rate but it doesn't feel right, most matches are one sided so there's hardly a feeling of victory when you win. 

On an aesthetic note, the art style and in game models leave a lot to be desired. 

Overall I'm not a fan and considering they've already invested so many resources into what they have now, I'm not hopeful for the future of this product."
19325,Great fun!
19326,Simple Fast and Fun
19327,Very refreshing game in the strategy world. Keep it up Guys
19328,Reminds me of the WC3 tower defenses from about 15 years ago :P
19329,"A calmer, cleaner version to Clash Royale. Not to say it's a direct copy. This game is quite in fun in it's own right.

It's tutorial captivates you as soon as you start the game with it's spectator and tournament.
General gameplay feels a bit sluggish could be just me though. The animation is great and feels rewarding.

After playing I can certainly say this:
One it contains a certain essence of many familair games: Fortnite, Hearthstone and Clash Royale.

1) There is a Battle Pass System, and the free tiers are pretty okay and give good rewards.

2) There is an Expedition mode where you roam the map (moving your master around a board, point and click) to different monsters which gives you several challenges to complete in battles either single or team battles, which rewards you with might. The amount of might dictates what rank monsters you can accept challenges from. Until you beat the map's bosses in a 1 v 1 duel. This then gives you rewards.

3) Animation/Graphics - This game is beautifully created. I would say it's a side-view of Clash Royale. Or 3D version to Hearthstone. THe way each monster attacks makes you feel as if you're watching a real life battle/war. 

4) Your Master Also Attacks - Depending on your master, they attack or affect the match in different ways. One master globally attacks minions and the other master constantly, some masters actually join the fray!"
19330,Fast learning and addictive. Highly Recommend
19331,Wow the best game ever f    ing awesome keep it up i am hooked.
19332,very rewarding and fast level up
19333,"TLDR

Casual Player ✓

Competitive Player X

The game is starting to try to appeal to more casual players and the devs have always been lackluster in playing the game and their gameplay resulting in half the cards being underpowered/overpowered and like 20% niche cards with a use but keep getting buffed just because they aren't shining in every scenario when they have metas they shine in and certain scenarios. There isn't really any reason to play besides ""fun"" and to see new content. The devs are casual players themselves majority of them none of them being spectacular in gameplay or anything and that's exactly why this game will be boring in the long run if you're starting as a new player. They do not understand and also do not seem to care to add an incentive to keep playing the game. The game will eventually become stale after a bit for most and then that's it. Nothing else to do besides climbing to rank 1 which when you are rank 1 that point is gone and basically all the reason to play the game is gone as well. They are extremely delusional if they think adding glory was the way to keep players playing and the community is basically a mess. An example of devs not caring is someone who plays enough and has high enough win % to be like at least 8k points above most GMs and yet the devs do not care in the slightest to add a points display to make it easier to see who is where and to display points which would be helpful in knowing how far people are above/below you. As well as just displaying the huge difference in points rather than a slight number change. They also seem to think it's fine to make GM to be so easily reachable that you can get to GM with a negative win ratio and even though a solution has been talked about for the 250+ GMs this season they just want to slightly make it harder which is not even comparable to 8k points on top of GM and yet no new rank or rewards or any incentive of that sort but a slight number change in leaderboard rank. They also make poor choices like deciding to nerf a card based on a meta that I spread in 2 days due to > them taking a vacation. < Like really? Their own mistake for timing it poorly when they take a vacation and then listen to a bunch of casual players on balance.. The funny part is they hit it with a double nerf to ensure the card goes from popular to unusable by most. There's a lot of things wrong with the game but if you do happen to play and enjoy it then not really a reason to stop playing if you enjoy it. If you don't enjoy actively playing then you probably should quit unless you're a casual player due to the devs being alien to anything but casual players nowadays so it seems. The community is a whole other story. The vast amount of people that are core in the community are either very ironic or very delusional. They also seem to make random poor decisions that no one really asked for but casual players such as the UI rework which the theme still looks very ugly to me. And recently some change with the pings which messed up alt tabbing which is now reverted but apparently with the way they worded it did not seem like a bug to me. They even changed a mechanic of Morgrul one time because casual players got too confused about an interaction somehow lol. A card named Demon Warrior also got reworked due to community outcry even though the card was weak in 1vs1 vs any deck with aggro after the arena change and was only OP in 2vs2 if supported correctly and played correctly by two decent players. You're probably thinking sure they reworked a card that was oppressive if played correctly and in the right scenarios but the issue is what came after. They reworked the card and made it so horrid it basically doesn't exist in the game anymore since it's so weak tier wise. Most of the tournaments are also a joke from extremely ironic to sabotaging staff to poor performing and generally not that great ""tournament players"" constantly boasting about how good they are and how flawless their gameplay is for playing in a tournament with no wildcards rule and that's it. Their play isn't that spectacular and some of them definitely do make a lot of mistakes but would in the past try to make you believe tournaments were special or something to look forward to when they really aren't. There were some and still are some pretty decent tournament players but there are also lackluster ones so would suggest you not fall for the tournament hype other than it being different due to no wildcards rule in a specific tournament. There are some ""veteran"" players that play 1 hour a week and the devs are more willing to listen to input from players like that than players who are actively playing their game that are grinding ladder to get an extremely vast amount of points that are almost worlds apart from GM rank 3 and below currently. It is grind but you also require a pretty high win ratio and decently timed games to be effective if for example the rank 2 GM is trying just as hard to get rank 1. It gets to the point of 40 points per win and 120 points per loss even vs 98% of GMs due to the vast points difference which is fine. The issue is there is basically no incentive to get rank 1 besides a number change on the leaderboard and how they can't even code it properly for past leaderboards to show up beyond 12 months. The one thing they done well recently was just adding new cards in general with each season of a battle pass. There was a time when the game lacked updates on PC completely many months ago which is now changed. The game is not really P2W but do remember it's a card game so when you start out you're going to have to collect cards to use most combinations but you can definitely get by vs top players with a less unique deck if you're good enough. You simply just spin tokens with ingame currency to get cards and if you play a bit you'll basically have most cards but legendary cards and most legendary cards are either niche or unviable but some of them being pretty decent like Xiao. You'll mostly only be lacking in combinations like Xiao x2 x3 as a new player which is usually for 2vs2 decks and not always ran but you can run it and is strong in certain decks. Setting aside the community, devs, dev decisions and so on the game itself isn't that bad for what it is. You can definitely have fun with this game if it fits your style of game. Although I would say the moment you stop having ""fun"" then it's probably time to quit or come back in like 6 months and then quit again."
19334,good game that is for free while you watch NBA TV
19335,+
19336,great game to pass the time
19337,"If you like Clash Royale and Hearthstone, don't hesitate.  This game is those two combined.  It has the diversity in cards like Hearthstone but plays like Clash Royale.  It is a great game and probably the most fun I have had in a long time with a card game.  Grab it today.  You won't regret it."
19338,"A fun game that is deeper then it first appears, given that it is early access it should only keep improving."
19339,gg
19340,Amazing gameplay!
19341,leiwand
19342,good game but crash alot
19343,Quite a nice deck game
19344,its cool
19345,Awesome strategy game enjoy playing it with friends
19346,awsome animation and design addicted already ! it's not pay to win ... save your sapphires spend wisely dou
19347,"fun ass game, free to play as well"
19348,good simple strategy and best part is you feel equal with other players pure choices basically you cant make cards stronger or weaker all Cards have a spefic power defense or use that cant be changed  making it feel fair while playing u dont rely on luck or anything and loot and findings are  fine  nothing   bad so far
19349,"Fun interactive game with alot of strategy and is fun for the whole family.
"
19350,"Match making is pretty fast, within seconds actually. It has a nice experience level progression in game and it makes you think of strategy during battle. I like it."
19351,love the zero delay matchmaking
19352,It's Clash Royale.
19353,So far so good easy to play and have fun at.
19354,Cant afford the best cards so you lose. Go next.
19355,nice graphics
19356,"good game, lots of strategy, low time matches, and overall fun."
19357,for a free tower game it's surprisingly fresh and adaptive with it's abilities. I also like the idea of defending the tower with a champion :)
19358,"If you play games like clash royale, or similar tug of war type games, this game is definitely a good pick. There is a slew of challenges, cards, champions, etc. that could be explored in this game. This game is luckily not just pay-to-win like most of it's kind. The moment you receive a card, you have it's full power. No additional upgrades are necessary, unless you just want to brag about how many times you have used it. The game mechanics is a nice mix of fighting for objectives or rushing your opponent so that the slow build up doesn't matter. Overall, it's a fun game and It has yet to give me any performance issues."
19359,"Great refinement of a genre I thought was played out already, but clearly isn't. Highly recommended."
19360,cool spin battle game
19361,Its a lovely fast paced competitive game that has a good strategic feel about it. Also runs smoothly.
19362,"[h1]Great game[/h1]
I read the negative reviews and I totally disagree!!!

- Developers have introduced [i]card levels[/i] but these [i]don't enhance the card.[/i]
Card levels only gives you glory to get more experience to advance in the battle pass.

- I've never been disconnected from a game, [i]nice servers[/i] and no lag issue.

- [i]Graphics are stunning[/i], beautiful and full of details.

- Rock, paper, scissors? Not so easy, [i]you have to use your brain[/i] much more.

- I did not get bored because you can create a new deck in 30 seconds and try 
[i]endless combinations[/i] of cards+masters to look for combos that work well.
[b]I love this game[/b] and I can't stop playing!



[u]To developers[/u]:
PLEASE RELEASE THIS GAME FOR iOS/ANDROID, it seems born to be played with finger on tablet."
19363,Много готина игра... от нея брат ми затъпя и сега яде кашкавала с найлона...
19364,Very fun game and also very relaxing even though it is competitive. Its very rare that you get those 2 combined
19365,I see this game becoming very popular. This game is a free hang out game to play with friends. Minion Masters also provides an amazing strategy game experience. But why is there so much strategy well the game gives you cards to use in decks which make it tricky which cards to use. Also you want to have a good understanding of which cards to place in a match. Great game.
19366,love it
19367,Enjoyable time killer.
19368,i like the voice
19369,"good game
"
19370,havent played long but this is amzing especially duo play. The amount of tactics is crazy fun and very good for twitch and streamer interaction.
19371,its fun
19372,Nice pvp platform. I like the concept of battle.
19373,Fun and easy game when you are bored with other ones.
19374,GOOD GAMEPLAY . I like the graphics  9/10
19375,awsome game play with friends recommend to everybody
19376,Pretty nice and entertaining game. :)
19377,"Game is pretty good so far, little time waster when im bored, enjoying it so far, I like the team battles, gets intense sometimes !"
19378,"Fun game :) just started playing, will post a more informative review later on down the line. Worth checking out at no cost!"
19379,"Minion Masters has microtransactions and looks and feels like a mobile game.
The art is cartoony, but not as bad as the usual type of games like this.
This game targets boys aged 10-15.
It is a multiplayer game for the most part- matching is usually fine although you will hit a plateau and get beat down to your real ranking.
Why not have more card slots/bigger decks, what's the use of collecting so many cards?
Very addicting although I will admit once I got tired after 10 hours."
19380,"Suprisingly fun!
Yay minion masters!
Play the minions la la lala, smashy smashy, oh he killed me, now i rage quit, do do do do, he he ho ho"
19381,"Awesome game! Didn't seem like it would have much strategy in it, but it's actually pretty decent and interesting enough to keep you in."
19382,Very nice!
19383,good
19384,"The core mechanics of this game are really enjoyable. The deckbuilding is simple to understand but also has a lot of versatility in order for players to make unique decks and playstyles. 

The matches are not long and drawn out, and the game is quick and easy to learn. Fun for casual gamers and the hardcore competitive players as well."
19385,fun!!!
19386,It's nice. Even if it screams mobile game.
19387,make game more interest with iconic cards please
19388,gud game
19389,holy fucking shit what a good fuckming game wowowoow good game lol whataaaa good game
19390,britty gud
19391,its cool game blyat
19392,super awesome
19393,"I am very picky when it comes to multiplayer gamers but i enjoy certain elements of some and this one brings a lot of them together. 

1. Reminds me of Nexus Wars on Starcraft 2
2. Reminds me of Hearthstone Deck building
3. Reminds me of League of Legends Laning

Beyond that it has a pretty rapid loot system.
I have ranked very well 24 hours of gampley and have not paid a dime, as to say its not pay to play its more how you react to the enemy is how you win.

Recommed if you want to relax and just use the mouse as well."
19394,My first impressions are optomistic! I like the easy pick up and it's fast paced style.
19395,"I just started this game $0 given, love it to pieces, can't stop, very competitive online, I have been lucky so far, bridges are the key."
19396,Irerekomenda ko ito sa aking mga kaibigan
19397,My kinda game
19398,This a great casual game I can play with my son! Thanks for the exciting game play!
19399,Quick but strategic matches.  Good fun.
19400,"I really like this game. I was looking for a game to fill the void when I was too frustrated with Dead Cells and CS:GO to continue playing, and this game is great. Really simple, yet makes you feel like a genius for accumulating a huge wave of minions and pushing the enemy base. Would recommend."
19401,"Very cool game, smooth gameplay and really nice art designs / instant matchmaking <3"
19402,really fun game
19403,Just started its fun so far.
19404,"hello maker of miniom master your game is fun and new to me.i thought it was going to be bad but its atually kinda good.
(PS sorry for any mispells"
19405,Great game should try it
19406,"With each new expansion there will be OP meta cards that create insane combos with the existing ones, Be prepared to get rolled over by them or the other option is to spend money to unlock battlepass and buy battlepass exp so you can get them and roll other people over too."
19407,"fast games,good performance,casual,low time queue"
19408,this game is awesome :)
19409,Its an okay game.
19410,Fun but is encouraging gambling in children
19411,Unique
19412,"Amazing game!
"
19413,If you want a free game that has a lot to do at least at first try this one. If they keep adding to it as they have it will be a great for some time to come. Fast past paced at first but whe nyou get into the timing and the differences in the units has much to offer.
19414,good
19415,very nice
19416,"A very nice game, well done !!"
19417,AWESOME
19418,"This game is drugs. Simple, honest and short review"
19419,I enjoy this game!
19420,"A surprising little game which I really enjoyed, enjoyable as coop or single player, a good mix of decks and tactical fighting."
19421,is fun
19422,This game is actually pretty dope. I was watching a friend on twitch play and it seemed simple yet complex. Its free to play and so far I have had a lot of fun. Not really sure how grindy it might be in the long term or what the full benfits of buying into the game will be. However this very much feels like a tower defence from the days of warcaft 3 battle net. I think anyone from my era that grew up with tower defence games can appricate a game like this. Single and duo play makes it more enganging in terms of beging able to play/stream with friends. If they plan to add a full team fighting aspect this could be really dynamic. For the moment this game is a easy game to play well doing other stuff or If I wanted I could likely stream and enjoy. Reccomend for now.
19423,"it's fun to enjoy. simple gameplay, easy to play hard to master i guess"
19424,"Gotta give it a thumbs down because despite what you may hear, it's as pay to win as any Collectible Card Game.  Sure.  It requires a little skill.  And you may be able to grind past the pay to win factor.  But at the end of the day, it's the same old meta you will find in any collectible based game.  Very limited meta at the upper tier.  You can get by for an hour or two with the 'base game' until you run into the first person that dropped ten bucks, and get completely steam rolled.  That's literally how the game is.  Your first hour gives you the illusion that it isn't pay to win, and you can progress with a reasonable investment of money and time, but then you break through the 'Stone' bracket and start running into people who have dumped 40-50 bucks (or more) on their account and no amount of strategy or deck synergy is going to let you overcome the power gap.  It was sold to me as something that wasn't overly pay to win, and more skill based than wallet based.  And thats why it gets a thumbs down.  And I mean seriously.  Any game that is in Early Access and has a cash shop with items over 50 bucks I am pretty suspect on.  It is a fun game for the first hour or so.  But give spending any serious money on it a pass and pick up one of the triple A titles on sale this season."
19425,"strait forward and fast paced, can turn in a heartbeat."
19426,It's like eating eating a twinkie that is inexplicable possessed by the god of war
19427,Awesome game!
19428,"I played the game enough to get to gold, in team battle and in solo ranked. 
I can honestly say that this game is so far unbalanced in MM and  cards it is not even funny. Oh on top of that its P2W, if you say differently you are lying to yourself. You can pay to get superior strong cards that .... yeah you can hope to get at some point. But if you don't get it by the end of season, sorry you are S.o.L (if its a season card, if it isn't then it is even harder to get)..... As with this devs other games, S**t MM, $#it balancing, and piss poor mods. Feel free to play since its free, but dont put money into it when other people are even further ahead of you in cards and you have no chance to catch up. Unless you want to spend hundreds of $$$."
19429,Better Clash Royale :D
19430,Fast and intense matches with an interesting real-time card deck battle system. 8/10
19431,Games Funtastic has a different taste reminds me of Demon King Box a Little just have to wait when the right time to summon the minoions to do some mayham its fun and paitence is  key. IDK if anyone would be interested in this game but its worth the try if your curious
19432,"Perfect game to pass your time, you can enjoy the game without spending money so that's a +. 
The graphic are pretty decent and the gameplay is simply amazing. 

You play your card deck on a field to destroy the other person base / tower. They give you rewards pretty often so you can upgrade your deck without spending money. 

For a f2p, i respect where this game is going."
19433,Nice game to have fun!
19434,ez pay to win
19435,Minions
19436,"It's fun, easy to learn, and pretty rad."
19437,"Very nice and entertaining game! The variety of masters and cards makes it very refreshing and playable. Good game modes and season events(Every certain time there's a themed update with new cards to unlock), nice progression( you don't need to pay to get all the cards of the game, in roughly one or two months you can get nearly all the cards and start playing the decks you want) and there is no need to spend money upgrading cards because they don't follow a level sistem.
Very pleasant design and sounds, lots of fun(The ragdoll mechanics got me on the floor laughing sometimes) and smooth gameplay. In my opinon it makes a sweet secondary game to play after you get tired of playing your main thing and you need to cooldown from your farming, long ranked matches or adventures. Absolutely recomended if you enjoy this kind of game or you want to get started at them."
19438,"So, I've been torn on what to rate this game. It is a well made f2p in the sense that you get lots of rewards and cards without shopping and you never feel blamed or guilted into shopping. 
The main problem with the game is that it's skill floor and ceiling are basically inexistent. After you learn the first 2/3 gimmick what you can personally bring to the table is done, so the whole experience boils down to having better cards. I praise the developers for making a good f2p game which is rare nowadays but the  game itself is not that much fun. Once you've played for 5h you start to realize that how you play doesn't matter, and it stops to feel good when you win and you just can't do much if the enemy has a better card than you, there's very little room to outskill someone unless you have both really good cards.
It's a fun game but it's not a good competitive game, if you're looking for a fun and rewarding game this may be for you"
19439,there are so many card games out there but this one stands out from the rest i mean card game and a tower defense game whats not to like you know!
19440,Fun tug of war style game. with unit counters and spells just like any good rts. if you have ever enjoyed nexus wars or desert strike from the starcraft 2 arcade you can probly get some enjoyment out of this.
19441,"when u reach silver, u cant win single game if u dont have good cards, most unbalanced piece of crap i ever played"
19442,lots to do!
19443,"Hate it cause I'm noob
Love it cause it's fun

Try it, then you'll know how good it is"
19444,I don't get it.  How is this fun?  I'm not seeing the advanced strategy here.  This feels like the kind of game you'd play on your phone.  The description of this game is rather misleading.
19445,Easy to learn but hard to master like hearthstone combined with MOBA.
19446,great game.just like clash royal but better
19447,Good game for chilling
19448,"Pretty fun. It has a ""Clash Royale"" vibe, but with more character and seriousness behind it (kinda). 

Can see myself playing this for hours coming up with fun deck types."
19449,best game EVA
19450,"Overall I think this is a really good and even with the small amount of hours I have on it it has to be a favourite of mine personally, although I personally also uninstalled it too!

Pros:
-Free!(Everybody loves free stuff)
-Unlike say League of Legends and Dota 2 it's all on yourself if you downgrade on a rank
-Games are way shorter compared to League and Dota 2
-You can put a lot of investment in increasing your rank, collecting cards, collecting all masters, and arena themes etc.

Cons:
-If you rages easily like in League of Legends or Dota 2 I wouldn't recommend it to you because it has an addicting rank system to see how good you are!
-The amount of time you put in to it can be a con I'm just gonna assume some cards are better than others to beat people in this game so you can either grind hours into it and at times lose games because a player's cards are better than yours your actually spend real money in getting gem stuff to buy your way into it!"
19451,nice and fun game
19452,WEll played
19453,The Best!
19454,I like how the pace of battle is i just would enjoy more variety of cards.
19455,Really good fun :D Easy to play and very well balanced too and seems fair when playing other teams
19456,Bugallygodlike
19457,"Nice game , nice graphics :)"
19458,"Quick games, simple UI, not super cluttered despite how the game works (flooding the field with minions) very fun so far, worth the price of absolutely free."
19459,Such a fun game :)
19460,"I wish I could write a better review for the game. 

Gameplay: Excellent. The graphics and well done, not distracting and dont feel repetative. 

In-Game Pruchase: Steering in the most blatant way to make in game purchase ... really bad. If it was just that without buying extras you can play but not advance as quickly or lose more games. This game becomes either unplayable or uninteresting quickly without making purchases. I kept thinking slot machine every time I play now. It actually turned me off from in game purchase. But it can be fixed. 

Hope this improves as the gameplay/graphics are really fun.

"
19461,"I tried the Valve game ""Artifact"" I directly asked for a refund and unrecomended the game. 

I tried Minion Master and I loved it after 5 minute of gameplay. 

How a F2P game like this one can be less of a Pay 2 Win that a game you have to buy like Artifact ? 

Here everything feels natural, the game is rewarding, several game mode, shit load of customisation, and most importantly, the devs dont take you for a Milk cow. You wanna keep your wallet in your pocket ? Fine, you can still get buckets of new cards. 

Tried it out !"
19462,The Game really nice :D
19463,"Don't read most usefull reviews here.

Fan boys that wasted money in day one to have all cards or people that played for like 5 hours.

Game is fun, but it's P2W, so If you willingly want to spent money for dying game that been in Early Access for past 2 years: It's good choice.

Imagine Hearthstone, but it's different genre."
19464,"As you've probably seen in the videos above, the game can be summed up as a 3D PC spin-off of Clash Royale. The game is extremely easy to pick up and play. The develepors have described it as easy to play but hard to master, and that is very true. There are a lot of subtle nuances to how each card plays and you can only figure them out by playing more and more.

[h1]The Mechanics:[/h1]
You have a deck of 10 cards that you can customize outside of a match (just like in other TCGs). When a match starts, your deck is shuffled and the top 4 cards are dealt to you. When you play a card, it goes to the bottom of your deck and is automatically replenished by the top card. Apart from just seeing the 4 cards in your hand, you are also able to see the next card you will draw. Thus, you have some control over crafting the state of your hand and making combos happen more than once in a match.

You can get new cards by using power tokens in a roulette-style gambling system. Power tokens must be bought using either gold or rubies. The only other way to get cards is via single card offers that change on a day-to-day basis (usually cost rubies but occasionally some high gold cost offers do come up). For example, 1 random legendary for 16000 gold. So, make sure to save up some gold for those offers once you have a sizeable collection. 

Along with your deck, you also get to pair a Master with it that represents your life points in the game (always starts with 3000). Each of these masters has 3 perks (abilities) that are either active (card(s) added to your deck) or passive, and are unlocked during the match when you maintain control of the two bridges in the middle of the arena. There are 9 masters as of this review (12-20-2018), and one more might be added by the end of the month. You can acquire masters by spending either blue shards (earned in-game at a steady pace) or red rubies (must pay $$$ to get enough).

[h1]Lots of game modes and events:[/h1]
In the beginning, you have to get through a short tutorial before you gain full control of the game itself. By level 9 (i think), you unlock most of the game modes: draft, mayhem and expeditions, along with the basic battle and team battle modes. Pairing up with another player is extremely easy; it only requires you to be steam friends with the other player.

The devs always have something new going on in terms of events. The events usually have 3 different houses, each of which has 15 keys associated with them. If you collect all 15 keys for a house, you get a legendary card. Keys can be earned by winning prize fights, which is just randomly determined at the start of a match, and by using streamer keys (watch out for those in the global chat!).

[h1]Pay to Win?[/h1] [b]I don't think so.[/b]
I got to Master league without paying anything with quite a few supreme rares and a couple legendary cards. I played so much last month that I got upto level 75 in the battle pass with only two season gold stars. I had earned 1000 rubies just by way of in-game rewards then finally coughed up 5 bucks to get 200 more rubies to purchase the battle pass. I got so many rewards at once (33 season tokens lol), it was beautiful. This is one of the most balanced free-to-play models i've seen in a while. If you like card games like Magic: The Gathering and Tower defense, definitely check this one out."
19465,Very cool game !
19466,I was waiting so mutch time for sutch an game like this!!! Thank you Beta Dwarf!!!!!!!

19469,"Just another whale hunting game disguised as FTP. You need to spend money to compete and break rank gold, else you get left behind. Grinding rewards pathetic pittances for hours and hours."
19470,Really fun and addictive I like it
19471,A fantastic little rts with intensity that is greater than its size.
19472,"this game had potential until the developers got money hungry!
everytime they add new cards they are overpowered compared to the current balance. the reason they do so is to make people spend money on getting the overpowered cards quick to rank up.
this game sold its soul and is now completely unbalanced.

for the record ive been on leaderboard on this game, so im not just  some mad noob"
19473,Haven't been that much entertained for a long time. Great game!
19474,Сool game
19475,Amazing game
19476,"I cannot recommend this game. When a new season comes out, the new cards are overpowered to the point that you simply cannot compete without spending money on getting the new season cards - it takes hours upon hours to earn them yourself, so every new update when you're supposed to be happy for new content, you instead get fucked over by players willing to fork over cash or have gotten luckier than you with the new cards. The newest update includes Werewolves and Bats that God knows dominate every single game. Now I know this is the case in some games like Hearthstone too, but in there the cards themselves aren't OP, it's the combos that are. And those combos usually require a great deal of investment to either acquire or pull off. In this, every Tom Derp and Harry buys a werewolf and just runs over you in the midgame. It's really just gotten boring, every single game without question since the update has been like this. And in 2v2, either your guy pulls the card first or theirs does and gg.

Edit: 
@BaboonLord

This is a really simple math issue. If you take the Bats, Bats, Bats card for instance and compare it to what I would consider to be one of the most straight forward cards in the game, the Warrior, let's compare the stats of 3 bats to 1 warrior (mana equivalence).

Bats:
Double the movespeed
Flying (so don't care about melee attackers nor the river), so effectively multiplies the movespeed yet further since they don't follow pathing. 
DPS = 33% more
Health = roughly a third of the warrior (with 3 bats, and total hp)

On paper you'd think the less HP of the bats make them fair, but the problem is there is 1) severability of HP. If you lose the Warrior, she's gone. If you lose a bat, you've still got X left. 2) they're flying, they ignore pathing, they have a smaller aggro range and they are **** fast. In practice they are better to include over the warrior against nearly all lineups.

The bats are annoying, but that I can deal with- the Werewolf is what got me to write the review (and is single handedly the reason I won't play again)

Werewolf (as compared to Warrior - [b]BOTH ARE 3 MANA????[/b]:
60% faster movespeed
Double Damage (not through attack damage, but attack SPEED- so you never have to worry about overkill on smaller critters like the Cleaver; it'll just clean the entire fckng board)
Oh but it has less HP right? Nope. It has 15% more at 400hp over 350 of the warrior.

But wait, there's more- because you get werewolves through lycanthropy. So not only do you NOT have to COMMIT the unit YOUR side of the river- you can just cast it whenever you feel comfortable to do it. So if you're already running over the enemy line, cool, commit it. If you're not and they just countered your X with their Y, leave it for later. No biggy.

[b]It is better than previous cards in every single way.[/b]

So, what would I recommend you do in the future? 

A) Don't overpower your own content and then patch it out and say ""woopsie guys we balanced our new $$$$ sorry for them being so overpowered that wasnt intentional at all."" 

B) Be more creative with DLC. Think of clever playstyles that may be more risky but carry greater reward. Think of the playSTYLE and not of the stats or 'wow' factor of playing the new card. It's well and good to try use fireworks to incentivise people buying the new stuff, but it's a [b]very[/b] shortsighted approach. This is the kind of thing that essentially led to the popular-vote downfall of studios like Hi-Rez. People just don't trust them anymore with competitive titles and their whole eSports approach fell flat on its face compared to what it COULDVE been had they played the long game instead. Make good content and people will buy it regardless of the cost.

An example of the latter would be, keep the werewolf the way it is, but instead you have to commit it your side of the river, and the 'host"" minion can't die, else you lose the werewolf. Reduce its cost to 2. Include another card with cost of 2, ""Full Moon"" or whatever. This gives the ""host"" minion Frenzy for a second or two and then launches the werewolf. This is literally my absolute ""top of my head, I'm procrastinating working from home"" idea and I promise you it will not only be more fun to play, but it will be more rewarding and more balanced. Yet easier way to balance it: mana cost 5."
19477,Great game that offers a variety of modes :) takes a while to learn but with the twitch support its getting this has potential :)
19478,"This game is simply awesome and it's fun.

Edit:At higher rank it becomes unbalanced, you finish either with 0 life and they with max health, or vice-versa. Some of the cards are simply over powered and most of the people who swipe have them. Balance is almost non existent, unless you swipe also or play the annoying matches so you can buy your ""better cards"".
•If you want to view it as a competitive match, don't. It feels like one of those mmos that you need to swipe so you can enjoy the pvp aspect of the game.
•You want to have fun, sure just swipe and buy the meta broken deck and you will win every time. You will have your funn till you get bored of it.
•You want to have some real challenge? The money you pay won't count as power, that only skill counts as it should be in a competitive game, then this isn't that type of game."
19479,one of a kind. Superb addicting gameplay. Fair free 2 play philosophy.
19480,i like it
19481,"If I give you the GLHF sign, and you reply with a mean emoji we are rivals.

I am the swarm master! bwahaha! my low level 2 star monster is basic yes , but they will be cast out as your men prepare to shoot, or right after there swords slash my swarms will pop up! I have invested 10 dollers into this game....and no reason to lie  I won the first 12 games in a row, even came across some scary looking legendary cards! but i beat them with strategy, i dont believe this is a pay to win, its a pay to get more, lets be honest, no matter how much someone pays i will be a strong foe, because you cant pay for skill, and as i have said without paying i have some strong cards, and use the basics to the fullest! I will be.....the very best, the best there ever waaaaas, growin my deck to use it for my caaaause, minion master!"
19482,Fun!
19483,"Meh, all the time the same things are being played. Too repetetive because the meta is the same all of the time. A lot of copy pasta decks from the top of the ladder (uses one himself)"
19484,"simply pay to win.

1. pay for the right cards (or grind for weeks/months)
2. crush your opponent from the very first wave with the right legendary card, he can't ever catch up
3. win in 90 seconds (if you're slow)

just don't. you'll end up paying a lot to keep up with incredibly overpowered legendary/supreme decks.. for nothing

it's a more cancerous version of hearthstone / artifact / etc because here the imbalance is so extreme that you literally destroy your opponents from the first second if you pay enough and even winning feels horrible (to me) because once you have a deck with immense burst at the start, you just do the same thing for 60-90 seconds each game over and over"
19485,"This game is crack.  It is perfectly designed to make even the most average gamer feel, that with practice, they could be a pro.  Achievements give something for which to aim, as do tiers, coin shards and rubys.  It is fast paced (average battle 3min), so rarely does anyone throw their toys out the pram and quit mid fight.  

This is the best game I have played in years - fun, challenging, skillful.  There are in game transactions, but only if you want them, everything is accessible with time, luck and skill.  I am fairly sure you will see this game played in arena, viewed by thousands of people in the coming years, which no doubt is the developer's intention - I cannot recommend highly enough!"
19486,ive only recently got this game and its amazingly addictive! although sometime i get disconnected before a match starts but its AWESOME!

19489,"First of all, the game is kinka enjoyable.. At first.

What are the problems?

► You need to spend half of your life on the game if you wanted to build a deck for your gamestyle. Since the currency for buying a card of your choice is as rare as a white crow.
► Battlepass. It is a negative by itself.
► Why can spells damage the masters? How this idea was born?
► The AI of the minions is horrible. They attack everything but the target you want. Even if you put them just next to the target, they just simply wander off, not caring about the enemy next to them.
► It is a pleasure to see when you start a draft in a season which ends before you finished your draft. In that case, your old draft build will be total useless against the new draft ones with the super cool new season cards which you defnintely do not have in your old draft deck. At least reset the deck when it happens and let the players put together a deck with actual cards.
► I don't get how the masters can be called balanced. The 4 armed monster has one passive only and 2 one time use summon which can be defeated without any problem. I beleive it can be used for rushes but they are one time use still.
► The scrat master's targeted gattling gun shooting skill usually get stuck and don't even shoot a single bullet at the target.
► Acquiring more of the same card makes no sense if you don't pay for this application. And rolling the random card-automat most likely will give you a copy of one of your cards. At least let us destroy the copies for those blue currency, like in any other normal card games.
► The randomness in this game is legendary. You can win or lose a game less than 30 seconds. Like.. Seriously..? Award winning for the biggest joke of the year.
► Spending money on the game is definitely not just cosmetic stuff. Which is unacceptable for a free to play game."
19490,"Played it for a couple hours and it's a really nice experience so far.

If anyone is having problems with crashes:
1) Right click on the game in your Games library
2) Properties -> (General) Set launch options
3) Put "" -force-d3d9 "" in the field, without the """""
19491,"Disclaimer: My perspective is centered on Diamond+ (currently D3) team battles so take it with a grain of salt, I guess.

This update has just skewed the game completely into a cheese fest. 

How? It's centered around that ""Bats Bats Bats"" card and dropping either Commander Azali or the 8 Mana Ram+Cleaver. It's completely dominating Diamond+ team battle scene.

It just does not feel good right now to feel shoehorned completely into a cheese strat. My buddy and I have not lost a single game to those running the older, more conventional decks. We drop the cheese and you just sit there and watch the opponent unable to do anything AT ALL.

The other part of the problem? It's extremely expensive and luck based. It's incredibly strong if you have Legendaries to back it up, such as Commander Azali, Xiao Long's to counter spells, and the new Season legendary, Bahra the Witchwolf.

Don't even get me started on that guy. Not only does he root every single ground unit when you first drop him, but I've used him to solo Brutus and several other minions nearby. He can hit the ground and sky units at the same time and move his laserbeam around to the next unit if it kills someone. 

My personal strat is to use him, the new Grasping Thorns card, and the Snake Druid to stop enemy pushes dead in the water. This combo punches WAY above its weight class in stopping power or equivalent mana exchange. I haven't run into too many people doing this, but I'm putting my strat out there. My buddy will just follow up and drop a Commander Azali with the Bats card and now they're dead. Boom, easy climb. Unless we get out cheesed! lol

Other strats I've seen rely on black holes and Xiao longs because your knee jerk reaction is to pop spells. But if you drop the combo right, there's just too many minions hitting your base to effectively do anything. Pop a spell and you'll die to dragons or whatever follow up they've got. If they've got a Bahra, rest assured he'll just clap whatever you drop in a last ditch effort to save yourself.

All good right? I'm winning the majority of my games! Nope. I can't help but sit here and just feel absolutely horrible for my opponents. Can't imagine how much it sucks to lose repeatedly to this cheese. I'm just thinking that if I didn't get lucky with my draws (as well as my buddy), I'd be writing a review from the other end of the table.

This isn't really a skill battle that feels rewarding.

You ever play certain Mayhem setups, get completely creamed by the good players that know the perfect deck strats to just sail to easy victories on the mode, and  pray they win fast enough and get out so you can have a fighting chance? That's what the normal play feels like right now. There is no hope for ""Well, maybe these guys will finally be out"" on the main ranked ladder. You're either in or your out.

Honestly, this is such a painful review to write because I love what the devs have done with the game...until this update (I'm also annoyed because Steam didn't let me copy/paste my original text, but I digress). I'm going to try hard not to get all doom and gloom here, but I cannot help but feel that the longevity of the game is threatened if things remain as they are. Hell, I wouldn't even mind if that ""Bats! Bats! Bats!"" card got completely removed. That would solve the main problem right there!

I really don't think players will continue to play once it really starts to catch on that you're now shoehorned into one archetype to win your games (again, this is team battles. I don't know if it is the same in 1v1s). Perhaps you will read this and believe I'm being melodramatic. That's a fair judgment for you to make, and I'll leave you to that. But, at the very least, I'd appreciate it if the devs took a deeper look into what exactly these cards are allowing people to pull off. 

In the current state, however, I cannot recommend the game in good conscience. Not if you're looking to play with a buddy and get into the higher ranks (unless you get lucky with some decent legendaries). My buddy and I probably won't be playing as much until some things change. This just isn't very fun.

"
19492,The games are quick and you just suck at it! ;)
19493,"It's taken all the best parts of games like it, and made a really decent game! Definitely worth adding to your collection! Very addictive."
19494,It's fun but after a couple hours it got kind of monotonous and you realize it's very grindy unless you pay up to get new cards to tool around with. Using the same deck constantly gets old
19495,"Only 50 mins in and I like it. For a pay to win game it's pretty good. It is very similar to clash royale, except it has a very different artstyle and some very different strategies involved. So far I would definitely recommend it as something to play for a few hours every so often."
19496,ok so beta dward does NOT have an option on there website where I can contact support. and I keep running into freaking losers who suck so bad at the game that they have to cheat. like mods and glitches and shit.   and ive written the names  of like over 35 people who I cought cheating. so i need support to get ahold of me
19497,"so this is basically a RTS magic the gathering game. and dont let early access fool you its complete enough to enjoy fully as it is but ive already been pleased with the devs update frequency and content . Anyways,  the most important thing is this game is fun really fun and you dont have to buy anything. though i enjoyed it so much that i decided to support the devs and purchase an account upgarde pack that gives me some extra deck slots and a gold boost. the game play is fast and tactical and is literally summoning creatures that have a preset AI to go out on a two lane battlefield and defend your caster while simultaniously trying to attack your opponents castpor. the matches last for about 2-7 minutes and theres alot of good combo building and deck constructing elements, and it really tempts you to play ""just one more game"" after each match ends. there is a pay element if you want to buy their premium currency but the only thing you can buy with it that you cant get for free is most (not all) of the skins. they really give alot of free stuff starting out and daily (including that premium currency) and i dont think youd ever need to buy anything if you didnt want to and you would still be able to build  several very good decks without having to grind ridiculous hours.  its also got a neat multiplayer team mode that lets you play along with someone else vs another team and its alot of fun to get matched with random people and be able to cordinate with no communication. i really recomend it and think i will be playing it for quite a while.

its free!!
feels balanced so far and devs seem active and post regular updates and free expansion content.
Its really, truly fun with a nice techno fantasy sort of theme (think masters of the universe or maybe thundar the barbarian)
game play is intuitive and you can pick it right up without much tutorial 
game play is quick and match making is good so its easy to get a few games in whenever youve got a couple of minutes
there are lots of game modes and events goign on so there feels like a decent amount to do
its free!! so if it sounds at all appealing you should give ti a try"
19498,somehow people will gain 30 mana faster then u without any boosters. theres either cheaters or bots bc i just faced a dude who spawned 2 of the same cards twice also spending 8 mana every time i have 3 with him spawning more stuff i dont get this game and how that can be a possiblity not worth the 1.2gb of space
19499,"Pretty simple game that has a lot of cool combos to try out. It's pretty hard to lose on the really early levels I found but in Bronze and above you finally meet people who are trying to win.

I don't know if this can keep me interested very long, but it is nicely designed and you learn a little trick every match.

19500,Hello! I enjoyed the game till it went out of service.
19501,"Looked at this game and thought to myself ""wow that looks shit"". But I was bored and said fuck it. Why am I having fun o_o"
19502,"Mi-Ma is mostly a deck building game that you need to get used to timing too. So it has some action elements and mostly a tactical understanding. Though it is still in early access most of the game dynamics are solid. There are both eye-candy stuff and also to the point cards. In time it might turn to be a pay-to-win TCG but for now it is very fun to play. At most the duels take 5 min. to complete, however generally around 3 min. is enough. 
In the end if you try to MOBA-type TCG this is it."
19503,"*TL;DR at the bottom

After sinking about 15 hours into this game and reaching gold in both solo and duo I must say there isn't much to the game it's mostly a rush down of card placement and who can establish dominance/counter harder. the game walks a line between Warcraft and a CCG without going into the level of depth either offers which is a real shame because once you get really into it you get blindsided by just how shallow the game ends up feeling. Despite the overall shallow feeling of the game, it was really fun and slightly addicting nature with each level up giving you a little something to add to your Plethora of cards but once you hit lvl 30 everything stops and you left achievement chasing or farming a mode that only gives you a prize once every three days. the game has a talkative and friendly community I've met quite a few of friendly individuals that communicated and tried their best in the duo games I've set up and played.while the art direction of the game isn't in my range of tastes it works for the game well enough. Reviewing this game as if I were to recommend it to a friend I'd have to suggest against it. Its alright but its far from being something I can see myself and some friends playing for any form of extended fulfillment. 

TL;DR: to put it simply, this game is quaint I'd love to see more from this game in the future when the game gets a little more fleshed-out but as it stands right now I can't recommend.
Pros: 
Not pay to win.
Has a nice potato-chip effect.
Talkative community.

Cons:
Meh art direction
Its a snack, not a meal.
A little too simplistic.
the lvl of progression ends way too soon."

19508,"I bought this game a while back, and enjoyed it - but felt that the price wasn't warranted. It was only 1 vs 1, and grew boring farily fast. However, it is now free to play AND has 2 vs 2. I feel like I'm too old, and shouldn't like this game - but help me, I do. 

The only true criticizm I have with the game, (with all free to play games) it's a little heavy on the incentive to purchase micro transactions. You ""can"" earn enough money to eventually purchase other characters, but it takes quite a while considering they are all purchased with ""premium"" currency. I have 10 hours on record, and have only earned enough to purchase 1 additional character, and halfway to another. If you could purchase characters with basic gold, this game would be great fun - but the artificial drag can certainly be offputting to impatient players.

To describe the gameplay, it's a bit like Magic the Gathering meets League of Legends. In fact, the gameplay is extremely reminiscent of an older MTG game called: Magic the Gathering Battlegrounds.

Definitely worth checking out, especially since it's free to play. Worst case scenario, you uninstall it and you're no worse off."
19509,"Its free and its good. A mix between Hearthstone, League Of Legends and tower defense. I've  had plenty of free cards thrown my way by just playing and progressing through the leagues.

19532,"Fun game. Proven concept of Nexus Wars from SC2, but the balance department is slacking heavily. SO many bullshit combos you can make if you have bought yourself the cards / grinded for eternity. And those combos give like tripple the power they should, considering the combined mana.
Gets old after few days of play, when you start reaching those people with the i-win combos."
19533,Super fun to play
19534,Bots bots bots! When you try to play against other people all you get is bots! And they are extremely easy. So if all you care about is advancing by playing AI set to easy mode then go ahead I guess. As of now the match queue is FULL of bots.
19535,Like in every other online card game: Strongest Card is Moms Credit Card.
19536,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
19537,"Super boring free to play, low skill requirement so I just ran through anybody I played against as I guess people just don't play with hands. I guess it's okay but it's a no from me chief."
19538,"As ""clash-royale-esque"" games go, it's not bad. Its really easy to play.
[strike]I'm not a fan of the genre so I'm uninstalling, but[/strike] its definately worth giving a try.
Havent found any bugs or technical issues.
Even the announcer isn't [i]that[/i] annoying."
19539,Very nice try it and you will see...!
19540,Glad I recognized that this game is 100% pay2win before I purchased any upgrades. Uninstalled. Without pay2win such a game could be cool.
19541,Anything remind me about SJW AND PC culture in a game is a no and virus to me. Aside from that the game is nothing new or remarkable with just ok artwork and ps1 graphic .  It is functional but i can't see any potential.
19542,Great game that doesnt even have exit to desktop or exit game button so you have to alt+f to close it would recommend 9/11
19543,"Pay to win wall around high silver/low gold where other players have all legendary decks. You *could* possibly get a legendary card without paying, but after levels 1-22 my friend and I had zero and our comparable point total cards/counters would get crushed by the best tier cards.

The game also sounds like it's been revamped toward the F2P/P2W model recently, if you read the boards and people asking about why things have changed, etc.

Fun until you hit low/gold, then I'd recommend uninstalling. Don't spend any money."
19544,Steam Advertisment got me here...only played 2hrs but i'm allready loving this game...good fun and grind potential !
19545,This game is super good time fun!
19546,addictive
19547,Very good! Fair business model and active devs. Plenty of active players. This is definitely an underrated gem.
19548,"I don't like this game it's not fun and  when i play it i feel like i m wasting my time on it i don't know why i feel like it is draining my soul i like it, recommended!"
19549,"Totally recommend it, it is fun and engaging, 
Easy to learn and challenging with strategy involved.

It is not P2W, it all comes down to strategy on your own.

1v1 and 2v2 modes, invite your friends!

It was free first in the Discord store, been playing it for a while now."

"
19551,"Best game
"
19552,This game is simply great.
19553,Probably a good game but they have used some pretty shitty marketing tactics
19554,GOOD GAME 8/10
19555,"This game is actually good!  Fun to play!  It does have some single player to get you started (against AI), but, once you are going, it's always 1v1 or 2v2 (coop).   When I installed, I figured it was another cheesy FTP (or cheap) game.  But like I said, its actually a blast to play.  And I like that a match only usually lasts 2 - 4 minutes.   You can get all the cards just by playing too, no need to spend any real money.  But the game is so good, I've actually been tempted to buy the season pass, which lets you get many more rewards while playing.   Definitely give this F2P game a try!"
19556,Weird
19557,"Game looks awesome, is very playable, nice graphics, sound is also awesome, the chest system is not my favorite but its kinda okish, but it just isn't for me, the idea of it is clash royale as it seems, and in my opinion that kind of games are just chewed out already."
19558,k00zak giera
19559,"""Easy to play hard to minion master"""
19560,"I understand a lot of people give the game negative feed back stating that it's pay to win, or that the community is toxic etc. Maybe it's because I'm a MOBA and old-school competitive player but, I don't find the community toxic, you can't even chat while you're actively playing an opponent, it's only post game, at the main screen/lobby. Furthermore, pay to win? Half of the Grandmaster decks are comprised mostly of Common/UnCommon cards, you don't need a deck full of legendaries to win, and a deck full of legendaries isn't going to help you win if you aren't already a strong player. The game is good, I don't care much for it solo anymore, but that's primarily because I dislike some of the ""Meta"" decks in Diamond+ I still play a ton in team battles with friends though, excellent game, I highly recommend it for the low, low price of free."
19561,i got banned for literally making a mom joke on the discord
19562,"It's a fun game. If people wanna pay money for things, they can go ahead, but for the most part the game doesn't require that. I mean, it's even free now, so I don't understand what the problem is? You drop creatures down onto your side of the arena, they go over and attack the enemy. That's the main component of the game. It only takes about 1-5 minutes to finish a match, and the game itself doesn't take long to start up. If you're looking for a quick and simple game, Minion Masters is great."
19563,"nice animations and mechanics. i think the card system is appropriate however it straight away invites greed and imbalance.
it is centred around rng lootboxes. it is by design a mobile game. it is p2w. as with all mobile games, you need to keep spending. this is not a ""one time purchase"" and you can enjoy the game."
19564,making this pay2win garbage free won't make it any better.
19565,"I love this game, its a unique card game."
19566,"Definitely reccomend! fun and easy to learn game, i hope we can spread it around now that it's f2p and we can get the community a bit bigger."
19567,"Would have paid for this. Awesome game, which offers great battles.
No base building and other macro-orientend management stuff, just pure tactic, based on the decks you build.

Give it a try, it is free."
19568,"Rating this early access a 8 of 10. Good graphics, always updating to balance, game play is fun and addictive. I love this game for when I am streaming live anyone in my chat can be apart of the game at the same time. The community is loyal to the game and there is always someone helping you. Of course with every pvp open chat games there are the toxic sore losers. Litterally everything in the game can be earned over time. So for anyone whom says this is pay to win doesn't play to win. I hope to see more of this game in the higher tiers of competitive esports. The developers are very involved and always watching the game and the play stats of the cards and masters. Keep it up BetaDwarf! Love this game."
19569,it sucks
19570,"A very nice take on Clash royale.

Cards do not get stronger by levelling, so you can put together a competitive deck very fast, as long as you acquire the meta cards. Most of them are cheap due to being commons or uncommons.

I didn't put much time on it, nor any money, and already made it to top 100 just from Clash Royale experience, a feat that i couldn't achieve into that mobile game because i lack the card levels to do so.

Overall, feels like a more casual and fair approach to clash royale genre."
19571,Good game
19572,"The game has a fun take on card battles, and I love the art style. 

That being said its a game utterly ruined by microtransactions, the most powerful(imbalanced) cards gated behind real money purchases unless you want to spend what is frankly a ridiculous amount of time grinding; its like EA lowkey produced this game. I don't mind supporting good games, but this game is quickly losing my interest simply because I feel i shouldnt have to dedicate a hundred or so hours to unlock just one card."
19573,"I got this game for free a while back, I was a bit skeptical because it seemed like a clash of clan clone. BUT these game devs are very genuine and generous with this game. I decided to try it a few days ago and I have fallen in love."
19574,what about the giant masters?
19575,"I want to reccomend this game, but then they gotta fix the ""crashing issues"". 

I've lost alot of games due to my teammates disconnecting!! 
I see no reason to why not the game could continue with a bot in my teammates place, until he's able to reconnect again...

"
19576,"The game seemed kinda neat when I tried it out on Discord and decided to install it on Steam. The quick battles and the 2v2 in particular appealed to me. However, all of the fun I had quickly paled in comparision to the sheer grind factor and just how much of the substantial rewards are gated either behind a very long grind, an expensive Battle Pass, or both. 

Particularly the Battle Pass soured me something fierce; it's heavily intransparent and does not inform new players properly about how it works or how you obtain rewards. In particular, nothing I could find informed that the option of ""buy Battle Pass"" in the store only granted me the most basic of access, and that I'd have to spend additional premium currency (or, you guessed it, a very hefty grind) to unlock further tiers. I imagine the only actually decent rewards are at the most basic level and at the very late levels, and you have to pony up a subtantial amount of cash to get to those later rewards. The gameplay, art direction and general design was not good enough to make me want to tolerate this level of monetization. The art in particular has some style mishmash that is not executed well enough to completely dispel the feeling of ""randomly mixed assets"". 

I know the game is entering proper Free to Play soon, and I suppose it'll be easy for people to try it out and judge for themselves then. Personally, I requested a refund, because as much as I like supporting developers I did not feel this was worth my time or money."
19577,"While simple on its surface, there is a lot of subtle strategy to this game. Not only that, most of the most useful cards are easy to get. Unlike the mobile games that this looks like, there isn't an obnoxious system where you have to level up your cards to make them strong enough to use. This means that you can actually rank up without spending a bunch of money if you build your decks around what you have rather than focusing on what cards you don't. I reached the top of the rankings last month using a deck of 9 commons and 1 legendary, which is easy to get without spending extra money."
19578,Good
19579,"Quick fun! Easy to learn, hard to master. :upvoted:"
19580,it remind me of Minoins from despicabke me I love the Minions from that funny movie they Make me laugh :) '
19581,Way more fun than Clash o' Clans!  Hope they introduce 3v3 battles at some point cause I'd love to play with more friends.
19582,tang ina nyu!!!
19583,Played it probably 5 hours on its own client.  Pretty fun.
19584,"Just want to preface that this game is avaliable on Discord's store for free!
I have never spent a dime on this game, but have recieved plenty of enjoyment from it. 
One thing I'd like to add is that this game is quite competitive. 
If you are the type that likes RTS games, definitely give this game a try.
People will say that this game is pay-to-win, but could not be further from the truth.
Lots of high level players will have mostly common cards in their decks, which you, as a new player, will be able to get your hands on rather quickly.
The game is growing out of its infancy and is about to blow wide open, so go over to Discord and give it a whirl."
19585,It's a great game and pretty addicting. Runs smoothly on my shitty laptop c:
19586,"the best board game i have ever seen 

and yes you will have to drop some cash 

but the real con is the RNG ."
19587,Decent enough game but shortsighted or poor moderators and toxic high roller players make for a poor experience in a game completely focused on multiplayer.
19588,"My steam is on my d drive, since my c drive is only 250GB m.2 ssd flash drive. MY C DRIVE IS NOT MEANT FOR SAVING SHIT ON, just win 10. THIS GAME forces you to save your fucking stupid replays to your c drive. I dont want the fucking replays, and if I do, I want to choose where the fuck they go. NO customization to where I can save these fucking replays. fuck you betadwarf fukc you! I cant call you guys developers with this stupid save to c drive shit. go back to phone apps you talent-less fucking hacks"
19589,"Cool strategy game which wont necessarily eat alot of your time, one match lasts 5 - 10 minutes.
It receives regullar dev care... Sadly there isnt a tablet edition..."
19590,"This game is fun. Fairly simple game, fun with or without friends."
19591,"Definitely worth checking out once it goes (and stays!) F2P  - in it's current form, the game is in no way pay to win, the microtransactions etc are largely cosmetic; you *can* potentially go ahead and buy cards randomly but with even the slighest degree of competence at the game, you won't need to as the starter deck is pretty OK."
19592,tha gem is nais
19593,Great game with regular updates - easy to learn and hard to master! Looking forward to it being totally F2P for more players - just wish they included cross-platform support.
19594,"I got a crippling addiction to this game, better than my past addictions 10/10"
19595,Lovely little game :)
19596,"An awesome game! Its an actionpacked stratetgy cardgame somehow. Its well balanced, has active devs who constantly improve stuff and absolutely no p2w, which I think it quite unusual for this kind of game. Only bad thing I can think of is that its pretty addictive (check my hours ingame). 
Update: Leaving Early Access this year didnt change much, since it was already fully functional long time before that. Devs are still releasing new stuff and adjusting balance when needed.
Still a good game."
19597,The best game of its kind there is
19598,omg
19599,"just nominated for ""game of the year"", as it is definitely my game of the year (650+ hours ^^).

really, give it a try! it is free to play, but for those who are serious about this game, some minor investments are neccessary: the premium upgrade, and the seasonal battle pass (i bought it once, after that i could buy the next battle pass with the rubies i earned during the duration of the battle pass). 
this game is no pay to win at all. premium and battle pass just accelerate your progression in cards an currencies, but there is nothing you couldn't accomplish without investing any money. it's a ""pay for being impatient"" ;) a got all the cards and masters (with decent glory), by just buying the two above mentioned...

the gameplay is amazing - easy to learn but hard to master! amazing to play with a friend! new cards and card themes are released with every battlepass. there are several game modes to play and adapt your strategies to. 

and the best thing about this game: it is early access! -  it is already a great game and can be expected to get even better, with more content to come! i am looking forward to where the game is going to! keep up the good work guys!"
19600,Noice!
19601,"Very addictive, lots of characters to choose"
19602,"So far, enjoying it quite a bit :)"
19603,Matchmaking straight up doesn't work and you have to force quit the game because there is no quit button of any kind.
19604,Fun and fast paced tableboard card game. No pay to win.
19605,"Pretty well balanced and minimally p2w... which is all you can really ask for these days.

I'm having a lot of fun with the multiplayer on this one, but it can be hit-or-miss. Some trolling bastards like to quit just before you win to make you lose instead... for who knows what reason. Barring that this game is addictive, unending fun!"
19606,Addictive and fun game. Recommend to play this game.
19607,Good Game
19608,A refreshing card game. It's fun and an addictive game.
19609,Fantastic game
19610,goog game
19611,Awesome game :D
19612,Best arena game on Steam ffs
19613,"I was never a fan of those ""clash"" games, but Minion Masters makes so much fun that I always get back to it every season."
19614,Noice
19615,"Great game, lots of fun!

Highly recommend this game!"
19616,"as a top player top 60 200+ hours i can recommend this game.
 i have my own personel run in with TGXAndy and you can too!
Me and him have become one and our lives matter not compared to the inevitability you will face.
This game is a means to a end of everything but also a begining of something more beautiful and less cumbersom.
Be calm now for the pain is numbing and memories fleeting for the future is vast as the mind is small.

(edit for the autumn sale badge thingy)"
19617,"The game that keeps on giving, I can only reccommend giving this a try, it is incredibly f2p friendly as every currency can be earned from just playing the game, be it achievement rewards, ranked rewards, levelup rewards, daily login rewards, event participation or simply store freebies - over time they shower you in everything and I haven't been missing out on anything! It's almost too generous for a f2p title, but they've been ramping up their microtransaction game and steadily releasing fancier skins for each master, so I hope they'll stay afloat.

To the game itself - it's basically like a strategic card game, but the twist is, that it is played fully in real time and not taking turns. You collect mana over time which lets you play a minion card or spell. Your ""deck"" consists of a small selection of cards only and you cycle through them as you play one, eventually redrawing it. Each card has different uses and effects, but so far it isn't too overwhelming to watch and understand all of them. The visuals certainly help making each card distinct (and overly cute/silly!)

My favorite feature is probably the 2v2 mode, finally a fun card game with an online co-op feature! Complete with separate ranked matchmaking!
And if you are a twitch streamer they've been adding a multitude of fun interactions between you and twitch chat, plus several events which really encourage streaming the game!

So far the game has only been growing and due to it being early access the devs are still experimenting a lot and changing the game in quite drastic ways regularly (not many are a fan of that). But so far the developement has kept it interesting and engaging and I look forward to all that's still to come!

Everything above originally written: 24 Nov, 2018 @ 12:49am
Update: 26 Nov, 2019 - game still very much alive, everything I've written above is still pretty much valid. It's my most played game of the year and they've finally decided to call it a release and I think they've been getting into a steady release cycle that's healthy and working for them. Soon they are releasing a wholly new game mode and they've awarded us with ingame stuff because of a slight delay of it's release so I think they're still very keen on keeping us happy. I really enjoy their dev streams on twitch too, they just feel very relatable and down to earth so that's a huge plus to me. Keep on rocking minion masters!"
19618,Nice
19619,Very addicting and fresh card/strategy game

19626,fun game to play and kill time also love  how enteractive it is with streaming
19627,"Just a trash game that's labeled RTS but is actually a card game under that RTS tag.

Borderline pay2win because some legendary cards are disgustingly hard to counter it's retarded

19636,nice
19637,Very simple and a lot of fun!
19638,"Edit: (2021/08/06) Game is going downhill fast. Once my favorite game, they decided to do some weird ""balancing"" changes that made no sense and made the game boring and annoying. They also tried to monetize, but I doubt they are having much success with the current state of the game. As of now I can no longer recommend the game and will finally uninstall it. Rest in peace.

Got the game for free, not really sure how. Quite decent game and worth the full price. Bought the DLC to support the developers, but the game can be fully played and enjoyed without it (not pay2win)."
19639,Can be played when you have 5 minutes over or for a couple of hours straight. Warning - Really addictive gameplay where you just want to play one more game again and again.
19640,This is a game that is a Dimond in the rough. This plays like Clash Royale. When i bought this game for like 25 cents i wasnt expecting much from it. If you like card games and the idea like yugioh where you play monsters and they come to life then youll love this game. Honestly paying full price or buying it on sale it isworth your time and money. My only complaint or headup I would give is that the community for this game is not that big  but its not that small where it takes forever to find games.
19641,"Fun lane/ tower defense gameplay, especially good mayhem in 2 player mode!"
19642,Another game that's gonna bite the dust :(
19643,Good to make some time
19644,pretty good!
19645,Good game is good to pass the time. <:> (.`´.)
19646,Nominated this game in the  Steam Awards 2019  .
19647,"Fun and entertaining, not that easy either."
19648,"Been playing it for a little more than half a year now and I've enjoyed every single minute of Minion Masters. While it may not look like it at first, it quickly makes you play several hours when all you wanted to do is to play like 30 minutes.

There are plenty of explaining reviews out here already, so most of the core mechanics have been explained a ton. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing. P2W is NOT a factor here. And even while it may now still cost 5 €, it is already f2p on Discord and should follow sooner or later with that on Steam as well."
19649,nc game
19650,"Really fun game with a lot of different tasks and modes to play; they have an active Discord where you can get in contact with the devs, which is really cool. Also, I love the graphics."
19651,fun game
19652,"Rock, paper, scissors, the videogame.
After playing Clash Royale for so long I really got tired of being outleveled by any player who spent lots and lots of money on the game.
Minion Masters is 0 pay to win, I'm able to play cool matches against the opponents in a fun, fast and fair enviroment.
I can't recommend it enough for all the fans of these type of games. 
And for the people who said is pay to win and stuff... oh well, as any game, you need some time to unlock all the content. But despite that, if you are good, you can be a high rank player with very few cards of your choice.
Thanks for reading my first review"
19653,Balanced Card game not pay to win and involves huge amounts of strategy to pull out a win
19654,Amazing artworks and details
19655,I've been enjoying this game.  Its constant updates and new combinations of cards still makes me wonder.  Great game to waste time on your own or play with or against friends
19656,berry noice gaim
19657,"Modern chess ,very fun :)"
19658,You should give it a try :)
19659,"Super fun! I don't usually play card games, but this one is worth it. Fun 2 vs. 2 battles and daily quests make this one have me coming back for more every day."
19660,Writing this review for the autumn sale steam badge. Game's aight
19661,"Review from first season - On comments the reason why from recommended when to unrecommended

Great game, like heartstone or Clash Royale but much more balanced. Has 1v1, 2v2 premade and 2v2 random different ranks. Its still on development so thats good, has room to get even more better. Easy to twitch with it and does events that helps Twitch channels to get more people with event keys.

The only bad thing i can say for now is that its a little expensive to get new cards or new heroes, but thats not so bad either probably thats why its more balanced too"
19662,Great Game!! Easy and simple. Matches are small and hence fun to play.
19663,Pretty nice one
19664,"need to stop this rng stuff, still best card game"
19665,Fun game overall. But the abuse of Xiao Long every match (especially team matches) has made it too repetitive and thus boring at this point.
19666,"You want to kill a few hours and not know that you did??? This is the game for you! With overall decent looking graphics and an extremely easy menu and UI, this is a game that anyone can pick up and play. What I like most about this game is how simple it is, once you master the basics you can go from building a basic deck to a complex one in an matter of an hour and the more you play the more your deck starts to reflect your type of play style. For its price I highly suggest checking it out."
19667,these minions couldnt master me
19668,Really fun a laid back game. Not much of a learning curve. But it does get harder at higher ranks
19669,"Fun, fun, game.  Login thinking a quick 3min round and that will be all, 10 rounds later and wondering where the time went."
19670,"Really fun game, I entered it only to spend a few hours but stayed for hunderds.
Can easily get it for free everywhere.

Pros:
-Easy to get into and learn
-Developers adding content frequently
-A large variety of cards (120+) and almost all of them are viable for competetive play
-The game is quite balanced
-Fast matchmaking
-Not p2w, many free stuff, I got a 99% complete of the cards in the game without paying a single dollar (invest in battle pass! ^_^)

Cons:
-Not too many people know it :("
19671,Very addictive and fun.
19672,Yup :)
19673,"Incredibly fun game, built for short matches of 5-7mn with a strong ""fun"" conception. Highly recommended."
19674,I've always like this game a good bit. A fun take on TCG's similar to hearthstone but with a managable RTS-like aspect. The addition of duo's just makes it much better for myself as well
19675,"With over 57 hours of gameplay. I really like the game, played it tons during the past summer. It was quick fun while watching twitch streamers or watching netflix. Recently, the game has changed and added a lot more pay to the game. I did get the game for free and now I notice people have to buy it. 

One thing I would suggest to the devs, is please change the ""E-Sports"" in their bio to Esports for it's properly spelling."
19676,"It is great game, Not pay to win at all.
Yeah it takes some time to get all the cards but you don't need all the cards to be a good player or get to high ranks, besides it's much funnier to have to collect them one by one than buying.

I can say that its poorly optmized for now, but I'm almost sure it should already run in most computers nowadays, btw I can't complain since I play it on a potato and it still in the beta build.

It is not the exact same thing as clash royale, it just have the same style in gameplay, for example, lol and dota2 are both MOBA games but not same game at all, so please, don't go to chat and say ""ITS CLASH ROYALE FOR COMPUTER"".

The community is a bit toxic but it also has a lot of good and friendly players.

Overall I recommend getting this game when it gets free, or even buying now just to support the devs"
19677,"Endless grinding to improve your army of minions. Can be quite fun if you like that kind of long term motivation. Game turned to F4P model and slowed down updates. On a bonus it's still more stable than many other games

Updates are rolling in quite fast improving the game so far. We will see were the game ends up once it gets closer to an official release."
19678,still game of the year
19679,"Very nice game.
For good price you get online game that isn't ""Pay 2 Win"".
Would recommend it to all gamers who like strategy or tower defense kind of games."
19680,"- Highly Enjoyable game.
- Great F2P structure, I have earnt ever card without paying anything.
- Dev support and communication is fantastic with weekly patches and developer streams to interact with the community.
- The balance on the game is well, with even the cheapest (freest) of decks able to be compeitively viable."
19681,Always fun to revisit now and again
19682,i brought this for 79p near release with a free copy of the game 130 hours game time +800 hours from the copy i gifted. Best 79p i will ever spend. FUN
19683,"Tis good, Yes."
19684,wonderful fun game
19685,"It's a good game that has potential but with how close minded this dev and community is, the game is ass on the long run, I wouldn't recommend. So therefore I deter you from buying this game and supporting its crappy devs, if you want reasons why I said they're crappy and lazy refer to this thread. https://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/2/1752358461537433


Jan 10, 2019 @ 8:57pm 
Sorry, but due to the dev being actual human trash he deleted my thread so no one can see what scum he is."
19686,Not exactly my cup of tea and  I will not spend god know how much time in this type of games but it feels pretty good and polished. Matches are quick sometimes very quick and can be equally satisfying and frustrating :)
19687,Very addictive and satisfying game.
19688,"Minion Masters is a great card game, similar to clash royale. 
I´m not sure why this game still calls itself early access, in my opinion it´s a perfectly running game which is better polished than most other card games out there. Balancing is great. You can always see the top 20 players decks and none of them uses the same cards. This means there is never one meta deck everyone plays, because no card is too strong or cannot be countered. Therefore cards in the starting deck are quite reliable and therefore still used in highlevel decks.  Also updates witch balance changes hit quite frequently as well as seasons and events with new cards available (have a look at the update news and you will see).
AND it´s a card game witch you can play coop with a friend and that´s quite fun!"
19689,This game so cool. I like it
19690,"Good concept, interesting cards and masters for varied play... Balancing is utter garbage. If you don't have the cards that are over tuned that week, you'll lose even with a proper and well rounded deck. To top it off, one of the 3-4 over tuned cards can be bought in a pack for cash in the shop. Team Battles are a JOKE when you're paired as 2 randoms verses premades.

Don't bother if you actually are looking for a game with any sense of strategy in deck building."
19691,Interesting game.
19692,"Really fun game, everything I wanted to be honest. Can't wait to see where this goes!"
19693,proof tht stupidity has won and humanity is doomed
19694,Just a big pile oh crap
19695,"Very good game
+"
19696,Killed in the last update sadly. Spells are still too powerful and they completely destroyed King Puff.
19697,decent
19698,!
19699,I can't remember the last time I was so addicted to a game. I absolutely love this.
19700,"Super fun and addictive. Better than Clash Royale. Economy is fair and allows you to grind to earn cards with relative ease. Highly recommended for 1-2 hours of fun a day. Match takes between 2 to 8 minutes.

Love it!"
19701,"This game...wow, just wow, the way it changed since the first time ive played it until now on how it has changed.  Yes it has a lot of cool new upgrades, and 2v2 is really fun, i really liked that. But, the agresive predatory microtransactions are ridiculous, they are only below battlegrounds, because they do the card upgrades your unit. But it does not makes it stronger, it allows you to bring more of that card and gain more ""battle pass xp"".

It went from a little nice game were you grinded to get other heroes to summon tiny versions of stuff to kill each other. And it still is, it did not went pay to win in the time i came back to check. But, it did reduced the rewards significantly than before, I saw this when i came back and started to check any new rewards. Sadly, only avatars, really? not even a core? or one card from a new release?, what about a free skin or a hero?, no just avatars.

The game was grindy since the begining, wich was what made me stop playing and try another of the same type like Red Tides, and now that i came back just for a bit, it was, worst. Every reward from loot a lootbox and roullete spin still feels like a casino, and i hate it. The game kept shoving on me how many rewards i was not getting, i had to get the premiun to get the other half of the rewards being held hostage for the game to actually feel  rewarded. It kept trying to shove in every screen the battle pass, its about to be over, buy the battlepass, get actual good rewards, buy the battlepass.

I kept asking about this on the chat and everyone was ok with this, it seemed insane. they ask for 1500 rubies for a pass that you cannot farm normaly, and get incredible minuscule parts of it. Get the battlepass and get more...like just 250, in 50 bunches, really apart from each other. ""But you will enjoy the game more when you have a battlepass!"" (straight copy from forthnight btw) ""you can just grind and get it""...well yes, if i wanted to play a game that is clearly trying to push me into buying extra things and just be their sardine, but i do not want to. I want to play games because they are fun and because i want to play them, not because i have to play more like its work or a bloody chore.

If they really want to go free to play, that is great, but if they do, they should stop asking for money for a game that seems to sell you the entry ticket to a flashy casino. I honestly just uninstalled and moved on, this game clearly has other targets in mind, and i dont think i can recomend a game like this to my friends."
19702,"This was the first time I have recieved a game for free and it was actually pretty fun. I like the idea of it, the characters, the cards, and the customization. This is a pretty good game to play, I enjoyed it and would continue playing it."
19703,"Cool tactical game, where you face 1v1 or 2v2 pvp where you spawn your cards and try your best to defeat enemy, some cards are worse then others, so your choise is just how you gonna play with em! :D Good luck!"
19704,Pay to win
19705,"Very good for a FTP, havent really gotten very high on ladder, doesn´t look like PTW."
19706,"One of the better free to play competative games out there. Really don't feel like I am getting out $$$'d when I play. It seems like everything is about how you play, and it's really quite decent."
19707,This game reminds me of clash royale and when I did play it before I was totally engrossed into this game.Playing this game has now done the same thing since it has a similar concept but its really cool with the kind of cards you can get and especially with the different heroes you have. This games so far from playing it is very fun. As well with the ranked system it seems pretty good.
19708,"not that good i guess it was worth $2

disappointed by pack rolls yet again"
19709,...
19710,"It is addicting in nature like every other freemium game out there spinning lights and the idea that you can outsmart or outplay your opponent no matter what well thats not the case. There are obvious bugs and cards that are much to strong and the developers know it and they dont bother to change it until almost a week later when every Top rank character has three of them. So get ready to open your wallets to another scummy shit stain of a game and yeah yeah it looks good but if the gameplay is manipulative I dont care if it looks like the second coming of jesus cus this shit should not be allowed to exist in my opinion. 

Its not a choice because if you dont pay your looking at thousands of hours to keep up with all the cards that have been changed nerfed and boosted and all the glitch decks your going to spend easily 200$ in a month to stay competative with how many cards they change and pull out of their ass.

Oh right and to the developer that may look at this as an attack just know this wipe away the fancy graphics theres nothing special about this game."
19711,"This game make you pay to play then also has pay to win. Completely insane concept. The community is so adamant that EA is worse, Idon't give a fuck. If this is your business model fuck off. Then the community insisted that the devs needed our support with the 5 bucks to keep the game going, are you so blind that you can't see the micro transactions will ""support"" them? I got banned from chat for calling a mod ""kid"" I was being toxic but how can you not be mad at developers that do this bull shit nowaday"
19712,"Funny Game, good time spender and entertaining mecanics. Keep it growing and make it even better."
19713,"Probably best to wair for release.  Right not there is no real tutorial, there is a sort of mechanics demo but that doesnt really teach you any when or why.  It then launches you straight into pvp with no real knowledge of the systems and you must win several games before you gain access to any of the systems like that shop.

The community appears to be quite friendly.    That is quite rare for an online game."
19714,"Pro:
Nice game that isn't P2W
The devs really try to make the game fit for all
A bit gore

Cons:
Sometimes a annoying chat but the chat mods handle that with bans for the spamming people"
19715,free on discord but not steam :(
19716,"It's like Clash Royale, but sideways and actually good, but sadly this game revolves around getting lucky with loot boxes, and currently certain cards & combos are so incredibly powerful that they let you win the match in less than 20 seconds, so if you didn't get lucky, you would always lose to a lucky player, or a paying player who bought more loot boxes and therefore had the chance to get a better deck than you.

At the moment, the game is unbalanced, I suggest waiting a few months for updates before hopping into it.

"
19717,"I got this game on chrono.gg I just had some coins and wanted to spend them on something. I had no idea what i was buying when I got minion masters. 

Long story short, that was 3 months ago. I now have 344 hours on record.

It's now on discord as a free title but its worth WAY moer than free, way more than 4.99, way more than most games Ive puchased for 40 dollars. 

My review. Just get it. 

Say goodbye to your social life :)"
19718,"If you're just starting, you missed all the good stuff...and most of the good players. 
Its all gone, the meat and potatoes. I hope you like leftovers.
Nuff Said...

But really this started out great. Now its just another P2W spam-fest with very little room for strategy besides rock-paper-scissors. It's sad to watch another great game with so much potential slowly rot and fester with greed...& the community isn't helping.
But there is still hope, & I'll probably be back once they come to their senses and at least put a working anti-cheat system in place.
...Now where is that final silly achievement

UPDATE: Now even rock-paper-scissors is gone. Hope has jumped ship and I don't think she's coming back, so neither will I.
See you in another game."
19719,I still remember disrespecting this game but holy crap you guys are doing great! I love the game and I usually hate games like this. Good work BetaDwarf.
19720,"i love this game 
good game
best game of my category"
19721,I've enjoyed my time in the game. Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys deck building and placement strategies.
19722,"This game was awesome!!! Much more better game play than heart stone and clash of clans tower game and magic. The game is extremely well balanced with an awesome announcer and memorable cast of characters and cards. The card system is also well balanced because the expensive cards that cost a lot also consume a lot of resources. There are various counters for everything, so even the strongest card can get countered by a low 1 or 2 ranking card. Game has many variable and strats because of the real time strategy approuch with the atb bar being your resources and picking your main character can change everything on your deck. You will never have a mirror match in this game and it is highly unlikely even in top solo or team rank you will never see a mirror match."
19723,"One of the best game I've played. Really fun and enjoyable especially the team battle is a great plus. Matches last 8 min at max which makes it even better as the matches doesn't take long to end.

UPDATE: still loving this game. The developers keep adding new stuff which I really love.

UPDATE 2: Facing a bug. Devs don't answer in in-gam efeedback or even in their official discord. Will stop playing soon."
19724,"Minion Masters is a very fun game that is everything but pay2play. You might pay a small entry fee for now on Steam (although the game is free on discord), but the game itself is fully free2play friendly. Sure, if you want to amas the entire collection it'll be quite the grind to go free2play, but you can easily be competitive without the rarest cards, as the rarity doesn't display how strong a card is but rather how specialized it is. In the top 20 leaderboards right now, some of the decks aren't even using any legendary cards. Heck, one deck in the top 20 is made entirely of common and rare cards. It truly is competitively free2play."
19725,"Really good game with interseting gameplay. Baically, Dota 2 + Clash Royale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90GF5siZlp0&index=2&list=PLOtTEc8oKrPqZbxPuIfLLXlk9rRE3xmYJ&t=0s"
19726,"Such a good game, 
it's in early access but it's already a good game !"
19727,"Very good game with new content constantly.  The only thing i think should change is to make the upgraded season pass easier to attain.  It's never good if the only realistic way you can get stuff is by making additional cash purchases.  However this game is not pay2win because you can be a top player with just basic cards, a good build and good card placement."
19728,"Pros:
- many viable playstyles
- pretty well balanced
- lots of different modes to choose from
- expansions are free for some time after they come out
- overall relatively fair business model
- not pay 2 win

Cons:
- three different currencies
- missing cards in the beginning can ruin competitive play
- sometimes balance changes take too long for very obviously broken cards"
19729,"Played less than 10 minutes, lost interest and tried to exit, THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT THE GAME without killing the process!
We need players online, please don't leave, please, PLEASE!"
19730,"Not a bad game, one of the only card games I'm enjoying currently as it got some similarities. The graphics are really nice, animations are good. Pretty easy to learn and get used to and for its price, I'd say it's pretty worth it."
19731,Do recommend
19732,"A fun blend of quite a few genres, you'll notice influences from several of the bigger multiplayer games. But original enough to stand on its own. Very addictive, especially if played with friends, either head-to-head or in Team Battles. Looking forward to streaming this game in the very near future."
19733,"great stategy/card game, The fact that you have a state that units walk throught gives you many more variables how you can play a card, that gives you great depth of possibility in each play (and a huge potential to screw yourself over). The meta is fairly diverse, every time you can find decks of each archetype, no real need to limit yourself to a playstyle because its the only good one. The devs are stupidly active, with content comming as often as every week.

And ignore all the crybabies about the game being p2w. You can see the leaderboards and check that top 20 competetive decks often don't use the rarest (legendary) cards, with legends often being situational, or build-arounds. You can easily climb high ranks without them."
19734,"Is a good game, just has an annoying caster voice.

23/11/2018 Still no change to the caster voice that forces me to use headphones whenever playing."
19735,"Realy fun card game where you need to beat the opponent by spawning enemies, matches are found very fast and dont take too long. Absolutely great if you want some quick gameplay without too much commitment.

8/10"
19736,Love this game
19737,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING and NOT EVEN CLOSE to being pay2win!

Before i explain the game, let me just tell you why:

After three days i already have 75% of the cards unlocked, without paying any more money (just 5€ for the game) and i have almost all the cards, that the top players are using! 

Its a moba game, where you spawn minions and buildings and play spells strategically to destroy the opponent. There are 1v1, 2v2, Draft mode, Adventure Mode and Challenge (vs AI) mode.  The game itself is super fair, you just have to collect the cards (about 120 right now) and you cant level them up. On my first day i already collected 55/120 card and now, 2 days later i have already more than 80 cards in my collection, without paying more money  There are a few legendary cards that are harder to get but they are not neccessary, and u get 2 from quests and i already got one from a chest. 

The only thing you can buy are other masters, which give you some special abilities and basically defend your base. There are 9 different masters right now, and you start with one of the best ones already (They are all good and there is no ""best"" master, they just support different strategies). And there is a weekly rotation of 2 additional masters, so u have at least 3 out of 9 masters available at all time. After 1-2 days i got enough crystals from quest to buy TWO more, and i then i decided to paid 10€ to buy 3 more masters, because i rly liked the game and wanted to support the developers. So i have 6 out of 9 masters now, after 3 days and 15€ total for the game. You dont have to use any money, but getting enough crystals for the masters could take some time. 

The gameplay is AWESOME and you can try out soo many different decks and strategies and every game feels different. Some are RLY close and that are the coolest ones. 
Dont get fooled by the negative comments, its NOT grindy and you unlock the cards soo fast. Playing with friends in 2v2 and work out some strategies is super fun and exiting.

This may sound too positive but im super hyped about the game, you should just try it, its worth the 5 € and its even worth much more! :D

Come and play! :)"
19738,"LOVE this game. Extremely addictive formula that is perfect for not only casual players but also higher skill levels. Easy to learn hard to ""minion"" master!"
19739,"Pay to win game, don't even try it, everytime they release a new set of cards the kids just throw a bunch of money to get them and obviously those cards are OP as hell, and then there are the fan boys saying ""hurr durr you can play to get the cards, they are available for free"" but then again you can pay to get them faster and easier and wipe some a$$es as soon as you throw money at them. I cannot recommend this ""P2W"" game unless you want to:
1.- spend money or a lot of time to get quality cards...
2.- get wiped by paying players or players w/no life...
3.- get ready to copy top ten decks in order to remain competitive, because real strategy is non existent thanks to the fact developers decided to put the top ten leaderboard cards visible for anyone, so you just need to throw money at it, copy top ten decks, and climb your way to the top..."
19740,"I've had this game since early 2017. It has been through a lot of changes, pros and cons but overall i can easily say this is one of the most addicting games I've ever played. For reading about a ""grind"". I can't really relate to this. we are not talking about 30 minute matches here. a match is around 4 minutes or less on average and you only need to win 3 a day for your achievements. and even more in the beginning for newbies.  they also now have more modes that allow you to find even more rewards and vary your experience. i enjoy logging in to complete a few matches for some free loot. 

YOU DONT NEED EVERY SINGLE CARD TO WIN. a deck contains 10 cards. if you are a new player, please keep in mind they are constantly changing the balance of cards. if you run into oppressive strategies, try to beat it with a different combo and learn the small things like placement and timing. save your resources for strategies you ENJOY playing. you are going to lose against your counters. as long as you are winning over 50% of your matches you will still be climbing on ladder if that is your goal.

Play DRAFT. once you have a solid deck and start to plateau around silver or gold, go play draft to learn what cards you want to play. it cost to enter, but it is much cheaper to play cards you dont have and pursue certain ones than buying the flavor of the week, only to have it nefed in the future. 

check the discussions, watch streams, read the blog. this game is awesome in that, even when i dont have time to play there is always something to learn about cards, resources etc. 

give it a try. and by try, i mean if you are liking the mechanics and the idea of a simple, yet complicated game. then give it at least a month or two of getting your rewards, climbing etc. im telling you, i was barely gaming anymore a mere two years ago and now i have a game that i can play everyday, it may get slightly old by the end of the month or week or w/e but there is always something around the corner to do in-game to spice it back up. new battle pass, new cards, balance changes, draft, mayhem, expeditions and always...troling with ridiculous decks. hope this helps,"
19741,:)
19742,its nice
19743,<3333
19744,This game is really fun. It does not feel like a mobile game when playing despite what other reviews might suggest. It is similar in ideas to clash royale but this game is much more thought out and beautiful in comparison.
19745,Nice Game
19746,Satisfying game that really rewards small but important decisions. Takes a little bit to build up your collection without spending money but feels fair with the amount of stuff you are rewarded with.
19747,Two Headed Dragon!
19748,"I got this for free, as many others that own any of the ""forced"" games.

I am quite supprised honestly. Been playin this game for quite some time now but let me break it a bit down for ya´ll.

This is, as far as I am aware, going to be a Free to Play title. You start out with a solid starter Deck. Of course its just a starter Deck but unless many other titles, your starter deck is acutally pretty decent. You wont make it to the higher ""tiers"" with it, but its good enough to make all the starters have a good start. You´re able to do the Challenges and when I started, I was even able to finish the ""Expedition"" that was running at that time.

What is this game?
Its somewhat of a card rts, nothing new but nothing bad either. You choose a ""Master""(oi, dats you) with some abillities like special cards or direct impact into the game. Then you gain a certain amount of Mana every second wich you then use to play your Cards. Similar to Heartstone for example but in real time, the closest comparison that comes to my Mind is ""Clash Royale""(CR) for the mobile phones, but unlike CR this aint a pay to win. Easy reasoning for that. While your Cards got better/stronger the more you´ve spent on them in CR, in Minion Masters you only boost your Glory on those cards by ""upgrading"" them. That has no impact to the actual game, since that glory is only used for the Battlepass. If you spend money here, you just progress faster but dont get a real, gamebreaking OP advantage. Guess thats the reason why I kept playing it. 

Sure, you wont win every fight you have but thats the whole point of it. This game is build upon something remotely close to stone-scissors-paper in the widest sense. Simple logical things like -> Huge hard hitting guy = countered by lots of small cheap units that overwhelm it. 

I can say, most of my loses are either my fault or I just had the wrong deck/setup against that guy. So there is no pay to win, but you cant expect that you got all the cards you need, after 1 week of playtime. It will take some time but just be patient and you´ll Progress. As far as I understand, this game is meant to be played daily for an hour or so. Not a game you can Play for several hours if you got the Mood. Ofc you can tho, but what I mean is, you wont receive much for ""nolifing"" this game. You got daily Quests, daily new shop offers (for ingamegold and premium currency).

Performancewise the game runs fine, had never a single Crash and the few bugs/errors I encountered are very limited in my Playtime. 

It does not Support Ultrawidescreen tho, but atleast it doesnt strech the screen. I personaly can live with Black Bars left and right.



Only thing I can think of as a Downside to this game is the Lack of sidestuff to do. I dont mean Singleplayer Directly but after you´re done with your daily stuff that only takes roughly an hour, all left for you is 1v1,2v2, draft and Mayhem. The Challenge Missions are ""One time only"" things and give you a good start if you´re starting out, but other means to generate some Money are missing. Whatever, I still enjoy this game for now and surely can recommend it for people, that are looking for a daily neat little game that you dont need to sink 6h a day."
19749,Great game! Deserves more attention! You should really try it out!
19750,"Clash Royale clone but:
[list]    
    [*]Better looking and a native PC game with proper keyboard shortcuts.    
    [*]No stats increase on card leveling. I.e. no need to choose between using the same cards over and over or dropping down the ladder with underleveled cards.
    [*]No cards locked behind higher arena ranking. 
    [*]Multiple heroes(the ones standing on the towers) with different abilities (leveled during the game).
    [*]Bigger cards pool.    
[/list] 

I find many of negative reviews here quite unfair but whatever, reviews section is not a suitable place to argue..."
19751,"This game truly is one of the very few card games that I actually enjoy. There is a lot of strategy and nuance to this game, and I find it a lot of fun to play with different deck combinations to advance my strategies ahead of other players.

Now to address some of the comments claiming this game is pay to win. I have not invested a single penny into this game, and I already have unlocked three masters in 13 hours, and hit Gold in Ranked. I've looked through the store, and the only thing that can ""qualify"" as Pay to Win, would be the capability to purchase power tokens with rubies, however, for starters, you aren't guaranteed the card you want, you have a very good chance to get duplicates, which are automatically broken down into shards that can be used to purchase specific cards or Masters, but there are no ""auto-win"" cards to my understanding. Every card has a weakness, and from my understanding, this game is heavily based off of personal preference and play-style. Whilst I'm sure at a higher level, there is a meta, I have not discovered it yet. That being said, this game is very far from Pay to Win.

BetaDwarf truly has a fantastic game on their hands, and I follow their FORCED™ series. I genuinely enjoy this game, and to anyone out there who enjoys some level of tower defense mixed with a bit of strategy and deckbuilding, this game is truly worth the money. As I would like to see the community for this game grow, not shrink due to some commenters misguiding interested players through claims of ""Pay to Win"", when in actuality, there is none, it's a simple lack of understanding and basic research."
19752,"Absolutely not pay to win, Minion Masters is a wonderful strategy game, easy to pick up and play. Every game vs human opponents is dynamic and no two games are ever the same. Although true that the game has undergone changes which some players do not like, these changes have made the game more dynamic and strategy-focused. Some players argue that it's the other way around but I disagree.

The game is still in Early Access and the core gameplay feels complete with only a few minor balancing issues but as with any Early Access title, this and further changes, perhaps even significant changes, are to be expected. Having said that, I think the game could have been released as a full title the day it gained Early Access status, that's how much effort BetaDwarf put into this project."
19753,"FUn game to play!
Way better than Clash Royale!
No P2W GAME

The only money you will spend is on buying this game, it's worth every cent!"
19754,"Great deck building game. If you enjoy playing the game you don't have to participate in the pay to play. It provides plenty of upgrades as you go through. And really, it's a great game, I'm more than happy to throw a little money at it from time to time."
19755,"This game is very beautiful and amazing. :)
This game is entertaining and fun and there are no complications."
19756,XD
19757,NICE GAME
19758,"I get a free access game from one of the devs. Its a fun game. So far i had no feeling i get payed out or anything like it. And i have not spend any money in it. I lose some games but most of them i won. I love the team game mode. The rest of the modes are not my cup of tea. Single play feels like any card game you need to have a perfect build and hope the other dont have the counter deck or a better pick. So the team mode is the only option if you want a random win/lose and not a paymyway dude before you. Even if you have the best deck or cards. The other one can have ****** the worst cards you can think of. And so you lose. This mode fits my game style. I do not like playing the ""perfect mode"" like all games in this style. Including dota league and so on. If you want fun just give this mode a try and see. If you want the perfect mode than you can pay your way or earn it like a real trooper and not going in QQ mode when other people spend money in it and your not!"
19759,"Imagine if Clash Royale had a base cost, and it still cost just as much for micro transactions. They just keep adding more micro transactions as well as a battle pass system. The game used to be decent."
19760,Pay 2 Win Trash
19761,"It's like new chess style. Units to use, changing in last minute, you are not really sure if you win or not :)"
19762,A nice little fast paced strategy game. I'd say generally the cards are balanced fairly well and you can unlock new units at a decent speed. I've also found the match making is surprisingly fast compared to what I would expect from the Steam charts.
19763,This is LOOTBOXES AT IT'S FINEST. The devs should be jailed for pushing this on kids. The game lets those who drop hundreds insta win. So In case you're wondering if thats why the game is on the decline thats it. Along with just shoddy programming and half the cards not working correctly. Don't waste your time on this one and think you can buy in like you would do in Hearthstone and have a competitive advantage. YOU CAN'T.
19764,greed game. ty for free
19765,It is an okay game
19766,"So absurdley unbalanced, and the devs seem to make it worse and worse with every update. This game used to be loads of fun but the unbalances and the devs refuse to accept that there can be cheats in the game.  You can witness something that is impossible to occur in game and they shrug it off and ask for the replay of the match because ""there are no hacks for this game"". Anyone with any braincells know how absurd the statement is"
19767,"When Clash of Clans meets Heartstone and goes live and flips it from left to right, then you have Minion Masters!
Get ready to a nice card game, tons of combinations of decks and Masters. Choose wisely and destroy the enemy!

Had a lot of fun with this one!

"
19768,"Seems good on the first few days, but gets boring fast. The communty getting toxic if you play in a random team. You need to invest in good cards to have a chance, so its basicly P2W shit again. PLS God strike those moneyhoes with a lightning"
19769,"While it has a strategy, I feel like it's buried beneath the mediocrity and certain card mechanics in the game (e.g. multisummon cards and flying cards.)

Even upon entering my first online pvp match, the power of those mechanics was evident.

Upon entering the battlefield, I decided to use a multisummon card to attack while I got more mana.
He quickly responded by playing a flying multisummon card that instantly wrecked my minions.
I tried to summon some ranged minions to deal with them.
He summons two more multisummon cards.
I try to use the fireball spell (which doesn't work because all of his minions are flying).
He summons more multisummon flying cards.
I summoned more ranged to deal with him.
He casts a lightning spell to hurt me and kill my ranged minions.

And that last bit repeated for the next five minutes until he killed me. My first match. Nothing I could do but watch as the ""rarer cards you get later on or now by spending"" gave me no hope of fighting back.

The game seems like it could be fun..... if you banned half the cards in the entire game. At that point, is the game even worth playing as opposed to other mobile style games?

On a side note, this game was released in December 2016, and still in early access? I understand some developers dream big, but there isn't even really much in the game right now, combine that with the ""buy one get one free"" sale happening,
and some reviews saying they were gifted this game by an unknown source (possibly devs)... It just seems a little suspicious. Not trying to hate on the devs if they really want this game to succeed, but it just seems like you're beginning to get really desperate for a playerbase here."
19770,"This is basically a mobile game, pretty graphics, cartoony fun, quickly becomes obvious that its designed to be pay to win.  How pay to win? thats up for you to decide, I can see how you could play it free but I doubt you can stay very competitive."
19771,"Since i got this game for free, my opinion is a little skewed because things are always better when they're free. Moving on, Minion Masters is a neat little RTS (Real Time Strategy) type of game where you take control of a hero and a deck of 10 minions, buildings, or spells of your choosing. Your objective is to destroy the enemy base using the fun-sized playing field. All you have to do is just place your card, and it'll do its own thing. With a fairly big variety of cards it'll keep you entertained just trying out how they can all work together. And if you're good at strategy/card games, then you'll have fun climbing the ranks and decimating all the noobs on your way there."
19772,"I do recommend this game but keeping in mind it almost feels like League of Legends and Hearthstone combined(I personally am not a big fan of either of those games.). i started playing on a 7 year old windows 7 store bought laptop so my laptop is out dated and my ratings in this review will be based on that. 
 ----Graphics-----
As said before mty laptop is 7 years old and runs an amd processor with integrated gpu, so keeping that in mind the graphics are great while not being over the top. They do not get to the point of lagging and the game runs smooth.  Which is a key point to a great game that has online play. So with that being said i hae to give graphics an 9/10

-----gameplay-----
The game has 5 or 6 different ways to play while still being arena based. 1v1 ,2v2, you have challenge mode, expedition which are all fun. You have seasons in which you earn points and rank for rewards along with achievements and daily quests. weekly you have free characters you can test before you decide to buy them with the ingame currency. (I wouldnt spend real money on this game in the cash shop just my preference) besides having your normal deck you play with you can have alot more to be ready if you feel like a change of pase. some battles are slow and others can be really fast paced.
being the game is early access and is not completely finished i expect good things for it so i give it a 8/10 but only because of its kind of in your face cash shop.

music  and sounds are not all that unique atleast nothing stands out to me.
the characters are all pretty different in their own way and have many different play styles. 

so all that being said while i do recommend this game it is for those select few who enjoy these kinds of games not just anyone
"
19773,"Wot Poo Tink? Servers never works for Poo, not sure why :("
19774,Honestly... really great game. For the price 9/10. Matches are short. Game play is additing. PVP ladder. NOT P2W. Can team up with friends. Easy to pick up and play but takes skill to master.
19775,"As the noob master general, I approve of this game out the gate. If you like hearthstone with a touch of stratego and chess, then you will enjoy this game. It's a quick play and put down. Its repetitive, but fun to take it for a whirl, stop, and pick up again whenever you need a good distraction without 10 min wait times. Recommend friend coop and competitive play. I give it 10/10 noob friendly, 8/10 I don't want to read the rules just play, and 7/10 I don't need friends I have this game.  GG minion masters GG"
19776,"It's a good game, deserving of a thumbs up, even if they release some questionably balanced cards every expansion."
19777,"This is the worst balanced PvP game I have ever seen, and i'm a nearly 40 year old gamer.

Certain heroes are just plain stronger than others, certain hard to get cards out-do every other card that is even remotely similar...the people who created this have no clue how to balance all of the things in their game to make different playstyles possible. You pick the one of the two heroes that are overpowered, then make a deck of the cards that beat anything else and win against anyone trying to have fun.

Such a waste."
19778,Feels like a p2w mobile game.
19779,"I'm going to be honest, I saw the price, I saw the art style and I heard it being compared to Clash Royale and I just went ""Ugh..""
I thought it would be another microtransaction riddled unplayable mess.
But no, it's oddly enjoyable, there's no huge incentive for microtransactions and the gameplay is quite solid. 
The art style grows on you too.
For a game of this price, 9/10
As a game in general, 7/10
Thank christ for the generosity of the Moderators in one of my Discord servers because if they didn't gift me this game I wouldn't have found this little gem
"
19780,"It's pretty cool! I bought the upgrade to support the devs.

Every new DLC has been free for a bit at release, and they've given away several in other ways, too. Really good development team!"
19781,"Let me preface this by saying, I do realise that I only have like less than an hour on this game, and I know that, but I have played it enough to know that it deserves a negative review.

My main issue with this game is that it is incredibly pay to win. I got matched up against people who had legendary and supreme cards when I only had really basic cards. As you can probably understand, that doesn't make for a fun time with the game. I did get it refunded because I refuse to support developers who make pay to win games. If they change the business model in the future, I may consider re-buying the game then. But for now I would recommend you stay away from this game, unless you have plenty of money to spend in which case feel free to pick it up. But if you don't have plenty of money to spend, please avoid this game and don't support greedy devs."
19782,jcghjkgk
19783,Good Game)
19784,"Anyone want this game? They keep giving me free copies. The game is just an in game money scam. Pay to maybe win. but probably not.

TLDR: Game suck give free

Gave them all away hopefully..."
19785,Received this for free because I own Forced and it's a fun little time waster when you have nothing else better to do
19786,Clash royale with a little bit worse and with a texture pack.
19787,"It's not bad at all I played it for 3 hours. Got it for free in my inventory so I figured why not try it. It can be entertaining, Will I ever play it again? Chances are slim. Too many games nowadays. Just way too many.

7/10"
19788,"Neat gameplay, fun theming, good overall except for one large factor.

The monetization. Way, way too grabby, and selling premium currency with which one can buy random boxes is Not Good.

Also someone seems to have decided to go ahead and put up as part of a trailer up there a video with a Pepe in it, and ever since that frog got hijacked by the racist frothing dingbat crowd, it's been a bad sign.

so it's got some good ideas and some awful judgement."
19789,"The Short Version - it's actually a really fun game, but like many of these ""mini-mobas"" the matchmaking is *very* poor.  I really tried to play through the pain, but when 2/3 of my matches are against more advanced accounts there just isn't much point.  If/when matchmaking is substantially improved I might come back/flip my rating, but for now I can't take the stress."
19790,"Game is fun, but it has the worst kinds of F2P microtransaction BS.

Lootboxes – check
P2W – check
Extreme grind unless you pay up – check
Psychological warfare for your wallet? Damn straight….

Monetization model is cancer, avoid this garbage.

Edit: Also, if you DC, or if a teamate bails in team mode, you suffer rank loss...."
19791,it's good
19792,"this was an alright f2p game, but they just took away steam avatars and are now trying to sell avatars. you were already trying to suck money out of people at every corner but selling pics is going too far"
19793,"Pretty fun game, but it gets to feel extremely repetetive very quickly. The battles are fun, and you can pretty much just play for ten minutes and set it back down again if you don't have a ton of time during the day, which is great. The announcer is extremely annoying, and it seems like the dialogue might be a bad translation sometimes, but it doesn't get in the way of the fun.

I got it for free (not sure how... it just ended up in my steam inbox), but I would recommend this game if you can get it under $10."
19794,Very fun game! :D
19795,"Great game you can spent time on. Matchmaking is uber fast, hardly ever leaving me waiting for more than 10 seconds.
"
19796,"i liked my avatar. i do not accept to be punished because of a minority who can't use steam correctly or be decent adults (or good behaviored kids)

this is insulting and i'm unninstaling this. it seem like the devloper do not think things trought. its a shame because i initialy bought this game and even recomended it to friends. but now i see that it was a mistake. just like fallout 4 and diablo 3. 

this is really insulting.   do not bring all of your player base to the same level of the minority of trolls.."
19797,"Very fun, I generally find a match in five seconds and quick matchmaking is like omniimportant in something like this. A good fun game for a few rounds on lunchbreak for me"
19798,Fun and cheap game. Like the other forced games as well. This is just like a mobile game for those gamers that dont wanna play on their damn phones like me :D PC all the way.
19799,My graphics card died playing this FeelsGoodMan Clap
19800,If you like games like Clash Royale or Hearthstone you will like this game!
19801,Love it!
19802,"Real time strategy, pvp, tower defense, card game. Easy to get into, can be played 1v1 or 2v2. 

I usually am not one for virtual card games but I enjoyed this game, theres more to it than just selecting cards. Positioning of your unit(s) is just as important and even more so at times, spells have to be properly timed and manually aimed aswell."
19803,"Easy to learn, challenging to master. Great strategy and fun game."
19804,"Paid for a game with microtransactions. Minion targeting is not good at all, resulting in minion jank."
19805,"ive put a decent amount of time into this game and I can say i really enjoy it. i regular battle is addicting and fast paced. a tactical card game using minion synergy as well as card synergy with the master you use. 9 unique masters right now all vastly different play styles. i wait less than a minute per a match and i am ranked plat and i have half the cards and a legendary i dont use.  the game also has a lengthy tutorial/challenge which will teach you how to play the game and it will give you rewards as well. 

daily achievements will give you at least 1000 gold which will give you a power token which unlocks a card. if you dont play every day you should have a max of 3 daily quests that would be 3 power tokens, its not hard to unlock cards. also they give you free tokens every so often. every time you get a token you get shards. these shards are able to get you more cards. on top of that you have achievements i believe there are 30 of them each achievement will give you gold, shards, or rubies. so you can get more cards!. shards and rubies can be used to get masters as well so if you dont want to use rubies or shards use gold you get from leveling up. everytime you level up you get 1000 gold or shards or rubies or an arena skin. mostly 1000 gold. so getting cards is actually really easy to do. 

the team battle however has  match making problems. If you que solo i wouldnt recommend that. you could be silver and a get a wood tier team mate. I believe the intention was for you to have a friend and que up together which should make it alot more balanced. the game play for teams is still alot of fun but you do need someone to coordinate with you.

a lot of negative reviews say this game is pay to win. i dont think its any different from the way hearthstone maybe pay to win or the card game magick , or gwent. ive seen experienced players on stream using the start deck and make it too masters. one of the strongest masters is the free one to start with, that shows that it is a lot of part skill and knowledge not so much the cards.

there are constant updates that keep the game fresh. you dont have to pay for the battle pass to get the cards, you just get less opprotunities to get them . its 10 US dollars for a battle pass there have been two i believe that is a reasonable price for the rewards provided and it helps the devs keep on bring out new content by buying it. like i said i dont think this game operates any different from other card games. alot of the negative reviews are from people with less  than a hour or a couple hours on the game. 

this game is awesome, play it"
19806,"Got this for free because of owning Forced.

While nice at first, this is just a copy of Clash Royale with high cash payments very similar to f2p mobile games to unlock unless you enjoy grinding day in and day out for one thing. I was told by the devs in game chat this is not pay to win and that legendary minions aren't game changing.

Yet what did I come to experience? Game after game of being dumpstered on by legendaries. Or people in my same rank, having significantly better cards because they purchased premium currency to unlock everything in the store, and/or purchased the battle pass (yeah, just like fortnite) to get far more tokens. For example, by the time a f2p gets 2 power tokens(what you get to unlock cards and in-game/premium currency) from the free battle pass, someone who bought it gets 5, on top of extra points to quickly go through the tiers to further unlock more and more stuff.

Save yourself the waste of time, run it idle to sell the trading cards, then uninstall."
19807,"If you merged Heros of the storm and hearthstone together, and then aimed it at the mobile market this is what you would get."
19808,"Minion Masters takes the standard pages from your average mobile game. Loot boxes, daily quests, monthly events, the standards. Even though it's still Beta its clear the Devs put a lot of work into it. A lessor developer would have published the current build as finished which does speak well of how clean it looks. Easy interface, simple to learn system, tutorial, a good selection of cards and a decent rooster of possible champions to choose from. (Once you pay in game currency to unlock them that is.) That's not to say it's perfect. There are still glitches and improvements that are needed. You're most common glitch is probably just the quests not being marked when they're completed or the game not being able to register achievements even though Steam marks them down. I've probably gotten dozen of them or so and the bloody ""Unlock 3 achievements"" quest still won't register them. C'est la vie. 

The game tries it's best to offer lots of different ways to play and experience the game, but it does get repetitive as everything, despite the mode you play pretty much boils down to the same thing over and over again. I guess some people find this fun, but I need a breather from this type of insanity after a short while. Still there is promise of future game modes that may drastically mix things up so I guess that's a good thing, if it follows through that is.

Although I'm pretty sure the game is not pay-to-win, there are a number of obvious 'tricks' that are being used to get you to open your wallet. There's a feature in the game called the Battle Pass and this to me... felt like a huge insult to players who don't want to spend more money. You see, like all games like this, they have like ""PVP seasons"" where players can earn ""points"", called Glory in this game, to climb up Tiers and earn extra prizes. Nothing wrong with that. The Tier system is split into two branches, one free and one for those who buy the Battle Pass. (With in-game or real word currency) Again, there is nothing wrong with this. It's normal to offer bonuses to those who are giving you money. Why this bugs me is because the free branch has many, MANY, empty tiers. Hours of game-play to rank up will earn you no reward sometimes for multiple tiers of the pass and earning a rank up can take hours of game-play with ranks needing tens of thousands of points. For a new player you're looking at about 20 points per victory only unless you use the Wild Cards provided to you which rotate out, then about 1000. So a rank up can take about 50-60 matches and without the 400 point Wild Cards, this would be impossible. I'm not crying for rewards equal to those who paid extra, but nothing? Really? Once I realized I was essentially ""spinning my wheels"" I really lost a lot of motivation to play. 

So yeah, there are a few practices that I don't feel comfortable with. They're not evil choices, like EA, but they are defiantly amoral. Still the game isn't unplayable and does offer a bit of fun. Even if it's not my cup of tea and despite the fact that it feels somewhat unrewarding unless you're willing to shell out extra cash I can see many other people enjoying it. Honestly, I really liked the Commentator. Reminded me a bit of Blood Sport and Rock n' Roll Racing.

It still kind of sucks. The fact that I know I'm going to be be static for the next 50 wins, not matchs, playing the same cards over and over again because I litterally have no way to progress outside of pounding my head against the wall pretty much leaves you feeling hopeless and depressed. Maybe there are people who like that. Hmm, pay-to-have-fun. Yeah, that's what this is. I'll leave it a positive reveiw, because there are some people who like this type of game and Minions Masters does deliver it. Can't account for taste I guess."
19809,"Let's start with the monetization systems before we talk about the game. Minion Masters has 3 currencies in use. Gold is used for card rolls and some cosmetics that go on sale in the store. Shards are used for crafting and promoting cards, and primarily comes from card Tokens. Rubies are the paid currency, although small amounts can be earned from events and rare daily Tokens. The Glory system is not explained at all, but is basically a point system to speed up Battle Pass levels. Yup, this game has seasonal Battle Passes, with daily chests that provide 10x Glory for 3 wins. Any owned cards can be ""Promoted"" to increase Glory, which only adds to that Battle Pass progress.

Every Matchmaking mode is Ranked, solo and team battle ranking is used for Expeditions and Mayhem, I've never touched Draft mode. The rewards for ranking up are often very weak, comparable to daily quests. There is a 5-minute queue penalty for leaving team battles, but your teammate will also lose the match by default, even if you leave before the match begins. There is no penalty for leaving matches in solo, so it is far faster to quit rather than waiting out the defeat animations. In practice, I only play a few matches a day to complete quests, fill out the Battle Pass daily chest, get the daily Token, and stop playing as soon as possible.

The core gameplay has interesting potential, but quickly gets boring. Many units are very hard counters, so you can lose just from a bad deck matchup. The Glory system just compels me to play a weaker deck, because the faster progression is more effective than winning regularly. There are a lot of cards and effects to learn, plus all the titular Masters with different playstyles and synergies, but it's not really strategic or skillful. The base rewards from matches are awful, 40 gold when daily bonuses give thousands. Even hitting Platinum rank gave less gold than some daily quests. It's possible to play for free, but it's a bad grind. The card balance is not great, and constantly shaking. The global chat is also generally obnoxious. I wouldn't recommend Minion Masters over other card games."
19810,"good clash royale.

19811,"I got this game for free and had never heard of it before, now I cannot stop playing it.
I normally don't like competative ""card"" games, but this is a ton of fun. I would have happily paid for it."

Clash Royal without the mobile time waiting. No limited chest slot. No waiting time for opening chest."

19814,nice game i enjoy it
19815,"Simple and fun.
Great game to sit back and casually play while still providing a sense of skill-based competition.
It's interesting to see how other players manage their mana and how they time their summoning when playing in a team battle.
Entertaining while not annoying commentator is also a plus.
Deck building is simple and easy to customize and the fact that you can have multiple decks is great.

I don't always write reviews but this one feels worth it."

See recent reviews saying p2w, sigh, from a game you NEVER need to pay a penny to play. 
2 cards out of EVERY CARD THAT EXISTS are gated for a month when new , NO NEED TO INCLUDE THEM EVEN WHEN FREE VERY SOON, it's not hearthstone...


Have been playing this for ages with quite a few friends playing, everyone who played it once is still playing. Was stunned to see the reviews are not more favourable, constant dev feedback and updates, Game throws cards at you so there is no need to pay them a dime. First 200 hours play I didn't spend a single penny so people calling this pay to win are wrong. 
New game modes have been added in that time, fixes are swift, adjustments are swift. Honestly just play it and decide. ;)
 
(Also you get cards that make a game winning deck just doing the tutorial 1 player challenges at the start, remade that deck last night and still won using it. Knowing how to place is more important than the cards you have..)"
19818,The battle pass made this pay to win..
19819,"I got this game for free because I own Forced Showdown, but even if I hadn't I wouldn't have regretted the purchase. Deck building tower-defense sort of game. Simple in execution yet fun.

Even for an Early-Access game it's well polished. I've played full release titles less complete than this."
19820,Boring game 😪
19821,"Absolutely fantastic. Addictive, love how it's updated constantly, everything looks and refreshed with new ideas being added all the time. Love getting free things for following the Devs etc. Nice little touch that keeps me going back for more. Only realised recently that my emails were being separated into promotional on Gmail so missed out on quite a few giveaways. Anyway... Buy this now, absolute cracker. Fun, customisation, leveling up, rewards, daily tasks, online battles which are always bang on, as in it takes seconds to find a match."
19822,"This game is easy to learn, and very fun to play, either alone or with a friend. 
The rewards feel well paced, and you can work up to getting most things without paying any money. However if you prefer to pay, you can skip some of the begginer's deck building and wait-time. Either way it feels fair and not pay-to-win.

The voices are funny, the characters are cute & menacing, and the matches do not take long to play.
There are lots of different mechanics (flying, shield, rage...ect) so you can tailor your deck to whatever play style you want.

Overall good game, lots of fun, try it out!"
19823,Game has a major graphics stutter issue.  Has not been fixed.  Nearly unplayable.
19824,"Fun strategy game! Reminds me of the battle system in Skyworld, only this is 2D, of course. The battles are quick, and addicitve. The voice acting is a little funky, but for only $4.99, can't complain! I look forward to trying it out on my Surface Go."
19825,"Got the game for free, still wasn't worth it.

Gameplay: Generic mobile lane CCG. There are a few hundred variations of this on Android/iPhone. Is this one any better? No. In fact, in many ways it's worse.

Community: Like any f2p game, the community is primarily made up of people who speak no English, lag terribly and will use cheap tactics to win whenever possible.

Sound: Average. Not terrible. 

Graphics: The graphics are decent for what they are, but nothing special.

Story: There isn't one.

Overall: If you like these sorts of games, there are plenty of options for you out there, especially on mobile."
19826,This game is fun.
19827,The game has been a blast for me so far. After 3 hours of gameplay I can safely say that I will continue playing this game as it is casual and competitive at the same time.
19828,"Yeah this game is fun & is most assuredly worth the asking price. Just another game that wouldn't be here if not for Warcraft III. There's really nothing that I can compare this too unless you are familiar with WC3 custom games. Fast paced 5 minute rounds that can be done 1v1 or 2v2 with a friend. This is not your typical 'turn based' card game. It's a 'real time' strategy game with tactics, but however involve cards that are played when you reach enough mana. Rounds can last longer if both sides are evenly matched, making for a more intense session. Plenty of ingame achievements and quests to earn new cards and such. Thanks BetaDwarf for the free game, will recommend to friends that coop."
19829,"I was just popping through my library checking for a game to play when I saw the alert of a gift in my inventory. Checked, I couldn't see any message attached to see which friend sent it to me. After reading in the forum I saw someone with the same experience as me, and an admin saying it's a gift those who owns one of his games.

That was a nice salute to his customers, a nice remember of them. A good act.

A good act and a good game.

Simple, similar to that game of the mobile phone (two sides, throwing mob to kill each other), very smooth, beautiful, remembers me of FORCED (their style). But I like also the 2 v 2 mode where you can play with another player together against another two.

Clearly, I can't review badly this game neither neutral, absolutely I recommend this game not only because is a nice game but because developers are nice too. Did I said NICE?"
19830,"May 2020 update sucks. 
Buggy and laggy, can't submit a bug report. Battle pass is now monthly and costs 1500 rubies. The newest DLC is not worth the money at all, the good side is it's free this weekend. Lot's of toxic newbies.

=(

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May 2019, another start of a new season! 
Now that I have spent 90+ hours on this game, I believe it's time to update my review.

This game is fun! You can grind for those legendary cards just by playing everyday, they even gave a DLC pack for free for some time! (and more free stuff if you subscribe to their newsletter) Even though I still don't have all the cards and most of the masters, I am enjoying the game. 

Oh they went from premium to free to play XD

There are additional 2 free rotation masters so you can test them out, and decide if you want to grind for them. Also by joining a guild, you can get to try out some of the cards that you don't even own yet! 

I like that they have a different ladder rank for pre-made team battles, you can set up combos with a friend.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got this as a GIFT from the devs because I own FORCED.

I'm a fan of clash royale, a f2p mobile game. It is like it but with a nice twist :)
Instead of having the same tower to defend, you have different Heroes that have different attacks and perks. Good luck on balancing. So far i'm enjoying the game.

I am not far from the game yet. Did maybe 10 battles, and 1 2v2 battle. My current rank is Stone, after the first rank Wood. So I don't know yet if you can compete against whales. But most games with microtransactions are p2w.

If this were on mobile, and f2p, I would definitely play it everyday.

I would 75% reccomend this game :)"
19831,It's like if Heroes of the storm was HOTS.
19832,"Quick draw card slinging and oodles of loot. Multiple deck builds to suit play styles and more monsters than the cheapest nightclub in town.

19833,"Not gonna lie it is exactly like a mobile game, it's not too bad but it does take on that microtransaction ordeal. But it is something you could definetly enjoy time from time. If I were to compare it too a game it would be clash of clans because it plays almost exactly like it."
19834,"the game has changed so much since this game go F2P from P2P, so now i would recommend this game to players that are into this kind of game, personally i realised that i don't like this kind of game anymore, but this game probably the best in it's genre and its non-pay2win, although it can feel like it's pay to win when you're against a player that has a meta deck and you can't do anything about it since that's just how it goes in most card games in general."
19835,"Feels like a mobile game, but they put a base cost on it. 
The gameplay is alright, but the monitization of this game is so close to a F2P Mobile game, I was very suprised that there is a price tag at all. I got the game for free, likly so I would spend money in the cash shop and write a good review.

If you like mobile games, its worth a try, otherwise, avoid it. There are much better games out there"
19836,This game have so many cheater players. I hope this game use Valve Anti-Cheat
19837,Interesting and fun little clash royale game. Makes good use of your time versus fun gotten.
19838,"This a game like Clash Royal without the crap.

I honestly enjoy this game so much. I wish there were more cards. And more Masters. 
But they will get there. Still took me a long time to get most of the cards that i enjoy using themost. 

Excellent game."
19839,"The concept of Clash Royale just bigger and better. No P2W, active developers, lots of unique cards and an ever changing meta. I recommend getting this very very much. The only permanent upgrade which is 20€ goes sometimes on sale for 10€ is not required at all, but grants one tons of currency and it's nice to support the devs.

I really don't know why I ever put up wt cash royale lol"
19840,nice game ! :)
19841,GG
19842,"Game is full of bugs and issues.

I struggle playing a couple of games at a time without being disconnected or kicked.

You concede game 1, you leave and go into game 2, but the game reads as you leaving game 1 by accident, so will force you back into game 1 to see the defeat screen. Then forces you back into game 2 but you're already 20 seconds or so into the game so it's an automatic lose.

Don't waste money or time on this."
19843,This game is like Clash Royale but non-trash.
19844,Actually good.
19845,"Constant updates that seem to focus on getting money out of players.

Edit: But otherwise a fun game that I come back to very often when I am bored.
I would change this review to neutral if I could."
19846,Good game
19847,"When I first picked up this game months ago, I considered giving it a negative review, simply due to how many glitches I was encountering. The developers were fairly swift in fixing the bugs/glitches I had personally encountered. They also seem to make an appearance in-game via chat every now and again, allowing you to contact them directly if need be.

People seem to highly discredit Minions Masters for its cons, yet make no note of the games pros. There are PLENTY of both. The game is still changing quite often, the cards people use are often changing too. The meta shifts in this game with every patch. They also release new cards and balance previous cards every so often, which of course forces the meta to change as well.

I've read some negative reviews in regards to ""leveling up cards"". This mechanic is 100% irrelevant when it comes to the cards strength, despite reading negative reviews for this (I don't even recall it being a mechanic in previous patches). Currently, powering up a card simply awards you more points for a victory if you're using the card in your deck. This point system is only relevant to the some-what new ""season rewards"" that were released.

You DO NOT need to spend money on this game to make decent progress, at least not at this time. Investing $20 will give you a boost of a couple of weeks, but other than that.. Yeah. I have personally only purchased the ""Premium Upgrade"" and have been set ever since.

Overall, it reminds me of a mixture between Clash Royale and Hearthstone, two games I've invested a lot of time and money in. If you enjoy either of them, you'll probably find enjoyment in Minion Masters as well. I've also spent about 5,000% less money on Minion Masters, so that's definitely a plus too!"
19848,"Game was addicting for a while but the constant nerfing of everything has kinda ruined the fun of it. Sure there's always been ""exploitable"" cards but it's gotten to the point where nothing is allowed to be any good for the sake of ""balancing""."
19849,Good stuff!
19850,"Yet another competitive deck-builder, right? Well, sorta. The thing is, I would have given it a negative review based on how generic it is until they recently started spicing things up with new content, better resource management, better balancing, etc. The heroes are cute, the art style is cartoony but fine, strategy is medium-simplistic, and I like the new expeditions they introduced, typically 1 per week.

All-in-all, it's light fun especially versus a friend. 7/10"
19851,"This is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. Build a deck and plan your strategy cause is about to go down! The game can get really intense. Cast the wrong card and GG to you, sir/ma'am. I had a 16 min match (for Minion Masters standards that is a pretty long match considering that some matches can end in less then a min) and I lost it cause I cast the wrong card at the wrong moment. I feel the game has come a long way since it first came out and the game balance has gotten better. The new Battle pass addition to the game makes things a little more interesting with the nice emotes, skins and cards you can get with it."
19852,Sach a lovely game
19853,Do not challenge the Puff's will.
19854,"I personaly like this game ALOT but if you know how to play this game it gets boring pretty fast because it is almost immpossible to find an enemy that any good..... You just grinde through the ranks like a hot knife through butter..... I mainly play with a buddy but most of the time we are just trolling because it is immpossible to lose against 90% of the players and you start ""to fell like you have to help them"" by using spells without hitting anything just sothat they get a chance (but even then they dont use it). 

This has become my go to game when I just just wanna have some fun at seeing things explode or using a spell to kill a large group of enemys. 

BTW if you play this you need to read the cards and cardtexts they are pretty funny ;D


7/10"
19855,"Interesting game. :D
"
19856,Balance is shit
19857,"Update:
This is what happens when devs do not listen players. Check my comment below and you will understand why game is dead now and devs changed it to Free to Play :)
I am happy that devs bancrupted, they deserved it.

Update:
Devs did not fix problems I mentioned few weeks ago. Result? GAME IS DEAD. There are no players and you wait many hours for any battle.
This is what happens when devs are greedy and do not listen players.

Games was very nice till I reach Diamon +. 
EVERYONE on high ranks use one skill - Magma Storm. It kills everything on 50% of the screen. So you are against 2 enemiec which give them between 4 to 6 of these skills. 
From this point there is no more tactic or strategy. It does not matter what will you bring on board. It will die from this brainless skill. Thousand of people claim this issue to devs but they do not respond for this problem.
Anyway, all my guild, friends etc stopped play Minion Masters just because it is unplayable on high ranks. Team who spent more USD wins. If you do not spent any dollars you can have zero Magma Storms. If you spent 1000USD you can have 6 of them in your team = easy win.
Game Not recommended till Magma Storm (called Shit Storm) issue is solved."
19858,This is a very fun and enjoyable game ;) I honestly recommend this game to everyone! This game was gifted to me by a moderator of a steam group with the name of AccidentallyReviewed. I advise you to atleast check out this awesome group!!
19859,"It's clash royale without ridiculously impossibly unbalanced progression.

I have loved this games for a long time, but I can't recommend it right now, it's constantly updated in ways I don't understand, and they don't fix the clearly broken constant grind up every reset. It's just too tedious to get to a level where the outcome of your fights matter in the slightest, and they are way too focused on seemingly random balanec changes and new content.

There is also quickly no meaningful way to spend your earned gold and shards."
19860,sooo good
19861,pretty childish but... idk i got it for free soo no complains
19862,"As of 2019 I still have to give this game a thumbs down for lost potential. It's very good in a lot of ways. I love creating interesting deck dynamics and teaming up with my friends to work a good strategy. Matches happen quickly and the devs are frequently active in chat.

All that being said the upper tiers of the game are absolutely dominated by people who simply paid more for the game. They have all the best seasonal stuff the day it comes out and there is just no dislodging them. It really sucks to work hard on a clever strategy only to have it destroyed by swarms of high level, legendaries.

TLDR: It's very fun and cheap to start but, be prepared for that pay to win brick wall."
19863,"Uninstall & do yourself a favour, enough said."
19864,"This is a nice relatively balanced game. If you look at the leaderboards it shows you the decks used by the top ranking people and it is all diverse, unlike most ccg/ tcg games both digital and real. Devs seem to keep up with the meta and update individual things accordingly. Cards are accessible without microtransactions. The main thing to spend real money on in game are characters and skins. There is not a huge need or bonus from spending real money on cards because even legondaries are quickly obtainable, I got 3 within 20 hours of play. Small deck sizes (10 cards) help allot of issues both in needing cards to be good, and make the game more about the flow of your strategy. When, where and what order you summon your minions matter much more than what cards you own. It is all about formation and finesse, which keeps commons relevant and strategy crucial."

19867,"love this game, but its a pain in the butt to rank up. the devs need to make win streaks collect more pts towards your ranking for that season. that way i dont have to play 100 games just to get to plat. like right now im probably like 10 wins in a row and still bronze, with no loss this season.. put me in plat already lol i need a challenge."

19869,"Alas you have recieved your free copy (I hope) of Minion Masters. In excitement you run upstairs, dunk your pasty, pathetic body into a bathtub yellow paint and put on your favourite dungarees. You run downstairs as the 29kb game has finished installing and you're ready to play. The game loads up. Minion Masters - the epic logo is on your screen in all its glory, you squeeze the banana in your hand in joy and shout random words such as ""pineapple"" and ""potato"" as you begin to play the tutorial.

But wait... where are the minions, you wonder? ""Banana?"" you say as your lip quivers and your tiny little baby goo goo ga ga hands shake. You crumble. You cry your eyes out. These are not the minions you were anticipating. These are shit skylander rip offs. Your day has been ruined."

19874,"Bought it for me and my 5 year old nephew and ended up only playing with his dad for 45 hours(not back to back) and we slaughtered most people just trying to have fun.

Pros-You COULD play it with younger family members-

Cons-loot crates(you can earn new units from in game but it's pushing a pay to win system)
Recently came back and this game is a bug riddled mess

It overall isn't a bad game but only really play it if you are bored"
19875,"Clash Royal but with much more cards. I feel like in CR theses days its the same few cards that are played over and over, the meta is so narrow that it makes for repetitive gameplay. There seems to be many more possible playstyles in this game."
19876,"I'm changing my review. Developers aren't as responsive and working with the community anymore as they used to be. Back in 2017 this was one of the most promising game project I've seen, game didn't have many bugs, Devs were in constant touch with the whole community and everything was fixed in max. a week. Now they're focusing more on adding more and more content (gimme gimme money) and simply overlooking - despite a ton of complains from the community - all the bugs that have been around for a long time (some more than a year), broken mechanics, way too easy ranking up (for example, the biggest rank you can achieve - Grand Master, can be achieved within a week of playing the game) which makes it zero accomplishment. I have a ton of hours played, but it's getting more and more obvious that they stopped playing their own game, not seeing the complaints are real. They aren't capable of keeping almost any veteran players due to all those reasons and seem to not care about losing them.
This game was one of the most promising games I've seen in years, but due to developers losing interest on their own, I do not recommend playing it.
It is super addictive, but you will see super fast how some cards are simply broken, some super neglected and just how long it takes for anything to change.
To add to all of this, they're losing me as well, a player from EA since Jan 15th 2017."
19877,"This Game Is In Early Acces But It Has A Lot Of Features,I Think It Deserves A Lot More Attention Form The People!"
19878,"Game hasn't the ability to copy a deck from one slot to another, rather than needing to rebuild it.  ""Write deck on paper"" - said developer. Hahaha, cool.

November 2021: game hasn't the ability to copy a deck from one slot to another"
19879,"Super fun game with good support. The team constantly adds new stuff, so if the game starts to get stale, a nice update will help you get lost in the game for another 10 hours. For fans of mobile games, tower defense, simple games, strategy, collectors, etc."
19880,"It might not seem like it but the more you play it, the more you realize it is a simple pay to win."
19881,"Update:

- I see bots were added as a training option as I had requested on my previous review. 
Big respect to the developers. 

I still have to try the game again to write a better new review.

My current rate:
▀▀▀█ 　 █ 　 ▄█░ █▀▀█ 
░░█░ 　 █ 　 ░█░ █▄▀█ 
░▐▌░ 　 █ 　 ▄█▄ █▄▄█"
19882,Different war modes(my favorite is team battle).Like the Clash royale on the phone BUT MUCH BETTER...
19883,"I bought the game when it was on sale as a meme as some of my frineds had bought it as a meme as well previously my mindset starting it was ""oh its just a shitty clash royale ripoff"" but this is actually really fun and in my opinion a better game than cr"
19884,"An early access look at this title:

https://youtu.be/0KMxwd7j8yI"
19885,"So a friend gifted me this game because he said he had an additional key he did not need. At first I was a bit sceptical but tried it anyway. I'm also a great fan of FORCED so maybe the developers turned this game into something great.
So I played the game over a couple of days and spent a few hours in it. So here a quick basic review:

The gameplay itself is nothing new, you pick a character, pick a deck and then summon minions at some location on your mapside and cast spells with mana in order to defeat the opponent. Mana accumulates slowly over time.
Your character also slowly levels and with each level up you get access to special abilities. There are two bridges connecting each map side and controlling them gives bonus exp.
The same gameplay already exists since at least one and a half decade and there is really not much difference to other games of the same genre. There are a few twists, which make this game stand out a bit (compared to the 15 years old games I played) and the developers really tried to make the game more strategical, but all in all coming from an RTS and Turn-based strategy background it all feels like luck is involved too much. The right draws at the right time make all the difference in this super-fast paced game (matches often last less than 3-4 minutes).
Starting a match with 4 different cards and all of them are either too cost intensive or get hard countered by the opponents spawned minions feels shitty. Changing deck setup is also a) ressource intensive as you accumulate new cards/ressources for cards very slowly (or I had not much luck there either with almost only duplicates) or b) every deck can seemingly get hard countered by another deck. Since your opponent will go for a strategy you cannot know before you go into a match, you also have to be a bit lucky to not get wrecked by an opponent with a special strategy you don't know and cards you have no access to yet.

Furthermore I have to criticize the ranked system. Apparently every month ranks get reset to Silver 5 as I have been told. I also was sent from Diamond 5 back down to Silver 5. Were before on my climb I was mostly facing people with the same cards I could use and a skill level that you would expect I suddenly face players who have hardcore meta decks and strategies you have to have a counter ready right away. I can only speculate which rank they belonged to before but it certainly wasn't anything below Platinum. Meaning low rank players have to fight high rank players at the start of the season and subsequently get punished for not being as good or invested into the game. They lose rank points and have a hard time climbing back to the rank where they were before the end of the season until ranks have stabilized to some extent.

Normally I would rate this game something along the lines of might be fun for certain people, but since there is no neutral or so-so button, I vote it down."
19886,This game is seriously fun as you learn more.
19887,"I saw some of my friends playing this, so thought I would give it a go. I was not dissapointed! Fun and timekilling game. Especially fun in 2v2 mode!"
19888,"Very,Very,very,very and super duper fun it looks shit on when you see the cover or the screenshots but if you play it youll absoloutely change your mind.download this game and dont judge it by its cover.*quote* dont judge a book by its cover. NICE NICE NICE!"
19889,Just a time killer to me.
19890,Very easy to pick up and play. I like to do this one for my livestream viewers so they can get items or swag
19891,"I am not the PVP type of game player, but this was fun. after about 16 hours my  RPG / strategy  exp had me unstopable but for players in the top most ranks. It lost its shine. It is worth a play. Card decks style game comes to life with RTS."
19892,This game has been ruined by the constant nerfs of any good deck combinations and the removal of wildcards by the dev team bowing to the professional community rather then the wider casual community voting to keep wildcards. would not reccomend to any all my friends have stopped playing this and is becoming less fun each month
19893,Epic game
19894,"Solid game, but the QA is garbage and they don't patch often enough.  A lot of so-called ""OP"" stuff really isn't, but I can see that certain cards/combos/masters would be tough for relatively inexperienced players to deal with."
19895,good
19896,"The game is good. The game is very good in fact. Do you enjoy the call and response of checkers and the mana dependant cardplay of Hearthstone? This game is for you then. As a plus, the game is not at all pay to win, with there being no ""End All Be All"" card, just good decks; and its also pretty easy to get new cards regularly. I for one have not spent a single cent on the game (thanks Humble Bundle) and have had lots of fun playing both solo and with freinds.

On a sidenote for those complaining about how Legendary cards are overpowered and need to be used if you want to win: Get Good. Its a card game and not fucking pokemon. I have chewed up legendary decks for breakfast using only common and rare cards, and hell; I dont even own a legendary and I have had no trouble countering them. Use strategy not brute force."
19897,Don't own any legendaries? Guess you weren't actually trying to win then.
19898,Clash Royale??!
19899,"One of my commenters pointed out a bug in the game at 2:03 minutes into this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_51R_V33jp8&t=123s 
A minion should have been hit stunned but wasn't causing me to lose the game, as far as the game goes
its alright but I feel like new players vs veteran players is generally a big mismatch, hope the review helps, keep working on it!"

19901,"Clash Royale revamped. 
Good game, but not my kind of jam."
19902,"Absolute garbage of a game, and not because of its rng-base, but because of it internal balance - you get an opponent with a legendary card? Well boyo you are fucked big time, as this game is actually based on how good creatures you have in your deck. Skill is not really involved.
Also they included a 3rd party software into EULA. Enjoy being used for mining."
19903,"Take Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm (or any other MOBA) and combine them together; that's Minion Masters. It's such a fun game, a great timekiller, and I'm super excited to play through it as they continue to add fun content."
19904,Fun way to kill some time
19905,"Enjoyable card battler where positioning and timing are important.

The fact you can play 2v2 is even better."
19906,"RECOMMENDED: YES

A nice daily multiplayer game to come back to. Feels like Heartstone, but with an actual battlefield where your cards come alive. Doing single missions and team missions to earn points, experience, coins, loot crates and more. Earning battle cards which you hope are legendary or just rare instead of common/uncommon. Controls are responsive like it should, nothing wrong with this game.

Don't mind the chat, it's toxic and filled with little babies showing off their ""skills"" and comparing them towards real life as if they mean something. Some of them are real enough to make a difference, you will notice it, unless you are one of those babies.  (nothing wrong with being a baby, we started the same way once in our lives) xD"
19907,got to rank one I guess

19909,"An interesting strategy game that I can recommend it.

+ I especially like 2vs2 mode because the 1v1 is slow at least for me.

+/- No lag or fps issues. But sometimes there is a server error that could cause an issue.

+ My favorite desk hero would be skelly op resurrection.

+/- Build an ultimate deck of cards to find out that you cannot use the same one.

+/- There are pve battles in special events but 90% is focused on pvp.

+/- Ranking system and its rewards.

+ Developers hands out stuff for free (dlcs, games).

- Bit of grind but hey got it for free.

- Loot roulette that is 95% times shit drop or owned.

 -/+ Update 76 removed steam icons. I liked that featured a lot but I can see why it got removed.

- Game is sadly meta in the ranked game (or if you get a counter deck that's pretty ouf).

These unbalanced seasonal cards that are just better by a small bit. I would personally prefer like vanilla game mode and on another hand a seasonal cards game mode 5.5/10."
19910,"i played a little bit, its ok..."
19911,"More than fun gameplay, a lot of stuff to do and collect and it's easy to pick up and play and with the recent updates the graphics look amazing. I can also honestly say the game always felt rewarding and never felt like a waste of my money, if you're not gaining more minions or resources to have more deck possibilities then you're always making a new strategy that's even more potent than the last, because the sheer despair and helplessness of your opponent as you deal the last blow is completely addictive and winning is so satisfying for that. 

There are cons though and though i feel that it isn't neccesary to have, there are dlc's that have to be bought that really do help to have especially after the last few updates. Those are the premium upgrades and the premium battle pass, both in which help you get resources, masters and cards faster. I will say the hard work you've done to grind something out is always less than what someone who bought the premium upgrades would have in half that time you put in, especially in regards to the battle pass, ALTHOUGH none of which affect ability or win rate so it's cool.

In general the game is an awesome cheap and soon to be F2P game and if you've got the time the game is completely doable without buying a thing unless you want the premium edition."
19912,"*sigh*, I really want to love this game, and deep down I really do. But the path the devs have taken has gone for the worst. I love BetaDwarf, they have a very Nintendo feel to them, players first, fun with friends first and coop friendly and enjoyable games…but like Nintendo they just went downhill. Like Nintendo these people are milking their franchise to the ground with every game being a “Forced” game, but unlike Nintendo that just managed to get their shit together, this company isn’t. Their newest update makes me sick not like their previous expe 2.0 was any better, we all know how rude the devs were. BetaDwarf must think the loot box craze is still in it’s early stages with everyone not complaining as much and companies getting away with it. Minion Masters isn’t only a payed game, but you now have to pay (around £6.99 extra) to get an extremely long and stupid “Battle Pass”. Last I checked BetaDwarf only free games do this to gain some extra money. This game also feels very pay to win…even if it’s a payed game, it’s rather disgusting (yes i know it will be free in the future). Very glad I got it for free cause I owned every other Forced game and rather enjoyed them. BUT even after I shot every last bullet from my gun at BetaDwarf and hating on them, this game is far more fun that the mobile version made by (tries not to throw up) Suppercell, Clash Royal. That game is even worse if you can imagine…not like that’s saying anything for Minion Master but it’s what’s keeping me with them. Yes, I’ve played and unfortunately payed in Clash Royal for about a year (when it first came out, only payed once thank the lord). 
Either way Minion Masters just shot itself in the foot with its update, and it will lose a lot of players with the new “Battle pass”. Shame another game had to die cause of developer’s greed and not noticing what it did good."
19913,top teir
19914,Addicting strategic game play.
19915,it has replayability and is not P2W
19916,"I actually got this game from a code when ordering stuff online and gave it a go. Since then I got the premium package on sale.

I really like the gameplay. The game is well made and everything works. I won't say that Minion Masters has ""potential"", because it would give out the wrong idea. Although this is an early access title, it's already well thought out and seems to have a workable monetization method. The game is currently quite well balanced, and I believe the devs would have a hard time ruining this game even if they tried, unless they do something incredibly stupid. They do, however, have to be really careful when adding new cards to the game in the future.

You don't have all the cards when you begin, but you don't really need most of them either. You can get a long way with just the cards you start with. You get new cards in multiple ways, e.g. completing achievements, using power tokens, playing draft or using shards. So the more you play the bigger your collection will become.

I really liked playing draft, and for new players I would recommend playing quite a bit of draft after picking up some experience. In draft you pick randomized masters and cards from the whole selection, so it's a great place to try out how they work before you add them to your collection with shards. Don't play your first games in draft, though, since draft tickets cost gold. I would advise that you play battle or team battle until you reach silver / gold ranks because the players in draft can be really good.

Tips for using resources: buy masters with rubies, cards with shards and power tokens / draft tickets with gold. In draft, if you get 7 wins you get even.

If I had any bad things to say about Minion Masters, I would say that draft MU is sometimes bad and easily fixable. I hope the devs address this issue. Overall it's a great game and well worth it on the current sale (0,99 €). The premium pack % bonus is negligible in my opinion, but it's still a good value for rubies/shards at the moment if you would prefer that."

19939,"Super fun card game, it's suprisingly interesting and strategic. I say surprisingly because if you just look at one match you might (I did) think it's just about throwing every minions in the arena and the most overpowered will win, but when you play it it feels nothing like that, espicially in 2v2 IMO. Additionaly, it avoids lots of flaws from the GC genre.
I love FORCED universe and bestiary, playing the different cards actually makes you feel something, it's hard to explain but those monsters have personality in their design, which makes them kind of endearing ! Especially when you already play the previous games.
Conclusion: Great job BetaDwarf !... way underrated unfortunately... maybe if your communication was as great as your products your games would be more noticed, because that's the kind of game that could be a hit on twitch and get a lot of gamers to follow the trend. It's easy to pick up, fast to play and addictive with a very reasonable pricing. And the connection between your games should lead people from one game to the others."
19940,"Quite good.

"
19941,Very refreshing take on common gameplay models right now.
19942,"Very fun, if you like deck building games or have even rage quit one so you are looking for something similar but still more skill oriented this is it.
Combat is pretty cool, the game tends to reward you a lot for playing it regularly, the 2v2 is also nice + when you buy the game you get a free copy to gift to a friend.
Very recommended"
19943,i haven't played the famous version of this genre on mobile so i had fun playing this.
19944,I really enjoy this game
19945,"Pros:
-The game is really better than that mobile Clash Royale game.
-This game is totally skill based and there is no level up system.
- Most important is that the game is fun.

Cons:
- Poorly optimzed and I am accepting this only for now as it is in early access. Getting lots of FPS drops in GTX 1060 even in a small arena game with low poly 3D characters. 
- More cards needs to be added in game

"
19946,good game
19947,"The game is ok, although they lowered the difficulty since a couple of months ago. But the worst part is making duos random vs. duos premade, so, I cant recommend the game at it is."
19948,Best Clash Royale like game out there with no pay2win mechanics
19949,"The game is cool, I took it on sale when it was still on sale. It tightens up. there is even a 2 by 2 mode, which is very cool."
19950,"[b]Words of honesty after 1000+ hours spent in this game.[/b]
Early on this game was fun. Contact with developers was clear and easy. 
Game was not free-2-play, you either had to buy key to beta or get it from streams or social media.. at least stuff were doing nicely.
Game was totally fair.. althrough mediocre about rewards for playing it. 

[b]First shot in the leg...[/b]
Game became free-2-play + discord release. 
That brought many bad players, most likely under 12 kids that just ""do stuff"" without using brain cells. Making game way harder to deal, and way more frustrating. 
Many veteran players were complaining about that, but developers remain silent.
If you became too agresive sharing your honest opinion on their discord - ban. - Happened to me, and to many other players who played this game for 1000 hours as well, and seen this game development from the beginning basically. This is how elites are rewarded.. -> banhammer.

[b]Second shot in the leg...[/b]
Betadwarf made reworking battlepass and cards system. Currently new cards are available only for battlepass owners.. turning this game into advantage from the purchases. Which is no more no less but turning the game into the Pay2Win in it's very core.

[b]Contact with developers is non existent currently, it's a myth.[/b] Game is unfair, developers adds more cards without idea how to balance the exisiting ones... Community is toxic, some acts like were retarded. I'm not afraid to use these word.. Either uber bad players, bots perhaps, or AFK players, who does not even bother to play one card entire match. This is reality, and gameplay in nutshell.

I love visual changes this game went through, but this is not enough.

Also.. [b]report button is fake[/b] feature. Reported myself maaanyyy players for griefing, did not receive any message back that any action was taken (aka CS:GO, where this function at least pretends that's working).

[b]If you did not started this game yet, don't start it.[/b] Not worthed. Basically clash royale currently. Developers cares about money and income only, not bothering about game balance or implementing ideas or solutions from dedicated/veteran players.

EDIT 05.01.2021:
Developers note from the Patch 1.19 Economy Adjustement.
[b](...)we've detailed how we need to make adjustments to the Minion Masters Battle Pass system in order to ensure that the game isn't [u]""too free""[/u](...)[/b]"
19951,"What is Minion Masters ?

A really cool take on the subgenre of arena-lite strategy games, do you know clash royale ? this is a really cool pc version of that game with much nicer 3D viuals and a cool and interesting building and deck mechanics into it, it surprisingly has a very cool personality of its own and has enough deep layers in its overall gameplay mechanics, it tries to be its own thing instead of copying and running with the subgenre its based on, after finally leaving early access it shaped up to be a very good game.

I played this game enough during the early access period and moved on but for people who are looking for a good time and like this type of gameplay, giving it a chance is the way to go, its out of early acess and has a very active playerbase, its also free so, no reason to skip this one at all since its a good pick."
19952,"First of all, I'd like to thank the developers for reaching out so quickly after I posted this review. When I wrote my original review (see below), I was frustrated in general with the ubiquity of data collection, and I think reading their new EULA and privacy statement was the straw that broke the camel's back. However, the fact that someone was so quick to reach out reminded me that the games and entertainment we consume are made by real people, and I may have been too harsh.

I used the word mediocre to describe a game that I was quite happy with. As a person with responsibilities that are probably shared by many of the developers themselves, Minion Masters allowed me to get in a couple quick minutes of fun gaming without a huge time investment. I really appreciate that about the game. I've left my original review unchanged for the sake of my own accountability, but I'd like readers to ignore the word ""mediocre"" when reading it.

However, there are part's of the EULA that still trouble me. For example, our data is collected and used ""to target and personalize our marketing communication, offers and advertisements that we display on our websites and services as well as those of THIRD PARTIES based on the combined data we have collected about you."" (emphasis added)

I know that BetaDwarf is by no means the only group that collects data, and I know that for some reasons (transactions, accounts) they have to. It's those ""third parties"" that are concerning. If BetaDwarf could shed some light on this, I'd appreciate it. I hope it shows that I'm a reasonable person who's just become cynical.

----Original Review----

Uninstalled.

It was fun for a bit, but this [strike]mediocre[/strike] title isn't worth the private data that they scrape from me and sell to any third party willing to pay. Thanks to the new General Data Protection Regulations, BetaDwarf and other companies are required to disclose that they do this. It's just creepy, so one less piece of spyware in my system that didn't offer me that much enjoyment or utility in return was an easy choice. I encourage other users to make that cost-benefit analysis and decide for themselves whether any software that does this is worth it."
19953,"Absolutely fantastic, addictive game.  Very much a 'just one more round' feel until you realise the sun is coming back up.  Not very compatible with having a family - I had to uninstall it several times, and eventually found a way to make Steam forget I owned it.  Thankfully now they've started charging a (small) amount, so I'm managing to resist sticking it back on my machine."
19954,"Gives you more headache than fun.

19955,Good game :) :D
19956,Pls support 21:9 display!!!
19957,Great game!
19958,"holy sht this game is freaking good , not that i liked playing clash royal it sucked a  lot ,, but this one is pretty amazing .. a good time killer"
19959,Fun game too play xD
19960,"Okay, I thought this game was kind of whatever because I got it for free and there were so many giveaways for it BUT it turned out to be so much fun. I love collecting the different minions and leveling up and the graphics are pretty cool and remind me of something Nintendo-ish. I'd give it a go. The price is pretty decent for it as well."
19961,"At first this game seems like just another ""pay more to win more"" type of game. After a few hours I just realised that it's much more about strategy than having the ""Legendary cards. When you just start playing and learning the meta game, gold and rubies will start adding up in you account, just by playing. Each 1000 gold will basicly give you a new card (via Powertokens), and quickly you will start adding up in your collection. You can earn every card in the game just by playing, or even trading (for shards) and craft the card you need be yourself. Admitted your collection will grow faster if you pay for power tokens, but its not mandatory.

The game it self is really a ""rock/paper/scissor"" kinda game. Added to that there is the deck building aspect, and the sneeky ways to combine cards that makes this so much fun, and a really great strategy game as well. No matter what card your opponent throws at your there is for the most part a cheaper counter. And getting the ""upper hand"" in mana management is a big factor in beeing succesful.

I wont go into details on specific cards, but with currently around 100 cards in the game there a endless combinations of making a deck of 10 cards and see the minions battle it out  :)

Reminds me of an old game called ""Magic the gathering battlegrounds"" , and thats not a bad thing.

I highly reccomend this game, it can be very addicting :)"

19979,"A far better game in the genre similar to Clash Royale and South park: Phone destroyer

this game removes the p2w bullshit since there is no card leveling in this one...this makes game balanced and every match feel fair. 

The game has basically no bugs, runs smooth, has far superior gameplay to CR and SPPD....if you liked those at least a little bit...you will love this game

it shits on all other games of the genre with its great design, decent economic model and great skill-based gameplay that is both fun for begginners and challenging for veterans"

I pretty much gave up playing the game after a while due to soooooooooo many changes to the cards and all the new packs and dlcs and the new metas, which might be a good thing for some people. Anyways, fun game. :)"
19985,Great game for both solo and team based matches.....its like Hearthstone cards +  Dota creeps unique concept and its evolving with time... Have only two problems  it can use reduce prices in game as opening treasure keeps giving you duplicates instead of giving you unique cards to increase your competitiveness  and  completing your card collection...UI needs to be improved it feels like mobile game interface very clunky.. also sometime FPS drops very badly needs to improve on performance
19986,"Now mind you, the game itself is good. It's pretty fast paced, skill dependent, the cards are well balanced and the masters themselves add a nice flair to gameplay. 

Now why can't I recommend it? The grind is too much, even having bought ""premium"". Instead of card packs, you get tokens, which unlock 1 card. Similar to Hearthstone, your fifth token will guarantee a rare or better. However, you earn only around 50g per match and with each token costing 1k... you're going to be needing 20 matches for 1 card or 100 matches to get a card pack equivalent in Hearthstone. However, daily quests do offer a minimum of 1k gold, meaning that you will at least be able to earn 1 card per day, with up to 3 quests at a time.

N.B. I no longer play Hearthstone but I thought it would be an apt comparison.

You also get daily logins which generally give you a bit of gold (I think around a hundred) with the fifth also being a bit better, though the rubies (real world equivalent money) are small enough that I'd rather just have more gold so I can get cards which can turn into shards (used to craft new cards or buy new masters), which leads into another problem. Masters are unlockable with shards or rubies (money). 

Although cards aren't restricted to particular masters, they do influence the way you build decks. Having them locked and without anyway to unlock them except through paying with real money or shards (which are shared with cards) definitely increases the grind.

To give you an idea of the card cost breakdown I'll state their cost followed by their salvage: Common 50 (25), Rare 125 (50), Supreme 500 (125), Legendary 2000 (500). 

Overall, while Minion Masters is a good game that does not heavily lean on having legendaries to be competitive, its heavy grind to build a complete set as well as to earn Masters severely restricts your ability to create your own deck and have fun."
19987,Start up this game and give it a shot. From what I can tell so far it's quite fun and easy to learn - hard to master. Cool game if you have little time and even more fun with a buddy.
19988, I hate that I like this game
19989,"this game has a lot of different things to do in, get all the cards, get all achievements, get loads of wins, beat the dev`s, and much more."
19990,"Really fun card based strategy game. Definitely not P2W, you can earn all the in game currencies at a reasonable pace without buying anything and can get pretty far in the leagues without spending a dime. The developers are constantly adding new cards and updating the game with content, definitely worth looking at."
19991,My girlfriend gave this game to me as a gift randomly. I played it for like 7 hours straight. O.O I love it!

19997,"This isn't a full-time game to play , this is a game to play for a little while.
  A few hours of fun and the mechanics are fine but then it really turns repetitive to the point that you see the same cards over and over.
  I recommend it if you want to spend a few hours or minutes when you have nothing to do.
cheers"
19998,"Not enough variety to set yourself apart, and not enough players."
19999,"Pretty much better version of clash royale.

20000,so fun game 100/10
20001,Somehow .. Addictive
20002,Great game!
20003,"Its a nice game, awesome card game/strategy game hybrid, great graphics and nice soundtrack!"
20004,"These guys had a good game few years back, but then they decided to make it as bad as they can for whatever reason. 

No balance, no work on interface, aweful coding (sometimes game stacks in loading and you get a lose, over time it starts eating your ram and lagging). They even tried to create a ""remastered"" version of the same game, but still couldn't even do that. 

And they love to ban (permenantly delete your account) anyone who expresses negative feelings about the game in the ingame chat. 

Basically you can play one of these modes:

1. Solo ranked - full of broken decks due to no balance, especially with new cards (sometimes it takes a year for them to fix some card that is literally everywhere in most used decks). Only recently they deleted ability to use wildcards in this mode (copies of same card).

2. Randoms (randomly picked 2vs2) - full of idiots. Literally most of the times you get an absolute idiot for your team and have to carry him to the victory. They tried to fix this mode and made it unplayable, which is why less and less people can get to GM (grand master) these days. Hidden elo points make the game give you the worst teammate and suffer instead of having fun. The higher you go the less chances you get someone who can play.

3. Premade duos - you pick a partner and play vs non-random duo. This is even worse than previous 2 modes, because poor balance shines in this mode the most. If you have low rank, it's fine, but if you get higher, you can only suffer.

4. Draft - mode that has not been updated for years and thus totally sucks. They don't care about draft and thus the best mode became one of the worst. Too random (you can pick 1 out of 3 cards while creating the deck, and most of the cards require specific deck).

5. Adventures - their attempt to copy pve mode from Hearthstone, which also totally sucks, because it's either too easy or too hard, and absolutely too random. 

So long story short - if you like to endure mental pain and have no life, this game is perfect for you. If not, you can play it for a while, but don't expect much of it. And the moderators and devs only care about money, so don't expect anything from them either. I actually bought early access for this game and paid twice to boost my progress, but they banned me for expressing my negative experience about current game development."
20005,I really have nothing bad to say about this. I'ts a great game if you're into these types of games.
20006,it's a fun game actually
20007,What Clash Royale should be. Beautiful graphics. Fun gameplay.  Different modes. Good ranking system. Friendly community. Less than 10 seconds Queue. AND NO PAY TO WIN!
20008,🍌🍌🍌🍌 Bananas
20009,"Underrated game, normaly i don't like this kind of games but this one actualy very fun to play."
20010,Its funny
20011,Nice
20012,hands down best game ever made
20013,"its fun with friends, dont play too long or the trolls will rape you"
20014,"Pretty fun game for 5 bucks, but once you get anywhere above Silver enjoy going against the same 5 decks. play the game with 3 friends. you'll probably get more longevity from it."
20015,"it's fun, but the monetization isn't so great

matchmaking is somehow fast and fair even with a relatively small playerbase

there's still fairly typical mobile phone traps here though. the game is very front loaded with one time rewards associated with specific achievements and profile levels, and when you first start out the rewards come at a good pace. after a good few sessions, you'll have exhausted everything and what you're left with is a fairly long grind that will demand a lot of your time, one way or the other - either by pacing yourself out over literal weeks, or playing matches for a pittance of income.

card ""packs"" cost 1,000 gold. a win, even with the premium dlc upgrade, is in the range of 50-90 gold depending on a few factors. a single ""pack"" gives you ONE CARD. there are roughly 115~ cards in the game as of this review, and you can have 3 copies of each. roughly 3.5 hours of play will convert to a single card for you, after you've exhausted your quest / one time reward resources. even if you somehow never draw duplicates, that's already converting to hundreds of hours of grinding. the newest ""battle pass"" update provides more rewards for you based on the number of copies of a card you have in your collection for your current deck, which provides exponential reward increases for players that (probably) don't need them. Basically, the system is set up to get you spending money as soon as possible to bypass a very lengthy grind. other elements of this system try to encourage you to play every day so you don't feel bad about missing out on once per day lump sum rewards. it's manipulative as hell and i really don't like it.

a couple of things work in its favor. the basic cards are VERY high quality, and even people topping the ladders right now primarily use basic and uncommon cards, which you can craft with (relatively) little time or money invested. a playable deck only ever has 10 cards, and the structure of the game is balanced around only ever allowing you to keep two duplicate cards in this deck. even very high quality cards you will likely only want to run one of, so you're more likely to draw playable cards in any given situation. 

is it fun? yes. for a (currently) $5 entry fee, which also includes a bonus key you can gift to a friend, it's not too much to ask. it occupies a weird space where you and a friend can competitively play a tactical card game against 2 other people, which is a somewhat unique feature in this space. 

but the playtime:reward balance is so poorly adjusted right now, seemingly to push you into buying gems to get more card packs. i feel that a reduction in price for cards and maybe a slight bump in the cost of cosmetics would be a far more fair method of extracting money from the playerbase. hopefully we'll see those adjustments by the time they remove the entry fee - i would like to see this move farther away from a ""Free to Start"" model and more towards a ""Free to Play"" model.

I have since revised this review. The monetization is getting worse and doesn't really show any signs of improving. It's still fun and there aren't many options for this kind of game on PC yet, but at the end of the day it's becoming more and more like a mobile phone game, the exact opposite of what I'd expected or hoped. This is leaving themselves open to competition, anyone that can do the same but with a retail price or a better free to play model can probably take the entire market for this product. For now, it's still an okay game to try with a low barrier to entry, but if you want to take it seriously you are probably going to be forced to spend money to stay competitive, and the game doesn't even make you feel good for putting money into it."
20016,"super fun 
its a good $5 worth of fun"
20017,"Great competetive strategy game, works like the mobile game clash royale, but aint pay to win.

Friendly community."
20018,Actually really good
20019,"All is good, but it fades in the moment when you get paired in ranked matchmaking against the same guy 8 times in a row. And it happens on a regular basis.

Total BS."
20020,"a fun game where u build a deck of cards and then this triggers the card creature to appear on screen in the arena where u fight your monsters from your cards against an opponent and their monsters from their cards. its addicting. fun. and there's always someone better just when you think you got it.  Its like chess in that u have to use strategy and defend as well as go offensive.  Lower cards are more quick but do less damage. Higher cards take a couple more seconds to use but they are usually worth the wait... unless your opponent is attacking you with numerous minions at once.  Different heros u choose have different special attacks that are incorporated in the match along with your cards.  Fun strategy game.... I recommend this game for a fun casual gaming experience. Matches last anywhere from 1 minute to 10 tops. usually matches are 5 minutes long.  after getting the game i have not spent a penny and i have a deck that can compete with most anyone.  it takes a lil while to get the hang of it but all u do is click on the right cards at the right time and your creatures will do the rest.  There are different choices for main character with different special abilities and skins too...all of which you can get for free just by playing ...and game is fun so playing is actually more fun than a grind.  I hope this game stays poplular so the ques to get into game remains at only a few seconds to find a match usually. u can solo or team with randoms which is actually super fun with the 2v2. but 1v1 is great too.  VERY FUN AFFORDABLE Addicting game. 

NOW for the Bad NEWS:

OK now its been months and nothing new except a couple cards. I want new characters with new card abilities and maybe rework some of the cards nobody uses.  its fun for a while but game is standing still right now which saddens me because this game is a blast to play....just not same stuff over and over. also if the characters had a bigger difference and or a skill that was actually useful that would be fun too. but really so many cards could be so much better.  now its hard to get enough cards for a deck that I like. when i first started it was fun but now i see 75% of cards are prettty unuseable.  I hope they update the cards soon... and make the characters have better abilities.... and add new characters we can use with different abilities.  like an archer character that makes all crossbow skills cost one mana less even. just something to make the characters more different and fun. so as of now this game was fun for a bit but due to nothing exciting happening i hardly play. i dont know. i do know its worth a couple dollars though."
20021,Great competetive strategy game.
20022,"Before I say anything, this is not a minecraft clone. If anything in my opinion it's a ton better. 
The game is is mainly sandbox with some rpg elements. You get the choice of just solely using it as a sandbox(no creative like mode) or you choose certain builds, defeat bosses and an expert mode if your too good. The main builds are melee,magic,ranger and summoner. The terraria wiki(btw which is very helpful) goes into more detail on the pros and cons.
The crafting system in the game is also very good. Theres almost no need to have to find out how to craft things as you start with an npc who practically tells you everything you can craft with one item. You also only need to have the items in your inventory to craft rather than align them in some shape.

This game also has many npcs(just over 20) that mainly serve to sell or give certain info. They are quite straightforward to unlock and you keep them in houses you build. Certain npcs are quite helpful depending on the build you go for during the game.

Gaining money is also quite simple. This can range from defeating enemies, bosses and selling items to npcs.

There happens to be a plethora of items including tonnes of weapons and armour for each build and tonnes or craft able material from many many ores to item drops.

Terraria also has a few biomes including evil biomes as well. All these biomes are quite useful with their own enemies and generic animals. You also unlock a biome after hardmode(more on that later). Terraria's map is not infinite an you set the size when creating. However there is no problem with this especially choosing a large map. Even the small map is big enough to explore many many hours and there still will be something you missed.

The game itself kinda has two parts which are pre hard mode and hardmode. Hardmode is triggered after defeating a certain boss and increases the amount of items obtainable, more bosses and another biome. 

There happens to be events aswell which spawn different kind of enemies or are there to provide a sort of challenge. Some are random while most are summonable.

However no game is perfect though. There is a bit of grinding to do especially if you want items and these can be really rare. Once you've defeated the final boss, the game is somewhat too easy except the only way for a challenge is expert mode(haven't experienced this mode). Items due tend to get useless especially items that are crafted by ore. Luckily this can be sold to make ingame money. While i dont mind the 2d graphics some may not enjoy it as much. Im sure there are a few more flaws but i cant think of any. In terms of stability, it's fairly stable and i have not seen a single bug at all.

Im sure I missed quite a bit in this review but this game has so much to do. It can even be modded though I havent experienced that yet. Overall I highly recommend this game at even full price."
20023,"this game is like heartstone ive heard everyone say it like that its not its so much more potential its fun its rage enducing but most importantly is strategic and i agree with people who say that its impossibel to beat somone sometimes because they have the exact counters for your deck BUT the thing that makes this game difffrent from the others is its mechanics what makes this game so good is how many diffrent styles can you play in and the game is being constantly updated and whenever i wait for a queue then usually 10 sec is conisderd as a long queue in this game because its playerbase is very active and the ranking system is balanced aswell ranks reset after every month and they dont make you go all the way down to 0 they put you in a fair rank 

TL;DR the game is fun and its playerbase is really active it gets contantly updated and if somone would ask me if its good then id say for 5 eur its practically a steal"
20024,Fun game with lots of potential. Easy to enjoy and no chat in game so you won't encounter toxic players. Nice ranking system but i hope they will somehow change the 2v2 battles. Currently it's hard to co-operate with another player. Also it would be nice to see the cards after you move mouse over them (in leaderboards) and additional button on a friendlist near friend nickname (same with solo rank).
20025,Id have to say give it a shot for the sake of competition .
20026,Good ol' Clash Royale for PC
20027,its a nice game. the way that it can go is base on the player
20028,"Easy to get into. 
Fun to play."
20029,"Fun for the first couple of hours,
then typical p2win shit with randon encounters and enemy players who beat you in 30 sec.
totally not worth your time or money .. spend 99c and right not sure if it was worth it.

oh .. forgot .. totally overcheated and hacked  .."
20030,"300 players at the peak of the day, the developers need to publish it in facebook and more places to get more players."
20031,"I've gotten this game by trading and I'm not really good with these types of games which is the reason why I probably won't have too many hours on record. Well,I did play a few matches and I can say this:

So the game is basically a PC version of Clash of Clans with of course it's multiplayer capabilities.
The game seems to run in the Unity3D engine,and just now as I'm writing the review,I took a glance into the root folder of the game and it confirmed my suspicions. It in fact does. But anyways, the models of the game I really enjoy. They are cartoony & low poly which I think it gives this special indie game charm. The shading is also nice, which is to be expected with Unity 5 or above. 
The flow of the game is smooth the creatures look pretty nice, but I'd say a little bit out of place? I'm not sure if it's even important to some of you,but for example, the crawler creatures look like they were straight outta the Russian Sleep Experiment creepypasta and the ranged unit,the Plasma Marines look like the Doom slayer from DOOM 4. All in all from my several years of experience with Unity3D and the indie games created with it, I can say that the game is very nicely constructed, with no major bugs or glitches which I think was avoided by excluding the Rigidbody properties from anything really, and just using navigational mesh.Uhh I just wished I was better at it.

A recommend imo."
20032,"Game was fun for the first couple hours and then suddenly it felt like I was consistently getting cheated. I summon a level 9 monster and it gets one shot from a crawling zombie and then they summon a level 3 that tanks hits like no tomorrow for no reason what so ever. Then I incorperate the same cards into my deck and they don't do the same things. Game doesn't explain why things happen the way they do and if there is special reasons why it happens it should be at least explained so the player has a general idea.

 I'm almost level 30 and still feel like it's 100% RNG. It literally just gives you false hope in the beginning when the game makes sense and then just says screw you and kicks you in the nuts a little ways down the road. I also consistently go against people who are some how able to summon Cleavers what seems like back to back even after I put down numerous disrupters. And no this isn't the mirage ability where it blows up into balloons. 

I don't know if there's a cheat going around or some kind of exploit but it's impossible to win when someone is capable of limitlessly playing high mana costing cards. Not to mention the archer masters are way over powered. The ability to shoot all the way across the arena is ridiculous. What's worse is they take out your puffs before you even have a chance to do anything. Uninstallin this garbage. Sad cause I liked the game too."
20033,الخراب ليس عادلا
20034,Not bad. 3d clash royal
20035,good
20036,The game is good i would like some skins for some of the minions too.. to trick the enemy a bit. but the game is extremely fun and well balanced as long as your smart or have a good team you can win
20037,1000000x yesssss
20038,"It's a super simple game I didn't think I would like, but I got a key for free, so I figured I'd give it a try. 2000 hours later, I guess I actually kinda like it."
20039,a good game but sometimes unbalanced in ranks ...
20040,it is a awsome game in fact i was so good after the first week that i was blamed for hacking and thats how easy it is to learn this game.
20041,"It's a dollar right now. Bought it beforehand but if you look at the game and think you may even get an hour out of it, buy the damn thing for a dollar.

Lots of games like it, same can be said for every game out there. Simple enough to learn and matches are only a few minutes long. Good time sink while watching streams or something. Idk. Just buy it."
20042,Nice game :) recommended
20043,"This game is a lot of FUN! it has a very simple system and is a very chill game to relax and play with. The cards are a lot of fun and the more you play the more you will understand that they have direct counters. It’s not a pay to win but a pay for looks because all the ""High"" lvl stuff is easy to obtain for free. They are also not that strong in comparison, some of the commons are stronger in fact. I don’t lose very often, and I have mostly commons in my deck where I play vs a lot of rarest. The current event is a ladder game where you chose a deck out of random cards and try to win. You get 3 losses before you need to start over, this however is a very HARD game mode. Personally, I keep getting high tier cards and lose quite often because the energy required to play the card is a lot, when the other player has multiple characters to counter my single one on the field... but even with the bad luck and challenge. it is still a very fun game and I fully recommend this game.


I feel like the developers have a LOT in mind for this game and I am personally Really excited to see what they do with it and where it goes! The current card set is a bit small, but it is still in the early stages of development and I’m sure there will be loads more content to come... I believe the playing field should be a little bit larger than it is now, and the 2v2 should be a person at each corner instead of next to each other. This allowing one person to die and the other to live to fight on. But to counter the death the energy increases by 2/3s so they have a fighting chance. It also moves them to the middle of the field instead of staying in the corner.  

But in the end, I do suggest you try it out for yourself because I really enjoy playing this game.
"
20044,"I got this for myself and a friend i thought it was silly that they reused all the assets from forced showdown which was a really fun game for this mediocre game but whatever someone has to like it

my friend screamed the entire hour he played about how it's so awful he's given up on videogames

while I don't like the game I recommend it because you should give it to a friend while it's on sale and actually damage their sanity"
20045,"Great Game.......
YES."
20046,I enjoy the games mechanics - style is very fun to watch and play (lessens the losing imo somewhat) Overall it's a fantastic game!! Get a free token (if you remember to log in daily) Just a very nice change- the way your cards are introduced to you as a whole - to let you know which does what. Also the way they pvp plays out with live duels. I'm loving it. I did the Beta fro this game and honestly I uninstalled it 3x before finally sitting down and finding time to work the mechanics of it out and get what was going on. I enjoy playing it now and am looking forward to getting the other versions now especially since they are on sale.
20047,bleh
20048,"i wasnt sure if id like that when i bought it.. After 9-10 hours in the game (in 2 days) i can say this thing is superaddictive i cant stop playing.. fast ranked maches with different masters and 
strategies and a huge amount of different minion cards! Thats the sht bro , if you like this kind of games just get it.. The only bad thing about the game is that 1/5 maches are canceled before they even start so you wait sometimes a bit.. but i think this can be fixed , the rest game is great"
20049,nice game

20054,"Great game, really recommend!"
20055,"[h1]Beautiful polished graphics & addictive gameplay![/h1]
This is one of the game I really enjoy everytime I play. I never felt boring even after playing for hours onward. Thumbs up to [b]Developers[/b] for creating new content regularly. Let's see some pros & cons of this game.

[+] Fair matchmaking on ranked matches.
[+] Gameplay sound effects & commentary is too good!
[+] Not so hard to learn.
[+] Not much microtransaction included.
[+] Average waitng time for ranked matches is 3 second!
[+] No online lag while playing ranked matches.

I didn't yet find anything to complain about this game. I absolutley recommend this to them who love strategy based games."
20056,GOOD GAME 8/10
20057,I Think is worth to Play This game online !!!
20058,"Underwhelming fantasy battle game seems to require no skill. The graphics are bad and whether you win or lose seems to be random. I might expect to find this type of game on phones and tablets but not on Steam.

Gameplay: 3/10
Graphics: 4/10 (for the style they were going for)
Controls: 6.5/10
Replay Value: 2.5/10"
20059,"Wow! I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this style of game, but it's an absolute blast and I can't get enough of it!
Highly recommend giving this a try. Bit weird at first but it's entertaining."
20060,"OMG having so much fun with  this game. Very fasted paced which I love, and easy to pick up and play. I like the fact you earn everything by playing the game rather than pay to win, please don't change. Really recommend you try this game out. :-)"
20061,Legend says no one has not got this game from random online giveaways
20062,"I dont have that much hours in the game, i got the cards and never really played more, it wasnt for me, but hey you might like it so read some more reviews and see where it leads you."
20063,"Awesome, quick and super fun PvP strategy game!
In my opinion it hits the sweet-spot between depending on lucky cards and creating strategies to take down your opponent on the spot, which makes it so that after playing the game for a while and learning it, you'll know how to counter your opponent's moves, even if the hand you got isn't the most suitable. 
After the beginning, there aren't slow moments in each battle, since as time passes (usually 1v1 games take from 1:15 to 10 mins), your cooldowns get reduced, so that you can create complete mayhem in the battlefield. And once you understand the game well, it's super satisfying to take down an enemy's horde with a single Grenadier, or open way for your Cleaver to deal tons of damage with each swing, or even hold on to your 100hp and manage to comeback in 15 seconds with an awesome combo. There are tons of strategies and deck possibilities, so you can try something new everytime.  Totally recommend giving it a try."
20064,Awesome game to loose some time :)
20065,Ok.
20066,adictive
20067,Fun Game.
20068,"Great competetive strategy game, works like the mobile game clash royale, but aint pay to win.

Friendly community."
20069,fun fast games
20070,"Free gift, first one who sends me e-mail."
20071,nice game.
20072,"Great game for a quike 30 mins of fun :)

It isn't complex, it's easy and fun. The match making is okay, nothing special, CSGO has a way more crappy matchmaking that's for sure

For those disappoionted about this isn't a game with the minions from despicable me; plz try looking at some of the pictures before buying a game next time, would help you a lot ;)"
20073,"I sit and wasting my time for this unsavorygames  

1.PlayTeamBattle And I'm Master Why was my playmate Rank Wood I lost 10 times in a row! Possible ??? To put me together with Rank and Wood play against Older Rank

2.Teambattle random vs Premade TeamBattle Are you serious ??? Is it possible ???
The same opportunities I have and a random VS Premade ?? 

* only random in this mode otherwise Quit Mode is not fair !! What happens !! 

Caution should immediately stop what is going on here otherwise would be forced to stop this game I deal with games plus 20 years And that I have not seen to be done in any game 
"
20074,Good Game!!
20075,"Minion Masters is basically a mmorpg PVP card and tactics all in one game where you pit your monsters against your apponents.  I would say its more like Electronic Arts mail order monsters on Steroids. Reason I have not reviewed this game from the time I bought it was to give the company plenty of time to fix issues that involve modifications, things I like to do with my games. Id like to thank them for not banning me too. Its highly appreciated.
When it comes to modifying a game, NEVER modify a mmorpg. It can get your game banned, and possibly your steam account too. Only reason I modified it, was because when I purchased the game at the time, it was a cheap game I got with one of those 90% off coupons, and wasnt advertsied as an online game. When I tried it the first time around, I got slaughtered so made my modifications, and slaughtered every boss monster that was thrown at me. It wasnt till I got a message in the chat window I was going to be reported, that I found out I was actually playing against another player. I quickly contacted the company and asked for a reset. 
After that, they replied, and I gave them all information on what I had done so as it can be fixed so no one else does the same. 
[b][h1]Minion Masters is a great game. As you level up, you get rewards to modify what you have, or just buy new things from the store as well. There is even a shop to buy things with real $$ if you choose to, but its not required to play the game. This game is not single player, so please do not modify it thinking it is. When you play, other than the statyup tutorial, your playing against other players and its important to play honestly. The game is worth the money wether 90% off or full price. Have fun =)"
20076,Better than I thought !
20077,Fun game I think I got it for free a long time ago but I liked it a lot reminds me of clash of clans battle royale.
20078,There is a bug where settsu dupes herself e.g one on field and one on the podiem at the same time
20079,my game dissaperad after getting a new pc plz refund or something
20080,It's really friendly for casual and new player. There is no card level or tower level so anyone don't have unfair advantage. And you can craft literally every card in the game so you don't have to rely chest system and hoping to get lucky. There is also countless combination of card and hero's ability you can mix. So if you're bored you can try a new strategy.
20081,"I enjoyed playing it, specially the team battle mode. You get access to all the cards and skins in game without having to waste money, because you get daily cristals which can unlock skins and characters.
Character rotation is on, which means you get to play with different heroes in a week."
20082,Wtf is this
20083,Great Game
20084,7/10
20085,game is very addicting. Good to play when nothing else to do.
20086,"Got the game on sale, which to be honest is probably the only reason I am giving this a thumbs up. Get it on sale or if you like this type of game.

I never encountered any bugs and waiting for other players never took longer than 30secs. Wide range of units, most of which I never unlocked, but I think that is because I am a very casual player.

It's not bad, but wait for it to be on sale"
20087,.
20088,amazing game
20089,"I got this game for free , but In my opinion It should be free...
You've probably heard about games like ""Clash Royale"" and others, where is 2 or more lines and you spawn your soldiers, monsters, spells and all other things to destroy enemy base or hero. This game is same type, just cost some money and there's reasons why.
This game has Beautiful quality and graphics (requires good PC, lags for me), but playing on all low and small resolution is still enjoyable. There is a lot of cards with different minions, monsters, soldiers, spells, dragons, robots, skeletons, space ships, dagger rains, fire balls and much more. You can unlock cards by playing this game, and how good card is depends on how you use it. Game is also very detailed, has physics, so when a enemy gets punched harder it can even fly out of map or explode into peaces, in other words it has ragdolls and I like it. Even when enemy is burned to death it's darker than normally. Seems like Developers wanted to put in game some logic, which is not in all other games. There's much more things I'm not telling about. I can't say that this game is pay to win, because everything  you can buy you can laso earn by playing it.
Game is good, but once you get defeated it will be boring to play another 1v1, at least for me. But when I lose one fight of ten, game is fun to play.
RECCOMENDED"
20090,Trash game because itsa confussijng
20091,"Glad I got it for $1, not worth the 5 they're asking for it."
20092,Funnier than exepted (very funny to be exact) and there are always players online to battle :)
20093,ye
20094,"Good: Graphics, Sound Effects, Polish, Multiple modes of play, Not pay to win as legendary cards are not more powerful than commons

Bad: Limited number of cards, heroes don't feel exciting enough

Horrible: Almost ZERO players playing. It's multiplayer only (for the most part) so it's going to shut down sooner rather than later"
20095,Very fun and cute.
20096,"The best parts of Clash Royale without all the pay-2-win bullllllllshiiiiiit. 

Very approachable for people who have never played this sort of game before but still filled with tons of depth and strategy. 

Also, I've never had trouble finding a match, which is always great."

20098,this game so fun thank you all
20099,si senorita
20100,"Good game in general. Easy to learn and has a good pace for leveling/getting cards.
Ranking and matchmaking needs some tweeks though."
20101,My minions died.
20102,clash royale pc version
20103,"Dont bother buying or playing it, the devs dont care about the game anymore, matchmaking is a joke, bugs take week to fix, mainly the small ones.

The game was fun but with every ""update"" you can tell the devs are just trying to keep people on it enough to use the microtansactions ingame to get a bit more money out of it.

True shame as this game was really good and had great potential

100 hours late and ive finally uninstalled the game till i hear news that the developer starts to address issues in the game and become even half active.

<EDIT>

Although the matchmaking is still somewhat shit, its far better than it used to be and it a lot more fun that it used to be :)

For a free to play game, its got a grind, but it worth it and its enjoyable"
20104,good game
20105,"Very fun game to play with friends. I only play this game for it's dual battle mode (2v2), which is amazing. 

My favorite master is Ratbo. Getting mana frenzy and then r4ping the enemies with my minions is pretty fun.

Although I got this game while it was free, I'd definetely pay full price for it.

Had my first crash at 331 hours, literally unplayable omg."
20106,"Oh yes got this game the free weekend. It's like Clash Royale, just with other characters and the map is horizontal."
20107,Great game
20108,"Game crashes at launch, i basically cant play the game, help!"
20109,"Coming back months later to update my review, old one is shown below.

Super fun, free, deck building strategy game. Matches are only 4 ~ 10 minutes, and it's not pay to win. The core cards are some of the best ones in the game. Awesome alone, or with friends. Skill comes entirely from game knowledge and decision making, no twitch skills or finesse required.

You build your 10 card deck of minions and spells, which you spend mana to put on the battlefield. You need to get to your enemy's side of the board and kill his master. Low skill floor, high skill ceiling!

The battle passes that come out add new cards to the game available to all players (although moreso to pass-holders) and are easily acquired when the next season starts. The game is still growing, and the cards they add for the game allow for more strategies or synergies, and they've outgrown their ""overpowered card of the month"" phase.

Wholeheartedly recommend, super fun, even my crappy old laptop can run it, and it's free! Hurry up and try it out already.

 - - - - -

The trailer doesn't do it justice, it's a fun, satisfying game! Matches are only 4 - 10 minutes long, and it's quick to pick up, long time to master. Playerbase definitely needs to grow but I'm having a blast so far!"
20110,THIS GAME ONE OF THE BEST I PLAY!
20111,"very fun game, recommended!"
20112,"pretty good game, but dota 2 is better, and its free so i would rather recommend dota 2 because a free to play game saves ur money....but dont hate me plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

画面感也比以前好更好了。刚刚又来70mb补丁。"
20115,For the trading cards and achivment :p
20116,"A pretty decent, fun and addictive strategical card game.
Highly recommended if you're into such type of games.
"
20117,Extremely fun game. Only problem is I stuggle to stop playing it (very addictive)
20118,Solid. Fun. Lots strategies.
20119,"After lots of changes and updates, this is now a solid game I enjoy playing.

Pros:
Frequent updates - Game gets tons of new content regularly, and doesn't get repetitive at all. 
Game balance - With frequent balance patches, the game is never unbalanced for long, and there is a counter to everything, no strategy is unbeatable. 
Free content - Although the progression might seem slow if you just grind, you get a huge free bonus every month that speeds up your progression immensely (LoL takes a lot more time to unlock champions, and you have to actually pay money to get skins). Also you get free currency daily. All the DLC's to date have been offered for free in the first weekend, so you don't have to pay a cent for troves of content.
Conquests, Mayhem - A different set of challenges, whether you want to make your daily matches meaningful, or try a completely different gameplay rule set, the team behind Minion Masters has you covered.
Skill-based matchmaking - Ensures that you are matched against evenly skilled opponents, which leads to satisfying matches in most cases. Contrary to some opinions, the way to improve is to play against opponents of your level, so that when you improve, it pays off immediately. Some 'bigger' games need to get this into their thick heads (World of Tanks for example).

Cons:
Cheese - Not all strategies are created equal, and while some want to honorably win, many are designed to abuse a gameplay mechanic and 'cheese' a win out of an unprepared opponent. Every single one of these cheese strats are easily countered, but they are infuriating (and sometimes impressive when the users get creative) when you see them for the first time. Also, because the game changes often, new cheeses are created daily, and you are guaranteed to encounter them at least a couple of times every week. Also, since your deck size is limited to 10, you can't prepare against everything, you just make something that shuts down most cheese builds, and then hope that those builds that you haven't been able to address are executed poorly when encountered.


Overall this game is very fun to play, convenient because matches only last for a few minutes each, and easy to get into and casually play while talking to friends. It has some aspects where it doesn't seem fair, but those are few and far between.
I would rate this game 4.3/5"
20120,"Very balanced from a competitive standpoint. If you look at the top 20 players of the season, you'll notice most of them are using different decks. This game rewards skill and counterplay more than just having the best cards. If you're good enough, it's very possible to reach diamond or higher within your first week of playing using the starting cards and whatever cards you pull from packs without having spent money on rubies."
20121,reverse update 60 lets play on phones update. I dont own a PC for mobile games and i hate that i bought this only to have it completely reworked into a mobile game. Where is my refund?
20122,免费喜加一
20123,This is a great indy game! It is simple but fun strategy game. There are many fun and unique minion and masters that the player can choose. It is nice to see that the devs are taking good care of this game and that are always trying to make it better. Even if you do not like card or strategy games I would recomend this game! This is a better version of Clash Royale for the computer.
20124,"Clash Royale for your PC.

Unlike hearthstone its

-Very very easy to make gold and get new cards
-has balanced 2v2 mode
-can destroy other people without needing legendary cards
-fast updates and balancing

20128,"I really enjoyed Minion Masters up until now. I got every achievement and getting every card was really fun.

But Update 60 (Visual Rework) destroyed the game for me. Everything is just more 'flashy' now, which could be overllooked, but increaseing the size of the minions while not increasing the playing field, takes all the positioning out of the game and it comes down to a ""Rock-Paper-Scissors""-way of ""Who got the best minion?"".
The reduction of the playing field is very much a step in the wrong direction.

Visuals can be overlooked and maybe the developers try to jump on a more 'childish' style, but changing the mechanics this way makes me quit the game, until those changes are reverted or some other serious overhaul is done."
20129,Fun little game that is similar to Clash Royale on mobile devices.
20130,"It's a great game. Sort of feels like Clash of Clans mixed with Hearthstone, but unlike Clash you don't have to wait a few hours to open up your card pack. It has different rarities for cards, but the rarer cards arent overpowered and you can make  a perfectly fine deck with just the base cards and common ones you get from packs. The 'Legendaries' are fun to use but like I said, they aren't necessary by any means. They are updating the game quite regularly (about once a week) and in the newest patch they made some balance changes and a visual rework that wasn't too extreme but the game feels much better to play. The devs are constantly taking feedback and working to improve the game."
20131,"I used to like this game and play a bit every day.
The matches were also fast, each match would never take over 10 minutes to end (even in 2v2).

Now it seems they did a big update, the arena is much much smaller, the minions are much biggers, and what before used to be an average of 10 seconds for a regular minion to go from 1 corner of the map to the other, now they do that in only 2~3 seconds!!!!

I dont understand, but my guess is that they are trying to release this game on mobile and want us to also play a mobile game on PC!!!! 

What used to be a good game now is total garbage!
Right now even battle royal as a much bigger arena size!"
20132,"Review changed to Positive. Whilst I still maintain that the game was better prior to Update 60; that I have continued to play after the update means that it's still doing something right to keep me coming back from time to time. I can acknowledge that my previous review may have been a little kneejerk. Never the less, I still long for the days where the game was a little more cartoonish with a larger deployable area for greater and more flexible unit interactions. All that said, the review has been changed to Positive, and the previous review shall remain as is below for posterity.
---
While I truly enjoyed this game, Update 60, 'The Visual Rework Update' has ruined my enjoyment of the game.

The Visual Rework has made the game more crisp, and defined with deeper blacks and shaper edges. As a result, the game has lost its cartoonish charm. Update 60 also changed the viewing angle and warped the players sense of unit sizes that we've become accustomed to. Its also introduced a wierd imput lag that feels like some sort of Vsync that is over compensating.


As such, I no longer enjoy playing this game. It is my hope that Update 60 gets reverted."
20133,"very Addictive and Fun to play
also the match making is good and really fast"
20134,This game is still in developement but I have nothing bad to say about it. I cant stop myself from playing it when I do play (I play a lot of games).
20135,Excellent game!
20136,It's better than League of Legends
20137,"Minion masters is like hearthstone but in 3D with the action you can see on the battle field.

Positives:
1. The game has enjoyment once you know how to use the cards well and can be a victory cry once you win. Which has playability.
2. The animations and graphics of the newest cards are decently good.
3. Can choose your master and card deck with saves presets, master skins and over time grind blue crystals to get other cards you don't have for free.
4. The masters voice acting is a nice touch coming from a free to play game, really adds to the immersion and personality of the masters.
5. Can choose your masters skin, map layout and profile picture from the ingame cards / masters.

Negatives:
1. Playing as a team battle, your team mate sometimes is afk and doesn't place any cards, costing your rank to lower down. (Recommend you play with a friend on team fights) the afk peeps in game should get replaced.
2. The global chat can get toxic. I wouldn't chat there if I were you."
20138,Good moba game to pass your time.
20139,awsome
20140,Want to play with friends in school?  This pretty much covers my review. Bye.
20141,A good game
20142,it has it's moments
20143,"I'm not sure how I got this game, but I found it in my library recently and gave it a try. I wasn't expecting much, but boy was I surprised. I've have about 30 hours in, which means I've been spending way to much time playing this game. 

It's great if you only have a few minutes, as most matches only last 3-5 minutes. Some matches (like my last one) may last upwards of 10 minutes, but I personally haven't seen one go one beyond that point. 

The best way I can think to describe this game, it's like a MOBA had sex with a TCG and gave birth, you'd get Minion Masters. Give it a shot. It's super easy to get into, you won't regret it."
20144,"starts out as simple fun with 2-3 minute games, but then soon you'll be strategizing while spending 11 minutes on one game and building up your master deck. Highly recommend if you like playing pvp games and want an easy start, hell even if your super into high intensive pvp you will be completely satisfied."
20145,"Very nice game, also has a nice future to com! Also the dev. team is great + active discord. Lovely game try it! If you didn't yet ! :)"
20146,"GOOD BOIII
"
20147,"Really fun game, especially if you have a friend to play with. You read it right, there's an awesome 2v2 mode. The game is far from pay2win, I managed to reach gold with my friend using just the basic cards and a few that we unlocked.
Cards feel unique and are not hard to obtain, so you won't be forced to spend money on this game to reach higher ranks.

Don't get fooled by the look, this is not a stupid rip-off to earn easy money.

Final vote: 8.5"
20148,"8/10, could be better if when my game disconnects for no reason, i dont lose rank points. but this is a really solid game that can go places. Its simple yet full of strategy. Can easily be 10/10 in a few months. :D If you enjoy Hearthstone this is like that but real time. I love the graphics and skills you develop to counter the counters of your counters."
20149,"that's a very good game.
looks a little like clash royale style and i really love that game too. 

it has tons of cards, heroes, arenas, and funny modes to play. i can't even imagine how many things it'll have when finally released"
20150,AWESOME

20154,good
20155,"If Clash Royale was good, it would be minion masters.

I don't mind the crates and that shit, I was able to win aainst a high lvl player, and I didn't spent a penny on this game, so it's fun, and cant see this as a pay to win, couse no matter how many resources (real money in this case) you have, if you don't know how to use, you will lose"
20156,"Minion Masters is actually an extremely fleshed out game that takes mechanics from others' and mixes it into a beautiful crafted ""Master""piece. This is one of the most underrated games I've ever seen and it sickens me to find out so few people playing and watching it on Twitch. I've dunked 80+ hours into this and it's still fun/challenging. Sort of like how Hearthstone is with the monthly resets and filling out your collection.

I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this game! On sale it was less than a dollar..I don't even think I waited a week to bump myself up to premium. **Buy it!** Get past the bots(they must go until at least Gold) and really enjoy what the developers have going on. They do update the game regularly as it is still in Early Access, but the devs are doing good! A recent change to a card that was somewhat broken made it extremely reasonable! Now you don't see that thing in literally every deck. It's a competitive market, premium-feeling game for almost nothing. It's not even that unrealistic to get the highest rank but know you're going to battle the same 10 people right now...Sometimes like 5 in a row!! That might be a selling point to some but I wasn't a fan. There's a few avatars that still haunt my dreams.

It offers random 2v2, premade 2v2, and 1v1. If you're not into PvP, unfortunately there's not much going for you here. 

TIP: The general chat is definitely a salt mine lmao. Read their comments and constantly laugh out loud. It's A+."

20160,"Noticed I had this game in my library. Probably gotten it from a bundle and forgot about it.
Saw it was still getting updated so thought 'hey, might as well give it a shot!' I'm glad I did.
It's a really fun and addictive game. It has some MOBA vibes where you choose a master and has some deck-building elements. I despise card-games and MOBAs so trust me when I say this works really, really well. Matches are short but not too short. If you lose you want to play more to get revenge, if you win you want to play more to keep your streak up.

Bottom-line, this game is fun, addictive, and constantly updated."

20170,Fun game to play with friends
20171,Very interesting for me !! and cheap
20172,"Wow!! I got this on sale very cheap, and I'm digging this a lot. Feels like elements of Hearthstone, DoTA, and Chess. Easily worth the $5, and a steal at the sale price of $.49 I picked it up for. Love it!"
20173,gud
20174,nice
20175,"I've played 3 hours so far of this game and it's really simple siege game.  The learning curve is not that hard, but if you master the mechanics and the counters, it can get really spicy. There's so many comboes you can do and the 2v2 mode is really fun.

It's worth way more than 5$ and thats the current price, check it out!"
20176,A good mechanic simulator
20177,yep
20178,"I've been enjoying Clash Royale on mobile for over a year now, and then this game showed up on PC apparently. And I'm quite happy with playing this game! I like the tacticle nature of the game and experimenting with deckbuilding. Something I really like, compared to Clash Royale, is that all cards of all players are on an equal playing field. Meaning my Card X is always identical to your Card X (in Clash Royale, there is this thing of leveling your cards, which messes up card interactions if cards are not leveled on par with your ranking) 

Overall gameplay feels nice, although the ragdoll physics is sometimes a bit silly (units getting blasted across the stage). Can't comment on gamebalance too much as of yet, but I've been able to do pretty well playing with default available cards in ranked matches. I feel 1V1 is a bit more balanced then 2V2 game mode, but I guess that's also an immediate result of more explosive combinations possible when having twice the amount of mana available.

I like how this game has 'challenge' available to get you started with the game, getting used to it and getting a few cards to start your collection out. Other 'helping your start out' methods to grow your initial collection of cards is by 'leveling up' (In other words, just play games), playing Draft mode and some achievements. You'll actually be handed out 2 legendary cards early on this way, which feels kind of generous I think.
There is now a 'weekly Exploration' that motivates playing the game with different decks, rewarding your typically with a '1,5' cards. Then daily you receive a quest (and 1 extra for playing in 2v2) worth doing for 2 to 2,5 cards (and you can keep 3 quests in a backlog). Winning games basically only yields pocket change equivalent of 1/30th of a card and losing yields 1/150 of a card maybe? So the pace of growing your collection is about 2,5 card a day on average after the initial bumb of cards.
Climbing the 3 types of ladder (1v1, 2v2, premade 2v2) also yields some rewards, from gold to card crafting materials.

You have the option of selling of cards for a currency used to create other cards. Common cards are typically very accessible this way. Getting rare is possible, but Supreme and Legendary cards require significant grinding to be able to craft those. Legendary cards are pretty niche and swingy, making them likely not essential in 1V1 gameplay but enable a more swingy (some would say 'Rock Paper Scissors') gameplay experience in 2V2. However there are quite some usefull Supreme cards out there, which can leave you frustrated if you oponent 'always seems to have them' while feeling hardly obtainable for yourself.

I like there are different Masters you can select, which help in a particular play style. Some are gimicky and therefore somewhat unreliable, some seem to be usefull in almost any matchup. Likely there is some 'imbalance' there, but haven't personally experience it yet."

20183,This shit is solid.
20184,"This is my FAVORITE Pay-to-Win game on Steam. For $10 a month, you too can ALMOST keep up with the Jones'.

I Do not believe this game should be listed as 'Free-to-Play', as it is NOT. For instance: Some features of the base game are inaccessible in the Free-to-Play version, including new expansion card crafting. Even with the LIFETIME PREMIUM UPGRADE, these features are STILL INACCESSIBLE. Although these cards can be played against you in the Free-to-Play version, you cannot play with them yourself, as crafting is disabled, and there is NO other way to acquire them, other than to pay for them.

I have lodged a complaint with Steam against the classification of this game. I think HONESTY in game presentation is an IMPORTANT feature, and this game is being misrepresented as Free-to-Play, when in fact, it is not."

20195,"I'll try make this simple and short..  This game is really fun and addictive and deserves a much larger playerbase. The devs are constantly listening to player feedback and bringing out regular updates to address the concerns of players.

For an early access game its very well refined and offers alot of value for its price.  Aslong as the devs continue their hardwork and keep bringing out new content and making changes based on good feedback it will definetly grow.

20202,Like a clash royale but this game make me more addicted
20203,Interesting mechanics that diverge it from Clash Royale's play style alongside unique gamemodes that provide different ways to engage with the game.

20206,"-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-

So far, sooooooo good.

This easy to pick up, difficult to master collectible card game is fast paced, frantic and FUN. The games last a maximum of about 8 minutes so losing doesn't feel like a waste of time and there are plenty of progession rewards to hold your interest.

There are currently 2 ways to play: 1v1 and 2v2. I personally prefer 2v2 but enjoy both.
There is also an expedition mode, but that is currently being changed in some way by the devs.

As the game is currently in alpha, there will obviously be a lot of changes, improvements and additions, but you currently have a very playable game that will hopefully just continue to get better!"
20207,I heard this was a ripoff of Clash Royal? It's hard to care when it's 90% off; fifty cents for a clean polished online game to play with some friends.
20208,GOOD 6/10
20209,error 140056 : 140153 why is this not working?
20210,"was really surprised about this game,fun to play but idk if ill ever be able to ""git gud"" pretty,fun,its not as toxic as league.just enjoy it.can be played comfortably from the couch.id reccomend this to someone wanting to pass time."
20211,nice
20212,"Currently has a lot of pay2win (P2W) going.
Or lets say its the other way around.
You only get cards by opening packs (one random card per pack).
Since the packs only hand a rando mcard, you can end up having an account where you get unlucky and unlock stuff you dont need, while all the other players are lucky and get stuff thats suited for the current meta.
For example the Anti-Spell Dragon that is widely used because it damages you when you use a spell.
I never got that Dragon, although i opened over 130 packs already. and there arent that many cards available at all.
And the same goes for several other really useful cards that you NEED to build a proper deck and try different tactics.
For example a tactic to send a healer after a tank (which needs you to have the Priestess Card), but you cant do such a tactic without having the cards you need for that.
Which means that unless you pay loads of money, you are crippled in your ability to create proper decks, try different tactcis and so limits your freedom.
Which would be fine if you could just create a good deck with dumb common stuff.
Which you can, but you wont get through the meta that needs you to have at least a few of the legendary cards in the game.

Well it can turn out fine.
Sadly i am in a spot, where i lack pretty much any of the legendaries you need to get higher in rank, which is frustrating.
I also dont have the cards i need to try out fun tactics.
Instead the packs i open give me doubles.
Oh but you might say ""cant you use the ones you have too often and create a specific card you need?""
Well technicly yes. But, a legendary card costs 2000 shards. 
To get the legendaries i really need to at least be able to do some new (and fun) stuff i would need to have about 8000 shards.
Scrapping a legendary gives you about 50 shards.
Which means you have to grind packs forever to get enough shards to craft specific rare cards.
And obviously you get more of the common stuff to scrap and not legendaries (otherwise i wouldnt have the problem in the first place).
Which are at around 15 shards per scrapped card.

Fun situation to prove thats a problem:
When you get matchmaked in a 2v2 (my team both level 30 and 36) against a level 248 and a level 3, but level 3 somehow has a pure legendary and rare cards deck with all the good stuff.
Smurfing and P2W for real (you reach level 3 already with just doing the tutorial).

At this point it gets frustrating NOT because other players paid money to be better than you and stronger, but because you have to spend money or otherwise you cant properly choose the cards you need and build a deck.
In short, the game is ""pay money for freedom"".
Which ultimatively ends up being P2W anyway.
At this point  ican only say that the system isnt fun or good.
And the monetization could be fairer for all.
Make champions paid, make cosmetics paid, make cards unlockable with gold (easy to farm) and allow the player to pick which card he/she wants to buy.
Maybe even have the game offer a singleplayer mode (like the expedition and challenges) where you can gather each card that exists once.
I personally would buy the new champions, but i wont buy packs and pay into a gambling machine. 
In the end i would pay 30€ just to get the same legendaries again and obviously all the commons i already own.
Wouldnt do that ever. 
Which means in return, i will also NOT buy a new champion. So they lost me twice with that system.

Even if all of the above doesnt apply, its still ""pay money to get a random card in a slot machine (its roulette here)"", which im not up to.
And that means, Minion Masters is like all the Mobile Games that are free to play or all these CCG Games on Steam that are free to play. 
Which is sad as the game itself is actually great to play and fun. Its deep and offers enough freedom to create unique tactics (if you manage to be lucky and get the cards you want/need).
As it is though, even with being a good game per se, the macrotransaction gamble system kills it and so it is like all (most of ) the other free to play stuff.
A P2W slotmachine."
20213,kewl yes
20214,better than clash royale
20215,modern chess .
20216,"Fun, but if you don't happen to HAVE card that specifically counters opponent's deck - you are screwed. And you can have that card if you pay money for a lot of boosters."
20217,Like it for free
20218,Good Game
20219,"Fun and quick battles that test your ability to react and plan ahead at the same time. Heroes each have their own strats to complement their decks. Card rarity advantage isn't nearly as blatant as Hearthstone as a CCG, and many top decks use basic and commons in at least half of their deck (Rarity is about specializations, not power). 2v2's with friends can be great fun if you combine your cards for cool strats and moments."
20220,Just .. 10/10 .. Great game !!
20221,Surprised how addictive and fun this game is. Very enjoyable!
20222,"It's essentially a mobile game on your PC. Think ""Clash Duel"", but the off-brand version of said game. Still good fun, monetization is very concervative (at the moment of writing this January 2018), it doesn't push you to spend IRL-cash and there's a lot of fun to be had. Mixing cards and master abilities brings a whole new level to this game, that's not to say that it couldn't be enjoyed by a casual player as well. I got this game pro bono from a promotion I found on r/FreeSteamGames, so I didn't spend any money on it myself. That said, the fiver it costs to get into this game is easily worth it. There's a suprising level of depth to this game, even despite it's mobile game roots. Can't recommend enough."
20223,The game is decent and honnestly it is preety well made  and I think it is an experience that is worth trying. It did not catch me however if you like clash royale or games like that you might start loving Minion Masters.
20224,boooooooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk gibi
20225,"It is rare that you find such a quick game to play that is so absorbing. It is a credit to the developers that they have created a game that you can play for 5 minutes or for 5 hours. Although simple to play it also has complex depth to it, perfect for gamers like myself whose gaming time is short most of the time. The developers are happy to help with any problems, another rarity nowadays. Highly recommended."
20226,"Played it for 20 days, got to GM 1 in 2v2, ggez

And now seriously, it's a great game, quick matches, not pay to win at all. You can easily reach the GM rank with the basic cards that everyone has and same for the Master. Lots of fun tournaments and there's enough meme cards, what more do you want

The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the matchmaking is completely broke when it comes to the 2v2 mode"

20228,Very good game! Highly recommended +++

20231,"The gameplay of this game is heavily inspired by Clash Royale, but it has very interesting mechanics that keep it original. While a bit monotonous and repetitive, the gameplay is quite enjoyable, especially if taken in short bursts like a mobile game. The PC is probably not the best environment for this kind of games, but can be a good game nevertheless for some types of players.

Unfortunately the game has been completely ruined by the 'Expeditions' gimmick. Essentialy a mini""game"" where you have to explore a dull map just to get the resources needed to get new cards for the main game. Arbitrary power multipliers make the dull experience increadibly frustrating, and force you to grind just so you can win in the main game. 

Expeditions has has nothing to do with the main game, and completely ruin the experience of this otherwise enjoyable game. Not recommended."
20232,I Reached platinium playing with cheese.
20233,"A pretty interesting game at first, but it really isn't a unique concept. What makes this game not worth getting, however, is the look of this meant to be an F2P. I don't like the fact that you pay for a game, and then there are microtransactions, similar to how EA messed up their Battlefront 2, and I'm pretty sure you (the reader of this review) wouldn't either. Other then that, I can't really come up with a detailed review of this game, so I'll just give a list of Pros and Cons.

Pros:
(-) Unique minion system where its a deck full of minions instead of a bit of a more limited system like some battling tower defense battling games

Cons: 
(-) Micro Transactions
(-) Can get boring pretty fast
(-) Plays more like an F2P game instead of 5$ game"
20234,ok
20235,ok
20236,"Got this game from a giveway a while back but finally had the chance to play it the other day. The game instanly throws you in to a series of AI matches that teach you quite simply how to play and then lets you learn on your own. Simple game and very fun to play if you like strategy games like starcraft but with out the ""You must Construct additional Pylons"".  My only complaint is that once you get to ""mana frenzy"" (the last perk in the match) its basically impossible to fight against. at least in the early tiers of the game."

20238,"NICE GAME @_@
"
20239,"As one who has never been to fond of this type of game, I find it very enjoyable.

Queue times are short in any of the three game types. 

Each of the Masters have their own cool little perks that can help you win a battle.

There's a lot of variety when it comes to cards, and it isn't too difficult to get new ones.

Personally, I enjoy the 2v2 aspect the most, but 1v1s are fun as well. I definitely recommend getting this game with a friend if you want to get into something for a few hours."
20240,"I don't know too much about this game, I guess it COULD be good but I don't know.

I shouldn't even be writing this review. eh."
20241,"Really good game for the price, couldn't recommend this more."
20242,It is really fun.
20243,"Betadwarf has put a great DCCG together. Totally worth getting in early access. This is actually a good game, it is fast and has responsive units with depth to them. It depends where you place, when you place, what you place. There are counters to everything. So, although in the beginning it feels like premium cards carry games on their own, you'll quickly discover weaknesses and ways to play around them. This depth creates great flux in the meta, a meta you can easily follow as all the decks are visible in the top score list. There are always different masters and different decks in the top, there is no oppressive meta or oppressive deck. It's easy to develop your own playstyle and add your own twist. On top of that it has different play modes that require different tactics, great replay mode, PvE content, 9 totally different heroes and some 120 cards already. Active player base, competitve scene, regular scheduled updates. 



"
20244,"Best game I'm #1 in Premade Team Battles.

""Mess with the best, you die like the rest."""
20245,"diz game...
iz cute and fun l0l"
20246,Take blood imps out of the game. Or at least out of team battle.
20247,This is much better than Battle Royale. Certainly gets BIG BONUS for not having levels on cards requiering an unending amout of time and $$$ to upgrade the cards.
20248,Nice Game
20249,"Very fun to play solo but even better with a friend.
Add more content work on graphic overlay and this game may become the next big thing."
20250,"Easily one of the best strategic experiences I've had in a while, despite still being in EA. Ideally it will have some better training and dummy modes in the future, the Expeditions will get fleshed out a lot, and there will be some balance passes (why can people mirror their teammate in doubles? :V), but the game is just really, REALLY good. 

Plus, at the time I write this it's on sale for a staggeringly dumb 50 cents, so there's just shy of no reason NOT to play it. Go sell a handful of trading cards from other games and get this one. 9/10. :P"
20251,easy to play love it
20252,the game was fun and easy to play.
20253,Very fun and entretaining game
20254,This game killed Clash Royale for me.  The premium version is highly worth it as well.
20255,"Minion Masters is an Early Access title that offers a different take on the 2-lane collectable card game popularized by Clash Royale and others. However, there are two bridges to control and an xp path that allows for teams who control the bridges to have an advantage in the any match. This leads to a very different feel than existing games, and is an absolute blast to play, especially 2v2 with a friend!

I highly recommend this game - I don't often write reviews, but this one is a blast in its current state. :)"
20256,"I win pretty much every round I play and my opponents act very dumb all the time. So I suspect that I'm playing against the bots. I don't like it. I was expecting to challenge other people, not the computer that makes stupid decisions and left no satisfaction of victory.  
The game is really good looking and have a potential, though"
20257,<3
20258,"8.5/10 
could last you 2-10 hours or 60-300 hours depending how well your willing to take loosing and improving
Its like every 1v1 3 way lane battle game ever-
only 
it doesn't punish you for wanting to play more, 
it has great graphics
and lots of content for character development/customization"
20259,lol
20260,"I bought this game thinking I would play for a couple of hours then get bored, instead I have found myself totally addicted and having a great time playing this game!

+Fast paced gameplay/Quick games
+Easy to learn
+Has a competitive edge
+NOT pay to win
+Almost all cards are viable
+Fun solo or with a friend
+Artstyle

-Not a massive amount of cards (Roughly 300)
-Small playerbase (Although I do find games within 30s every time)

Why not support the devs and help them improve a great indie game?"
20261,Very nice game
20262,"Very fun game, as far as card games go the pay-2-win is almost non existant (just get more cards) and all cards, including starting cards, are viable.

Favourite thing: Physics in the game are spot on. When a Golem smashes a person he goes flying.

Worst thing: Small playerbase. Sometimes low ranks team up with / verse high ranks.

In conclusion, definitely worth picking up especially on sale."
20263,"as you can probably imagine, quite addictive. good for when you have a few minutes to spare, as a round usually takes less than 5min."
20264,a little fun game' still fun with friends'
20265,"This is actually an excellent game, if you don't mind the grind of gathering leet cards and the futility of a ladder system that has you flailing to keep up. It's the same fundamental issue I had with Hearthstone, of which this is a clear (and probably superior) successor.

If, in Hearthstone, you played actual minions (instead of cards) that moved across a battleground and fought each other before attacking the hero, you'd essentially have Minion Masters. The same issues are very obviously going to arise - mastering the meta and collecting ""legendary"" cards is going to trump anything else. So if you can do those things, you will win, and if not, you will lose. The game board adds a small amount of spatial variation and reactivity to the formula but it's not enough to free you from playing by formula. You don't need to buy the in-game currency but you can, if you want to speed up your chances of getting better cards, more heroes, and some aesthetic upgrades.

The ""expeditions"" portion of the game is fun and rewarding. Here's where I have a suggestion. I would love to see this fleshed out such that it could constitute a full single-player (or co-op) experience without the necessity of grinding ladder matches to fuel your expeditions. The AI is pretty straightforward in the expeditions; it doesn't seem like a technical challenge to build this part of the game out to suit casual gamers or people who just like to have adventures with their friends.

I don't care about being stone or wood or diamond or fish tier or whatever. I don't want to fight battles against random strangers that much. At this point in my gaming life I can see the addiction hooks immediately and I'm grizzled enough to stay away from them. 

The real reason I don't recommend this game is that it's clearly designed to be addicting, and consequently to siphon money out of those without the awareness or willpower to resist. Plenty of people CAN use responsibly. If you're one of them and you'd like a well-executed CCG, go ahead, and enjoy yourself.

I can't comment on the overall balance of the game with my playtime, but I played ten or fifteen ladder matches and didn't lose any. I am pretty sure this is because I lucked out on my first spins with the ""power tower"" and got purple and orange cards. Maybe I just played against muppets. But if it was the cards, that's bad news for casuals."
20266,very good little game
20267,"THIS GAME IS NOT JUST CLASH ROYALE! ITS BETTER.

Sorry for being loud, and telling the truth. It is just better. Heres why:

Card levels: First of all there isn't any. That just balances everything out. Level doesn't matter for fighting others. Cards will have no level so no need to worry about a level 13 in your wood league with max cards.

Expeditions: You can explore a map with loot and more to find. Easy way to get stronger and newer cards. 

Battle: We got team battle which me and my friend really enjoy doing, it works well since I gave him another copy I got for free. We also got draft battle which can be fun if you know how to play your cards right!

Card Rarity: One of the rarities is supreme...

9/10 because one card rarity is supreme..."
20268,"Choosing between catchphrases for this game:

- 50% hearthstone, 50% Dota, 100% fun!
- Hearthstone, eat your heart out!
- Move over Hearthstone!

I bought this game on sale for 49 cents, figuring if I hated it, I wouldnt even bother having to return it.

Instead, I was instantly hooked. I'm currently considering buying a bundle before they go off sale.

Pros:
++++++++++++++++++
+ Familiar but legallydistinct characters
+ Announcer has good (not great) voice acting
+ Fast load times
+ Fast match queues
+ Holiday events in Beta?!
+ low low price of 50 cents!!!
+ Simple to learn, difficult to master
+ Totally original gameplay
+ Auto loads bug forums when crashing
+ Can play game with one hand, eat cheetos with the other.

Cons
----------------
-I crashed once, the game recommended lower settings, and suggest I report the bug, taking me to to the bug report forums.
- Graphics and interface could use some polish (my biggest complaint so far)
- Game should auto generate/submit logs regarding crash, for Quality assurance.
- Will probably go free to play after release"
20269,"try expedition - Crash
try 2v2 - crash

20273,cool
20274,"Minions, Masters. Xiao Long got nerfed"
20275,"Unlike the many other tower/card games out there on the market, Minion Masters comes with a refreshing take on the genre without the endless progression/paywall that you see on many app style games. The game is rather generous at providing the coin necessary to get another power token for an additional card. Also, the cards once found are none upgradable. That means a person spending cash cannot wipe a person to the floor with their upgraded versions.

There is 1v1 and 2v2. There is also expidition mode where you bring a chess piece around the map for additional gold and cards by using supply points received by leveling up and fighting battles.

Balanced, fun, easy to pick up with a high skill ceiling, loving it!

10/10"
20276,"Really awesome game, it gives me something to do on my spare time, and it's kinda uniqe if you compare it to other games. Sure you have clash royale for mobile devices, but this game also let's you switch heroes with different abilities, and it has it's own challenge mode."
20277,"great fun game, try it out"
20278,"enter the game and crash....
what happen ?"
20279,thanks alienware arena
20280,"Gods I love this game, I truly do, it's fun, the matches are quick and great for a pick up and play, but it is an unstable and buggy mess. Never have I had a game crash on me, or even crash my computer, as often as Minion Masters does. My PC isn't some sort of beast, but it has more than enough horsepower to run this game, and yet after a few games I'll end up joining a match and then my screen goes white and the game dies. Whenever they fix its optimization, I'll happily pick up this game again, but until then I'll have to give it a pass."
20281,"The one word to describe this is Chaos.
Its just so amusing to watch everything explode and fly around and burst, especially when you have one of those good old tombstones ready. The gameplay is simple yet effective and fun to experiment with when in a desperate situation. 

But theres only one personal problem. And that is that Rubies (which can be paid for via microstransactions) are getting harder and harder to get. Most level-up bonuses have changed Rubies to either supplies or something other than rubies.
This does get a bit annoying if you are trying to get a skin you really want or a master itself. 

Other than that however, I highly recommend this game and it is quite often on sale so its good to grab a good game at a cheap price. Just remember that at some points you might feel overwhelmed by 50 enemies but when you end up killing them all with a single hit, relief comes :).
10/10"
20282,"It lags a lot. And the early access description says that this game will be free to play in the future. And it also claims that if we already have the early access it's gonna give us a precious gift. I've played a lot of early access games that had that sentence in it's early access description. And half of them lied and didn't give me any gifts. So, I am not trusting that sentence tbh. The gameplay is good but, it has ton of bugs and lags. But, more importantly I do not recommend this game. It's just a waste. And the master are unbelievebly expensive."
20283,"It used to be a great game, until they added the Expeditions module and removed the gold rewards. Now players have to trudge on a bland map fighting so-so computer opponents to get more provisions to maybe get some gold. Unless you are ready to spend your time not dueling and waiting for more provisions from time based campfires, this game is in essence PAY TO WIN.

Also, every week or so, there is an update which will nerf a card or three 'in the name of game balance'. The developpers may or may not at that time improve other cards. This has been known in the gaming community as 'Flavor of the Month' strategy to keep players spending time and money. In the case of Minion Masters, it's 'Flavor of the Week'.

If you are in the money or enjoy jumping through hoops, this is a very good game for you."
20284,"Surprisingly well balanced and fun. Didn't think much of it when I purchased but I ended up having so much fun. 30 hours into the game and I don't see the end so far, especially not when new updates roll out (new updates every week)."
20285,kill me please
20286,Not very competitive as it's very easy to hit high ranks in under a day of grind due to the player base and ranking system with win streaks. Same copy repeat decks everywhere at higher ranks so can get exhausting but still fun sometimes and is even better if you run premades with a friend.
20287,"Experience gets even better with friends.
This game caught me well & truly by suprise, extremely enjoyable & hope it keeps growing."
20288,Good Game Thx!
20289,"Wow! It became one of my best game in 2 days.. If you really having heart attack cause of DOTA 2, give a try for this freakin game! Also its possible to play 2v2 which means no more painkillers!"
20290,"This game is awesome! Im lovin' it! Too much better than 'Clash Royale'! This game is worth more than current price. I got it free btw, i recommend you to buy this game and relax rest of the day! :p"
20291,"I'll keep this simple. Minion Masters is a great game, and you should buy it right now to support the developers. The game gets constant updates, the developers care for the game, and the game itself has a very active and friendly community. The gameplay is just as you'd expect from a card game. It's very intense and fun, and every match tends to be different from the other since the combat is in real time. There are multiple Masters and a lot of Minion cards that you can use for your deck. The cards range from light to heavy units, buildings for using as a distraction, or ranged attacks to pick off groups of enemies. Lots of variety in the game.

The game is totally worth the price, so scroll up and buy it. You'll be helping out the devs with money, and you get to enjoy a great game. I would suggest picking up a gift copy for a friend, so you can engage in some co-op action. The game is double the fun that way.

Shoutout to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/swiftshifty/]swiftshifty[/url] for gifting me this great game."

20298,"I was cautious and skeptical about purchasing this game, considering it's early access and my poor experiences with them. However, I was blown away by this game. The dev support is amazing, and the actual game itself is excellent. It's a fast paced card game that requires strategy and thought in your attacks. Pick this game up with a friend, too."
20299,"Extremely addictive game and easy to play. I am not a big mmo/rpg gamer, I play racing games quite a bit, And I absolutely loved this game. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.

Easy to play. Hard to master.

9/10"
20300,"Played it for a bit.
So far seems like a funny game.
So far nothing bad about the game :)

7/10"
20301,"Much like all TCGs this game suffers from one thing and one thing alone: accessability

You want the ultimate form of deck customization? you gotta pay for that
Wanna aquire the sick master that your enemy used against you and make it your own? you gotta pay for that
Customize your field to lay claim letting your enemy know that they're in the wrong neighborhood? you gotta pay for that

Weather it be on a per card/master bais or toss it in through fate you have to pay for gains. Lacking the ability to have the entire deck of card accessable to yourself or the masters is the biggest imbalance to exist in these kinds of games in general.  Evertyhing else is just by chance of what you and your opponent happen to be using at the time.

Here's a suggestion: allow one copy of a card from each rarity to be freely useable for everyone on a rotation.  Not only will this enable a good amount of avalability, but will allow players to ""demo"" them to decide if they'd like to use them in their master deck builds in the future."
20302,"edit This game needs alot of rework on alot of cards especially the demon warrior for rebalencing for one thing. FIghting against a demon warrior deck isn't fun because games against demon warrior decks tend to last anywhere between 15 - 25 mins dut to them being a stall deck. At one point I had one that lasted 45 mins. So let me put it this way why would I like a game that can't even think for a second hmm this game should be fast paced you know what let's have a card designed for a slow paced game where people could sit and with little to no skill and win. I'm not joking demon warrior decks literially take no skill to win you just need to stall it out to mana frenzy and you won.
original review:Let's see where do I begin ok so 


How did I get this game

friend got this game for me when it was on sale for 54 cents so was really good for the price.


Would I buy it at full price

yes 


Pros


The game is fast paced

Card placement matters

Cards do not have levels so if you have the card you don't need to spend and spend and spend to level it up to even compete with other people (why I rage at clash since some people have no idea about card placement but manage to win through brute level difference)

Two of the cards you get in the beginning are actually amazing the two being stun lancers and (I forgot his name) he has like this huge sword and just deals massive damage and runs at enemies

Graphics

Fairly good too bad most people can't run this game at full graphics without lagging and I know because I have a gaming laptop with an i7 -6th gen processor with a navidia 960 4gb graphics card

Exploration stage

It's interesting in it's execution and it's fairly nice to use to get recourses in the game just don't spend gold to get more resources because that would ruin the whole point of being there (to find gold, cards, more resources and relics)

Is pay to win an issue?

Define pay to win because someone could simply earn the cards by just scrapping some to fuse for a different card. So not really since legendaries are only op in limited sitiuations and any other cards rarity is fairly easy to get

Cons

The servers are not optimized yet so you will get some lag, but I'm fairly certain this will be fixed when the game is complete

games can be long

it's addictive

This game costs money although not much.


Would I reccommend getting the preium pack. Well I mean sure if you want to support the developers and if you want to get a differt master quickly but the default master is fairly op with the global range and able to target the enemy tower if there are no enemy monsters in play

I would give this game a 7/10 and for a budget game that you could buy I would give it a 9/10 not a 10 because again lag this game is actually the best budget game that costs money that I have actually played"
20303,"At first I thought the game is worth the 99 Cents I paid for it and not even one cent more. Wrong! The game is great. You can either play it as a filler if you got some minutes OR for hours in one session. The different masters offer different playstyles. And with different I mean different and not like one style to play. You can basically have success with a lot of combinations and if something feels too imbalanced its getting rebalanced pretty quickly. Content updates are regularly coming. You can either play 1on1 or 2on2 with a random or as premade group (different ranks). Even tho I think the newest addition to the game, which is some sort of half exploration/half PvE thing isnt that great, the game in total still rocks.

10/10 for that price"
20304,"Oh boy..

First off starting price was 20 Bucks. Ridicioulus

Now it is 5 which is still WAY TOO MUCH for its business model.

THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY GAME FOR 5 BUCKS - DONT BE FOOLED!

There is premium currency in this game, lootbox style card gathering (yes, it is a wheel, but that doesnt change the system) 

MP is either: You wrecking,  You getting totally wrecked , or (which is very bloody likely) you or your enemy just loose connection and therefore the match ends without a single card played. DONT TELL ME "" BAH ITS EARLY ACCESS""

Fuck

Off

If you defend the core mechanic of a game being broken, then you deserve a TI-83 Calculator with Big City Skater on it, nothing beyond.
This game is buyable for a year now.

20305,"Fun game, Recommended. Try to play it with friends: )"
20306,It will get boring but it was worth the $0.53
20307,"Stop wasting your time, this is just a clash royale knock-off. But despite that, it still has it's specialty here and there that makes this game unique to it's own...unironically saying."
20308,Best game 10/10
20309,"Love this game, I come from a hearthstone and Clash Royal backgroun have over 5k wins in both games.. this game is funner.  

To people that say it should be a mobile game.  I play this also with splashtop remote desktop app on my s7 edge.  I also did this for hearthstone before it hit mobile.. how bad you want it?"
20310,Clash Royale for the PC Master Race and really fun to play
20311,"Should be a mobile game, not on steam.  Expeditions are the way to get free cards.  They are poorly designed, tedious, boring, and a waste of time.  Like any free-to-play game, you can expect these massive time sinks to make small gains.  Just charge $10 or something and give me 100% of the content.  I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars of hundreds of hours to get to the same point."
20312,the best moba game
20313,"Bought the thing for my sister, turns out it's actually good XD 
+1 for the chubby minion on the tower"
20314,"I'm not even sure how I ended up with this game in my library, some promotional givaway I think. Needing something like but engaging one morning, I geve this a shot. By the end of the day I'd logged some 8 hours, and weeks later it's still my go-to.

This game is immediately accessible, yet deep in strategy to keep you coming back to master. It's very tight and polished for an early access game, and feels pretty much done really. It operates on a F2P model, but doesn't feel pay-to-win at all. I've come quite far in the game, and logged 47h as of this writing, and haven't felt hindered by a paywall at all.

Overall this is a thoroughly enjoyable and rewarding game, highly recommended."
20315,"EDIT: 09/05/18
After giving MM another try i also had to change my review.
Expeditions were changed and are less annoying, at the moment there are only a few balancing issues left but balancing is always something that takes a long time.

I had plenty of good and balanced fights over the last days with only a few questionable masters and cards.

// EDIT END

I had to edit my review based on the Economy, the fun went downhill really quick after a few days of waiting for expedition ressources. 

For 49 cents i payed for it, i had a ton of fun for 61 hours.

Human psychology needs rewards to keep the intrest up and after the first week the rewards stall. 

You log in, the daily gives you some ressources to move in expeditions, you do a few matches and thats it, matches give way to less ressources to go anywhere.
You are stuck with the few cards you got and the time has arrived were you grind over and over with builds you don't like to hopefully get a card you want to use.

You can't blame the dev's, all trading card games have the same issue, you are limited by the cards.
I am not saying that you need ""legendary"" cards to win, i am just saying that being stuck to less then 50% of the cards is not fun, all builds look and feel the same without the options.

At the current state i can not recommend it with a headsup price of 5€ and on top of that an ingame store.

In the end it's EA, so take this review with a grain of salt."
20316,Not a bad game if your new it is best to play in the afternoons. The is the price problem here I got my for free but paying for a game with a pay to win system installed bothers a little.  A buy at $2 or less and more if you like this type of game go for it.

20319,"First and foremost, this game is not pay to win. Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.

A lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.

The graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other. Gameplay is well paced and balanced - but it does take time to master.

An excellent game that I look forward to seeing grow. Highly recommended."
20320,"Jogo bom demais, uma belezura!"
20321,"Card game, 2v2. Fast and simple.
Strategy is still present.
game not finished yet ?
Basic cards are good
No need to pay for cards to win
well... that's a good game.

the number of card seems still limited but it will surely grows.
Cards can be long to unlock...


EDIT : Diamond in 9hours, too easy !"
20322,"Honestly there isn't much point in putting a lot of effort into this review. I can sum it up with just a few short words.

This game is basically free to play, you can't win via buying cards, you only win by being good at the game. It's easy, simplistic to understand, and provides enough of a challenge for MLG / Elite players that even they will enjoy it.

Play with friends, play solo, enjoy playing the best and most simplistic tug of war game on Steam."
20323,"Surprisingly Fun, fairly well made tutorial, easy mechanics... 
overall very good game. Recommended!"
20324,"If you like Clash Royale, you will like this game too.

On sales just 0,50€,and you get one copy of this game."
20325,"So,you have a chance to get killed by either rats or an ancient fucking dragon.

Now this is what I call realistic."
20326,That announcer  scared the shit out of me.
20327,"Nice game,

+Pros
Daily quest.
Free rotation heroes.
Real time strategy.
Fights, blood.

-Cons:
Pay to win system."
20328,"It's good for a quick match between meetings, but it's not a game requiring deep thought."
20329,I loved this game :D
20330,nice game liking lot!
20331,Am quite liking this game :)
20332,"Absolutly amazing game for such a cheap price. I thought of it as a ""Clash Royale Clon"" and in facts is kinda the same but different. Try it out its worth it"
20333,<3  <3  <3
20334,Such a great game C:
20335,It's fun. And updates keep it fun!
20336,"Super fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)"
20337,very funny
20338,This game  is not good but Great. Its exciting and different. You can spend hours playing.
20339,"Nice game!
(review for badge)"
20340,"I wish I hadn't recently been laid off, or else I would have put more money into this game.
Not that you have too, considering most of the top tier decks all use the basic cards and free champ ;).
This game is one of the best definitions of balanced games. Like wow.
As long as you understand the cards and strategies behind them, this game is incredible.
It's not too difficult to get cards, I think that could be worked on a bit.

Otherwise, great fun game.
In 2 days, made it to Master Tier in Ranked without spending any extra or having that awesome premium upgrade.

Also, if you stream you can ocassionally giveaway free copies of the game.
I usually stream after 9PM EST, if you wanna give it a go :)"
20341,10/10 would only have a 2% chance of getting Devil King Puff again. Milloween gotta stop going for KP tho
20342,"Best 49 cent I ever spent !


I really didn't expect much from this game when I got it.
Minion Masters completely took me by surprise. 
You are forced to duel against npcs or players on a small field. 
The goal is pretty simple kill the other duel master but it has a fair amount of strategy involved.
Minion Masters is a very impressive early access game with a lot of potential.
I have only played the game for 14 hours and it has already become very repetitive.
The game only has a handful of masters and cards to pick from. 
Minion Masters only has one map with a few different settings for me this is the games biggest problem.
Addressing and fixing the lack of maps for this game has to be the first step.
Adding new masters and cards will also be a key issue mainly will players be forced to buy these cards or not.
Hearthstone is a major card based game but buying cards is a big part of the game.
Minion Masters will have to decide if they will also force players to spend real cash to obtain those cards or not.
Hearthstone will say players can earn those cards but they go so far out of thier way to restrict those players.
Hearthstone puts out insane OP quest on hardest setting with new OP cards just to force players into buying.
Hearthstone restricts players progress to further force them into buying cards.
I realy enjoy Minion Masters but if turns into a cash grab like hearthstone I won't stick around.
Giving players the option is fine as long as they don't start restricting and punishing players for not buying cards.
Minion Masters needs to add new bigger maps with new objectives and ways to fight then a few masters and cards.
Early Access so hopefully will we see a lot of new content in the future.

20343,"Great Game, fast paced, no microtransaction abuse, best surprise of 2017 so far."
20344,"So I've played this game for a little bit now (329 hours on record...), and I can say that although I don't like some of the newer changes, this game is ADDICTIVE AS HELL. It really has that ""just one more"" thing going, as I can never quit on a loss and can never quit on a streak. It's 5 min at a time games make it perfect for doing something when youve got just a few minutes before moving on, and I can honestly say that this game has become one of my favorites."
20345,"Clash Royale, But alot better, worth the little bit of money!"
20346,"Better than Clash Royale. Coop can be really fun. Devs are working daily to make it better with updates every week and they listen to the community.
Still playing, updates are quite often with new content!"
20347,"so i want to recomend this or even gift it to others
BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTTT!!!

theres a game BREAKING bug they havent fixed, yet...many updates went by and it still exist :D


its a  ""Desync/LAG Spike""
what it does is after loading, before the match starts, there's an intro for the masters then
booom ""desync/lag spikes"" happens and it would look like you just went AFK or trolling :D

so the match timer for me mostly starts at -1seconds after that match starts you can summon units then

buuuut thats not always the case, when this ""desync/lag spike"" happens your match will start at 6-20seconds others have posted in discussion they have experienced it on 2v2, that their match timer was 30seconds!!! 
they started the match 30 effin seconds  so what happened there was they did nothing then you guessed it, 

its a big advantage for the enemy, and you will most likely lose or not XD

compared to other online competitve multiplayer games out there, this game doesnt let you load properly before you start a match or it doesnt give you enough time to prepare the match itself, lets look at DOTA or LOL those games gives you more time to prepare, and as for other games in the same game genre like this one, others have no issue like this.


if you are looking for a game like this but with many units/faction(ARMY) and larger map
you should check this out >>

20348,Very good game! It's like Clash Royale. It is very fun. Games are long. I think that's good.
20349,"well i though its a bad game or Dumb but when i try it its really fun 
"
20350,YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME !!!!
20351,"I recently bought this game on a sale because its extremely cheap but I didn't expect the game to be this extremely good. Minion Masters is a fantastic fast paced card-based real-time strategy game. You will play as a minion master and you can choose from the nine different masters that has their owned respective perks to suit your gameplay style. You will build a deck of cards that have different minions on it. Each card has their own ability so they have their own different strengths and weakness. You need to strategically play your cards to gain an upper hand against your opponent. The first player to drain the other's health wins. Some says the game is pay-to-win but I disagree because you cant buy the cards directly. The game might provide an edge to the players who puts money on the game but it doesn't mean the game is entirely pay-to-win, it just makes their grinding a little bit faster compare to the others. Overall, Minion Masters’ fast paced and humorous, colorful style creates a bizarrely fun addicting game. It's still in early access right now so Im still expecting major improvements over the course of time."
20352,"Clash Royale is free ,and better"
20353,"It's the best game of its genre on PC by far. Weekly content and balance patches and great involvment of the developers is a great bonus. While the price is already low, you can actually get the game for free by watching different twitch streamers playing this game or other streamers promoting it (look up KrippNL and his free referral link)."
20354,"This game like Clash Royale On mobile
But this game have a lot of hero and better graphic ;)"
20355,Good game
20356,"Best description for this game is ""Clash Royale for PC""."
20357,"7/10

Minion Masters is a really fun game. If you enjoy Clash Royale on mobile I would recommend it to you.
The devs are constantly updating the game with new cards, bug fixes and fun new features. This game definitely needs more players :D"
20358,"Very good game!
-Good strategies
-Not to much thinking so its a bit relaxed
-good updates"
20359,nie polecam
20360,I like This games Its Fun!
20361,Clash royale on pc!
20362,"Pros:
This Is not one of the Pay to Win games. 
Minion Masters is one of the fairest free to play card game.  :-)
You can earn almost everything for free, and It's not necessary to level up your cards like crazy.
Friendly playerbase 
Easy to play
Hard to master
Lots of replayability
Good graphics
The matches are short. (~1xmin per match)

Cons:
The game is not balanced. 

Some decks are better than other decks, it is hard to play this game with high risk decks if you don't know your teammate."
20363,"didnt even bought it. 
got it in a trade from someone who didnt want it.
if it was free to play maby just maby play, but those 5$ are not worth it."
20364,"Since nobody is doing a pros and cons of the game, here is one.

Pros:
* Has a global chat
* Active playerbase
* Almost no hackers
* Consistant updates
* High replayability due to the nature of PvP
* Most of the ""OP"" cards are below supreme
* Decent graphics and it feels really polished
* Has a leaderboard to brag about or work towards
* Legendaries are situational cards. Most decks don't need them
* Has skins for masters and deploy effects for cards if the player gets enough copies of a card
* Will be free to play after early access and often goes on sales or even becoming free for short periods of time
* Semi friendly playerbase (though people do get salty in global chat a bit, mostly due to blaming their teammate in 2v2)
* Not pay to win. Minion masters only makes the player have to collect most of the cards. (no card levels like ""Clash Royale!"")
* You can play with steam friends, not more than one though, unless you fight each other which reqires 4 people (has a 2v2 gamemode)

Cons:
* Bad matchmaking
* Small playerbase
* Costs money (for now)
* The game is not perfectly balanced
* You start with a small card collection
* Longer queue times than most games, usually 0-30 seconds. It can go up to around 4 minutes at the higher ranks. >4 minutes is extremely rare and only really happens at higher ranks when no one is on at those ranks. Or in draft because is is an unpopular gammode.
* Is kind of slow to get all of the cards.I have 1 of ~7/8 of the legendarys and ~3/10 in total including wild cards with ~400 hous in mtaches and no premium.. Note that thats the legendaries, not all of the other rarities, other rarities are much easier to get

Pons? (could be ""pros"" or ""cons""):
* Is a card game
* Is a PVP game
* Is a PC game and is not on any other platforms
* Games tend to last longer at higher ranks or when players use stall decks (decks can be designed to survive into late game and play very defensively)
* There is no abslolute time limit for games. There is an real time minute though (mana frenzy)
* The matches can last up to usually around 7 minutes at the real max (it almost never lasts much longer than 7 minutes, though it can in extremely rare circumstances)


100% Legit Overall:
1/0 Streamsniping all the streamers on twitch is the best. ;)
Also, it's Clash Royale, but horizontal instead of vertical.

""Real"" Overall:
8/10 The game is fun, however It has really bad matchmaking which is the primary downside other than the price for this game. It has a good, ""free"", pay to win alternative on mobile called ""Clash Royale"""
20365,"Basically, this game is what I wanted Clash Royale to be.

Minion Masters offers a similar ""tug of war"" gameplay to Clash Royale in which players summon creatures and play spells into two lanes in an attempt to push forward to take out the enemy Master (= King). However, as compared to Clash Royale, Minion Masters has both more strategic depth and a much more player-friendly business model.

There is a lot to like about this game, but I think what I like best is how well the developers have done at differentiating the various Masters. Each player has a Master who stands on a fixed base at the back of the arena and has a different basic attack to defend itself. (Some Masters have generic basic attacks, others are strong against certain types of enemies -- e.g. AOE attack vs Swarms -- but weaker against other foes.) Additionally, each Master has three special abilities that have a significant impact on both deck-building and gameplay. Basically, the goal of deck-building is to maximize the synergy that you have with your Master's abilities (while still making sure you have answers to the threats you expect to face). 

With regards to the business model, the game features a model where units and spells are represented by cards. Cards have different rarities, and the game is generous with giving you the currency you need to acquire random cards. Like many games that feature cards there is a ""crafting"" system that allows you to destroy cards you don't want (or have extras of) in order to create the cards you want or need. The two things that really make the business model player-friendly are: (1) the generousity with regards to cards and currency; and (2) the power-level of common cards. Many games that use rarity-based systems have high-rarity cards that are strictly more useful/powerful than lower-rarity cards. In Minion Masters, the lower-rarity cards are shockingly useful in a variety of decks and don't get overshadowed by higher-rarity cards.  There are certainly opportunities to build synergy-heavy decks with an assortment of high-rarity cards, but you can also build a deck with lower-rarity cards and do very well. Essentially, high-rarity cards are more specialized and niche -- and can be useful with the right synergies -- but don't seem to have more raw power."

20367,"A reasonable strategy game that will eventually go f2p with less grindy bits?
Yup, that's MM.

-Don't need hundreds of cards to upgrade, multiples are just a bonus and you'll never need more than 3. Most of the time one is fine, extras can be salvaged to craft more you want.
-Earning cards via playing games at an ok rate or get more with in-game currency via RNG.
-2v2 and drafting are fun.
-There are cheese strats but the devs do balance passes a fair amount.
-The PvE feels a little bit mobile game but it's optional (also single player only).

Worth the initial price, wait for it to go free, or find one of the many free codes floating around."

I have overall put in 20 hours in less than 4 days, and playing with freinds has been incredibly smooth and without bugs.

Pros:

So far it has not been a pay to win, but that is up to Platinum. Gaining, and progressing is not impossible but very enjoyable.
2v2 online is very fun with friends.
Strategy is not impossible to figure out and has a pretty general learning curve.

20423,"I am addicted, it is easier than a card game to adjust to the meta since units are left to fend for themselves.  Understanding the targeting mechanics is the skill and timing is more critical than card selection."
20424,"This game has proved to be a fun way to pass the time.  It's not the most in-depth deck building game out there, nor is it the most strategic - but it still has lots of playability.  It's quirky in all the right places and has a decent enough ranking system for multiplayer"
20425,"I joined Minion Masters some time in it's Beta version, but only just recently got back into the game.
It's one of those ""collect cards to use against other players to gain treasures to upgrade and craft new cards"" types of games. So, if you like that style, Minion Masters excellently pulls it off in what feels like a new way to play. Personally, I can enjoy it for a couple hours at a time, but I'm not sure I could ever truly get into it. There's no truly final level you get to, as ranks are reset every now-and-then, but it's still fun.
I'm not sure I would spend the $4.99 that they're asking for it, but at the time of this review, it's only $0.49. I would recommend getting it on sale to waste some time on with your friends, but don't invest too much in this game."
20426,"Good gameplay, although the balance of some of the masters needs work. The expedition mode is a controversial bit, but i enjoy it."
20427,Surprisingly fun
20428,"It's a 3D strategy based card game. Give it a try if you like these kind of games. I think it's fun, or I wouldn't have over 400 hours in it, would I?"
20429,"Better than Hearthstone, Clash Royale, and any other game of that style.

Update: Game of the year, every year."
20430,Way better then I expected!
20431,Justs gets better with time.
20432,good
20433,Good game. I like it! :-)
20434,"3D Horizontal Clash Royale Clone.  Clone may be kind of harsh, but it is undoubtedly heavily inspired by Clash Royale.  Definitely has its quirks but devs very active and are constantly tweaking balance.  Matches are quick (~3 minutes), so it's a great game if you don't have lots of time to play."
20435,"I started playing this game a while back now and i keep returning to it. It can be super fun at lower ranks, but you need to focus your decks if you want to climb the ranks. The character designs are all over the place but in a fun way; a hodge podge mix of sci-fi, fantasy, and god only knows. I have become more and more interested in the other games released by these guys."

20446,Awesome game that keeps on delivering
20447,Minion Masters is a great game for those who may be into card games and MOBA. The game feels like a mix of the 2 and can be really enjoyable. The game is essentially Free To Play already as you'll find many copies of it floating about and you can definitely play without spending money. They update frequently so the game changes even if just a minor update on some cards making online gameplay evolve as different cards swap in and out of play. Give it a try if you're into those kind of games.
20448,"This is a through explanation on the gameplay:
It's like clash royale but more simple. You have no archer tower, you only have one king(master) tower. You can choose your king(master) from a variety of kings(masters) and each of them have their own different skills. Also your lane and the opponents lane are connected by bridges. You will have control over a bridge if your minion is the last one there(standing or passing over the bridge) and vice versa. Controlling the bridge will make you level up faster. Yes your king(master) have level. Everybody start on level 0 and will start gaining xp to level up with the max being level 3. Each king(master) will have 3 skills and you'll unlock your first skill on reaching level 1 and so on. Your king(master) tower have more HP than in clash royale. 
Also, unlike in clash royale, your cards dont have levels, meaning your opponent cant have an advantage of having higher level cards.

TIP: This game is more of spamming your cards (units, spells, etc), because there's not that much space to let you strategize a lot (strategizing don't have that much of an impact on the gameplay, unlike clash royale). Also, unlike in clash royale, if you get swarmed, you'll most likely end up dead, so don't get swarmed. That's it.

Overall, fun experience"

20450,PC version of clash royale. its good
20451,"[h1]Super fun, got this from a friend, would buy.[/h1]
This game feels really fresh, it's fast-paced but rewards tactics and strategy. 
Kind of dissapointed by the amount of microtransaction's since the isn't ftp. Kind of P2W (but hey, look at Hearthstone). And the PvE adventure needs some tweaking. Still it's a great game. I hope devs will take this in the right direction and not milk players and leave the game to rot.

[b]8/10 would listen to narrator again.[/b]"
20452,"Minion Masters well, not for a moment will cause you to have a wow effect, won't make you forget about all the games in the library and bury yourself in it until the zombies, but that is very surprising, the game is good in its niche and General characteristics as a whole.

The project is in Early Access, because the final verdict to make even earlier, but at this stage of the game is very friendly and filled with content. Due to the fact that almost one hundred percent emphasis on PVP battles in real time, all aspects of the game motivate you to take part in matches as often as possible, not to create queues waiting in the lobby.

That is why the battle lasted a few minutes. And for those few minutes you get to a sea of emotions, trying to overcome the enemy. After one fight, I want another one. What is logical is screwed ranking system to gradually climb the ladder of professionalism. Every month rank resets and plus a certain portion of the experience to start from scratch. In parallel with the grades there is a system of levels. For obtaining the new give us all sorts of useful loot.

Minion Masters the whole battle system is built on passive management. You choose a card from the deck, put on the field unit and see how it goes Rashit opponent using your skills and characteristics. Cards quite a lot and have relative counterparts of each other with only minor differences, and there are very unusual, unique card. Accordingly, there is a gradation of values cards. You can get them in the process of leveling hero, and buy at the store for the local currency, and Donat. I was not hard to score a pack of different cards and brute force in the battle to find the perfect composition that I hardly will soon change. Although sometimes I enter a new map for testing.

Another advantage of Minion Masters is its simplicity. Simplicity is evident in all aspects. Intuitive interface, a minimum of superfluous information. Even the graphics, pleasing to the eye, looks rustic. Why I attribute it to the pros because the person who wants to play half an hour in such a game would be enough to spend no more than five minutes in the lobby and the same time in the battle to master all the mechanics of the game and get pleasure from it."
20453,For a $5 Early Acess Game this is a solid fun game.
20454,"Pros:

- You start off with the most OP champion in the game.
- Game has above average grahpics
- Fun for the first few hours.
- Has potential, but I sincerely doubt the developers can steer it into the right direction. Hopefully I will be delightfully surprised in the future.

Cons:

- Pay To Win
- Leveling up in Ranked is incredibly easy, you stomp your enemy so hard you feel bad for them. This is the case until you reach a full stop. You get to a point where you just can't climb anymore because the tables turn and you get stomped instead.
- Stomp or be stomped, the chance of finding an equal match is like finding a sasquatch."
20455,"i got it from a free key codes site, aaand, thumbs up cuz it its useful with IdleMaster cuz it have cards, dont buy, go to any free key codes site."

Something average"
20459,Pretty darn fun pc version of clash royale
20460,SABI!!!
20461,"This game is awesome they have taken clash royale and hertstone ideas and improved it in so many levels. I'm Bronze 5 atm and it just got interestig.

Pros: 
*The heroes and perks system
*The is no level for cards which in my opinion makes it a lot less p2w thingy its all equal
*Interesting cards, and they all are OP when combined correctly. theres so many cards that there are so many counters to each others decks. its freaking awesome!
*Gameplay modes:Expeditions, Draft, Challenges, etc.
*The market prices feels fair but thats a matter of prespective.

Cons:
*Quests sometimes feel quite hard for what they offer in return
*The Shards System. very very hard and grindy."
20462,very good
20463,"I used to love playing this game. However, I noticed, that it wasted my time offering little to none entertainment value in return. No educational value. No fulfillment of my actual needs. I no longer recommend this title. There are way better single player story games that you could play instead (especially on PlayStation). Or you could spend time with your family. Or you could read a book. Value your time and keep away from free-to-play and multiplayer games with micro-transactions.

The following is a copy of fellow Steam user review for Minion Masters
This game is designed to suck people's time, using persuasive technology such as:
- daily login rewards,
- daily quests,
- battle passes with daily XP boost,
- loot boxes
- the need to grind massively to unlock important cards
- the need to grind massively to rank up and get rewards
- peer-pressured grinding via a guild system

""Persuasive technology (also called persuasive design) works by deliberately creating digital environments that users feel fulfill their basic human drives — to be social or obtain goals — better than real-world alternatives. Kids spend countless hours in social media and video game environments in pursuit of likes, “friends,” game points, and levels — because it’s stimulating, they believe that this makes them happy and successful, and they find it easier than doing the difficult but developmentally important activities of childhood."""
20464,Mi se pare ca joc Clash Royale pe PC
20465,Jhfydgxh
20466,nice
20467,"Pros:
+addictive and fun at first
+nice graphics
+fast duels

Cons:
-so much much much much more frustrating than fun
-unbalanced AF and devs don't giva a f*** about that
-P2W in it's worst 
-bugged and glitchy
-rigged matchmaking

After playing this piece of crap for a while I'm absolutely certain that this is one of the worst ""games"" I've ever played. Notwithstanding that it's Early access. Actually, being EA makes it's even worse: you absolutely must not charge money for something as glitchy, buggy and unbalanced as this. It's should be called ""Abuse masters"" because that is all this game is about: you buy a master with easily abusable perks, buy a lot of tokens to get good cards to build abusive deck and there you go. Unless you make mistakes or get matched against another abuser you win everything. That pretty much explains why devs don't bother about balance: normal players come and go, they are just ""meat"" for abusers, who pay money and get what they want.     

Every few dozens of mathes you just get disconnected and lose. Every few team macthes your teamate leaves or disconnects and you lose. As soon as you manage to get a small winstreak you get matched with abusers and get a 5-10 game lose strick. 

Better avoid this lame trash before you get addicted. ""Devs"" who make ""games"" like this should be banned from Steam and gaming industry forever.

1000000000000000000000000000 lame greedy devs out of 10.

Update: finally I'm done with this sh-ty excuse of a game! Recent update brought a rework of Expeditions and made them essentially useless. Before this rework you could get a lot out of expedition: random cards, several tokens, resources and a lot of gold. And that allowed you to catch up at least a little to those who bought Premium and donates for resources. Now all you get is a small amount of gold + 1 token and you can do only 1 expedition per week. P2W of this game  reached a new hight.

Devs are too pu$$y to push any actual changes this game needs in balance, matchmaking or anything, since in their opinion this game needs more players first. So it's up to players to deal somehow with all that buIIsh*t that's going on. 

And this game's community is absolutely the worst gathering of the worst scumbags I've ever seen in Steam yet. Cause every f-ng abuser scum thinks he is cool and ok just because devs allow it. Notorious for it's toxicity communities of Dota 2 and CS:GO seem rather nice and friendly after this s**thole. F**k this sh*t, I'm out!"
20468,The highly upgraded Clash Royale has some minor bugs but is poorly optimized. Optimization would want to patch it but it's 3 times better than C.R. 6/10.
20469,"This review is being written during Early Access:

Use your wits to meet out punishment to all who oppose you. When things look dire, you can always rely on your Master to push back the tide.

Minion Masters combines the intense action of a MOBA game with the strategy of a TCG. Collect cards and build decks to battle other players. Combine the strengths of the Master with the deck to build the best strategy. You can play a ton of cheap, fast minions to overrun your opponent, or use spells and abilities to tear down the enemy army and drop a big/bad to push to the enemy Master. In the end, the last Master standing wins.

Currently, there are only 9 Masters and little over 100 cards but it is growing.

I recieved this game for free from an NVidia giveaway. I enjoyed the game so much that I got copies for my wife and kids accounts as well. Buy it. You won't regret it. If you are a fan of either genre, you will definitely enjoy Minion Masters."
20470,"I love 2v2. 
Really fun game. Lots of tactical decisions. 
Many viable strategies, but some tuning is still needed when it comes to cards/abilities that stack with casting spells. 
Game is getting regular updates."
20471,"Really nice and cute game, but I won't invest my time in it, maybe you will so try it to see how you like it."
20472,"Easy to learn, hard to master. Suggested to all who like rts and fast thinking, this game will make you spend hours upgrading your deck, improving your strategy and increasing your rank. It can still be improved, being it in early access, but it's polished enough to make you have your fun, and it has the right dose of humour and fun."
20473,This game is simple but kind of fun and addictive. Worth it
20474,"This game is fun.
For how cheap I was able to get it, it was worth it.
The recent econemy changes have made this game much less fun.
Draft rewards are lack luster and the new expedition mode is slow and a gold sync.
Even the expedition PvE battle are super boring becaues they made them super easy.
On top of that they're pushing you to play expedition.
Until changes are made and the recent changes are addressed I cannot recommend this game.

(Edit 10 Dec 2018) Been playing for a few months now and besides some stale Grand Master decks this game is super fun and has come a long way! Totally would recommend this game to anybody. It's casual friendly at lower ranks if you're not looking for a super challenging experience.

+1 to the Devs."
20475,"you need to make a report feature, somone named Administrator is spammeing everyone in chat messages the the game is lost or the pool is closed
"
20476,There needs to be one extra event that we can use to get that slight piece of gold for a guaranteed  power token every day
20477,"If you like Clash Royale then you will like this one, too...well, when it doesn't disconnect you or crashes. 7/10"
20478,"Being a big fan of the earlier BetaDwarf games (FORCED & FORCED SHOWDOWN), I was disappointed to see the company jump onto the ""Free To Play"" bandwagon and cease development on FORCED SHOWDOWN, which could use some polish. 
Minion Masters incorporates many of the same ideas in a multiplayer environment, while adding in-app purchases.  

I'll be the first to admit, I'm biased against the ""Free To Play"" model.  Though from a business standpoint, it can be quite profitable if there is a substantial player base, it quite often simply milks the player for more money in the long run.  Should the player base die out, a substantial amount of money can end up wasted.  Being an older, more casual gamer, that simply isn't ""my cup of tea"" so to speak.

That is not to say this game does not have merit, there are those who clearly enjoy it.  More serious and competitive gamers who don't mind a possible long-term investment may really enjoy this game.  That being stated, more casual gamers are liable to be sorely disappointed, as I was.  

Bottom line, if you are a more avid competitive gamer that doesn't mind a long-term investment, this game might appeal to you.  On the other hand, if you are a more casual gamer, this title is not liable to be what you are looking for.  Nonetheless, the ""Free To Play"" model has become very prolific and it is not surprising to see the company headed in that direction."

20480,"I play 1 game on steam, DotA 2. I have 3600 hours in it... But this game got me not playing DotA... This game is actually really good, much fun"
20481,awesome
20482,Disbalanced trash
20483,"I'm gonna be honest, while the game did aim to be a Clash Royale knock-off, it has it's own special side that just makes it more different than Clash Royale.

And as for the reply of the Developer, I didn't quite enjoy the game at first and didn't really want to play it anymore, because I would just get beaten by players that would just have stronger cards than me, but I do appreciate it that you have replied to my Review.

Other than, that this game gets a score of 7.50/10 from me, while it isn't the best, it has potential and can become something bigger."
20484,"Criminally underated game, tons of stuff to keep you coming back day after day.
Despite low player counts matchmaking is still a breeze.

pros:
-Quick matchmaking.
-Plenty of heroes with different play styles to choose from.
-Updated often (almost every week)
-Enough cards to keep anyone interested.
-Several different modes to keep anyone interested

Cons:
-Cards are released one at a time rather than in expansion packs like hearthstone.
-3 different virtual currencies make it annoying when you dont have enough of one.
-Only one card given per pack.
-Frequent updates make reviews invalid very quickly

Well worth a try"
20485,"Overall a great game, recently the company has gotten rid of Gold as the main income and went with supply (for expiditions) which I feel is the wrong direction, but overall the battle system is still great."
20486,"basicaly a better clash royale. no pay 2 win, singleplayer experiences, 3 different ladders with random 2v2, premade 2v2 and singles battles. only costs 0.49€ in sales or with coupons. the basic cards are strong enough to get through wood/stone/bronze and silver. (i'm in gold 1, i bet if i play a bit more i can reach the next league too with that) it gets frequent balance updates and new stuff. many freebies to grab. overall just a great experience... and the visuals are just awesome. it's so fun to see a big minion hit something small and have it flying off screen or against a building of the surrounding of the map. had many laughs with my friend already :)

(oh and if you purchase, you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free aswell)"
20487,"Played for a couple of hours. Game seems like its really well balanced, I won all 15 or so matches I had ranked. I also won a epic halloween skin so the odds dont seem too terrible for things.

The game is fun. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft 2 Desert Strike. I love it."
20488,cool game had fun playing
20489,gameplay look nice
20490,This is a nice game
20491,"Version 1.19 killed the game.
Don't lose your time in this pay to win game. Find something new to have fun. Minion Masters was wonderful and a great game, now it's another p2w and it won't have a lot of new stuff like before.

Old review (2017):
""A good game. After the release of 2vs2 I started to play the PvP, I spent months playing versus bot only =p (I hate 1vs1)
I really love how this game works for cooperative.
It's simple, good graphics, developers keep trying to add new content to make it more dynamic. 
It needs new cards or some balance, but it's already awesome in present.

I just don't like the system when a teammate disconnects and you insta-lose.

Edit: I never spent money, but it's harder ofc, there's no need to pay, you just reach the top quickly (so it's kinda p2w). If you are patient as me you can play, have a lot of fun and craft cards in a long time (you dont need to care about ranking ;-; you really can have fun in this =p ). My max rank was Diamond 2 (or 1, i dont know), so... it's okay if you are poor :p """
20492,this game for free http://betadwarf.com/kripp/
20493,"Nice small game. You can play for free if u like. You don´t have to pay and it has realy good strategy features.
I realy recommend it. If u want to support the devs then spend a bit money when u like it."
20494,ehhh
20495,Having to force shut down the game each time cause the settings menu has no exit option? talk about getting sucked into something.
20496,"Fun game, easy to pick up, easy to master(hehe). Easy game, easy life 10/10."
20497,Good game.IF you like Clash Royal then you will like this game
20498,Don't know if any of youi guys have played Clash Royal on your phones cause is kinda the same however in my opinion it is far better that clash royal.
20499,"Good game.
Clash Royale game on computer but with different cards, which are awesome. There are some achievements which you can do.
You have to think and sometimes you need some luck to get good cards.
And you can get trading cards."

20508,"This game is pretty fun! I've played it for a decent time now and it's great! It reminds me of this game called clash royale. Some of the cards you can use on this game are pretty cool, definitely not boring! I did get this for free with a key but I'd say it's still good for $5!"

20510,"Minion masters issuch a great game. Is one of my favourites :)

(Private Issue)
Unfortunetly this isn't the case any more. Ever since a recent update this game has been absolutely terrible. The new exploration mode is rubbish and now all of my quest give me rewards for things I don't want (in game currency for exploration mode). I wish this was optional. It ruins the gameplay for me and the community just isn't there any more. 

Apart from that the game is reasonably ok. I really enjoy it and I recommend it. Although I don't think it should be that expensive and I would only buy it on sale."
20511,"The game was dying before release, so it became free.

But the game is still dying.

My advice?

[b]Don't waste your time with this game.[/b]

I have supported this game for so long, but became disappointed with too many issues like bashings against the good community, abusive MODs and the steady implement of an agressive microtransaction system that closely translates to pay-to-win;"
20512,"GG
"
20513,"Not a bad game, but I'm waiting to hit the p2w wall soon enough."
20514,"This game is really fun at the start when everyone has the same cards but then the real problems start to show. Fireball a basic spell you get costs 4 mana to use and does 150 dmg, It kills some 4 mana cards and even a couple 5 which is good. The problem is healing fireball and the healing spells, buildings, units in general. Healing fireball costs 2 half as much mana and heals for 400 over double what the 4 mana one does. Preistess is a 4 mana card that heals a unit near it, pretty normal for a game like this. The card however can attack while healing and can attack air units as well, meaning that the only counter to is using a spell like fireball right? nope. The game right now so far is someone saving for a large minion with a lot of health then puppy guarding it with cards that increase its health total as well as heal it like preistess or healing fireball. The spell that does the most damage is a 6 mana spell called Beam of Doom which generally kills most things besides the 7-9 mana costing cards. This means that you do not have a spell that can reliably kill their strategy. You might kill the preistess with this and damage the minion they are guarding but then they will only spend 2 mana and quickly heal it right up. Ive been trying to find a way to stop this and there is a 4 mana card called Lighting Bolt that kills a random enemy minion witch is the only way around this. If you hit the lighting bolt you tend to win but if you miss its a guranteed loss. The past couple days every game has been this way. I mainly play doubles but I have seen this problem in singles as well. Another problem with the game is shards. It costs 2000 shards to create a legendary card but if you somehow manage to get 2 of the same you can get rid of one for 500. The proportion is crazy bad. Getting a legendary from a pack seems damn near impossible too. I have played for 27 hours and I have only gotten one legendary and it wasnt from a pack, It was from doing achievements. I have only gotten 4 of the supreme rarity cards as well. This game can be fun, the expeditions are a really cool idea that I like a lot but so far the way to win is to play a deck that makes me want to tear my hair out. I tried to make a deck to get around this colossous play and you just cant. If they are playing Mordar no matter what you do you are going to lose. Lazer turret wont work beam of doom wont work absoloutly nothing will work. I really hope they fix this problem becuase if you want to try a fun or creative deck you will get your ass kicked time and time again.
UPDATE
For Witchwood I am somewhat still dissapointed with the game. The meta currrently with me writing this review is just pushing with Brutus and winning of off that. If you survive the first one a second one will arrive shortly. Its no fun becuase there is still only one counter card (that card being laser turret) but it is so easy to deal with that it cant fire without being destroyed. I like the werewolves but they have so much health and dmg that when you pair it with Ravagers frenzy they are extreamly storng, and with their high health they still have quite a lot of hp when they hit 50%. The did nerf the Bats Bats Bats with the Goraki brothers card which just won you the game every time but now its all ravager and theres no way to stop it. Harbinger seems to be the closets counter but it fires so slowly that it too can be dealt with easily. The only hard counter I have found is Magma Storm and its pretty RNG. Against worse players that you, you can defeat your opponet if you are more skilled than them but if you are on an equal plane and they have a Ravager deck, you are probably going to lose. In short I like the game but right now the meta is just not fun one bit."
20515,"For a game that is priced  relatively low, it provides so much more entertainment and value than what's it's worth. The in-game matches are short and enjoyable with lots of different combinations of strategic play and cards/decks to always allow you to play every match differently as you see fit. Of course, this game is only in beta and there can only be more and more great additions that can be made to take the game to another level. Keep at it devs for continuous innovation of cards and all the good work that has been accomplished so far!"
20516,Munted Clash Royale
20517,This game is awesome. It plays like a StarCraft mini-game. Very easy to get into with very fun characters. Super addictive and a single game will last usually between 1 and 5 minutes.
20518,"Recent economy changes have made this game much, much worse. I can't recommend buying it in this state (or even playing it for free). If you are interested in games where you move across a world map, with EXTREMELY limited progress (gated by time / progress) to do some mediocre PvE encounters, this one might tickle your fancy.

As it is though, collection of cards has been severely impacted and reduced. No bueno."
20519,"Surprisingly good game, easy to get into, but has depth to keep coming back. Players play at their cards (minions) at the same time so there is no waiting for on your opponent like most ccgs which is an added bonus. Has a nice PVE option as well as 2v2s."
20520,"Played a fairly decent amount so far. If you keep up on your daily quests and use the explore function to its fullest, its easy to acquire a full set of cards with no money spent at all. If you enjoy hero based minion arena games, play this game. Its mechanics are refined, the gameplay feels solid, and it has a solid aesthetic and identity. 

If I had critical feedback it would be that I would aprecciate seeing a casual mode implemented in the future, as currently all VS and tag team matches have only ranked play available. I would also appreciate a mulligan feature, but these are minor issues. 

If you feel like spending the dollar right now to get into it, I'd reccomened it. If you don't want to pay but you are interested, put it on your wishlist and come back in january when it's free and I promise you a good time."
20521,Nice game
20522,nice 1 :3
20523,so far i've only played about 50 mins and i can already tell i'm going to put hours into the game my big issue is in this little time i have been playing i've been disconnected about 6 times my internets bad but not shit its still early access so i have hope this game is going to get even better later i just hope it don't die like some of the games on here.
20524,"Thought this was going to be a joke, its actually really good (kinda addicting)."
20525,LOVE THIS GAME!
20526,"I just started playing this last night but it's a well made and thought out enjoyable game. It's a mix between a tower defence and deck building game, which is interesting, and you can go out and explore to bring back gold and treasure which can help you in future fights. Overall, this game is worth picking up and playing."

20529,"Well, pretty addicting... GOOOD JOB!!"
20530,"A good unbugged version of clash royale, more interesting and with a lot of possible develops in the future. If they keep on the work on it it will be a very very good game (as it is actually).
Truly reccomended, very funny with a friend but also alone.
Incredible cheap price (taken on steam summer sales with a 90% discount on it + a free copy for a friend!!)

9/10"
20531,Worth every dollar.
20532,Very good game
20533,so fun #1 game
20534,"amazingly fun game.
Even having got it for free, I've made sure to purchase premium to support the devs.
Surprisingly addictive and casual at the same time, quick matches that leave you wanting to play more.
For veterans of warcaft custom, it's basically Castle Fight Meets heartstone (apparently it's the same premisse of those mobile games, clash of clans~ but I do not know them).
The game itself is surprisingly polished and balanced for a early access product and shows enourmous potential to be the future heartstone.
I hope the developers keep doing the good work, the game, so far, for me, has been a perfect experience. I've just enjoyed every single aspect from it, draft, single player, team matches, expeditions... More than Recomended!

20544,"Super fun innovative game. Reminds me of the old WC3 mod Castle War, however much faster and currently very balanced.
Hope the devs keep up the great work!"
20545,Nice Game in Early Access Sjust to Play This Game if you Have Money or wait for Relest of the Game.
20546,my phone game is better
20547,Great game

10/10"
20549,"8/10 this game is good. but the legendary most of it is suck.
 like kill him self damage all friend and enemy. 
can posses enemy but died instead. 
success posses but the health is too low now and died without purpose. (seriously they should atleast make it like banshee in wc3 for ghost skill, you know. when using posses skill on minion the targeted minion cant attack. that would help becaese enemy would counter it with spell instead of dying without doing anything big to enemy even with the fact that this card is legendary)
"
20550,"NICE GAME AND FUN TO WASTE UR TIME !! LOVE IT
GG"
20551,"Excellent TCG, very good FTP model (unlike most I've played) Still in early access but well worth sinking time into"
20552,There is not enough minions very bad game
20553,"This game is great. Simple, yet difficult. Timing is everything. You can get top tier decks with basic cards. There are no pay to win elements. 
It's being updated regularly, new things are being added and cards are being balanced with each patch.

The only negative thing i can say about the game is matchmaking. I am guessing, due to limited number of players, it tends to pair weird people with each other.

Overall, great game. 8/10"
20554,"as of right now I find this game, a very interesting one. 
becuase this game is more a play2win than a pay2win because every month there is a ladder to climb (re=climb every month) and you can see which cards are used by the best players and can create a deck like them without in some cases needed to have a lot of powerfull cards that are difficult to get.

but is it worth the 5 euro?

I think it's not worth it, i think they should make it F2P or lower the price because after buying game there still are options of in-game stuff that need to be bought with money."
20555,Enjoying it!
20556,"The game is really good at giving the thrills, I haven't felt an adrenaline rush after a tense match for a long time. The expeditions are a nice touch for a more laid back game approach. The doubles team matches are really cool, there's so much fun to be had there. A lot of kudos for having such a wide range of game specs, you can play this on a toaster and still be running fast without losing much of the look.
I just got fed up with all the meta, I dislike that part of the game where you're not playing the game, but looking up deck builds.
Overall, a really nice game."
20557,"Nice game it's like Clash Royale but in better with another universe, better graphics, more content and on PC 
I hate Clash Royale for it's P2W side and it's community but Minion Masters is really balanced so there is no problems about that they also have a Discord for the community it's really nice

"
20558,"This might be the most f2p game when it releases f2p. 
Rarer cards are made to be more situational than lower rarity cards. Basic cards almost always have the most direct strength, and are the best at what they do. You can make a solid deck with entirely basic cards.
Premium currency is actually obtainable in reasonable quantities without spending money.
You only really need one copy of each card due to the wildcard system.

If you need a key you can probably find one by asking around.

- 

Updated 3/31/2021. See other negative reviews for why my stance has changed. Game is getting worse, not better, which is not what development teams are supposed to do to their games."
20559,Amazing game! very much like clash royale but with alot more content and appealing graphics for steam. I have recomended this game to many of my friends and all of them approve. I feel i should stop typing now as i seem to be more into writing this than doing the spanish homework ive got due tomorrow........
20560,Great fun and cute graphics!
20561,a mastapeece
20562,Very noice game
20563,"I started playing this game at 9pm... and went to bed at 2. I have a daughter and a job - that was unusual. I played a bunch of CR a while ago and this game, while it follows the same format, somehow does away with all of the horrible anxiety I'd experience with CR. I like the art style and the goofiness to the announcer and unit naming. I am all around a fan of this game and have yet to hit any kind of pay wall that I can see. Good stuff, guys."
20564,"Great game, unfortunately it has an awful in-game economy, forcing you to grind for weeks in order to get a sizeable collection (roughly 23h hours in game gets you the same content as 4$)."
20565,very nice graphic right there
20566,Very good and fun game would play more. NOT A COPY OF CLASH ROYAL! THIS CAME OUT BEFORE:/
20567,Clash Royale for PC without card upgrades ♥
20568,Kripparian sent me here - and I like it! 10/10 would pay real money for it!
20569,"I was legendary rank in Hearthstone, but haven't played it much after I felt how much more skill-based this game is:

I'm about plantinum league. When I returned from a break, I managed 40+ game winstreaks when climbing back up. Yet I tried friendly matches with a grandmaster, and he wrecked me badly 10 games out of 10, even when my deck was favored.
Losses in Hearthstone often left me feeling there was nothing I could have done - here there's just so much room for always improving your skill level.

Games are quick (2-6 minutes) and the free progression is about twice as fast as Hearthstone.

I found the $20 premium purchase (permanent +100% bonus from daily quests) well worth it, but be aware that the rare cards are more unique than they are powerful. Looking are the top 20 ladder decks, you could build 5-10 of them with less than 10 hours of free progression."
20570,great game
20571,your good
20572,nice game..its similiar with clash of royale
20573,"Honestly, while this game feels like it should be on mobile, and is designed for it, it's also an actually good game.

It's kinda weird to say it that way, but it's about how it is. It's a fun little PvP game that is pretty simple and short, good for short bursts, but actually has some solid depth to it. Or, rather, will, once they iron out the balance and such. Core gameplay works, concepts work, just needs fine tuning."
20574,"Great Concept, Great gameplay only needs to speed up characters a bit and possible special powerups, early access great start and recommended purchase"
20575,i like it... player progression is kinda slow. but its fun.
20576,"Simply put: Buy this game ONLY if you are hardcode competetive player. There is no casual mode and after while you will meet only those who want to play this seriously

There is ""pve"" mode which is barebones adventure in world map agains easy ai but you get supplies WERY slowly so you can play it about once a day unless you want to spend money"
20577,lul
20578,"A Great Game For A Great Price!

Good Job!"
20579,Great game
20580,This game suprised me. its really good!
20581,"I dont feel it is resource intensive for the brain, easy to grasp and chill.
You get what you buy which is a casual cards game with some new systems like mana and heroes with their abilities."
20582,"It would be great if they can make you carry on a team battle if your teammate leaves, letting you control their deck as well."
20583,"Great game, you will have lots of fun with it"
20584,"Well, it's colorful, it has some dynamic to it but still it looks like a cash sink to me. Trying to play with a basic deck is hard. You have some crappy cards while your enemy has pretty much only the good ones. If you want better cards you know, spend some $ on this game.

Oh, and this Protoss Archer master is pretty World-of-Warcrafty in appearance.

Idk, probably it's not for me."
20585,11/10 - FUN - 🔝
20586,"Fun game until i got to draft.Seams to put me with too high of foes. Nothing like loosing 5 times in a row to ruin a game for you.
Very clash of clansy"
20587,decent
20588,good pvp game
20589,best game ver
20590,I like the minions
20591,"Game is very nice for me as tower defence category games lover and same time u got some card game elements here. Ranking system is good for all - newbies and experienced players by reseting it every month. Very nice idea was to create 2x2 ranked mode, also draft mode. In overall got some suggestions - work more on new cards and  new master exposure not only creating plus new mode."
20592,This game is a lot of fun especially the team matches <3
20593,"Are you a fan of clash royale? *kids screaming yes in the background*
Do you want the same shit and cancer on the pc? *kids screaming yes in the background*
 

say no more"
20594,"This is like the Warcraft/Starcraft Funmaps where each player owns a base and has to send units to destroy the enemy base. The twist is that the minions/spells/buildings are actually cards from a deck you build and you need mana to summon them like in any Collectible Card Game.

Some positives about the game:
It has a deep strategic component. There are a lot of counterplays and it is really important when and where you summon your cards. Like any good game it is easy to learn but hard to master.

There is a good playerbase. You can find a good match in 1-2 minutes.

The game gets weekly updates with balance fixes, new cards and even new gamemodes. The devs are really on top with the balance fixes and respond very quickly if anything is off.

The game is going to be free to play once it releases. The free to play model of the game is very fair. The free cards you start with are very strong. And if you log in every day and do your dailes you get a decent card collection pretty fast. 
Within 70 hours i got to the second highest league without spending a single cent.

I really recommend trying this game. Especially if you like quick (each match is 3-5 minutes long) strategic games."
20595,"I dont really suggest it....
It clearly is a copy off of Clash royale and that being said it does have its own playstyle but its still a copy nothing more nothing less....
You can get some fun out of it if you want to play Clash Royale on pc :l"
20596,"So... I Just got this game, tried it out... It seems interesting to me, but...

Why the hell shall I pay for a game 5€ and then, to access its content, I shall invest in ruby or shards or whatever it is called?? Why implement the free2play system in a PAID GAME?? Are you freaking NUTS? It's like buying a flight ticket, and if I want to sit I have to pay more... You guys took greedy to a whole new level..."
20597,"Nice little strategy game
Easy to learn, hard to master"
20598,"8.2/10

I have no idea why, but something about this game makes me like it way more than I should.

For starters, this is one of them ""freemium*-kinda games, where you can play for free as much as you want but if you don't like waiting and grinding and want to be the very best you have to pay a fair bit of cash. However, it never feels rushed or created with only money as interest. Instead it feels well thought out, planned and tested to actually create a fun experience.

The game is mainly a 1v1 arena/card/tower defense-game where you drop minions on a battlefield that will walk towards the enemy and fight their minions along the way and whoever kills the enemy wins. Quite simple. You create your own ""deck"" consisting of a few different minions with their own strengths, abilities and weaknesses. Strategy and planning is the way to play with careless moves being punished with defeat.


With great graphics, fun and varied minions and a gameplay that feels great for what it is I really enjoyed this game. It's fun with friends and unlocking new stuff feels cool.

I got it for free but I would probably pay a few bucks for it"
20599,lots of fun getting my ass kicked and its still fun lol
20600,veri funny game
20601,Bad
20602,goooooooooood
20603,"Stupid game. 5 unbeateable deck builds. small kids playing the same shit. no balance. spent a lot of time and money to realize, that developers are doing nothing to stop stupid combos like succubus and spirit infusion and heal and rapmage. really not worth it. another pay to win shit. no balance updates. only new cards, forcing you to spent money. real dissappointment for everyone, that is not folowing internet unbeatable decks. shame on you developers. 300 cards, and you need only 6 to win it ti the diamond league. buy a pack of jack daniels and never buy this game. it cost me sanity, to try make some universal deck. fuck this shit. i want my money back."
20604,"Addicting and simple Card Game / Tower Defense mix. Something to do if you don't have that much free time. Games are usually quick and if it ever takes too long a Mana Frenzy stage forces the match to an end. 

It also has a Teambattle mode which is always a plus for me."
20605,NiCe
20606,I couldn't figure out how to exit the game?
20607,Best rat simulator of 2017 yet
20608,Very fun game! Its like playing a card game with added strategy. This game is already fun as hell and it seems to have a ton of potential!
20609,"Overall 9/10

This game draws you in with fun Voice overs and strategic placement of cards. The brilliant thing is most cards serve a purpose of some sort, even if they are commons. and although Legendaries are very difficult to obtain, they are by no means necessary, and plenty of strategies don't include them at all. Thanks to the Ladder system, you are unlikely to be placed against opponents that are vastly superior to you, and allows for time to get a feel for how the game works and what strategies you like.

Pros:
- Very Strategic in placement and timing
- Cards work as intended
- Building your own Deck Strategies is fun
- Events are commonplace and bring a sense of community

Cons:
- Major Strategies of the Top players are usually the best, although the timing and placement of those strategies is still the game changer.

Overall This game is very fun, and should easily bypass the Price:Time Played ratio. Give it a try, and be the Master to your Minions."
20610,"Just a good game, I love it."
20611,awesome little time filler
20612,"Played 4 hours recently to pass some time. 

I thought i would dislike it at first, viewed it as a cheap PVP game. (well it is cheap\free) 

Suprisingly it was quite fun and at first i thought no strategy was involved or is P2W(possibly higher levels) but i am able to beat ""rarer"" type decks only using basic cards with a few upgrades.

The game still needs deck building and strategy involved which doesn't seem to appear unless you played it.

Will probably compare this with Battlerite once it goes F2P(or when Gigantic dies)"
20613,"Friend gifted this to me, I was expecting a lazy cash grab game but I actually found myself enjoying it. Reminds me of Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds and a little bit of Age of War. Playing coop mode adds just enough strategy to make it fun, but isn't a huge effort or time sink. The gameplay is actually pretty fun, it hits a good balance between careful thought and mindless spam. There are a few cards that could use rebalancing (looking at you, Whirly Scrat), but it's pretty well balanced overall. Of course, after a few hours the microtransaction elements become clear and I doubt you'd be able to progress reasonably after a few hours, but I haven't got that far to speak on it.

Considering you can find it for 30 cents in some places, I'd definitely give this a go."
20614,"Never been much into deck building games before. Never been much into F2P games before. I'm loving this one though!

The balancing is pretty good (especially for 4+ months out from full release), matchmaking is very fast (about 15 seconds to get into a game for me), I don't feel like I'm going to be forced to spend money unless I want to (can fully enjoy without doing so), and I especially love that this isn't turn based.

Got this on a whim last night, then immediately played for 5 straight hours (for better or for worse lol) and am looking forward to putting in many more.

Fun, relaxing, easy to learn, yet has depth and can be very competitive if you want it to be. Great game!"
20615,Really nice
20616,Finally a fun 2v2 game!
20617,"This game is really great, I mean give me more crystal!"
20618,"Is a combination of chess strategy, action war and other elements of the game player against the game, the game uses the 1v1 sports mode, the two sides in accordance with the round card process drew his own cards, they are divided into summons and various types of equipment and strategy card, you can summon summon a variety of powerful creatures, they will be in a movable 3D the image appeared in the arena, the battle process is also presented in the way of action game for everyone. It can be said that this is a card game and action mode of multi element game."
20619,idiots game fucking
20620,"Brawl of Ages was the only Clash Royale type/ripoff/copycat game on steam and now, Minion Masters is here too, and quite frankly, this is better, funner, quirker (sorry $2) AND at the current moment, has a playerbase. If you enjoy the Clash Royale type of games but got sick and tired of Clash Royale itself like me, but also dont want to play the other ones on the mobile that are arguably better than Clash Royale itself (such as Warzone: Clash of Generals, Titanfall something which might aswell be the best one at the moment and Chaos League, all better than CY itself) then this is the game for you, right now, and always. Has great humor (atleast with the spokeperson) has great design in sound, art, graphics, characters or minions as you call them (albeit i dunno whats the deal with Scrats but that and some other characters like Succubus still leaves some some to be desired, the squeaks though...feels bad listening and how useless the poor little fellas are...) but are mostly quite well made, the graphics are great, i love the physics to everything when they die, even the masters on towers fall down which is realy nice, gore is great and not too exagurated, and the masters themselves have a whole lot of personality, VOICED personality i might add albeit i wish they talked more as they sound quirky (atleast the Lighting guy), than other games of the genre, look great to look at, multiple ones with multiple strategies sure make it interesting to pick one from the bunch avaivable, the new mechanics such as the bridges giving xp for perks is great, musics and soundtracks are great, the game is very, very generous with the free stuff it gives aswell as the devs personaly themselves who keep this updated with new content reguarly often alot, its realy, realy fun and enjoyable to play, you have multiple varying modes to play in (even an upcoming single player map adventuring which is gonna be a first!), leagues, rewards, daily quests, no crappy chests you gotta wait hours on, albeit there is no minion/card upgrading like the other games have (not sure if its needed or not), and balance health wise might need more improvements, but the game's lore is neat, it isnt tied to anything albeit maybe just the future or something? So you get to see all kinds of wacky minions, medieval, fantasy, futuristic, etc. (kinda like Chaos League), and just like other games of its kind, you make multiple decks, synergize, use 3 same cards of one specific card 2 cards of 2 other cards, build up a winning streak to advance faster, made by the guys who made the FORCED games (which saddly i have not played but always known of their existance with their striking name), you can even buy different arenas for your side of the arena, which is better than being tied to the league arenas like in the other games, but one of the best parts comparing to those games, this game has horrible less unit/character/minion copies of other games and has far more completly unique made up minions that dont copy those from other games, it still has some like the Living Statue, Pulse Marines, etc. but not nearly enough for it to feel that way, which is awesome, its a realy great game, realy fun, realy good looking and sounding for the most part and its looking like its only going to get better, my only problem with the game is that i can only reset 1 daily quest per day and get quests involving playing with friends, while i have those, what i dont have is cooperation, willingness to play and i dont mean just me, so it would be nice to maybe get less of those? I dunno, not realy a huge deal breaker, i can get by it. Either way, love the game, keep up the great work ya all, i can wholesomely recommend this.
''GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLL.    d.'' - funniest bit."
20621,"Man, why is this game not more popular than it is. It requires skill, has balanced matchmaking, balanced cards, no p2w, and best of all it's only 5 fucking dollars. 

TL;DR: It's like Clash Royale but more balanced, better graphics, more tactical, less p2w. GET IT."
20622,"really fun game tbh, I bought it for the full price and it was worth every cent. it's not pay to win"
20623,"Been playing it for only two some hours, and I love it!"

Would buy for the full price."
20628,Game was fun until everyone is spamming xiao long and collosus. RIP game
20629,"(Updated review)
No idea what happened to this game. Started out as a pretty solid forced to battle game where you placed minions that attacked each other. Simple. Now it's, I don't even know what it is. The menu is a clusterfuck of all kinds of buttons and ads and options and what not. And yeah, season pass? Really? I just don't know what it is anymore, what's the goal? What's the tactic? There's just not much to it anymore, tbh there never was but I was bored and got addicted."
20630,Nice game! I love it!!

[/list]

[h1]The Final Word[/h1]

Minion Masters is like a real-time, fast action, AI-controlled chess match where each unit has their role and a counter. Choose a Master with their own set of abilities, build a unit deck, and queue up for a match.

Two lanes, two bridges. Control the bridges and earn a boost to accumulated XP. XP levels your Master and thus unlocking their skills. All the while, you're deciding what units to spawn for either an offensive push or defensive strategy. These decisions are constant throughout the match with little-to-no downtime. Your units, assuming they make it to your opponents side of the map, will start attacking the enemy Master, chipping away at its health. Kill the master, win the match.

What helps separate Minion Masters from other online minion battle games are the Masters. Each player selects a Master who comes equipped with 3 unique skills (some passive, some active), with the potential to completely change the strategy and outcome of the match. It keeps each round feeling organic, refreshing, and new.

While there are many cards to collect, it's a bit of a grind to unlock them all. Luckily, Daily Quests (rewarding in game currency) and card-crafting help alleviate the grind.

Minion Masters will be F2P after Early Access, which explains some of the mobile-like micro-transactions. Having said that, the developers have created a system where, thus far, everyone is on a fair playing field. Starting cards are competitive and can hold up against some strong meta-decks. Unlocking cards is achievable without spending a cent, and locked Champions are playable during their free week.

It's easy to spend a few minutes or a few hours playing Minion Masters thanks to its accessibility and fast rounds. It's rewarding for those who stick with it -- learning minion combos, counters, and champion strategies contribute to the game's replayability and competitive scene. While Minion Masters can be both fun and frustrating, those big, fist-pumping win-moments make it all worth it.

20637,"I loved it, absolutely great.
I would really like to purchase the upgrade if only you could give us some discount or something.
Keep up the great job and I'm looking forward to the new updates and features."
20638,"I enjoyed playing the game, but i don't know why the achievements aren't working or available yet it says 38+ Achievements locked.. Come on i wanna have fun! :D

20639,"So I left this game sitting around in my library (not an unusually occurrence for me) for a long, long time. Then, one day, I randomly decided to give it a go while I had a few minutes to spare. I was not disappointed. Minion Masters presents a new take on the card game/minion spawn genre while offering a deceptively easy-to-learn concept and a smooth interface. The humor in the game is very digestible to nearly everyone, and adds a certain charm to the game. The 2v2 combat works well, and can be played either with a friend or with a random. In-game purchases are available, but you also earn the in-game currency as you play. 

Minion Masters seems to be very well balanced, and the minions are programmed well enough that they really do seem to simulate a real combat situation. There's lots of good cards, so early on deck building is easy. Be wary, though - as you get into higher ranks, you definitely need to strategize and take note of what cards work and what cards don't!"
20640,"I would buy this game any day, every day"
20641,Recommend. Simple yet fun and intuitive
20642,"Fun game. Intertesting heroes. right now, the cards are quite limited. Definitely worth trying out!"
20643,nice
20644,mmmmiiiiiniiioooonn mmmasssterrr
20645,"Just... wrong.  

I feel bad for fans of Forced and Forced: Showdown that sprung for the premium edition.   This is basically Forced's answer to a CCG with plenty of microtransactions.  It's a cynical cash grab on what (was) a fun action franchise.

I suppose it's a very unique take on the CCG genre where your cards come to life and fight each other, but since better cards require either a large amount of grinding or buying ingame ""rubies"" with real money.  There are too many games like this now to compete for my time and cash, and it's getting exhausting."
20646,"I can absolutly commend this game. 
Nobody knows it, because it's from a small developer (BetaDwarf), but this game is soooooooo awesome. It has the best community i've ever seen in any game in my whole life (thanks to the huge Discord community <3 ). 
I played this game for about 250 hours now, never payed a single penny for it, and just reached the top 20 ^_^ 

Buy this game if u search a new strategic pvp oriented fun game to support the developer, or just join on a twitch server when a King Puff (KP) Tournament takes place, or just ask admins on Discord - they are very likely to give it to you for free as well :)

So well - all hail the allmighty king Puff!"
20647,"dont download... its stupid...  unbalanced... pure luck... stupid game...  

but honestly im adicted..."
20648,Epic game. Recommend.
20649,Having a blast with this game!!! feels in a little bit of a itch for battleforge.
20650,"Fantastic game, but still too unknown to be appreciated.  To really make this game explode, get it on Android/iOS, and make all 3 platforms cross-play.  The game needs to be Free-to-Play with paid additions like League of Legends or any other major FTP game (which I believe it pretty much is at this point)."
20651,"It's alright

EDIT: It's no longer alright"
20652,this game suddently appeared in my library
20653,",./"
20654,"Looks promising.

Original way to play a card game. Like it.

And you can play with a buddy.

EDIT: 2019

The game came out of early access and kept its promises.
- It did not add thousands of cards. The balance changed but was not completely jeopardize.
- New and fun game modes, challenges.
- Even starting now makes sense because it's easy to get new cards.

Definitely a good card game I enjoy going back regularly."
20655,suprisingly addictive
20656,"Simple, and fun little game. Matches only take a few minutes, so it's very good for time burning."
20657,"A fun spinoff of the mobile game, Clash Royale. Gets updated every week, looks promising to be a better game over time. Optimized for PC."
20658,Bad
20659,"This gets a big minus from me, no way to report cheaters. Impossible hands happening from some people, impossible mana. Add a function for reporting.

After playing a ton of it, this game is one of the worst examples of pay to win I have ever seen. If you have money, you win, period. You can buy more cards and build better decks. Paying $200 lets you skip around 200 hours of grinding. And the game constantly asks you to buy more."
20660,very nice game :)
20661,was given this game as a joke gift... it's a surprisingly good game.

20665,"pretty like this game,well done"
20666,"Okay so this game is still on early access at the time this review was made, so full features of this game is not present yet, but that's okay because i feel the game is already great. Of course we know it'll get much better upon full release"
20667,"I'm having trouble finding a single issue with this game! It is easy to jump into and learn, but difficult to truely master. The gameplay is smooth and simple, while the strategy is complex and rewarding. While you CAN pay to unlock cards immediately, it is absolutely unnecessary. You can unlock anything through playing that you could buy, and I don't mean you have to grind 1000 hours to get them either, it is very reasonable when it comes to the microtransactions. The game places you in matches with similar level players so that no matter what, you're going to have a good time playing and not have to worry about someone ages ahead of you completely wrecking your life. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Duelyst, Hearthstone, or Battleforge back in the day. Also anyone who is interested in just trying something new. You won't regret it!"
20668,"Boring Gameplay, and Shorty version of Clash Royale"
20669,"Tags: Multiplayer Based

TLDR: Crashes way too much. Slow grind to get new strategies open to you. Presents free rewards in casino style slot machine/roulette gambling mechanics which I thought was gross.

Was fun for the first while building up a small deck but eventually you plateau in terms of rank progression which hurts your free rewards, you start to always repeat the same strategies and it gets repetitive. Then the engine crashed a lot which I do not think is all that good. Finally although the game was generous at first, the free rewards drastically drop off."
20670,"Minion Masters is my go-to game when I have a few minutes.
If im expecting a call or waiting for a download or whatever. Minion Masters perfectly fill the gap. No more boring moments of waiting, pop in, play a round or 2 and continue your day."
20671,"After getting to grand master, i can now say that this review is still true. Gameplay is fun, but all decks are boring, all decks seem like an exploit and the big majority of players only play two or three decks with slight variations. 

I can conclude saying that this game is a big unbalanced mess.

-- edit again ---

Edit after +70h of gameplay.

At least all those kind of games are similar. You have fun at the beginning where everyone is ""new"" and everyone does its best to get a nice deck and play strategically. 

The more you play and rank up, the more you find players that exploit a mechanic or create virtually impossible decks unless you play another counter-meta deck.

And this becomes a circle where the one who plays more meta is the winner. So has become very boring after a while. I'm going to change my recommendation and left it as a ""play for a few weeks / months"".

-- old review --

Enjoying the game so far.

Its a mix between clash Royale and heartstone mechanincs in a PC brawler. Not completely unbalanced, and kinda fair. also has micro transactions but the game is not a ""level this card"" game.

The character animations are pretty bad. Character designs stolen from wow are there as well as other major design flaws and an atrocious ui, but the gameplay is nice and fun to play.

I recommend the game if you can get it for free"

20676,"Actually very fun game, in the beginning you're getting lots of cards for achievements and level ups, but sadly after first 10-15 hours grinding becomes unbearable. You only get ONE RANDOM card per ~50games it's 3-5 hours of gameplay, ridiculous.
Also this game should be f2p."
20677,"I truly love this game in many ways I really do. However, the developers will be the eventual downfall of this game. The community is very vocal and passionate about many of the constant unbalancing issues, including myself. I have given them the benefit of the doubt for a long-time but at this point, it is safe to say that their passion for the game just is not there. To further back up this claim, I did indeed report a few bugs on their official Minion Master Discord, and rather than getting a proper response I was overshadowed by their camping conversations.

I did not take this personally in any sort of way but when you have a bug report system and two developers talking about their camping trips and over-shadowing all the bug reports what does that say about you as a whole? There needs to be a basic line of communication between Beta Dwarf and its community, trying to talk to them or get a straight answer can sometimes feel like pulling teeth and that should never be the case if they want their game to grow. Also, I would like to mention how they have a statistic system that shows all the win-rate of cards and masters, yet it seems like it rarely comes into play.

Overall is the game fun? Yes but it starts to fall off quickly for many obvious reasons. The way I see it there are only two main reasons why this game has not died out. Tournaments and Draft Mode: Tournaments are always fun and a great way to bring more people in, however, they are clogged up with too many pros so people begin to lose their motivation to play the game further. This then leads to draft, draft mode is such a basic and fun game mode that is underappreciated by the developers yet very popular among the community despite the lackluster reward.

Please consider this feedback with an open mind and understand that I do want this game to succeed but there needs to be a wake-up call at some point. I have done my part but will they do theirs and listen to the constructive criticism? Only time will tell...
"
20678,"Alright here goes nothing.
Before I say anything else, I gotta clarify I got this game in a giveaway (and from what i can tell you did a lot of those to get people into the game).

This game? It's pretty fun. Basically, imagine clash royale with better graphics, rotated sideways, and with no p2w levelling system. (also gratuitous amounts of blood because every game needs that)
The mechanics are solid, and they work just fine.
There's also a ton of different cards which opens up many different playstyles, from heavier decks to spammier decks to building-based decks to staller decks. Plus the hero system adds a bit more variety to the mix, giving opportunities for synergies between your hero's skills and your decks. There's at least that.

Now the problem is, obtaining the cards themselves is based on a random sort of lootcrate/roulette system. You buy tokens to spin that with in-game gold, which you get from daily challenges, achievements and (possibly) a single daily resource spin. That system is entirely governed by RNG, and i can ASSURE you, you'll keep getting repeated cards, most of them common, and the rarer cards are a real pain in the ass to get.

Repeat cards can normally be recycled for a measly amount of mana shards (which can be used instead of the premium currency to unlock heroes and arena skins), but the most common cards (the ones you'll keep getting) can't even be recycled at all. You'll end with piles of those just lying around, with absolutely no use to them. This makes trying to unlock all the cards and heroes an amazing mix between long, drawn-out grinding and RNG. (which is not in your favour most of the time). But of course, you can just BUY the premium currency to make it easier! On a paid game! Or just buy the premium upgrade which is 4x the price of the game ITSELF to lessen the grind!

There's also the issue of content; the game is fun for the first bit you play it, but aside from a few slightly different gamemodes, there's really not much else to do besides trying to climb the ranks (something that's also made harder by the progression system in place). You'll probably get bored after not too long, unless you're an avid fan of this type of games.

Look, I'm not saying the game is bad (because it's definitely not, it's well made and fun while it lasts) but it's really not worth buying. It should be a F2P game, especially with this monetization method. It's not worth 5 bucks for the amount of time it'll probably last you. Some people may enjoy it, but it's just not for me."
20679,"The game is very good why: The graphics are good, and donat does not need anything, the intrefes is very nice."
20680,"Nagyon jó játék! ládák,szörnyek,kinyitható ládák,multyplayer. Mi kell még ide? ""10/10"""

20683,"Minion Masters is an iconic PC game which involves establishing a surreal fantasy experience with DnD-type characters, unit-based strategy and yet simple layout which the dev's have pulled off very well together. For early access, this game has caught my attention and can be guaranteed to be a hit when fully released. Also with an active community playing, its hard to put it down when its open.

Congratulations for making such a rich fulfilling game that made me come back for more.

Minion Masters - 8/10

- Romulex"
20684,"First of all, I have to admit that I don't usually play this type of games, but I found this one interesting. The graphics and sound quality are both okay-ish, but the gameplay saves the product. It's worth trying. The game has a 2v2 mode which I played the most. I don't see myself playing this for too long, but I expect it to be fun for a while. The variety is there, you can choose one of the ""masters"" as a main hero, then build your own deck, as you wish. The progression system works fine: you level up, you get coins and rubies, you spend them to buy things, and so on. You level up quickly , at least the first 20 levels of the game. The game also rewards you for daily logins. In my opinion (this might be wrong) the biggest disappointment comes from the balance. Even though I was clearly a ""noob"" I noticed the fact that some masters combined with some specific minions are so strong, that you can't even develop a strategy. With that out of the way, the game is very simple so it won't take long for you to learn playing it, I'm talking about the basics, because the game requires some real skills if you decide to play at higher ranks."
20685,"game server is not well when I play matching in China. Always stuck for couple of seconds, and it is so annoying for me."
20686,Very nice Update Make the game more and more interresting! The 2v2 Update unlock new play strategy has the new card added frequently.
20687,love it
20688,More like Shition Shatsters
20689,"Once you get high enough in rank, you'll start to realize just how shallow the gameplay is. Needs more cards and strategies before this game is worthwhile. Some decks and master combination perform better vs others. That's pretty much it. How well you actually play is negligible."
20690,"Strategy of a card game with real time fast paced action. It's easy to find for free also with a quick Google search and will become free when completely released as well.  The economy is good too, definitely not a pay to win game surprisingly.  Also, the matchmaking is very good too."
20691,I like it.
20692,"*looks at my time played*


...Yeah it's alright I guess"
20693,very good
20694,why does this game say I have 100 minutes in it and I clearly haven't even installed it yet
20695,"Very much fun game. Same like CLASH ROYALE on ANDROID but i can say much much better than CLASH ROYALE. You can choose ur MASTER which means a superhero. your superhero have abilities to use. Many cards to play. Its in early access which means its gonna add more cards but i think the game has enough cards. New modes have added. I suggest take it gonna be worth it
"
20696,NOICE GAME
20697,Great game for burn your time
20698,"Personally. I love this game.
Somehow it gives a lot of fun. Looks simple, but it needs a bit of strategy mind to succeed.
Devs updating it quite often, so there`s potential. Good job."
20699,"Like Clash royale for Pc.
Slow updates and little number of minions spoil the experience though.
I especially suggest trying the tag mode in which you can side up with another person (friend or random) and face 2 other persons."
20700,Fun game with great graphics!!
20701,"So .... A RTS, a MOBA and a TCG decided to hang out one day pretty much enjoying each other's company. Then had a few drinks too many and ended up in bed together.

-Simple to understand but complex mechanics(strategy)
-Extremely Competetive
-Balanced af

20703,I got this for free and I definetely enjoy it!
20704,It's playing Yugioh on steroids.
20705,One of the best game I have ever played.
20706,"One of the (if not the) best tug of war available on PC.

Pros:

- Free.
- [b]Not pay-to-win[/b], this is a very important point. Many reviews claim that this game is pay-to-win, but top tier players can reach top 1-5 with almost only basic cards.
- Very quick battles, often over in under 5 minutes.
- Good card variety allowing for different strategies.
- Your deck consists of 10 cards, and your hand of 4. This means you can quickly cycle your deck, and the game revolves a lot more around skill than luck of the draw, like other card games.
- Next to no RNG. Some cards are pure RNG, but they're a gamble you chose to take. The only RNG that's forced on you is the initial hand and draw. Some decks rely on a single card that you buff / heal, if you don't draw this card first, this can be a problem. However, this is also a risk you chose to take. You can make a versatile deck that has an answer for almost everything, so any draw can be useful with those.
- Looks great, and sounds nice.
- Draft mode and 2v2 if 1v1 isn't your thing, this means you can play with a buddy.
- You can customize your arena, as well as your master. There are also emotes you can use while in-game.

Cons:

- Some balance issues, as is often the case in PvP games.
- You need a good computer to be able to run it on max settings.
- Not a huge playerbase, this means you will see the same people often. This is a bad thing for some people, a good thing for others."
20707,It's actually a lot of fun.  And the grind isn't bad.  And we need more people to play the game so you lazy sluts need to get this game and play it.
20708,Nice Game !
20709,Clash Royale ripoff but i think it could have a future.
20710,"Pro
-high quality unique assets and good sound design
-stole all the right ideas from other games
-the game used to be fun and addictive, playerskill *used* to be rewarded

Con
-paid EARLY ACCESS into f2p at release
-Lootboxes 
-60€ of Day1 DLC
-""Battlepasses""
-imagine any sort of semi legal monetization and you will find it here. At one point you even had to pay to move.
-since this is f2p you will eventually meet every toxic kid under the sun
-devs stopped caring a long time ago and completely lost touch with what is going on in their own game
-poor matchmaking

Been laying this down several times now whenever i´ve reached my BS threshold, just to come back and get more annoyed at the devs months later. The game ""used"" to be very rewarding, but constant very poor decisions slowly shifted this into a mess.

If you are new to the game and haven´t played anything similar, you won´t get dissapointed. It is free, so you may aswell try it.

Update 2019:
For whatever reason i tried it  again, and who would have thought - constantly shoveling more untested garbage into the game did not improve the experience. Piling up more and more Cards just to lure players into the game lead to the expected powercreep, so if you want to be competetive - you better pay up and buy the recent busted season cards for double the price.

Until the next season comes around, stuff gets nerfed down to the ""normal"" value and new busted cards get introduced again, that you can buy for double the price. Welcome to economics 101."
20711,"yes
"
20712,"Shiter version of clash royale, Money-Centered, csgo-like match making(aka the sh!t matchmaking experience). HORRIBLE GAME !!!!!!  1/10"
20713,"A new  concest... The P2PaPM2W! You don't understand? It means ""Pay to play and pay more to win"". I will always remember my first games where I simply got pwned in chain because my opponents had cards looking quite OP since the beginning...

Well, I got it for free, but I'm glad I didn't purchase it."
20714,Love this game.
20715,"Like all micro transaction or ftp games Minion Masters can become more of a chore to do the dailies than something you actually enjoy. This said, it remains a decent pvp game that wont break the bank. I would advise getting the more expensive version so that you have an early boost to grabbing new masters/arenas and units and to not pay too much more later rather than going the slower route and making impulse purchases later on.

Basically you set up what passes for a deck of units and play them repeatedly until you can bring your opponents health down to zero. Sort of like a high speed tower defence. This might not sound very tactical but it is and especially so when playing 2v2. Master skills are quite varied and your choice of Master will make the biggest difference to how you form your unit makeup. Like all pvp MM is best played with friends although the matchmaking is quick and reliable. Don't take much notice of the fact it is still in early access. It works as a fully finished game and its development will be ongoing whether it is marked as early access or not."
20716,"Recomand cu incedere,nu sunt vre-un fals"
20717,"great games fun casual game 
"
20718,"Nothing special to add to this genre. Fun for a short time before the game is giving you no option but to pay up or play a tedious amount of games daily. I say tedious because there comes a point you are just losing to a endless stream of people who clearly just spent money and have great cards. You can never really progress... you can only hover at the same level. Wins come when you play a fair game against someone with equal power card wise and you'll have to play a few games where you are destined to lose to get to those.

I got it with extra in game currency in a Humble bundle and thats the only way id have ever tried it. Really not worth any money at all... kind of disappointed I even bothered playing it for as long as I did."
20719,its just cool.
20720,meh
20721,"Great game, i really enjoy it."
20722,"With the way this game changed over the years I can no longer recommend it. One issue for newer players is the way that you unlock cards, it's much slower than it use to be, but this is not the end of the world. I have also had all the cards for a while now. 

The game started off fantastic and slowly became more and more geared towards lesser skilled players. They constantly make the game slower and easier to play.  The back and forth use to be really intense, very fast paced. It gradually becomes slower and slower, with the average card cost of the deck rising. 

I really believe OP or broken cards are release on purpose to make $$ because people will use the rubies to buy the battlepass or a special package with these cards in it. They allow some time to pass knowing it needs to be nerfed and then eventually nerf if after everyone bought it. I believe if many of these cards came out balanced from the start then not as many people would rush to them. 


Another problem is that they keep drastically changing some cards to the point they become completely useless and literally never see play. They don't seem to like the slow and gradual approach to making changes. If a card is too strong I would try adjusting the health, attack speed, attack damage and other things first before I do something insane like completely change how the card works, basically making an entirely new card. This is fine if they did it to the cards that need it, but it seems they always make goofy decisions when it comes to these things. The cards that need to be reworked stay the same and the ones that only need tweaks get major reworks, too often it just doesn't make any sense. 


There is one really big issue that I've hated for a while and it's a key reason I uninstalled the game. If you don't play consistently each season then you will fall very far in the rankings, so far to the point you will be forced to grind for hours against players who can't beat you. It's a waste of my time and unfair to the lower ranked players who are facing a pro who simply dropped in rankings due to inactivity. 

I've finished several seasons in the top 10 and placed as high as #2 & #3. After a point it feels like you should be immune from falling below platinum rank because you have consistently hit the highest ranking multiple seasons over. I will try to play again sometimes, but end up quitting after 10 games because it's just so brutally boring. I end up dropping down to bronze from being away, destroy everyone without any challenge and must keep doing this for a few hours to find a decent challenger. 

I reinstalled the game today after a few seasons away and fell all the way down to stone league from being inactive. Used one of my old decks and went 14-0, it's a joke. Ended up becoming super bored because even if you win 100% of games it will still take you hours to get high enough to find a decent player who can put up a fight. I ended up just stopping out of boredom. It's frustrating because I wouldn't mind playing at a high level against decent players, but I'm forced to mindlessly grind for so long and lose interest in it before I can find a decent enemy."
20723,Like Clash Royal
20724,"How can i give it a thumbs down? You see,the game is really fun and addictive i can say,my playtime of it doesnt really matter but i'd say im into it so badly.Minion Masters is a game like Clash royale,but its on 2D platform.You have your Minion Master base which is protected by him! You can spawn variety of minions to protect your base.Basically your goal is to destroy your opponent's base and you'll win.The game is not fully done yet,it might have some glitches,bugs and stuff like that.But i don't blame it cause it's still on Early Access! Have fun!"
20725,"pros: addictive and fast paced
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
team battles are the best part about this game

cons:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game punishes you if your teammates leave the game and it also punishes you if you get disconnected before a game even starts

you can't talk to your own god damn teammates which is even more bullshit, developer is trying to keep every thing g-rated with this hearthstone spinoff of a game 

chat client is garbage. can't invite people to join your party or anything like that.

progression is very very slow (acquiring good cards to compete)

any rewards are very small and rather insignificant. Around level 25 you hit a brick wall. Acquiring rubies is next to impossible and the only way to get gold is basically through quests and 

AI of the unit pathing is super wonky and generally poor. For example you might place a unit with the intention of attacking but it walks away which will lose you games.

certain units feel unbalanced 

only a few masters to choose from and they still need a ton of balancing and variation

Matchmaking will pair you with the same person sometimes up to 3 times in a row. This is great if your teammate is good but if he is not you will want to kill your self/ leave the game. If you leave you get a 5 minute ban from match making.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
suggestions: work on the ui, keep balancing units, implement custom matches (more health, no mana, instant cast speed, etc let us choose what we want.) , make reward system way better

When I started playing I dominated right up to the silver badge but then the real fun began. I love creating a deck that’s kick ass, climb up the ranks thinking “I’m indestructible”, then just have some random dude or dudette hand said ass right back to me.

What’s also perfect to me, is how I can just jump into a game and play for say, 10 minutes, express my rage and I’m good again.

Definitely recommend"
20743,"This game is pretty entertaining for the first 15 levels or so. You can complete all the PvE challenges and reach the Silver PvP rankings relatively quickly. However, once you reach the Silver level, you will go back and forth between Silver and Bronze for quite awhile. The reasons for this are systemic. The cards you recieve as a reward are random and the difference in power level, mana cost, and usefulness vary wildly between rarity levels (common, regular, rare, legendary, and supreme). For this reason, those who subscribe to the pay to win game style (at the cost of other players' fun) or those who have been playing the game enough to accumulate a quality card collection quickly begin to dominate the game, countered only by bad luck in their randomized draws during individual matches. This turns the game into yet another one of those skinner box games that eschews interesting gameplay as it's primary mechanism for engaging and retaining its player base.

Tl;dr
This is skinner box game that is fun for a day, so long as you bought it on sale, but beware of getting sucked into grinding just to be competitive."

20763,"I don't think I'd recommend the game. Much like hearthstone this game will suffer from stagnation as set strategies emerge as being the best and come to dominate the game. However due to the fact that Minion Masters and this is me making the assumption having a smaller team they simply won't be able to put out new content fast enough to keep the game interesting. I don't see that big of a community forming around this game, especially when it has to compete with so many other more established games. Personally, once I got my achievement whoring out of the way and got the few last achievements I wanted to grab from the game I uninstalled it with out a second though since I found myself simply becoming bored with the game.

20764,One of those indie games received for free used to farm trading cards.
20765,"By far one of the greatest and most balanced games I've played in ages. 

Theres a surprisingly high amount of variation of decks and skill actually matters. Let me say that again, skill actually matters. When you first start playing the game you should be matched with people who are first trying out the game as well but as you progress through the ladder you'll end up running into people who are out of your league.

I just want to emphasize how much I love this and how much of a positive this is for me. You genuinely need to learn how to play the game and get better in order to beat others who have done the same. It's not like other games where random effects will dictate the course of a game. You can calculate every second of the game if you are paying enough attention and are good enough at the game.

That doesn't mean its hard to get into, just it can enable you to really keep purshing your skill and understanding of the game. While that might start screaming P2W since this is a card based game, one of the best things about this game is the base cards and common cards in the game are actually the most powerful.


I think my entire review has turned into an ad for the game. I just genuinely love the game so much. I even have started making videos to try to help my friends learn and get better at the game and have devouted a ton of hours over the month that I've been playing. 

Genuinely one of the best games I've played in ages and I highely encourage you all to try it. You can always stop by any person streaming the game and try to snag a key for the game to get lucky."
20766,may take a while to unlock new commanders but otherwise game seems pretty fair and as 2 v 2
20767,"I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The animations are very well done, and I enjoy the art style. Only had one hiccup when trying to do challenges, but other than that the game ran very well and didn't take long to get into an online game as well. If you enjoy tug-of-war style games and need time to kill, I would recommend this one. Would kind of like a couple more offline single player things to do, but overall, a good game, keep up the good work developers! I look forward to playing this more!"
20768,"At first I really enjoyed the game and found myself winningg and having fun. I kept going up in rank ant then it happened - cheaters. The output of the people once you hit the silver league is often clearly illegitiment. I am fine with losing as long at it was a fair fight, and still fought may rounds at the silver level where the player was clearly not cheating but just good - those were tough but fair matches I lost. However, once you get to that point you will start finding players who are clearly able to output more cards than they could possibly have mana. That's when it lost me. Fix the cheating problem and I will return... 

Not recommended - shame too it was fun until I realized I won't get beyond a certain league without cheating."
20769,"Keep that good work! 
This game has a lot of fun things !
"
20770,"At first I wasn't sure if it will be enjoying but after short time i liked this game.
I spent hours to unlock every card there is.


+Fun
+ You can play with you friend and against him
 |-> If you dont have friend you can play 1v1 or 2v2 with random
+ Cool updates

To sum up: I recommend this game."
20771,Ain't a half bad game.
20772,irado mto tri tem que molhora poucas coisa adc mais personagens
20773,its cool
20774,I love this Clash Royale rip off!
20775,Life after death is as improbable as sex after marriage.
20776,Nice!
20777,"Wow, just simply wow, the mechanics are incredible 1v1 battles are the hardest because you have to have some from each of unit tank dmger rusher swarms stuners omg omg so many units to chose from BOMBERS OMG THE BOMBERS :D.

Pro's :
1.Easy to learn
2.Easy to play
3.Fast paced arena matche's no more then average 5 minutes max 10 minutes per game.
4.Fast match makeing, decent player data base for an EAC.
5.At the moment no p2w, but still is EAC phase we don't know how is going to change.
6.The reward system is great from what i experienced.
7.Easy way to achive new cards ""mobs to spawn"".

Con's : 
1. Ranked system is a bit to harsh giving an rank 5 wooden with a bronze level 1, if this is going to get fixed it would be great.
2.Hard to set a decent deck card not many option to ballance the deck.
3.No report system for leavers it just finish the game instant. or maybe i didn't see it ?
4.Premium upgrade to expensive for what it has to offer ...


So yea i recommend this game but i would really like an easyer way to achive ruby's and gem stones this is really annoying for a P2P game if it were free i would say but god damn it you pay to play for it, and also can't streamers get extra rewards so far iw seen none, only for veiwers :-? not that im greedy but can't the streamer get something in return too that is doing publicity to the game ? :)"
20778,wow
20779,asdasdas
20780,"Fun, great to kill some time."
20781,fun but limited
20782,Really good game and great way to spend time
20783,"First and foremost, this game is not pay to win. Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.

A lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.

The graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other. Gameplay is well paced and balanced - but it does take time to master.

An excellent game that I look forward to seeing grow. Highly recommended."
20784,"I like it
Get it on sale though 
Good little game, I recommend you the game 
8/10"
20785,The game is nice.
20786,"free game dont pay £4 for it just get it off G2A for like 0.10
"
20787,GooD Game with nice graphic !)
20788,"Great little tug of war.. bought it on sale for 50 cents.. but its worth the 5 bucks for sure as well.

Seems to be pretty balanced already."
20789,"Game is a ton of fun. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who just wants to relax and throw down some cards and watch minions beat a tower down. Also, its only in beta so the few bugs that are there will be eventually worked out. The 2v2 is ALSO a ton of fun with a friend. The strategy of the game is what makes it even more fun especially when its 2v2! GLHF to all that buy this!"
20790,"Good quick paced game.
2v2 is where it is at!"
20791,Amzing game! I absolutly love it! The only problem is that the game is a bit laggy.
20792,Fear me! :)
20793,feels like playing clashroyale right now :D ... 8/10
20794,When the early access game is Really Good. Hail to the Masters!!!
20795,"Ping is toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo high. And don't say I have a shitty pc, my other games work fine. I get that this is a early access- game, but COM'ON!"
20796,wait what game is this
20797,"A fun Card type game that i always looking forward to, if you like these types  you will find it enjoyin
do i recommend this game?: YES"
20798,add please 2 vs 2 draft
20799,"10/10, like Hearthstone just more visual and more likeable."
20800,GG
20801,"esse game é otimo, joguei pouco mas já senti a emoção do jogo !"
20802,Cool with pontential.
20803,"Great game, totaly recommend it for playing it with a friend in duo team battle or if you don't have friends ( I'm just kidding ) playing it alone.

Many pros to this game: graphic, stability, fun  to play, it's not pay to win... etc.

Only 1 con: needs better ranking algoritham when gives you an opponent, exmple: you are rank wood 5 and gives you an opponent silver 1..."
20804,"a really cute, fast paced card game. sometimes buggy, tho it gets fixed regularly."
20805,Go try it
20806,Seems cool. I'll edit later.
20807,"Good intros and tutorials. A little similar to HeartStone, but better ?"
20808,"I have really struggled with this game. Being free and decent graphics, I have given it more than one chance. The game simply never takes off and never gets genuinly fun to play."
20809,bad game
20810,"some of my cards are dissapear ?? !! 
why ?????????????









I LOVE THIS GAME  and i had more than 10 friends who download it just to play togather and they like it  much.       31 AUGS 2019"
20811,"It's like Clash Royale for pc, with some extra mechanics. It's definitely not a rip-off, the game is good and stands on its own. Free2Pay model so you know what to expect."
20812,Clash Royale for PC
20813,guys wheres the real players
20814,alot of fun
20815,Better version of Clash Royale
20816,"Really cool game. However, it is basically a copy paste of assets from previous BetaDwarf games and gameplay from the many SC, WC3, SC2 maps that came before it. I really tried to like it. You get further and just get dominated by some crazy rare card that you don't have. I wanted something more like DOTA/LOL/DOTA2 where each summoner has there own deck so you can't just pay to win everything. I cannot say I am an expert at this game, maybe it is more balanced once you own everything. Unfortunitly, I am an adult and don't have the time. So I am moving on."
20817,"It never really feels like you won because you're good at the game and instead it all feels like chance. Some cards seem stupidly overpowered while others are completely useless, and its completely random whether you'll have any good cards unless you dump money into the game. I really want to like this game but it is completely pay to win."
20818,Good Game
20819,"Severely unbalanced in it's current state, but still fun 8/10"
20820,I think this is  a great game for what it is. It has more balance than most games of the same variety and you can actually get somewhere in the game without having to shell out extra money. It still has some areas that need to be improved but the developers seem to be sticking to their guns and working away on the game as needed. I look forward to seeing how this game continues to progress. I'm hoping to see more options in possible masters to use within the game as they don't have that many(maybe more arenas too). It would def be worth the 50 cents to grab now(summer sale) or wait until it is released fully as a ftp. I enjoy that it's pretty quirky and easy to play a round or two when you need to kill some time.It's free now so get it and try!!
20821,bad game !! waste of time
20822,Cool game.. But i got 12 wins and the rewards were underwhelming :( Still really fun tho.
20823,A waaaay Better version of Clash Royale
20824,very good
20825,"looks like a fine alternative to other games, a bit goofy looking but that doesnt take away from the fun"
20826,Pretty fun game
20827,"She fell in love with her

The idea is very cool,
I hope that the Arabic language will be added

Updated every week, with good content so far, they added recently 2v2 mode which is a lot of fun and also expeditions.
most important it's F2P and not P2W."
20845,olalalalala its your time

20847,best of the card games i ever played
20848,kis
20849,Very annoying gameplay and announcer
20850,Nice game! <3
20851,"[strike]Do you like the concept of Clash Royale?
Do you dislike losing games because your opponent has spent more money.

Minion Masters is your game.
It's like Clash Royale with more depth and without P2W.[/strike]

Minion Masters drastically changed how the economy works. It's now much slower to aquire a decent card collection.

This change does not impact existing players as much, as they've already have a decent card collection. New players are the ones missing out. 

Once you've build some card collection however the game is fun. 

So the choice is yours, just be aware that this may turn into a Hearthstone 2.0"
20852,"Clash Royale on PC! 
and I dont like Clash Royale."
20853,it a copy of clash royale
20854,Clash royale but good
20855,"Mini-moba card game: Use your cards to place units, buildings & spells on the board and watch them deal with the other players and their units/buildings. Last avatar standing. 

You don't control  units after you deply them. Instead, they head for the nearest enemy or start walking towards the enemy's avatar, so a big part of the game is to control how both your and your enemy's units move (kill, stun, block, shield, distract...)

Matches are less than a minute to a few minutes, but beware of the ""just one more match""-effect

Has the usual Deck Building + Draft Mode, but other modes are coming (2v2 soon)"
20856,"Honestly this game is not so bad as I thought It would be.The game is basically Clash Royale but PC version.The Features,Gameplay are great,and also Graphics are decent.

If you are planning getting this game i would totally reccomend you :) 8/10 in my opinion -Pretty fun!"
20857,GOOD GAME

20877,"Nice Game :)
"
20878,yeeee
20879,yea
20880,"I wanted to change my review because the old one wasn’t relevant anymore. Since the first review they added Team play and let you play Draft for free once a day (and otherwise at a reduced price of in game currency).

Before the review I want to make one thing clear. I do recommend the game but only if you care to invest some time in it and can play almost daily. I have not paid anything except for the early access prize.

Graphics:

The graphics look good. Everything is really colorful and they got a nice style going. Also all the minions got a good silhouette so they are easily recognized on the playfield. Also there are a lot of visual cues so you can easily tell what’s going in, even in the chaos. 

Gameplay:

You collect cards that represent minions and spells and you use those to battle against other players. There are a handful of game modes.

Single player:
This is basically just to prepare for online play. It’s more of a tutorial as the game is very much an online game. 

1vs1:
Here you battle against another player and try to destroy their tower. 

2v2 Team battle:
Here you team up with another play and take on another team of two. Since they added this game mode I feel there has been a lot more variety in what you can play. 

Draft:
Here you get to pick a deck from a number of random selected cards. Every day you get to play it for free one time. Then if you want to play again you have to pay a small amount of in game currency. This mode is really challenging because you can’t always pick what you want. It is also good to try new cards you haven’t had a chance to try out yet.

A small thing I do dislike is the spinner. You can get cards through tokens. A selection of random cards end up on a spinner. The cards spin around and when you click a you get a card. You would think the spinner would actually stop at a card when you click, but actually the card you will get is predetermined. So the spinner is kind of useless."
20881,"Good game! Similar to Clash royale!
Trust me buy this Game. You will enjoy it!"
20882,It's Pretty decent. Reminds me of COG with a Pre-tent feel to it. Can't wait for the future updates!

20897,"This was a nicely crafted tower wars/tug of war game. For something I got for free, I would say it was worth it. Acquiring coins to get better cards is quite the grind, but players can get a few solid hours of gameplay or some fun with their friends. 

The [b]gameplay[/b] is quite simple and straight forward. Minion Masters is a tug of war/tower game with a few quirks of its own. The players are allowed to choose heroes which have their own special characteristics. For example, the player may choose an archer that can fire anywhere on the field or a mage that uses magic to hit players within a radius. The heroes can be upgraded by controlling a bridge (or two) on the map. To control these bridges, players simply have to have their own units walk across the bridge. Meaning, they have to be the last ones to cross the bridge to claim it for your side. 

The player can choose to customize their deck. This means that players are allowed to swap units which work for their playing style. There are many different types of units and many to be unlocked. Some units include archers, gunners, giant knights, ogre rock looking things that like to smash and an outhouse that produces crossbow units. Units can be placed anywhere on the players side of the playing field. It will take a few games to figure out what sort of units work for your playing style. Bigger units will take more ""mana"" points to deploy. Mana is acquired simply by waiting. It is recommended to have a few ""cheap"" units to deploy to keep the field and your opponent occupied. 

The [b]visuals[/b] suit the game and it's presentation. It is a cartoon-ey feel, but the special effects definitely compliment the game well. The [b]sounds[/b] are good, but I feel they could have been a little better. Every character have their own method of expression (sound). The battle effects could have a little more fine tuning or varied effects to create an immersive environment.

Overall, a decent game. I got it for free and think it should be a free game. If you do want to make a purchase, I would recommend a sale.

Did you like Monster in my Pocket?     
Do you like Pokemon??                          
Do you like like Magic the Gathering???         
Well....
Until they make 'Monster in my Poke the Gathering' perhaps consider trying Minion Masters!                                                                                 
Minion Masters is an animated collectible cardgame, powering an  RTS-lite battle mode.                               
The game losely uses traditional rock, scissor, paper, mechanics  with most units having a number of counters but with a twist...          
The game features AI battles, friendly battles, 1v1 random and soon group play. 
The majority of your time will be spent with your own custom decks, but there is also a draft mode that acts like a mini 3 round tournament with prizes- and a payment to enter to discourage quitters- that provides you with a random selection of cards forcing  you to try new combinations and playstyles. 
  
When learning to play expect defeat, but when it comes try and resist dismissing the game as pay2win. 
Instead, think about mixing up your deck and learn when and how to use your cards- optimising your deck with your avatar and unit placement are very important too. 
If the deck building intimidates you, copying best builds from the leader board is also an optiion. 

Some accuse the game of being pay2win, but with dual methods of payment and the ability to earn all of the ingame currencies, paying only gives you access to the same content as everyone else a bit sooner, it's not an outright advantage.
Crafting  is a much faster method of getting the cards you want than say doing something stupid like openening 37 power tokens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiIMAPXSEwQ&t=25s

Essentially, Minion Masters is an addictive, easy to play, hard to master game with plenty or replayability provided by the wide range or avatars, units, spells, and buildings on offer- though not yet finished I'd say it's worth a punt.
The game is currently in early access and features a cheaper early access edition, I'd recommend that over the premium edition as the price is maybe a little bit too high for the premium edition though on sale that argument disappears. 
So yeah, try Minion Masters, its not nasty.

20913,"Sometimes we overthink games. We try to assign meaning that's not there. Ultimately - the question for us to answer - is the game fun and worthwhile?

A confident YES in Minion Masters' case. Yes its basically Clash Royale on PC but its slightly more than and thats okay in the grand scheme of things. I got this copy for free from a Steam friend but now - after 8 hours of playing it - I would have certainly paid cash money for the pleasure. There is something satisfiying in trying new combos of cards almost to the exclusion of whether its successful or not. Even when I lose a match - I still gain some enjoyment. That's more than I will say of other titles.

20914,this game is recommended from me and others
20915,"thought it was alright at first, but turned out to be stupid.  ranking system is terrible.  I've never wanted my time back more."
20916,Not my type of game but it is better than clash royale.
20917,"I got minion masters as gift,and I really wasn't that excited by it's name.So One day after I activated the game,I decided to play against a friend who,got the game and he was very very excited with it.So I gave it a chance!This was one of the best choice I ever made!It was like discovering a lost treasure in my library.At first you start with a basic minion card deck which allows you to duel with others.It was kind of let down as I wasn't that strong.But,after some victories and finishing the solo challenges,I got some strong cards and I developed a stronger and more strategic deck capable of beating formidable opponents.

The game features a quite fair ranking system with nice rewards as you climbe the ladder to the top !
Graphics are really good and the game is very light so that It can run on low end systems to with only cpu graphics!
There plenty of Masters acompanied of some unique passive abilities that might be crucial for your victory!

Note that game is still in Public beta and you get involved as it gets better and better,but the amazing thing here is that only a few bugs can be noticed,at least on my system.Overall the game is really smooth and quite interesting.

I would definetely recommend this game for you especially if you ever enjoyed card games and strategy !"

20927,"[h1]SIMPLISTIC MECHANICS, SERIOUS FUN.[/h1]

I have to confess that my expectations weren't exactly high when I got got it, more of a ""well, it's free..."" kind of thing, but after firing it up I found it quite fun. As for graphics, they're competent for the style, as many indie devs tend to the lazy side of visuals these days; music and sound fx are rather repetitive, but considering the game mechanics, it's no surprise. Maybe my only real criticism is the microtransaction-prone nature of the game, that kind of forces you into that, but maybe I'm just cheap. Minion Master has its feet on the ground as it makes no promises it can't fulfill and can give you many long hours of fun be it single  or multi player. 8/10"
20928,"Nice deck building and tower defense game.
Its way more fun to play cards here than in Heartstone. Cards are easy to obtain. 
After few hours of gameplay I had cards which were suitable for almost every deck.
I didnt spend a dime and I was able to fully enjoy the game, its way cheaper than other card games.

Pros:
- Uptades every week
- You can be grandmaster with basic hero and basic set
- Common cards are well balanced and in certain situations can outballance legendaries very well
- Great solo experencie
- 2v2 mode, Mayhem mode, Adventures mode
- Battle passes you can buy with currency you can earn in game
- Guilds

Cons:
- Draft mode sometimes too RNG
- 2v2 sole queue sometimes matched with 2v2 premades"
20929,nice
20930,"Alright game, not  pay to win, but if you are new and need good cards you either pay some $$ or suffer a bit."
20931,"As much as I wanted to like this game, in its current state I feel it's just not worth a recommendation.

Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some highlights and this game has more than enough potential, but the devs will have to actually bring it to that point first.

Obviously, with this game being an Early Access game means it's not complete. I accept that. Recently I was a bit discouraged when I ran across a bug and then found it has been reported 6 months ago, with a dev response stating they weren't planning on fixing. Rather, they sort of just accepted it as an unusual mechanic in the game. Since this game only offers competitive queues, thus pushing a competitive agenda for the game, I find it hard to support it given the dev's take on bugs.

Any bug, big or small, should eventually be addressed in order for a competitive game to be taken seriously. Due to the nature of competitive games, there needs to be balance, and game mechanics need to be as solid as possible. Imagine if some of the top competitive games on the market today had devs that left clear and reported bugs untouched and wanted players to just play around it.

Anyway, I suppose my biggest issue just seems to be with the devs and how I feel they have been and will handle the game. It makes me worry about longevity."

20940,"Nice Strategic game! 
Clash Rolaye but on PC :D

9/10"
20941,"Buggy, with a needlessly convoluted and user-unfriendly interface, limited multiplayer options, and only a short tutorial existing for single-player, the straightforward combat and imbalanced deck design don't allow for the gameplay to make up for the game's other troubles.

If the game cleans up its interface and bugs, polishes gameplay, and either implements better single-player features or the promised 2v2 mode, the game'll have enough compelling elements to draw attention, as the basic concept is (while not particularily original) compelling enough.

In other words, this is a game that rather firmly reflects its Early Access label (in a rather unflattering way), and should be avoided until it gets closer to live-launch- which, hopefully won't be for some time yet, given how much still needs to be addressed.

(As an added note, while the game has had more than its fair share of bugs and quirks and odd management decisions up to this point, my own interactions with Betadwarf staff have been very positive and friendly and respectful, which does make the developer stand out among the far less respectable norm. As such, with the developer indicating their willingness to give respectful consideration toward their user-base, there's firm reason to hope that similar consideration will be offered toward fixing the game's current shortcomings.)

*** NEW REVIEW ***

TOTAL CRAP: half-dead, bugged and full of griefers as developers ignore player reports and feedbacks.
Like if it's not enough, they promoted to moderator a lamer who exploited a bug (just to give you an idea of how ridiculous/amateurish is the management of this game).
They are also trying to MONETIZE with Season Pass, even if they sell DLCs and life-time bonuses. It's probably going to be P2W.
Don't waste your time here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, since it's free to play, it's unplayable as there are griefers (and noobs) everywhere, but griefers are not getting banned, and they are not even improving matchmaking. Be sure while griefers don't get banned from game, that you get banned from chat if you tell something to griefers. So, not only you suffer injustices from griefers, but you suffer another injustice from betadwarf devs that ban you and not the griefer.
Like if it's not enough, they are releasing console and mobile x-plaftorm support to fill the game with unskilled players.
Here is an example of what kind of players they are not banning (he's intentionally inactive at max mana): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja3kGo9O7TA
I'll rechange my review if they'll start doing something, but since i changed my review, nothing has changed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** OLD REVIEW ***

One of the best free-to-play games i ever played. Much fun.
I followed this game since EA launch.

It's like ""Clash Royale"". A perfect mix between MOBA, TCG and RTS genres, where your hero is your base (every hero is unique) with abilities that you unlock by exping during the match, and your cards are your minions; they differ in attack speed, HP, movement speed, attack range, abilities, stealth, flying or non-flying minions. You are free to unleash them everywhere on your side of the battlefield, but not on the enemy side. Choosing good counters against the enemy minions is very important and positioning is important as well. The bridges of the arenas are two control points that generate exp over time, which is useful, as i said, to unlock perks but not only perks, as you go in ""Mana Frenzy"" (you generate mana much faster) when you hit the exp cap, and that's why the duration of the matches is never longer than 5-10 minutes.

I find that this game is well done under all aspects: good gameplay, humor and quality.
The devs are friendly and very active.

Is it Pay-to-Win? NO, NO, and NO. It's extremely friendly. Just play.
There are tons or free rewards, you can easily earn legendary cards, and there are no overpowered legendary cards, or be sure they'll nerf them.

Golds, Tokens and Shards can be earned by completing Seasons, Mayhem mode and Expeditions mode (which is a map where you fight to move ahead).
Also, you are rewarded with Golds by completing daily quests or by winning PvP matches as well. In Draft mode you earn both Golds, Shards, and sometimes Cards.
Golds are used to open chests with Tokens that you buy in the shop, but a card is guaranteed with every single Token. If you salvage a card, materials (Shards) are used to craft more cards.

In addition, there is a classic hero rotation (for those who don't own all heroes), and one free Token every day."
20949,Best Netflix show
20950,Its a very fun Game to relax and hear music to it. The only downside is there is a bug (i dont know if its only on my computer) if you click Mouse 1 when the game is loading it crashes. Its a very great game though so its worth the money.
20951,"Outstanding game and I'm realy enjoying it,I will recomend to anyone who wants to have fun 1000%:)"
20952,the game itself is good but i got dc'd a lot of times. as of now i dont recommend this game
20953,"I hate this game! 
1) No way to play offline, wont play without an internet connection.
2) I buy single player games that I can cheat at! There are no cheat
codes.
3) Sure the game was only .99 cents, But I will not give one red cent
to retarded developers that wont allow me to have fun, offline, single 
player.
4) I have asked for a refund."
20954,"toxic community, pay to win mentality.  (how is it pay to win when you can earn things?  this is called incentive to buy.  quick question for those of you who dont belive me, how many heroes do you have?  2?  and the rest cost what?  exactly.)
the game itself is amazing for what it is.  however, the admin, the players, are all toxic.  i walked in on a admin (dnd) cussing out a player.  i lost my shit, said rude things, and was banned.  considering everything t hat had been said in chat (hahahaha and a couple other very memorible trolls.. lol) what i said was weak.. but still in violation.  i'm fine with being blocked, but i did put a cancel payment on everything related to th eir company and will no longer buy their products...

but none of this explains the gameplay.. so lets get into that.


gameplay is simple.  you have a maximum of 10 mana, with this mana you summong monsters (or minions)  the premis is pretty simple enough.  there are many varied units.. but here's the problem...

you dont get units for free.  ever.  there are promotions right now that will get you a few minions, but for the most part, you're on your own.

there are.. 2 almost 3? modes?

there's draft, where you pay 1500 in game coins to get a chance at a deck you get to use until you lose t hree times.  each win nets you extras like units, money, gems, and crystals.

there's single player tutorial which basically explains the game.  you receive nothing after completing it and attempt to play that way again, and  then there's ranked.

thats it.  seriously, thats it.

money is used to buy a random dice roll for a unit.
gems are used for buying backgrounds and heroes and chances to get a random card. (a couple other things but you can use other currency for that)  GEMS COST REAL MONEY.
crystals are basically card goo.  as you destroy cards, you get crystals.   you can then use those crystals to get other cards, BUT JUST ONE MINUTE!  there's a caveat.

cards that you want will cost in upwards of THOUSANDS of crystals, and you might get 15-50 for each recycled card.

what this means to newbies is that every time you get a new level, you will receive in game currency, but crystals you can only get via draft mode, special functions (they have these stupid stream led key searches that basically make you stay in chat forever while trying to get them.. there's NO WAY the streamer you're watching will ever get enough for you to get the bonuses, so you'll be forced to pay attention to chat, check forums, etc.  its fake attention and all you got was a couple of units. maybie)and these keys i just mentioned.  the only ways.

so basically you're forced to spend real money if you want  units.  theres no way around it.  you can play and play and play, but most games you win or lose only give you about 100 coins, and draft mode costs 500 more coins than it takes to just draw a card randomly, and there's no way to kn ow if you're gonna get tons of wins, because just like everything else, the deck you get in draft is completely random, and you have very little choice of what you can put th ere ( you draw t hree cards per slot and must choose one, same goes with the  hero)

so here's how this will go for you.

the first few days you play will be fun, even losing.  however, as soon as you start to realize that cards can cost tons of crystals and you'll have to recycle cards to get t hem, about 200 for a rare card.

and also upwards of 5000 crystals to get a different hero.

so you either make a:  a ratbo deck or b, the archer dude deck.

after a couple of weeks, you'll be bored with it, and thats if you DONT open the chat

open the chat and you'll see wh at i mean about people's toxicity.

fyi its also possible to shut chat down as its just an IRC chat room.


the devs were nice at first though.  after awhile tho, just like everyone they get tilted and start cussing players.


watch them try to tell me i'm lying.  (""we have chat logs"")

well, i have the irc feed.  try to lie about that.





TL:DR:  game is almost functional but is so close to the line of pay 2 play its crazy.  people are toxic (i should know, lol), and the devs can be manacing at times, but at other times nice and ok.  t he game will bore you within a couple of weeks.

if you want to pay 20 bucks for 2 weeks of fun, be my guest.  me?

i'm gonna go play disgaea 2.  its a good game if you like jrts's 

still though, while i dont recommend it, go give it a try if you liked turret attack or other old school turret defense games from sc1's ums settings.  just because i dont like a game doesn't mean you wont.

i just wont play p2w games, no matter how much they try to hide it.
"
20955,Go and buy their other games. Those are brilliant and fun. Really fun. This is just a frustrating mobile game.
20956,"F#CKIN PAY TO WIN !!!
Don't play it. It's free for like 2 HOUR (12 matches of the campaign), then you have to PAY to get any NEW cards... IT'S SO LAME !
SKIP."
20957,This game is Pay To Win unfortunately. If you got real money to spend you can get the best masters and best cards and all you got to do is get a C2a deck and you are a master at this game. No other strategy to it. A patch to nerf C2a decks went live today and its still OP. This game requires a lot of balancing. I know its Early Access but all I am playing are players that use C2a decks and its really annoying. The whole game is flooded with players playing C2a decks. Very sad.
20958,"Often on sale or free. Grab it one of these times.

I hope it's eventually published on mobile, because these very short games are ideal for that and Clash Royale seriously needs a competitor that isn't pay to win."
20959,I like the game just dont like micro transactions
20960,"RTS. Fun, simple like playing card game.
For a genre that i rarely play its quite good.
Although they need to improve the matchmaking bit
Fun rating hmmm 6/10
"
20961,"The game itself has potential, has a lot of good ideas and the graphics is nice, but the number of pay-to-win elements is problematic. If you invest money you can go far, otherwise you just gonna stuck on your level forever since every lost match grants -80 points for your badge, and be aware, there are plenty of ""change game cards"" you can get if you invest enough money.

Other problems is lack of balance, poor matchmaking system (is not rare face a adversary with 5 or 6 levels ahead of you), terrible ""badge level system"", 2 ~ 3 loss and you go back from where you start, is frustrating and annoying as hell."
20962,I just started playing it and this game is really awesome. It's just  an early access and I already loved it! :))
20963,"Minion Masters

Where should I start. It is a PC version of Clash royal,  butility if you ashed me what I prefer, it would be Minion Masters. 

- Game play: it is a great game, but some of it is a bit simple and I wish I could control the minionsame on the board. Though there are some interesting concepts.

-Graphics: decent enough

I only have one problem. Though I got thengaged product for free. £15, $15 is a high asking point. Get on sale"
20964,"From v0.27.6

Overall a very fun game.

It is surprisingly balanced in its current point of development; i.e. Champs and cards have strengths and weaknesses. None of the champs appear to be overpowered, but a few of the cards have a degree of OP qualities while a few are incredibly underwhelming; this is annoying at times because you have absolutely no control over what you are going to get and more often than not, you won't get it. A crafting system is in place where you can salvage unwanted cards to create other cards after a period of time; this feels too grindy for what it is worth though.

The matchmaking system appears to do a pretty good job on matching players with the same skill level from my experience with the game, I seem to have a relatively balanced record. Ranked goes through 2 leagues before wins and losses really count for much which gives players an opportunity to learn while playing against other players, which will be more comfortable for more casual players while still being a good game for competitive players. This is still very much a pay to win sort of game, which is to be expected from its model.

I enjoy the game in its current build and I look forward to the changes and additions for future versions."
20965,feels like im playing a mobile game
20966,I like this game! recommend it 10/10....I will come back with a full review.

20969,Great addictive game.
20970,best game

20972,Art style and gameplay mechanics are very intriguing
20973,"RAGE QUITS AAAAARRRREEEEEE LIIIIIIIFFFEEEE!

If you're like me and enjoy nothing more than seeing that ""VICTORY"" overlaid with ""Your Opponent Has Left The Game"", please play this game. They're abundant!"
20974,This game gets repetitively boring because people are using the same obviously-strong meta decks. If you are one of those people that can get competitive but can't handle the stress and struggle then please avoid this game as much as you can. If you are not being wrecked by rammers and cleavers on rage then you are getting wrecked by a last-minute spell just to shove salt into your open wound.
20975,"Still early in development, I cannot share the notion that it is not balanced. It is the quickest fix for those who like trading card games. 

"
20976,"Fun little game.
2V2 is awesome with a friend."
20977,"Although I actually love digital card games, I usually quickly lose interest in them. With Minion Masters, this is different.

There are many good things about this game:
[list]
[*] The mechanics are quite deep.
[*] It is a real-time card game, therefore nobody ever has to wait for his opponent.
[*] Having bought the premium dlc (and not having spent a dime more), I find the card acquisition rate to be really fast and generous.
[*] The game is updated on a weekly basis.
[*] The devs are extremely responsive in the forums.
[/list]

There are also some bad things:
[list]
[*] Sometimes the matchmaking isn't great and one is matched times against the same person multiple times in a row.
[*] Doing expeditions (that's the way how one can earn in-game currency) can take some time, although the rewards are quite good.
[/list]

All in all, I think Minion Masters is a really great game and everyone who likes card games should give it a try. Beginning this game with no collection can be hard, but sticking to this game is absolutely worth it!"
20978,"So. Much. Addictive. Madness....

That is the official summary of this game."
20979,"Not bad
Simple
Fun
I realy enjoy the game"
20980,"game isnt balanced at all, you just spam spells and thats it"
20981,Weak graphics ( even at the highest settings ). I don't like this game.
20982,"It is a really boring game, they should improve certain things."
20983,"It is quite fun, looks pretty great, but lacks in some areas:

First of all, most of the heroes are really bad and/or boring. I think the devs should rupdate the hero passives/ lvl acheivements to make them balanced. Personally, th heroes with permanent passives are so much better than the ones with a one time only card.

Second, there needs to be more customisation, have your own map is cool, but that is about it.

Finnally, there needs to be more deck choice, most people have similar decks and it gets kind of repetitive.

Otherwise a decent game"
20984," intresting concept but unbalanced and very rng based would hold off till they atleast fix the balancing and add some more content

20985,cool
20986,Horribly addictive but a lot more frustrating than enjoyable. Stay away from this if you value your time.
20987,Like Clash Royale
20988,Fun if your good at it
20989,So i see that this game doesnt worth it much you can buy it on sale if you want rather than that i dont recommend you to buy it for almost 5$ keep your money better.
20990,"Minion Masters has all to be a good game.
Looks like Clash Royale for Android/IOS.
Keep your eye in this game. You wont regret it.
Recommended :)"
20991,"When Minion Masters appeared in December 2016's Humble Monthly bundle, I thought I'd give it a chance but it was a pretty underwhelming experience. 

It might be that I'm not fond of these sort of games as it's orientated more towards ranked players rather than casual players. If you put in enough hours reading up on builds and experimenting, you'll get the hang of the game but if you're just playing the odd game here and there knowing the basics off the limited single player matches, you'll just get beaten easily often. That's where the fun stopped for me.

That is probably why this game is regularly given away for free so the developers can retain a sizeable playerbase; the Premium DLC is absolutely not worth it though unless you want to support BetaDwarf directly while getting some return on your money. I also got a few gift copies that I gave away while subscribed to their newsletter. It will probably go Free-to-Play on full release but it's definitely not a pay-to-win game, more of a pay-to-progress system.

If you like dedicating long game sessions to card games, you'll probably like this game so I'll recommend it on that basis but only for the right price. I'm sure you can figure out that price for yourself."
20992,Great Game!
20993,"Not really my kind of game, but still enjoyed it quite a bit.

20999,"Brand recognition and a free-play promotion is what piqued my interest in Minion Masters: Forced to Duel. Though I initially went in with the healthy dose of skepticism warranted by micro-transaction games, it was not long before I found myself enjoying the fast-paced and rewarding matches Minion Masters has to offer. A short learning period leads to gameplay that involves a suprising amount of variety and quick-thinking. Though I would like to support the company monetarily at some point, I have yet to do so and am having a blast playing the game. Updates are frequent and a quick look at the forums will demonstrate a responsive dev team that's working hard to make a great game people want to support. I have seen issues in the metagame balance occur that may sour the experience for a while, but complaints are listened to and smart fixes are made pretty quick. Put it on your wishlist or give it a try if you think it might be something up your alley because Minion Masters is currently going in a great direction for an early access game."

21004,"A classic pay-to-win game obtained from the latest PC Gamer magazine.

There's no replayable solo mode, once you're through with that, you won't get any more rewards for playing the same matches. It serves as a testing ground for any new deck concepts you come up with, that's it.

The only way to progress is to battle randomly online and specifically win. Which leads to farming the lower ranks so that you can get the coins to buy a new roulette-spin to get more cards.

You can, however, pay money for rubies, which you can convert directly into these roulette spins, thus neatly skipping the arduous grinding bit of the game.

Daily challenges which also give rewards help to hide these issues, but ultimately this will sit in my 5-minute-game category.

21005,"The summary of this game in short can be put like this: 
At first it will be entertaining a fun because it is a new game. You will be interested in learning, playing, and even trying to advance your rank. However, after playing for a while and digging deeper into things trying to get better and learning all you can then you will find it incredibly frustrating. The game is very imbalanced. Which if you ever try 'Draft' mode then you will see how random things really are even with good picks.

The long list:
Solo mode - Solo Play is about what you would expect. It is you versus a computer AI. The computer isn't particularly smart though at times it was kind of hard just starting out and having practically nothing or knowing little about the game. Solo is there to give you a basic education though.. nothing special.

""Online"" mode - Technically all of it is online...but whatever. first of this is what the game calls 'ranked' mode. you play and as you win or lose your rank is affected. now here is the issue. there is NO 'casual' mode to play against real players in a non-ranked format. so you are always playing with your rank on the line. its not exactly the most relaxing thing. some people would like to just join a casual game and not worry about wins or losses.

Draft mode - This is like 'Arena' format where you get a line up of some random cards and you pick from them one at a time until you have a full deck. As I mentioned before the game is pretty imbalanced and this really comes through when the rng is at its worst...which is here.  In fact I have tried even with really great decks to win as much as possible. the most I have one is 3 out of a possible of 12. It takes 1500 gold to enter after you have grinded it. your reward should you actually win 1-3 is like 1300-1400 gold worth in prizes. you get a power token (1000gold from the store) and around 300-400 gold. i suspect you have to get at least 6+ wins to just break even.

Imbalances - So about those imbalances. Just coming into the game recently I was greeted by the ""Call to Arms"" meta. Which is that they dont play much except buildings and more buildings. Then they start spamming you with the spell ""Call to Arms"". Its nearly impossible to beat unless you have a deck specifically dedicated to beating it. Which kind of makes you vulnerable to everything else in the game. It really makes the game a pile of crap at this point in time just by itself.

laser turrets are stupid. they can hit both ground and air targets. fire at high speed and the longer they stay on a target the faster they attack as well. they can take down heavy tanks in a second. i mean if they had a vulnerability like they couldnt attack air targets that would be one thing. they have no vulnerability though. worse though is it is considered a ""common"" card. it is so cheap to get these things through crafting anyone can have them.. even the noob.

"
21006,it's good game but obviously PAY2WIN... EHH
21007,"NOT WORTH BUYING!

Same bullshit game like the other fail matchmaking games. its like every 0815 card game you find out there for free, but instead of cards there are brainless minions spawn on a field and run on each overs. they game maybe would be any fun if there where any balancing, but there isnt any. buy the good cards and you win..."
21008,"Trash game.

Update: Decided to give it another go. There is zero skill to this game. It's a pure pay-to-win game. The rarest cards win. Period. I stand by my previous review. Trash game."
21009,hlv
21010,"Very fun. Great game, keep it up developers!"
21011,As a mix of a TCG/MOBA(ish?) I really enjoy the premise of Minion Masters but I would really like more VS AI options.
21012,"The arena mode is utter garbage, absolutly zero balance."
21013,clash royale rip. Fun game though. 9/10
21014,"Overall a fun game even though i havent played it much myself, maybe one day ill change my review when I've put enough hours into it."
21015,"NO P2W, despite what people say. Don't listen to them, you can get everything fast enough and you even get both type of currencies by just playing the game. Nothing is locked behind a paywall. 

I don't have premium and after not even 30 hours, i got 3 metadecks ready.

This game is a more decision/skill based Hearthstone. Less RNG because it actually matters when you do things and not just in which order you draw and play cards. It actually matters when you do it and where you place certain minions/buildings/spells.

It is still a casual game, but it is fun as hell. Don't take it too serious and ignore some of the bm guys you encounter.

There will always be metadecks that are flat out better than others, sure you can build a deck yourself to counter a specific decktype but then your deck is weak to other decks. And when you more or less fight the same guys, you will only catch them off guard once. Next engagement they either have their deck adjusted to deal with yours or figured out how you play.

But it is all about consistency. There are also idiot proof decks, that you can easily copy and use those to get into the high ranks with, even as a bad player. So there is fun to be had either way.

They are on it to balance it more but it mostly just shifts the meta. But at least they are doing it frequently. So it is really fun to figure out some nice decks.

I wonder why this has so few players. I guess the developers need to step up their game to give their game a bit more exposure.

One thing is for certain, this game will stay on steam and will steadily raise it's numbers.

You DON'T need to buy it , you can get keys everywhere on the internet or simply go watch some streamer and ask for a key.

If you like the game , i suggest you to buy premium to support the developers."
21016,"Amazing game.
Its very fun, the only cons i have so far is the low playerbase, hope it increases!"

21020,"The major issues that take away from the positives are:

It's a money sink.

It's terribly optimised making even the best machines have a difficult time."
21021,Started out very good but for some reason gets worse with every update. not fun anymore
21022,ok
21023,"The Developers have been doing a really good job of keeping it up to date and yet not tweaking the game too much. The Battle Passes are expensive, however if you play consistently and keep up with all of the modes, you can easily earn enough rubies (pay currency) to be able to get every other battle pass. they have created a very low pressure pay model that has some how sustained them for all this time. I have invested very little money (almost all of the DLC has been given out free from the developers) and thoroughly enjoy this game."
21024,memes and dreams <3
21025,"This game is simple yet very gripping. The gameplay itself despite using autonomous minions, still has a lot of intricacies that make it challenging and competitive.

Similar to Clash Royale, this has an added element of bridges that grant experience to your master, giving your more powerful perks that shape the gameplay. This forces a much more dynamic and agressive style where both players are constantly fighting over the important bridges, and creates a nice flow where both players can be attacking and defending simulaneously on different sides of the field.

Already there are enough cards to rival Clash Royale, even in early access, and new cards are coming every week. There's several different winning strategies, some focus on trying to kill the enemy master ASAP, while others try to control the game, deflect enemy attacks, and control the bridges. Even though some decks are ""meta"" there's still room for deck variations within those strategies, especially since so much of the game is still executing your deck better than the opponent. As your collection fills up you will find a style that fits you. 

As of writing this I have not spent a penny yet I have nearly a full collection and am among the top rated players in the game after 200 hrs. Certainly might get a little tougher when more cards are released, but Betadwarf has a strict balance philosophy in that higher rarity cards are more specialized but not really stronger and certainly not necessary to win.

My advice for a new player that loves the game but is having a hard time winning: keep experimenting with new cards, try to identify cards that aren't working out for you, and learn what counters what so you don't waste mana playing minions that will die right away. There's a steep learning curve with a lot of depth to explore and it's not apparent right away, but when you ""get it"" you'll have a great time. 9/10"
21026,"After 3 years I came back to this game. Overall, the game quallity went up. There are more cards, more interesting powers and the devs are still working on this game.
Sadly, there are things, that does not seem very important, but after playing for a while, they get really annoying and frustrating.

When you play 1v1 or 2v2 (the most played modes) you always have to play ranked. There are no unranked modes. In beggining, it seems great because you play rankeds, you get all the rewards when getting into better rank and the game gives you feel of improvement. But that is one of the big problems in two ways. The first one is that in lower leagues, you are mostly not playing against people, but bots. They are easy to beat and people think they are getting better, but they are not. This leads to many people getting into diamond/master league with actually no knowledge how to play on higer ranks and more competitively (Its RANKED mode, so its expected people are competitive there). 
This mostly affects the 2v2 because you can play just fun deck that you came up with or super tryhard and trying to get into contender, but you cant because all kind of people getting matched together, so it is super frustrating, when somebody who wants to climb the ladder gets queued 10 times in row with people who just copy crappy deck from leaderboard or just play whatever.
Another big annoyance is that there is zero punishemt for people that troll/afk. People can help the enemy, block your units or just leave the game and you have guaranteed lose and you cant do anything about that.
Which lead to another thing, when game finishes, few buttons shows up. For example report player. You can click the button, but you have to be fast enough, otherwise it changes position on the screen and its replaced by another button, in this case watch replay. So instead of reporting player that trolled, you enter the replay, then you leave it and because its not end of match anymore, you can not report said player, completly wasting time. More about wasting time, when you want to open ""rewards"" (chests, tokens, achievements), all are open one. by. one. You have 40 power tokens and 20 chests? Enjoy clicking like a idiot because there is no way to skip all the animations.
The game have its own way to selling  skins. You cant directly buy skin in this game. You have to wait for specific day, when the skin is in the shop and then you can buy it for rubies. So if you like specific character and you really like one specific skin, you dont have to see it in shop at all. I played this game for 1-2 months now and i saw a single skin on character Volco, even that i wanted diferent one. In all this time, there was one skin from his +-seven.

If would give neutral rewiev if I could. The game is not bad. I really enjoyed when i was exploring new cards and strategies. But the more I play the more I feel I dont actually like this game that much.

Overall:
- no unranked
- all people getting into same rank
- playing vs bots
- no trolling and afk penalties
- annoying animations
- cant buy skins you want
- buttons changing positions at the end of each match

+ lot of cards
+ being updated often
+ active community"
21027,"Really fun and fast paced whilst still being a very tactical game. 

Choices are always important from what you play to when you play to where you play it- one wrong move can cost you the game. That might not sound fun but since the games are so fast it really is super fun and very rewarding when you make the right moves. A well palced fireballl or counter minion can make you feel like a GOD!

Some cards are still slightly unbalanced but that's part of the fun at the moment I think and I'm sure it will all get balanced out eventuallly - some of the most overpowerd cards have already been fixed in the time I've been playing. 

Great game!"
21028,Good for a few hours of fun. A little too less content but the price is also low. Nice to play when you just have a few minutes of time.
21029,"I honestly can't wrap my head around how this game could be enjoyable as a concept. It seems well-made, so credit where it's due. I just don't think there's anything that can be done with the base concept of the game that could make it resemble fun.

Then again people seem to really like Hearthstone so I guess maybe I don't understand anything anymore."
21030,Got this game in a trade for some Cards :)
21031,Fun quick games with quite a bit of depth.
21032,Fun game. I like it.
21033,"Clash Royale for PC, but on drugs. The voice acting is hilarious and the announcer sounds drunk, but that is a good thing. I think I am going to waste my life on this. 10 out of 10 would waste my life again.

21034,Games decent. Fun to kill some time however it does feel like P2W and there are some significant balance issues. Decent time killer but a long way to go IMO.
21035,"[h1]Things They Must Add[/h1]

[b]Skirmish Thingy[/b] : Bot Game with different options like difficulty options , Opponents master option, normal or draft play option, pickable arena option and many options to be discussed

[b]least played type of game[/b] : banning cards this is going to be more stratigical but put short time limit so it wont burn a lot of time if you guys want to have fast game every play

[b]Online Play Not Ranked[/b] : if you want to try your brand new built deck to online players but you dont want to waste your rank, how ?

[h1]Suggestions[/h1]

[b]About Skins[/b] : how about making skins of every card to specific type ? i mean for example i want all my cards looking swarmer so i want to have a rammer but in a model of a swarmer no skill will change just the model, another example i want a mana puff but in a scrat looking

imagine a deck of puff skins :D
colossus puff ? ayy lmao

[b]Zoom in[/b] : with mouse scroll or something because sometimes you just want to watch your favorite card dying or something

[b]brutus[/b] : lets talk about your 800 hp monster with normal speed and damage, this is auto surrender master, can someone agree ? who is the master at the top of the leader board ? com'on nerf this crap

                         ""there is my brutus how about adding colosus ?"" ggwp

[b]ratbo's description[/b] [i]""Ratbo is among the most famous Scrat leaders. Scrats will gladly follow him blindly and in great numbers - they have a Minigun insurance""[/i] : and he got a skill where he summon a scrat with sword, seriously ? this creature is just 1 hit, make him range so he can atleast attack 1 time before he die smurf the damage if you think making him range is OP, [i]spare some love[/i]

[b]Guild Update[/b] : you can make a guild but you can only play up to 2v2 come on guys make it up to 5v5 if can :D imagine the fun (if this is bad idea please tell me why)

imma recommend this high potential game even tho i know this is clash royale ripoff, but who plays on phone right ? add more options so it wont get boring, so high potential game please dont die :D"
21036,"I've never really cared to devote myself to an RTS due to the complexities of tech trees and feeling like I was never learning and constantly overwhelmed. This ""new wave"" of Clash Royale/Halo Wars ""Blitz Mode"" style of RTS games has been amazing to me for those reasons. And, Minion Masters, really takes the simplistic style of Clash Royale (which is perfectly fine for a mobile focused title) and adds a nice dash of variety and complexity. My only concern is that these more ""casual"" style games can fail for seemingly no reason on PC to ever catch on. Hopefully, this is not one of those titles as I would love to play this for a while into the future."
21037,Good game :)
21038,"I have played (and spent money on) Hearthstone, Duelyst, Gwent, MTG (Duels, Arena), Eternal, the TES card game and probably others I can't remember, but none of them have inspired me to experiment with different archetypes as much as Minion Masters has.

Sadly, the game is held back by 2 issues: the (EU) servers and the matchmaking.
Not much to say about the servers, they're allegedly working on it, but the matchmaking is a real issue.At lower ranks you often play against bots (free wins), at higher ranks there often are mismatched matchups because the matchmaking favours speed over quality, and people do carry/play with lower rank friends (feels super-fair to play against a GM and a silver while you're at plat lel).

Balance is somewhat iffy. 2v2 has a lot of broken strats and Stormbringer is the only master you see at Master-rank, 1v1 is better but also has issues.

Overall I do definitely recommend checking it out for free, it's very fun, despite its issues."
21039,"Some say this is good.. well I disagree. I easily lost 3 Multiplayer games in a row, due to people who I believe are hackers. So my advice? Don't buy this & get a better game. It's not worth the money."

-Needs more modes
"
21049,A great game freindly to players new to real time strategy. And a loot system that lets you practically select what card you want...
21050,"TL;DR: The gameplay gets boring and same-y; you could play half a dozen matches and essentially get the feeling of every match you'll ever play. The card system is just a grind for the current best cards. Current ""best"" decks make competitive play a boring, stagnant mess based on RNG because the game requires very little skill.

The gameplay itself isn't bad, but it's shallow. The game boils down to picking a card to play and playing it on a location. 

There are spells and minions. Minions can be flyers (making them invulnerable to ground melee units), buildings (meaning they're stationary and lose health over time), or building-focused (they ignore other minions except buildings). Spells are all variations on temporarily or permanently removing minions from play; some require basic MOBA-style targeting skills to use effectively.

Masters are the avatars you can choose to play as. Each has its own attack style (for defending itself when minions reach your end of the board) and special abilities (cards that are mixed into your deck, or passives) that are unlocked with in-match experience.

The board itself has two bridges (which give experience to the master of the last minion that walked/flew over them), a gap in the middle that flying units can bypass.

Each minion has its own quirks in addition to basic types (flying or not, etc.), but it feels like some are far more viable than others. This is given evidence by the dominance of successful builds used by top players— leaderboards can be dominated by a single deck until a new patch arrives. Which leads me to my next point...

Deckbuilding is the only thing giving this game any longevity besides its competitive leaderboards (which can be meaningless due to the current dominant deck). You earn pitiful amounts of gold by winning matches, significant amounts by doing daily quests (ex: win X times), and pitiful amounts of shards (card crafting ""dust"") by gaining more than 3 copies of any card. As far as I'm aware, the third resource, rubies, is limited to a few handouts that every player will quickly receive via achievements (ex: reach X competitive tier). Gold is used to buy tokens for a single random card, massive amounts of shards can be spent on new masters, boards (just graphic changes to your side of the board), and cards, rubies are used for masters and boards.

PVE is just a set of matches against bots. You receive set rewards for beating each bot match once. This was a major disappointment to me— I enjoyed the randomization and depth of Forced Showdown."
21051,"i got this game free from PC Gamer so i didnt need to shell out the entry fee and that is where the problem lies, this game should be a freemium game, Now i understand it will be free in the future but having to pay to enter seems pretty suspicious for a game with in-app purchases. 

THE PREMIUM ISNT WORTH £15

Pros:

Regualry updated (even tells you expected date)

Easy to understand (literally is a PC clone of Clash royale

Twitch rewards is an intresting concept (streamers get codes to giveaway if wn match doing stream)

Rewards for earning achievements, completing challenges, levelling up etc

Cons:
Multiplayer is ranked but utterly broken so you can have a wood rank 5 (default) go up against a wood rank 1 (top of that tier)

Some of the ""Masters"" and ""Minions"" are broken or very OP and need to be nerfed or removed and redone.

Like Hearthstone the game uses RNG to give out cards so you need to grind a lot to unlock the best ones through collecting shards or by buying several power tokens using Rubies (Premium Currency)




"
21052,"100% P2W , yeah if you play 10hrs everyday for a month on the draft and you may be able to play it for free
But other from that dont even try online matches , you will 100% lose to people who invested tons of money , even on wood rank ,  I never saw a common card on my enemy deck and the difference of powers of the cards is absurd 
AND I GOT THE PREMIUM not even with that I could stand a chance against any deck I fought against
I Stopped playing Clash royale because it was P2W , and I wont play this any more either"

21057,"If you PAY for this game, you're in for a disappointment. This game is very unique in how it plays and it is a lot of fun (which I'll get into a moment), but it still boils down to in other aspects this game is just like a million other ""free to play"" games that you expect to see on mobile (and I think this game does have a mobile version?). 

Pros:
-Very addictive, fun battles
-Lots of humor while still being serious about the fights themselves (reminds me of Monday Night Combat)
-Unique PVP gameplay
-Quick rounds, if you or your enemy are bad, the pain will be over quickly. Between 1 and 3 minutes are nornal
-Pleasing graphics

Cons:
-Should be FREE always
-Based around microtransitions (buy premium currency in-game or spend twenty years saving up the scraps you get from leveling, which comes to a screeching halt between levels 15 and 20), exactly like the worst of the Mobile pay-to-advance structures
-Advancing is a lot of fun until you reach Bronze (which is like the third level? Just long enough to get you addicted), suddenly in which each loss actually knocks you down levels. There's a reason almost all players you meet in the Bronze levels are stuck at 5 (the lowest) - even if they are good players

In short, this game is a lot of fun for a couple of hours, then you realize it goes nowhere because each player is meant to advance until they meet others who are even close to their own skill (which isn't hard, as most players are relatively equal in skill and luck/randomness plays a part in such a case). Play this on mobile if you must, where we expect it. I'd pay for this on PC if they got rid of microtransitions and focused on gameplay longevity instead of freezing players in level zones (for the sheer purpose of attempting to frustrate players into paying for premium currency).

I'm not sayng it's pay-to-win (though it sure can help) , it's more like pay-to-(advance once you get to a point where you're kind of just flopping around like a fish and you earn like 10 gold per battle and it takes 1000 to have a chance at winning a new card).

EDIT:: I just heard that this game will be free on full release. The rest of my review still stands as of when this was written. Just a few ins-and-outs of the model of this game, especially for those considering purchasing it before full release."
21058,"Pretty interesting, although it has only a few cards and they all are easy to get, it could improve it's variability and become way better than the other games like this."
21059,Dont expect to have a remote chance of getting all the units neccessary to keep up unless you're willing to shell out an obscene ammount of money. Shamefull greed from what was a good developer.

21076,"A friend gifted me this game as a joke. I somehow got addicted to it.

The gameplay is like a mix between clash royale and hearthstone. Although in this one it matters more where you position cards and the timing plays a big role as well. Sure there is rng in the game, but way less than in other similar games. Besides , it is a fun game that shouldn't be taken too serious. Although, it is so addictive trying to climb the ranks, that you will play it more than you initially planned.

There are keys for this game all over the internet (Watch streamers on twitch, giveaways on sites like alienwarearena and such). I would still recommend this game for the $5 it costs right now.

If you have some time to slay and don't know what to do , this is the perfect game.

Despite what some people say, this game is not pay to win. You can even reach the top 20 with a deck made from basic cards."

21081,"Greetings Everyone!  Minion Masters is an interesting game, sort of reverse tower defense but still tower defense and a bit of MOBA built in.  Let me start by saying this isn't what I'd call a ""Primary Game"" this is something you pick up when you have a few free minutes to play something, almost like a smart phone game.

Pick it Up, Drop it Off:  One of the qualities I like about this game is that I can start up for 5 minutes or so and immediately drop off when I am done.  Many games are adopting this and I think it is a good thing for ‘secondary games’ (games I play intermittently).  It also helps that it is a free to play game; although there is a paid version and micro transactions (unlike many reviewers I don’t really have too much of a problem with this).

The Few, The Advanced:  One of my biggest complaints about this game is there doesn’t seem to be a variety of people to play with (against), I found myself going up against people much more skilled, equipped or just in a tier above me and I have to admit, this killed the enjoyment for me.  Perhaps if I had started playing earlier this wouldn’t be much of a problem but then it would be someone’s problem and also creates and environment that does not encourage new players.

Forced to Joke:  The humor is a bit puny, where it makes fun of the genre it represents but I feel this fits for the game as otherwise I’d feel that the game is incomplete, the game could really use some additional content though (and lines) as I end up hearing all the one liners and they do tend to teeter off as you play.

Overall, it’s a fun game.  And what it really needs is a larger player base and probably some more balance with some mechanics.  I’d really like to see more to do than just head to head and draft (as well as the challenge enemies AI).  I definitely don’t think that this is a game you dedicate any real time to however; you jump in play a game or two while waiting for friends to log in to something else.  My recommendation?  It’s free, give it a chance and see if you like it!"
21082,"P2W, Moneygrab, fast but boring"
21083,It's a lot like Clash Royale except there's not that gross feeling of being outplayed by someone who's spent more time/money on their decks by upgrading them.  As far as i can tell units can't be upgraded at all so a hard counter is a hard counter always.   There's some microtransactions build around gaining new cards here but they don't feel necessary to progress or win.  I've won almost all my online matches 5-10 of them so far and i haven't spent a dime on it.

21085,"Unfortunately this game suffers from the typical CCG element of payment options giving far too much of an advantage over non-paying customers. If you can look past that it is a decently fun game, however with glaring flaws and some frustrating gimmicks. In its current state I don't think I could recommend this to anyone due to its frustration, unless you are a CCG fan...probably best to steer clear."
21086,"Its a clash royale clone that is akward and frustrating to use.
Not my cup of tea."
21087,"It's a ""casual"" card game that you actually cannot play casually, as only grinding massively (including in grinding events) will allow you to unlock decent cards."

21094,Interesting for about an hour then is just repetitive. Not sure the game is balanced for people starting out vs people that have paid or played to get better stuff.
21095,"I will try to write this review non-biased.

NOTE: At the time of the writing of this review, the game is still in early development. This means things i mention could change with time. Please be aware of this when you read the review.

ONE OTHER NOTE: I usually do not play these games, so  i am seeing this type of game for the first time ever. As one person suggested below, i am a casual gamer and not focusing on just getting all achievo's or even beating a game to death. I play for fun, so please realize that when reading this review. Thank you.

So, i got this game for free during a free weekend event, and decided to try it. I am personally having difficulties in the game myself due to my disabilities, but not everyone will have the same issues. Anyways, here is my un-biased review:

Pro's:

`Game seems to be leaning to be free, yet it is not free at the time of this writing.
`Random minions are interesting as some of them have weird abilities and such
`Interesting masters of arena
`Most pay to play items are cosmetic or new masters only
`Game is fun up to level 10, after that, the game seems to get somewhat difficult
`Controls are easy to use
`Card action is interesting, although the game is similiar to other MOBA, but uses cards.
`Solo mode
`Friendly community on the forums

Con's:

`After level 10, the game becomes quite difficult, especially if your not used to this kind of game
`Sometimes, the game online matchmaking is not very good. I once went against someone who beat me less then a minute due to the other person online having a strong unit, while i used starter deck.
`Premium mode costs money, which is how you get good cards. This can lead to the above issue about joining online matchmaking, making it unfair if you only use starter deck of cards.
`Game forces you to play online matchmaking, even if you dont want to, because the SOLO mode does not reward you after a certain point.
`Game is always online, even for solo mode
`Solo mode is too short and need more rewards handed out. Not everyone is a expert at online multiplayer mode.
-""Newb-Stomping"" - What is newb-stomping? This is mainly on games like this, where the common players of it outskill new players and alienate newer players, thus making newer players pariah's because they cannot win. In a way, new players are being alienated, and i have also suffered from this issue in the game...

Also, about matchmaking issues, i posted reporting it here:

http://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/1/135513901705935196/

I cannot recommend this due to issues with matchmaking with someone more stronger than your current level / deck. This leads to unfair matchmaking of decks, possibly with one person only having starter deck, with other person having advanced cards. The matchmaking needs better differentiation between cards in each deck, premium account holders, and skills of such game players. The current matchmaking will lead to new players quitting the game, or having people view the game as P2W or balance issues. Hopefully, the developer will take this into account and fix the issue with matchmaking. 

ONE NOTE: To clarify why i put online mode in Con's is because not everyone likes to play games exclusively online. Even though the game says it is online only, there is a solo mode in the game too, but you are required to be online to play the solo mode. I was confused about this and posted this as such.

I wanted to thank Sir Faulty for mentioning a few points i needed to clarification on to make my review more clearer for people, and wanted to thank them personally for this information."
21096,"the balance is awful, too much rock paper scissor and then you get dealt a hand of rock and they get all paper. gg not fun no players either so you always play against the same exact p2w players."
21097,"Recommended, if this game will be a F2P model when released."
21098,"yes, this game is fun in its own way. i hate this game. to me, there is no strategy. it becomes nothing but spam fest. its fucking stupid, but hey give it a try, if you like it. good to you. have fun    (pc version of clash royle, with all the pay to win parts)"
21099,"This game is a ""buy shards"" ""buy tokens"" ""buy crystals"" etc. kind of game. You can do this properly and you can do this in a disturbing way that's overly trying to distract you from the fact that you're supposed to be tricked into unloading cash to the devs. This is the later. That alone is enough to not recommend the game, but there are things I don't like about the gameplay too.

Another Castle Fight... -like? That other mobile game locked cards behind ranks. This one also locks cards by having to unlock them with ""Currency"". Currently it doesn't look like playing the game is enjoyable enough to justify the wait until you actually have the deck the want. That's bad.

But my problem is another one, I think the randomness messes with the idea of counters. I mean, obviously I should build my deck in a way that can counter stuff, but I found myself too often with no counter for what the enemy was throwing at me. Not entirely sure if that's because I suck at building decks or because the cards are too diverse for the card slots you have.

Castle Fight worked because you could easily see what your enemy had and if you knew the game you knew how to counter it. That lead to long games, but it also lead to actual enjoyment."

[spoiler]Way too few competitive cards available atm to recommend this game in its current state.
Ranked mode is currently a joke, as you simply steamroll (am currently at a 25x winning streak with basic cards) if you know how to organize a deck. XD

Bonus points for fast-paced strategy and fun overall game design.

21112,"EDIT5: I changing review to recommended (september 2020). It pains me knowing that this was much better game before but... two years later only few people remember it. Game itself is relative good and for free its fair deal at least to try it.

EDIT4: Update 60 is CAN*CER. Its ""visual"" update, but it changing gameplay so deeply that after this update it feels like completely different game. This is not small change its massive. It was smart, tough challenging, ""adult"", ""PC version"" of the game. Now is gameplay dumbed down, player mistakes are easily forgiven and players skills are toned down with outcomes which relied on luck. It feels like some (bad) generic mobile port. Its like go from chess to checker. Yes, some people (and probably even more of them) will prefer more dumbed, random, mobile version but I dont. I dont like it at all. I will not write more I will just link you to the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/grained-spice-mineral/recommended/489520/]fnu´s very good review[/url] about current situation (april 2018).

EDIT3: Devs realized that their expeditions s*cked big time. They reworked them. They are still bad but they are unimportant now. Meanwhile devs were able fix a lot of balacing issues. Yes, it took them few months but most balancing issues from my comment from 20.7.2017 is currently fixed. Its actually fun to play this game again even outside draft.

EDIT2: Ok, game balance its again broken. Balancing in this game is joke. Very few players play this game now. Devs go from extreme to extreme with card balancing - for example spirit infusion card. From absolute OP state, to super nerf that it was useless then OP as duck again and now again super nerfed that its basically dead card. This happened with other cards too. Its like devs trolling us hard. At same time they have several very good suggestion how to fix it from experienced players like Beancake, Terra, Rush etc. and they just ignore it. And expedition ""single"" player mode? Thats so boring that better fun is stick your Mick into beehive. So why I still play this game and even recommend it in this review rating? Its because draft mode. Draft is very good, very fun and because every player have random cards, cancer combos arent really big problem here. This game has big potential. I would wish great succes for this game but... I dont know. I just hope that devs dont kill this game for good. 

EDIT: Ranked mode is still bad, draft is ok but doesnt have players now, but new 2vs2 mode is very good! I have to say I was wrong when I was pesimistic about that. Overal I changing my rating to slightly recommend this game. In past 14 days I play relatively a lot (almost exclusively 2vs2) and it was a fun again.

The game is so much unbalanced that ranked gameplay is basically broken now. This reliably deters new players to stay with this game so player base constantly shrinking and only few experienced players staying. I currently play 3-4 games/day just to make achievement and usually 2-3 games are against people who I played before.

Draft plays are quite good though, but at first you have to grind ranked games where you will be crushed badly by old experienced players to get enough gold to play again so I can't still recommend this for new players.

After two months I don't believe that developers are capable fixing it even though they are active. They chasing wrong tail here. Adding new cards is useless when even old cards aren't balanced. Guild system? Doesn't solve anything. 2vs2 mode when 1vs1 doesn't work? Pointless work sorry. Skin system will be cool though.

MM currently [url=http://steamcharts.com/app/489520]hemoraging players quicker[/url] than squirrel smashed by a car.  I don't believe that this will change in future although Im open to change my rating if that happen."
21113,"This game tries hard to have a balanced meta until you realize you can use a cheesey strat to flood the map with low HP minions to win most games. If you build to counter the cheese strat, then you will lose to regular varied builds that try to have some intelligence."
21114,"Pretty nice game, very enjoyable. I really like everything so far. 
Easy to grasp and fun to play, and I found match online pretty fast."
21115,Its a fun game.  Its a challange to learn what to play build a deck but over all a good game
21116,Its just as bad as all the others!

There are a ton of MOBA’s out there and I’m not currently playing any of them anymore. Why? Well that is due to the long-winded nature of the genre. It’s not that I don’t have the time to play a long game, but the single match length is a bit much. I used to like watching the League of Legends matches and I still can enjoy them at times, but playing them is a whole other can of worms. I loved LoL‘s Dominion mode and was grateful when they introduced it with its shorter, quicker matches… until they eventually canned it. I know that grinds are part of the meta and how the games work mechanically, but I feel it’s tough to make a grind fun in any game. Does Minion Masters fall into the same trap? Well… that’s a difficult question, let me break it down for you.

It’s important to note that while this game is very polished, it is technically an Early Access game and they mention that they are testing for balance and the like. Things could and probably will change in the future. 

Minion Masters from Beta Dwarf (the makers of FORCED  and FORCED SHOWDOWN) are entering the MOBA scene and doing things quite a bit differently. They taken some of their characters from past games and are recreating the concept of the MOBA and so far, I’m mostly liking what I see. (That seems vague, but I’ll try to make it more clear.) On the surface, if you’re a fan of the traditional control your hero, kill minions for money, level up and buy skills and gear, Minion Masters will turn you on your head. In this game, your hero stands on a pedestal and with your help, aids the minions that get sent across the arena over one of two bridges. It’s small, it’s quick, it’s simple and it’s quite ingenious.

I’m not one to jump into multiplayer because of MOBA skill reasons so I chose to take the single player route. Naturally, this route teaches you the basics of the game and how it all works. You pick ten cards(minions) before the match and start. As the match goes, your mana bar fills and you can start to place minions on the board if you’ve attained the required mana. They proceed to the other side of the board and violence ensues. Some units can attack only ground or air while others can attack both or none and will make b-lines for your enemies base. It’s play and counter the whole match. Having a well-balanced team is difficult to have in the beginning so most will create a deck that plays a specific way and try to make it work or try the next round. After said round, you are rewarded with experience, Gold and rank.

As you gain in experience your account will level up and you’ll get Gold, new units that can only be attained by leveling and also Rubies and Shards. There are a lot of variables in play here and it can be kind of daunting. You’ll figure it out fairly quickly with some back and forth in the easy-to-use menus. Money buys you chests which give you Power Tokens which then gives you a roulette of randomly selected cards. There can be duplicates of ones you already have and duplicates in the selection itself (which is admittedly rough since there is only eight). You’ll get a free token every day for a chance at more Gold, Shards or Rubies. New heroes (some inspire different builds) and arenas(all of which are cosmetic) can be purchased with either Shards or Rubies. Shards are also used to craft new cards/minions and duplicates/unwanted cards can be scrapped for pennies-on-the-dollar Shards (but at it’s least something). Rubies can also purchase two or ten packs of Power Tokens (with ten being the better deal of course). All this to say, if you play long enough, you will eventually be able to get everything without dropping a dollar and/or supporting the developers.

You can plunk down $20 and get double Gold for a year, 50% exp for winning forever and 2500 Rubies and 500 Shards for their Premium Upgrade. $20 isn’t much so I won’t scoff at the price at all. In fact, I think it’s rather fair. On the same note, play it for about two weeks or so and that will give you a few units from the random draws, the units you get from leveling up and you’ll have some experience on what you like/want and what you don’t care for from playing with others online. At that point, your money will be better spent because you’ll have played with multiple heroes and seen more minions. The only thing you’re really buying here though is the Rubies and Shards because the money from winning is terrible so getting double 20 Gold when you need 1,000 to get a box feels like a drop in the bucket and you’re better off leveling and showing up for dailies. Experience is cool, but to be honest, if you like this game, you’ll level up eventually. As a bit of a warning, you can play directly against your friends, but you get nothing for it unless it’s a daily.

All that said, the action is fast and the concept is cool. The grind isn’t seen in the game, it’s out of the game. The game will be free to play and can stay like that. However, if you are not friends with cranky old Mr. RNG, then the grind can appear for you outside of the core gameplay. If there are units that you want, but can’t afford, the ability to obtain enough can take some time. If there are multiple units that you want, it will take even longer. This has led some to call Minion Masters a wallet warrior friendly game. I don’t feel this is too true, but I can see where they are coming from. Everything is attainable, but developers have to tease you with a carrot(or Ruby) in some form or another even if you can’t buy a unit directly with real world money. With RNG being king though, you’ll encounter a lot of people with some crazy good cards early on. Not all of those people paid money, some of them got lucky, but people will say what they will say.

Score: Support This Title!

I would like to say that Minion Masters is great. For all intents and purposes, it kind of is. However, it can’t keep me playing for long periods at a time. You basically make no progress if you lose a match and if you win, it’s a small reward. Leveling up and showing up for dailies is really how to feel like you’re making progress (besides simply winning that is) in this game. Some of those games will be quick and easy and others a slog of loses. This is definitely a game well worth checking out and playing for a while because it is fun. If anything, give it a few weeks and if you’re not doing so well, just show up for the daily free Token and daily challenge and you’ll start to attain a collection of Minions that you can put together and create a fun composition or a trolling team. Minion Masters is a great take on MOBAs and the matches are quick and fun. If you do find yourself enjoying it, show some love to the devs; buy some dang Rubies!"
21119,"The more I play this game, the more it gets updated, the more I enjoy it, if that wasn't evident by my >100 hour mark.  It boasts competitive deckbuilding, promotes good play and reactions just as strongly as good cards, and a wide amount of playstyles are very viable.  The interaction with real-world money consists mostly of pay-to-not-grind as opposed to any real pay-to-win, which I can appreciate.

The real issue, honestly, is the INTENSE learning curve, which I hope can be smoothed out somehow.  What you're not initially aware of is the fact that the baseline cards actually do allow you to deal with almost any situation, but you have to know 1) what the biggest threats are  2) how to play around those threats, and  3) what cards you have to include to deal with said threats.  Now I understand that may be inherent to card games, but this is a bit more 3-dimensional than just card vs card, stats vs stats.  With the addition of field positioning and real-time placement at stake, it's a lot of mechanics that can overwhelm a fresh player - myself included, once upon a time.  Also, 2v2's are a bit... hammy, but the game was designed initially around 1v1.

It's a very satisfying experience if you stick with it and understand it, though.  As I'm growing into a decent player myself, I have no deal-breaking gripes and mostly good things to say.

(The ""update"" was a complete rewrite of the review.)"
21120,"is a very godd game ,fun  recomanded"
21121,Started playing this game earlier this week so am still getting to grips with the game. That said I keep returning so it must offer something that has hooked me. So far I have dropped the smallest amount of cash as I feel it has given me something to make it worth giving the developers something and I may even go premium. As it is free to play you have nothing to lose by giving it a shot and I feel it is worth at least that if not a lot more.
21122,Good game but everyone copying their desks.
21123,"Never played any of these ""cardgames"" but this is quite fun. Dont know how long the fun lasts since Im getting the sense that this is heavy p2w game.

Got game free, have enjoyed alot, would recommend this to anyone, as free, wouldnt pay for it tho."
21124,"No matter you are a fan of which genre, must try once...
Surprisingly good!"
21125,Is pretty good game
21126,BULLSHIT BUT GOOD VIEW FUCK HEARTSTONE
21127,Great fun game :)
21128,"In the huge wave of free (might I add; crappy, not so good) games, there's gonna be that one that stands out from the rest and is actually worth playing aside of just gathering its' trading cards.

This one is IT! It's a really fun game especially if you are playing against a friend.
Its simple to play, gets competetive and offers a large variety of cards to choose from and the deck building just adds another layer to the game to keep you playing!

Give this a shot, especially if you got it for free..."
21129,The most fun game I've been play!!!
21130,"Clash Royale+Clash of clans+Dota=Minion Master!!!
 its like Clash Royale but its more Epic and for PC Platform"
21131,Been here before... decent game buried under p2w trash. Wallet warriors assemble!
21132,"Don't even bother it's literally already agro shaman the game. You would think that with the tens of generic boring card games for literally every franchise that gets popular they would have some sort of idea how to balance cards and not make a game this is literally already meta in alpha. You bring in anything over 5 mana you've already lost because the control spells are trash and cost 4 mana, the only good one being a random kill spell which doesn't matter because they just flood the board, and can barely kill anything to begin with then you just get flooded with 3/4 drops. The last thing we need in this world is some uncreative microtransaction bs card game."
21133,"Either unblalanced or p2w
Bluntly said i wish they would be at least subtile, that they want whales."
21134,love it
21135,"INTERESTING GAME
Although the graphics doesnt good but quality"
21136,"Very nice games, but it's free all time, expect the key games"
21137,"Got it for free, is it a good game? Why yes, yes it is, however it has it's issues, it is early access after all, the main issue comes from poor balance which should be fixed as it moves closer and closer to a full release.

You may be asking what's wrong with the balance? Well an example of that would be rush decks, you basically spam 0-1-2 mana cards doesn't matter which one you put down you just spam them and eventually you'll win the game because of how flooded the board will get, it's impossible to deal with this nonsense which brings me to my next issue, flooding the board, there is no limit on what you can have on the board which leads to big balance issues, I've seen a board get filled with so many buildings there was literally no counterplay, nothing could be done about it.

My next issue with balance is spells, spells work on heroes, that seems fine but really it's not, you'd ""I have 100hp but I am holding really well I think I can turn this around"" only to have the enemy fireball your face and then you lose, there is nothing you can do about this.

I'm not going to list all the balance issues but this is just a few, this is a solid game it really is but there are so many balance issues it's a pain in the ass, sometimes, it also has a $5 price tag on a game that should be free to play, the developer said it will be free to play in the future which sounds nice and all but that is so backwards it makes no sense, let me get this straight, it's going to cost money to play the EARLY ACCESS game but free to play when it gets FULLY RELEASED, ok then, that makes perfect sense... No, no it doesn't, the game should be free to play from the moment it's on Steam, period. People that played early access should get those special rewards, don't try and entice with stupid DLC that pay for the game in early access, cut the crap, the people that buy it in early access are buying DLC, they aren't getting anything for free, the developer can call it a gift all they want but the fact is it's not a gift, you are PAYING for it.



Bit of a rant I know but it kind of pisses me off when developers try to pull this shit, using bullshit tactics to entice the player, you're not enticing me, I got it for free, awesome, I would never pay for this game. As for whether you should buy this or not? Well if you want the ""gift"" pfff haha sure go pay for DLC in early access otherwise stay the hell away until this game becomes free to play which is how it should be.

I do not recomment it, I will change to recommended when it goes free to play, others may be fine with it but I'm not, it's a bullshit tactic that should never have been done like this."
21138,I love force games fuking all of them + this game is so nice and u can do alot of cool sheet like summing a fuking black hole can u do that ?
21139,"Shitty game, completely fucking Pay to WIn. I'm in wood 4 and this guy in wood 2 HAS THE MOST OP SHIT. HE LITERALLY SUMMONS SOMETHING THAT KILLS ALL MY SHIT AND THEN HE HAS A GLOBAL HEAL? Broken game. Garbage. Don't even download it while it's free."
21140,"Boring magic the gathering wannabe. This should be a mobile game if it isnt already. There is no need for this simplistic cartoon garbage on steam.

It took me all of 20 minutes to tell that this game was pay to win."
21141,Clash Royale if it was designed for PC - Adds some fun new mechanics as well but you'll know the drill if you've played clash.
21142,"I love this game, requires tons of strategy. Although im terrible at strategy games, and... not a big fan of them, I can't stop playing this. Give it a try, and if you dont like it you can do what you want with it. But trust me, you will love it if your a fan (or maybe not) of strategy games."
21143,"There's always an strict meta that defines the way you've to play. You can't try to do new things, you have to follow the meta every time."
21144,After another shift in game direction I am no longer able to recommend this tytle.
21145,"Previously i would not have recomended this game but now i definetily recomoned this game honestly they say its ganna be free (which im all for ;) ) but this game is worth the 5$ you spend.

Cool events

21146,good game but some cards are really not fair
21147,"P2W (Pay to Win) = Garbage

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is garbage! It's not worth a minute of your life. It's a piece of shit because to start with there is nothing original. Even being a new game there is nothing original.

With the same deck you can win and lose indiscriminately. Your skill won't affect the result of the game. It is a matter of luck. This game will only show you how people who spend money on it win whereas people who are just looking for an original game waste their time and patience. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Este juego es basura! No vale ni un minuto de tu tiempo. Es un pedazo de mierda porque, para empezar no tiene nada de original. Incluso siendo un juego nuevo no hay nada de original.

Con la misma baraja puedes ganar y perder indistintamente, tu habilidad no va a declinar la balanza a ninguna de las dos opciones. Es cuestion de suerte. Este juego solo sirve para ver como gente que se deja su dinero gana, y gente que buscaba un juego original pierde el tiempo y la paciencia. No recomiendo el juego a nadie."

Well, its fun and can last time, specially if you are collector of achivments, card freak or just it will get your skin. Concept is very simple, two players against each other with two arenas connected by two bridges. You both got 10 cards representing creatures and spells plus your character, standing on ultimate tower and a goal to destroy, have its own merits and perks.
Let's clash! I mean, lets battle. Classic rock-paper-scissor, everything have counters and everything is strong vs something. Card summons creatures and spells and all depends on your slowly replenishing mana pool. If you control bridge (or two), you slowly get experience and get to activate your passive or active perks (as written before, unigue to your character)

++ I got the game for free! Yay!
+ Devs are hard promoting this game, often give for very cheap price or even for free.
+ Simplicity
+ Singleplayer with decent AI and multiplayer.
+ Somewhat strategic
+ Quick queues, no long waiting for a game and suprisingly good matchmaking system
+ Free to play model not forcing you to spend money (money only considerably speed up unlocking things for you)
+- Humour. I found it repetive and sometimes even childlish, others may like it. Dunno.
- Rough mechanics (cheesy tactics, currently very often mentioned Ratbo or spell spam)
- Balancing. Some things are just better than others, meta is hardcore with this one!
- Longetivity. Nothing really force me to play this game again after a few hours in.
- You can't controll your units directly, AI sometimes betrays you and you are screwed mate.

21163,"Personally. I love this game.
Somehow it gives a lot of fun. Looks simple, but it needs a bit of strategy mind to succeed.
Devs updating it quite often, so there`s potential. Good job."
21164,"Excellent! Shines among many other similar games, and has way more potential than Blizzard's Hearthstone. Dynamic, fast paced, and strategic. It does not feel ""play to win"" despite negative reviews, as many strategies do not require the best cards. Special mention: the interface is some of the best ever made in a computer game: simple and intuitive. Job well done for an Alpha - bound to be a hit if devs do not get greedy."
21165,Really nice
21166,A fun little game thats enjoyable. the gameplay resemble that of crash royale but the mechanic is somewhat different. a good game all in all.
21167,Good Game
21168,"I've tried this game out and honestly only played the introduction.
I was so overwhelmed about the lack of challenge during the first 3 introduction missions, that I started looking up towards the fourth mission, playing against another player.
During this battle, I didn't even try to win, yet I won easily...
I didn't feel accomplished, so I pressed ALT + F4."
21169,"A great game idea, needs some improvments. (Hopefully underway)"
21170,"At first it was fun, but after a while it got real annoying.
game isn't balanced, some card combinations are just OP, and gues what, those card combinations usually involve super hard to get cards, so you pretty much have to buy shards and craft them (pay-to-win).
At first it seems fine, since I was playing aginst, AI or other beginners, but once you start getting to a certain point in rank, you'll never win (like 1 win every 10 games or something).
just so so bad, so unbalanced."
21171,every match is so intense you do not now if you will win or lose but you always try!!!
21172,"It's a fun, quick CCG.

[b]Update 2018:[/b] The game isn't really going anywhere. The mobile game economy, stagnant spammy gameplay, no decent card changes and unending Early Access are frustrating. I think the dev is just sitting on a minimum-effort lootbox scheme under the guise of Early Access - and asking money for access.

I don't know any creature combat alternatives, but Eternal and The Elder Scrolls: Legends are better card games. Both are free to play, much more rewarding and varied."
21173,I think it's amazing. One of the best Beta games out there. Good graphics and fun overall.
21174,It's so funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
21175,"good little game 

for a full preview watch this video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=now1xiqh1tw&ab_channel=TotalBiscuit%2CTheCynicalBrit"
21176,I had a lot more fun playing this game than I thought I would.  I like all the different minions and the variety of attacks.
21177,"This game is really very good, I did not expect it to be so good.
I would recommend to buy or download :)"
21178,"Great little game.  Reminds me a LOT of Hearthstone, only it's better.  The animations and even strategy of where to place your units when starting battles add a whole extra dimension to the game.  Great variety of units and lot to learn to learn the nuances of which units counter which the best.

It's a great fast paced game with a lot of strategy.  It feels a little pay to win, but then that's the way with pretty much all free 2 play games.  When you start ranking up you quickly run into players with much better cards.  However this is no different to almost every other F2P game and certainly no different to Hearthstone.  

In short, well worth a visit.  Be warned it's addictive as hell and definitely will cause you to say, ""just one more round""."
21179,"Ok game, im not so good though lol"
21180,"Minion Masters is a game that kind of let me down, I recieved the game when it was in beta for a sale price of $20 US and if I had actually purchased it at that price I would have been severely let down because it is essentially a rehashed Clash Royale with an upgradeable King Tower. So it is a definite no from me."
21181,I like it..
21182,Some copy of Clash Royale but it looks pretty awesome !
21183,"Have been playing with a friend for a while now, worth it."
21184,Before this game was 20 euro
21185,"bit too twitchy for me, hate twitchy games, I have a brain, gimme time to use it."
21186,its a good game
21187,"This game is pretty fun, I prefer the draft play over just online duels. 
Build your deck and become the minion master!"
21188,"Very good lane-clearing game without the pay-to-win stuff. You still have to have a level of competency in order to win, and the game changes weekly with new updates. Overall, it's just a great, addictive game!"
21189,bad
21190,Amazing game
21191,It's improves every update :) very good game
21192,ok
21193,More Like Crash Royale..but while the announcer mocking you xD
21194,Mediocore game with damn good marketing.
21195,"This game is really great, even though I've played 60minutes+ of it, I can already tell it's going to become another ""CSGO"" for me where I pump in 2,000+ hours. Everything is just overall amazing about this game."
21196,one by one i will conquer my enemies !
21197,"This game, like all the other pay to win games, is trash.  It matches you up with people who have so much better cards than you do that you can't hope to win.  It's just like all the other garbage games that let you win by paying real money.  Might as well just play a bunch of stupid games on your smartphone.  Don't waste your time."
21198,"Plaayed this game a ton as you can see but I need to give it a thumbs down at this point:

- Game got more and more buggy over time, 
- new cards got more and more powerful, making old cards weaker and weaker,
- new cards/combos get easier to play while also being really strong, to make it more accessible for noobs I guess,
- toxic metas and very unenjoyable faceroll type of gameplay because of the above mentioned
- people are able to reach the highest rank (grand master) within their first 1 or 2 weeks of playing even though they only know what like 20% of the cards do or what the counters are. It's silly that this game was so dumbed down that you don't need to have any game knowledge and can still reach the HIGHEST rank. It's a joke

- lower ranks are almost exclusively filled by bots, so if you win your first 30+ games don't be surprised, you are actually not good at the game, you are just facing bots. These are there to make new players 'feel good' and keep them playing.

In the end though, game is free so try it and see how it goes yourself. It's still gonna be enjoyable for a while but it gets more and more frustrating to play the more time you spent on it and see how dumb, easy to play, and broken some combos are and that there is nothing you can do if you don't happen to run the perfectly built counter deck.

21199,clash royale
21200,"Pay to win. I got the game for free and I feel bad for the people who actually paid money to get a pay to win game.

Also if you lose connection to a game for a second, you instantly lose and get kicked out."
21201,"Clash Royale, but for PC

Awesome."
21202,Nice :D
21203,"Pretty nice game, very enjoyable. I really  like everything so far. 
Easy to grasp and  fun to play, and I found match online pretty fast."

21205,"Very Pay2Win.. This game Isn't free yet has Fremium mobile game like mechanics.. It gets boring, has nothing specially exciting about it if you compare it to clash royale, gets grindy, feels like a mobile game and costs 5 dollars. Not worth your money go play literally anything else."
21206,"This is probably the best Clash Royale copy on PC. I definetely recommend, so much fun!"
21207,"Sure, not my type but it is a good game for Clash Royale lovers"
21208,best strategy games ever on steam
21209,"This game is very nice. I got this for free from somewhere that I don't remember. I tried the game yesterday while talking to my girlfriend. The game was so interesting that I was lost in the game and could not focus on her call. So she got angry and am single now. 

Happy gaming, lads.

EDIT: Don't mind the cringe. This was posted ages ago. I have a girlfriend now. But I'm still virgin so stay tuned!"
21210,YESSS!!!!
21211,sdfsdfsdfsdf
21212,"free stuff, nice game"
21213,"A fun easy-to-learn action-strategy game that is good for small rounds.

Pros:
- Nice bright and cartoony graphics
- Easy-to-learn gameplay style. Place cards on battlefield, hope minions destroy opponent's tower before yours is destroyed.
- Fun and fast-paced gameplay. It is exciting to play against opponents hoping to put the right cards in the right places.
- Rounds are quick and don't overstay their welcome.
- Both single player mission and multiplayer fun.

Cons:
- Coins can only be used to buy wheel tokens. I think you should be able to use coins on more than just one thing. Maybe make us able to buy arenas or champions with coins, just make them expensive.
- There are some cards where you don't understand its usefulness."
21214,you want to play Clash Royale on PC play this game
21215,"Fun game with fast-paced, short games that offers plenty of possibilities for tactical manouvers to beat your opponent.

Things that I found really appealing were that there is no excesive grinding required to be competitive in top tier (there will always be some grinding required to get the content of a F2P game, but it's much lower compared to other F2P games that involve collecting cards) due to most expensive units having solutions to deal with that are really cheap, even for new players, and frequent updates (of which many are based on the discussions with the community) that include new content and/or balance changes.

Balance wise the game is looking pretty good in my opinion. It offers plenty of possibilities of building different decks that are viable, and there aren't that many cards that I consider a really bad choice. It still needs some work, but it feels much less meta dependant that other games I have played.

The game charges 20€ for a premium version which in return offers much less grinding needed to get most of the things in the game, but the game is playable even with the free (being given away by streamers or various giveaway sites), basic version. It will require a bit more time invested to get some basic things, but with that more time invested you can be on par with premium users in terms of competitiveness."
21216,"I got this for free not worth $20 but, is a decent game that has a good concept"
21217,The narrator put an effort jajajaja good game.
21218,rip optimization
21219,"Got it for free and at first it was fun but once you hit silver or so it becomes extremely grindy if you don't want to buy all the cards for your deck. Not to mention the need to fight the same 3 popular decks over and over and over. It's just not fun at this point. I am determined to get all the achievements and at 60 hours of gameplay I still don't have them all. Ugh, it's such a chore."
21220,Kinda okay. Could've been better. It's just a copy of Clash Royale in a way. sed to see this. gets boring after a while
21221,It's okay
21222,Best League of Legends rip-off
21223,"I think for the time period, I like this game.

PROS :
- Good Background Music
- Nicely detailed characaters
- Nice Graphic detailing

CONS :
- Some units are too opped and require some tweaking.
- Not enough arenas

For now i think this game is playable."
21224,"Fantastic game. Fun to play, easy to learn, skill based more than anything. All content in the game can be earned by play.

Dev's are involved with the game constantly, allowing you to give feedback on bugs or suggestions for the game. Active balance changes come readily, as well as a stable competitive mode.

The community is great as well, available in game or on their Discord channel.

tl:dr this game is like Clash Royale but better."
21225,"Most unbalanced thing i ever played in my entire live.
Even getting it for free it not worth it a fucking penny.


Tried it again, still bad.

You just need 1 card and you will"
21226,"Im not so much into card games, but I got this for free and tried it. 
I can't say that it's not good. I believe people who like these type of games will have a good time playing.
What I fear is that the game might evolve into a p2w type with microtransactions.
"
21227,This game is pretty good .I like it!
21228,great game i play it all the time i love it
21229,"This game is sort of like clash royal, but also comletely different. It has plenty of features and types of characters that clash royale doen't have. I managed to get this game for free. At the moment you can get it for super cheap of G2A. At a glance, I wouldn't have payed for this game. But after playing it for a while. I would 100% recommend it. Maybe not for 20 dollars. But if you can get it for 15, do it. It's a great game, loving it now, and can't wait for more updates. This game can run on ANY computer if you turn the setings on low, so don't worry if you have a toaster."

21238,Nice and fast game... Smashed 2 monitors already because I lost from a wood 5 beginner but hey that's okay!
21239,ok so lets get this out of the way i would not pay anything over $20 for this game but for less its a good game i enjoy it its basic but fun and easy to get into i like how it looks and have no problems with the gameplay either sure it seems to be heading in the direction of P2W but for the time being it seems rather balanced so untill that changes i can not say anything bad about the game

21241,"Has the cleanest, easiest to use UI and is a fun game, what more could you ask for?"
21242,"Card Shuffle 1v1/2v2 edition. Verrrry real time fast-paced, I said give it time, it will become better from its potential stage, and it did. Balance factor is quite fragile, can't wait for more new masters regardless. Ruby gets harder to earn after reaching higher stages of achievements. Would definitely recommend if theres 3v3/4v4/1v1v1v1. Casual card game 7.7/10

check comments for timeline update details"
21243,"Simply addictive!
Great looking graphics, lovely soundtrack and tons of cards and tactics.

[b]So far it's early access so there's no point in saying ""Too expensive"".[/b]

Description below:

[u]The reason why is also down there.[/u]

I hope it will be well balanced in nearly future because for now some cards are too overpowered and it's really hard to counter them.

Definitely worth playing!"
21244,yes

21251,This game very nice
21252,"Minion Masters is a strategy game mixed with a bit of action of course. The game controls a lot like duelyst, however you can choose where your units go. It reminds me a lot of clash royale. It's a very fun game and I'd recommend it."

"
21254,Its's Very Cool game like clash Royal.ThankYou who have created this game :))

21258,"Game keeps getting worse,  they add things like more voice lines and garbage like  ""Twitch.TV"" ONLY masters and cards, so if people don't use twitch, there is 0 ZERO ways to get them.

Can't craft them, so  why not make it only usable in single player? 

One of the few who supported this game before it was free.



*Edit the review was longer and the dev sort of replied but it's not going to fix it."
21259,"i got mixed emotions of this game. i really dont know how i feel.,
gives off a clash royale feel?
its still on early state., so hoping for something good someday"
21260,"nice game, ez to get and hard to master."
21261,nice game
21262,"It's as bad as any other card based game - you need to learn every cards features...
Then you need to collect them, then try to make good deck - while using op cards and combos... otherwise you'll keep losing and losing... and rarely you will win, because somehow enemy was worse than you or you countered him with your mindless deck.

Game introduces itself very weak... is there any plot? Or it's just mindless less than 10 minutes battles?
Game is somehow optimized, but at the same time it is not.

Generally I could say that game steals scheme for highly popular multiplayer games - you earn, you unlock, you have divisions, you fight with random people. It rewards you in many ways... and well... has ""victory"" or ""defeat"" signs...
That makes me wonder...

But no, I do not recommend it to anyone... sorry."
21263,Good Game
21264,"The game is great.. But most of the time i play against other players i lose because, its either im noob or you aren't matched with those players with the same skill set as yours. (level) or their just good.. I recommend this game. I didn't play it much but i had great times when i was playing the game..  Maybe ill come back once early access is gone, so that i can update my review and make it 5x longer. Bai~

21265,Fun

-Thanks Steve (Linesky) for this game [GIFT] xoxo"
21267,"This game is a hidden gem in a sea of poop.   My wife first started playing this game after I gifted her a copy, and when I saw how simple yet deep the gameplay was, I had to give it a shot.    The best way to describe this is by calling it a RTS-Card hybrid that also has a loot and crafting system.  So much to learn but so easy to pick up and play!"
21268,This game is shit
21269,"Someone randomly gave me this and I was like ""this looks dumb"" but then I tried it and immediately played it for an hour straight cause it's pretty fun.  It's like if in magic the gathering you could actually watch all the monsters fight each other.  Figuring out how to deal with all the insanity that the opponent is throwing at you feels good."

Stay away from the game.

Still needs balancing.
Looks better now.
Kind of fun, not going to lie.

21300,"[strike]A really nice game!
The developers DO take care of what the community suggests!
The performance level is a bit poor at the moment and it only supports 16:9 resolutions (needs some applaunch trickery to make it work on other aspect ratio monitors), but I hope it'll be fixed in future updates.

Almost every unbalanced card or master has been revisited properly during the last few months. Many bug fixes and constant cool updates. The game is basically never boring, unless you play too much.
Lots of fun with friends (and definitely Twitch friendly too)!

I really hope it'll gets bigger and more played in the future.

And if you find a bug: #blamefdm Kappa[/strike]

Game became broken. Devs doesn't even know what they're doing nor they know how to properly play their own game, hence the lack of proper updates and balance changes.
Old players are slighlty taking distance from the game because of this, but apparently they prefer to give an advantage to who doesn't know how to play so they boost/create cards and mechanics to let them win against real skilled opponents.

It was a pleasure to play this game few years ago, now it's not.

Get it together, devs.


From a player playing this game since Jan 28th 2017 (nearly 3 years)."
21301,Fun
21302,I like it
21303,"This gamen has one of the best concepts ever, you summon minions to attack the foe's tower, the only thing bad about the game is that it is pretty much unplayable on a laptop, but I'd like to see the game fully developed because it is a great game to play overall."
21304,"If someone wants 3 free packs and new arena:
6WA-7CR-TDB
How to redeem?
Go to shop then click redeem code and paste it down.
First come first serve"
21305,"The Game is fun to the point and i know its alpha but it dosent mean i will take it easy on it for that

What will you like:
ANIMATION and DESIGN is solid funny ,
The units them selfs are interesting they have VARITY in it
RNG is pretty fair compared to most gameS
Crafting prices are SOLID fine
Few solo/tranining  missions are fine (but lacking as daily)

What will you hate and hate more:
That there is barely any tactics left 
Some units are way overpowered for their cost,
And matchmaking is a joke : Pinnig wood to bronzE leaving wood ranking people with out a chanse
Draft mode and confusion: They give you to play Draft Mode one free time but the rest to play again  after  you  lost three matches  you need to pay for it and price really is cosmic 1500g coins or 150 rubies. And for it there is really not that big rewards. Compared to buy a unit you need only 1000g

And most GOLD GAINED is from level ups and daily quests/challanges  one battle is few gold pieces not even reaching 20
IF some one ask if units dosent matter its how you play then thous people are really wrong
"
21306,"Game is only fun when you win, teams are always unbalanced, I'm either trashing someone or being trashed; same with most deck games, there's always a counter, but you probably don't have a well mixed deck; because you find it more common to fight someone with a specific deck.
There are some really OP units, like this one ""voidborne"" that teleports away from melee and 1 hit kills basically everything
Kind of pay to win, because the cards cost 500 shards.
There's 3 currencies which seems very unnecessary"
21307,not worth 20 e ...... but its fun
21308,nyyeez
21309,"Feels like if you buy the wrong cards early, you're stuck beneath a massive grind to get anything else worthwhile - and that grind sucks if you picked the wrong cards. I prefer to experiment a bit with deckbuilders, and the complete unforgivingness of the purchase system makes that basically impossible. If you're going to play this, read online how you should spend your currency, this game punishes blind experimentation quite harshly."
21310,The potential of this game is beyond any similar game but with allot more to it. it removes the pay to win shit! and adds Play to win! masterfull! stay play to win devs! and you will go far!
21311,LAG LIKE HELL!
21312,"Really good game. No RNG, no mulligan. Add more cards."
21313,"Completed the FTP Part of game, got a free pass to try game, Gave it a very fair chance
I am even what many in this genre would consider a whale or at least a hefty buyer, and could have put hundreds into this game (and do to others frequently) if I thought it had a chance to hold a player base and a reasonable way for F2P people to compete

Rating
PVE Solo Player 4/10  Way too short, perhaps an hour, and I never lost a match, too simple, and NO PVE END GAME
PVP 1v1 Noob    8/10, was only placed against p2w tiers above me maby 25% of the time, and the other 75% of the games I won more often then not vs people with my same cards
PVP 1v1 After first 5 wins  1/10  Your only hope is that some other poor soul out there also has not spent money on the game and you both are bashing your heads against the pay to win wall at the same time and get put together for a good game
Draft ~5/10  Have a chance as decks random, but there is another pay wall to join and compete

I have done all the solo quests, I have done pvp enough to get out of first noob bracket
I have completed everything so that there are now 2 things left in the game: 1v1 pvp, and draft

The first 2-3 hours of the game nets you enough free coins to pick up about 10 cards on top the starter 10cards (x3 of each), of which every 5th ""roll"" is garanteed at least ""rare.""  Both my garanteed rare rolls got the same unit, which is essentially useless that I have never used.  Apparently you can have up to 3 of each, and cards only give you one when you get them.  I was fortunate enough to pick up a rare in one of the 8 other rolls, ok.

At this point I have passed the starter deck players like myself, and am into the pay to win crowd.  I have lost around 12 matches in a row, very fun and competitive( Just Kidding), to players with huge swarms of smalls, only flying minion hands, and rushing hands with special abilities from the commander to enter field and join the fight, as well as minions that rush you main guy and kill him in a min flat.   There are at least 2 tiers Above rare, and you are not going to get them without serious cash.  Also, other ""commanders"" or like that above are not possible to obtain without paying real money, or beating an absurd number of pay to win players in pvp to get the rewards to unlock a single other one, other than the starter guy

Ok so, can you take a few hits, level up still and get some more cards to compete? Urm not unless you want to spend... a year at it.  12 matches, netted me like 8 gold per loss, and guess what it takes 1000gold to buy a single roll at a single card.  

To be fair there are a few ""level"" rewards that give you some free common cards, a daily which can get you a roll (if you say can beat the pay to win players in under 3 min... nope) There is also a crafting system, of which apparently you can craft, and you get some free crafting mats enough to make a common card or two from entering the 2nd pvp tier.

Only way I see this game working is if they pull the huge grind down to a reasonable level, and try and make money of cosmetics instead of features.  Unfortunately this will take a lot larger player base than this game has.

Overall Dissapointed, even as a free game"
21314,Great game so far!
21315,"Freee game, good game!"
21316,This game is actually pretty fun... Imagine a PC version of Clash Royale...
21317,Is super game!
21318,nice
21319,really good game.
21320,"This is probably like the PC version of Clash Royale , really engrossing , would have liked even more if the combat was a bit more smooth and distinct but still a game worth buying if it's on a sale . 
A 7/10 for me . 
This game can keep developing as long as the DEVs want with new updates and cards . 
"
21321,"Good game , if free lol"
21322,for the first time I played this game was terrible ! but  with time it looks good opposite of the athor games
21323,"pay to win ✓
rigged price wheel ✓
unbalanced ✓
should be free to play ✓

But it's still fun. The Devs just need to be less greedy. The good ftp games are not ptw and it works."
21324,Betadwarf seems to have mastered the art of repackaging their assets over and over into a different and enjoyable experience every time.  Minion Masters is all the same characters you know and love now getting other people to do most the fighting.  It's my favorite so far.
21325,this game is golden it need some bug fixes but it is still golden
21326,nice game
21327,"so far a very fun game !! 
give it a try!!"
21328,Fun alternative to Clash Royale with out pay to win and very gentle rewards.
21329,Balance issues but overall not bad a concept.
21330,Good game :)
21331,"[u]P2W?[/u]
No, on a scale from 1 to 100 it’s surely below 10 in this regard. Compared to Hearthstone it’s much easier to acquire a good deck – I leveled up to platinum in less than 20 hours of gameplay. I think only collosus card seems a little unfair – at first very unfair, but then you learn to counter it, but then you notice that a limited way of counters can be countered by your opponent, and as the collosus is a legendary card, F2P players obviously won’t be able to affrord it right of the bat. An important thing to note is as you need a lot of time to acquire the collosus, most of users of this card are experienced players, so saying that you’re more likely to lose against collosus is like saying that sports cars are more likely to have an accident – it’s true, but not because sports cars are dangerous (quite the opposite), but because who their statistical user is.

[u]RNG?[/u]
It doesn’t seem like RNG is involved at all. There is no mulligan stage in the game, because your hand always has 4 cards and once you play one, you get another – so you can cycle through cards pretty quickly to get the one you want. Of course every card costs mana, so it’s important that you don’t waste (too much) mana on cycling through your cards. There are situations when all 4 of your cards don't fit a particular situation, which seems like bad luck, but maybe given enough practice you could avoid to get to that situation in the first place?

10/84 = 12% cards have a random effect. Some of these random cards can be used skillfully to avoid randomness, like a lightning bolt card which kills a random minion, will always kill the minion you want if it's the only one on the board (it's good 4 mana counter to 9 mana collosus for example).

[u]Skill[/u]
The game seems to be heavily skill oriented, where the right timing and position of the cards you play matters a lot. However, I noticed I lose to some decks consistently, and win with others consistently, which means there is a kind of rock–paper–scissors issue. Also I feel 10 card deck size limits your options a bit too much.

[u]Community[/u]
There's a chat in game, and people are nice to each other. Well, at least it used to be so, but recently a wave of new players – I heard they're from Alienware promotion – came in, showing that average IQ of people buying Alienware rigs is pretty low. I hope mods will start banning some of these a-holes.

[u]Overall[/u] I r8 8/8, no b8"
21332,It's good
21333,"This game is awesome.

-Great Graphics
-Easy to understand
-No pay to win (everyone saying otherwise just doesn't understand how this game works, legendary cards don't have any advantage and are mostly outplayed when using your brain)
-Hero System is a nice addition
-Different Arena styled for personal preference
-Heroes have fun abilites
-Not to slow and not to fast

Only point that needs to be adressed is the league system, playing against higher players with a 5-6 ranks difference may be hard for new players."
21334,"Really enjoying the game so far, currently it's in a semi-closed beta (it's quite easy to aquire a key) and will be f2p on release; the $20 buys premium for a year and isn't required to play.

It's a tactical game that requires timing and precision, and is just fun to watch in general. It's kind of like a real-time version of Hearthstone in terms of tone, bright and fun but gory.

I see at least one review talking about connection issues, I haven't experienced any issues since I started playing a few days ago."
21335,100/100
21336,Its a nice game.
21337,"Enjoy your new money, guys."
21338,funny
21339,Could be nice game if it would not be so broken disconects every 2 min which makes you lose match. To broken to play
21340,very good Game and Competitive for Online Playing
21341,"You spend more gold on in-game purchase, more powerful cards.

and it takes too much time to get a single new card through ordinary playing.

Also, You have to pay more than 10 bucks (not free now) to play this 
game, ugh... and pay more bucks to buy cards?"
21342,Not Bad Game Goo work
21343,"It's okay.
Nothing great"
21344,lol
21345,Play this game guys!
21346,Its like Clash Royale but with much more minions and you dont just get higher level versions of the same cards. And this has one base instead of three. And other slight differences. Fans of that game should definitely check this out. I am enjoying my time on here.
21347,Please bare in mind that this is a early access game but at the moment the amount of cards available is extremely limited and I think that you would need to be willing to invest a lot of money in order to get the most out of this game.  Very simplistic and repetitive maybe with further development the game could be good but at the moment it is not worth the asking price.
21348,"I like it a lot,very great game but still its not worth 20 euro tho,good thing i got it for free :D"
21349,SO CUTTTEEE
21350,No.
21351,":/ why people waste their money on this bullshit -_-
better play clash royal lolz"

21353,"A very nice game , funny and is good if you are bored."
21354,So addictive and absolutely brilliant. Basically like Clash Royale on steroids. Love it!
21355,"Many ppl comparing it with clash royale, and while it does have similarities with the aforementioned game in its core gameplay it also has many things which CR does not have.  

-Unique Bridge mechanic is very important to maintain temo.
-Different masters with their different attacks and spell upgrades.
-No leveling up a card, which means no grinding 100s of hours and spending 100$ just to level up 1 single card at max level.
-Draft mode which can be compared with the arena mode of different card games.

These are the main differences it has from clash royale. So to people who are saying its a pc rip off of CR, it is NOT.

Online matchmaking is fast and mostly fair, and the amount of cards are also numerous.
This being an early access game, many new features and cards may be added as the development progresses. 

In its current state I rate it   [b]6.5/10[/b]"
21356,stupid game
21357,It's a fun game.
21358,Not bad But Need More Optimize

21363,its literally clash royale but on the computer lol
21364,2 Words - Clash Royale
21365,After logging many more hours I have come to the conclusion that this game is definitely fun. The game provides a interesting turn on a card-based game. I do apologize for the negative review and I hope that this game gets recogniton for being so entertaining.

21378,"In early access, I said:
It is a bit shallow. The sound production isn't very good. And it isn't balanced at all. Too many currencies. Not friendly for beginners.

Now, I do recommend this game. It is good fun. Most of those issues are addressed. I still think there is too many currencies. But there is a lot of depth, good sound, and it feels balanced."
21379,Good.
21380,"Not bad once you get used to game mechanics and tactics. Don't mind other negatives reviewers that are complaining about game being pay2win, you just have to build the right deck and have a stretegy in mind and it's all good. You can farm cards that you want for your pack fairly easy if you just destory the ones you don't need. Give it a try, it's some pretty satisfying 1v1 combat here."
21381,lol
21382,"i like this game so much
"
21383,Good game
21384,"it could be a good game but its not, the new draft mode was where I just couldn't try to like it anymore, it was just lose after lose at a high cost of money, not fun. I guess ths game is not for me"
21385,"Do you like Hearthstone? 
Did you rage when madder bomber hits you 6x in the face instead of that friggin Moroes chilling on the other side?

If the previous questions apply to you, get this game right now. Cut the RNG and up the strategery!"
21386,"[h1]Minion Masters[/h1]
This is a great game that is fun to play and even more fun to compete with mates. Its like the well known game Clash Royale but better. You get to choose from a wide variety of 'minions' and just have at your opponent. Attacks are great and fun to watch and the fact that at the moment the game is not pay to win is fantastic. Im really hoping the game doesnt turn into another pay to win [strike]game[/strike] like most of the other purchases you can make on steam. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone with a pc and anyone with the ability to click a mouse button
Aussie Out!"
21387,Clash Royale clone but still ok game :)
21388,"Cute game but seems like balance would be all over the place and has a high chance of having P2W or grind for a eternity system which I'm sick of.

If you've ever played Castle fight in WC3 then it's that but with unit types needing to be either bought or grinded for who knows how long."
21389,Good Game..
21390,This is a very cool little game. It reminds me of a game of Magic but in a fast paced and realtime format. It is definitely a game to watch. I can't wait to see how intricate the deck system will get.

Thats All I Can Say :D :D"

21396,Nice Game
21397,nice one !!
21398,Been playing for a while now and I gotta say this game is far from P2W. I thought when I first started that gaining access to cards was hard. It isn't and now with the expedition feature I can gain cards in between games. This game is super competitive and very balanced. It deserves a 15/10
21399,"This is a lovely game but feels like a free to play game simular to hearthstone while it does cost money to buy it.

Upsides-
1.)The gameplay is simple but hard to master [b] rewarding good players. (regarding understanding of the mechanics) [/b]
2.)The way the game is played constantly changes because new cards are added and people think of new deck ideas as the master rotation keeps going [b] rewarding smart players. [/b]
3.)Cute art.

Downsides-
1.)Micro transactions
2.)Becomes repetitive after a little bit,encouraging coming back to play the game only when new cards come out or masters rotate

"
21400,Cute game.
21401,Nice game.
21402,"If you like Clash Royale you will like this one. It's nearly the same game, with one difference you have heroes (similar to Hearthstone) here which makes game quite more interesting and fun. 

+Fast paced PVP battles with strategy. Quite a fun in current state. I has potential to be addictive. It also has potential to last very long.

-Nothing or actual graphics look dated a bit (which could be due to fact it is in alpha)

Pay to gain more currency model (neither good nor bad)

I would recommend this game highly."
21403,Fun game!
21404,nice and addictive gameplay.
21405,"Enjoyable Gameplay, need more like this"
21406,"Awesome game for all the Clash Royale fans, it has a very similar gameplay, though I would prefer this game rather than Clash Royale because it is a PC one, improved graphics, much more nice looking characters and the game is actually nice. Though the game is great, I think it is a bit too more expensive."
21407,"I received the game for free. Its seem fun but I have to unlock news troops by winning multiplayers fights and since I keep loosing, progression is very slow ( you can get daily free token too ). I cant recommend it for 1 main reason, dev ( Betadwarf ). I loved more Forced showdown ( made by Betadwarf too ) but server have alot trouble and I never received answers from dev. I cannot imagine Minion master working well since its a MP only focused game. Game itself, I had no problem ( Minion masters ) no crash or bug but my play time is low. Buy at your own risk !"
21408,"Sure a nice game man! Clash Royal, but waaay better :)"
21409,"Fun game, it will be free soon."
21410,"I did not want this game, but i got it in a bundle. If you ever liked card games, magic, yugio, pokemon, or the thousands of others this game is for you. Build a deck, save mana, make smart moves and its action packed. like sid meiers (pirates) addictive but nice and simple. As some one that mainly like FPS, this was a nice enjoyable change. The keep adding game modes and tweaking to perfection."
21411,"Pretty good game! Haven't played it that much yet, but maybe I will expand after more playing.
Nice first impression!"
21412,i got this game for free its like clash roayle on mobile but diffrent at the same time
21413,a good game
21414,Its Good Game Really i love it ^^
21415,Insanely fun with friends (but I have none)
21416,"Very fun game. Simple, yet has some good depth in terms of strategy and tactics. I would highly recommend Minion Masters if you enjoy this type of game (Clash Royale, Castle Wars in WC3, Nexus Wars in SC2 etc.) and want to experience it on PC."

My Thoughts:
From the creators of the incredible 'Forced' series of games comes a much need 'Clash Royale' styled clone exclusive to Steam. I have never seen or played 'Clash Royale' so the best way to describe this is.... A PVP, Tower Defense styled game with Battle Cards.

Game Details:
Enter a world of Minion battles!Summon your Minions and watch them charge blindly toward their opponents, leaving it entirely up to you to decide their course by where you place them.
Minions can claim the bridges and destroy the rival Master. 
Claiming bridges earns you xp and allows you to level up, earning unique perks based on your chosen Master.
You can also use mighty spells to tip the tide of the battle, for example with a well aimed healing fireball (it’s a thing) in the midst of your wounded troops."
21418,Nice game.
21419,It's A Very Good Game.. With Good Graphics And Good Sounds!
21420,Nice game
21421,"Okay, have to update my review of this game again. Its like the 5th time or so. Gameplay is good and fun. I have become addicted to this game. 2 vs 2 adds alot. 
 It would be nice, to get all the cards with one price. If that is added later, that would be great. 
Rush decks have been changed, cards in general are  changed(not nerfed into oblivion like other developer handle such things) regulary.

Lots of problems have been addressed

Overall positive

I left the bad things in my old review that still stand. Deleted the outdated problems.

Old review:
In short:
If this wasn't free to play, it could have been good.
Its extreme slow in getting new cards after the initial phase.
And you need a good pool of cards to stopp different decks.


Problems:
1: Slowness of getting new cards:
1000 Gold per Card. a won match is 8 Gold (with premium upgrade 16 Gold). Losing gives like 4 Gold. O.O
daily quest give you one card. Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.

The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.

Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. 

In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. 
Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.
Why losing a lot of times? See point 2"
21422,2
21423,"Minion Masters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
Masters, are you ready? It’s time to choose your deck of cards. What tactics are you going to use? Would it be a defensive or an offensive strategy? What you really need to know is what your opponent’s plan is! Stop speculating, Master, you are about to enter the area. Good luck and I wish you well to lead our minions to victory, my Master!

Minion Masters is a PVP / multiplayer game where you compete with other players online to move up leagues! 

As a newbie, you will be assigned to the Wood League to start. Each league has five divisions. Each time you are victorious, you will be given experience points which will go towards your ranking and therefore move you up divisions within the league.  In the Wood League, for example, you need to reach 100 points to move up a division. 

You will be given one master as a default, and will have to access two other masters through the free weekly master rotation. 

As soon as you are ready to battle against an online opponent, just press the play online button to enter the arena. It will not take too long for you to find an opponent. The longest I had to wait was around thirty seconds.

Your deck will consist of ten cards. All cards have a number on them. For example, an assassin card has a number four on it. What it means is that you can activate this unit when the mana gauge reaches the number four on its scale. Bear in mind, the highest number on the mana gauge is ten. So if you wait until the gauge reaches ten, you can activate two assassin units (if they are in your deck, of course) and a laser unit, which costs two mana points. 

In terms of the battle map, you have two sides which are connected with two bridges. The trick is to capture and hold the bridges. If you do so, your mana gauge will rise faster than normal. Also, your master can access peaks faster if you hold the bridges. The goal is to destroy your opponent’s power tower where your opponent master stands to win the game. At the end of a game, you will receive experience points for rising within the league, and also levelling up your character. You might receive coins, shards or rubies.

How do you get new units or cards? With tokens! You can purchase tokens with your coins or rubies. Then you can use these token on your power tower to access a random draw; a bit like a roulette wheel. Each card has experience attached to it; it could be a regular, common, rare or supreme card.  The last one has the most experience as a unit.

Every twenty-four hours, you will earn a free token. The only difference is that instead of drawing a card, the draw will have coins, shard or rubies for the taking. Oh, by the way, you need shards and rubies to purchase new masters. 
Graphically, Minion Masters is well done and very easy to understand and get into. The most important point is that you don’t have to wait too long to play a game online. However, I think we need more Masters and map designs.

Positives:
~~~~~~~  
-	Great graphics
-	Good selection of cards
-	Fun, addictive gameplay
-	Easy to access a game online
-	Achievements and trading cards
Negatives:
~~~~~~~~ 
-	I would like to see more masters to choose from
-	It would be nice to have different maps

Minion Masters is seriously fun to play and is extremely addictive!

21425,"it's the same type of game like Clash Royale, but I would prefer Clash Royale since it's free on Apple Store and also better imo"
21426,"Its really fun.Start countering your counter,spawning minions,throwing spells and having lots of fun.Become a minion master and join the comunity!Its similar to Dota 2 or Clash Royale but much better.Its worth lots more then 20$."

21429,"1vs1 combat this game is great, all you need is to use your cards and their power wisely than your enemy and you can win easy, but this feels pay to win game sometimes in starting unless you give sometime to play this game and use everything you get as reward very wisely, make a good deck and nice combination gives an easy victory.
I completely fell in love with this game and kept playing to rise higher in ranked battles, tried many different combinations, with different playstyle and masters and found a good enough deck to defeat many of other players easily.

Watch some gameplay here:>>>   https://youtu.be/tITUuk1O7Is"
21430,"OK so this is my 3rd time editing the review, this time changing the negative review to positive.
In my last review I mentioned that the game has a great future and is a great concept but it was very unbalanced and needed some fixing instead of upgrading particle effects and stuff.
And the developers fixed it, the game got much much better, they added new modes which solves the main problem of tryhards they got more generous to the players and let them get hardly obtainable items easily obtainble and so on. 
But obviously there still are problems which they're working on, the developers are doing pretty good I'll be honest The problems are: the player base if you and your friend are searching at the same time you could even meet them but they're doing a lot of giveaways to  get a legit playerbase, also supporting twitch streamers to promote the game and so on. Also another problem is deck building, it's really hard to build a stable deck, over updates a lot of cards get nerfed and buffed, you need to be able to stand everything: giant 1 unit cards, hordes, flying units, long ranged units, etc.
The game does have a high price for what it is but it's practically free, you can really easily get it from a giveaway and there's always at least one Minion Masters giveaway at a time.
 So I suggest giving the game a go, if you're into strategy and planning and stuff, it's really fun and competitive, it's free after all and it's really fun with friends and they're gonna release 2v2 any time soon so it'll be great to play with friends."
21431,I'm all up for moneygrabs like these: SHIZION ÑASTERS is the game you need to turn your PC into a 2nd-spec crappy Samsung Galaxy with Android and its Play Store.
21432,"Once you get past the initial bracket (to which you can never return), you will find the meta is two Masters and three decks between them.  The game is fun, as long as you play any of those in-meta decks, but if you set even a toe outside of the meta, you will find a massive drop off in playability.

It was pretty engaging for a couple days, though."
21433,"Game is great, Not worth the 20$ though.
EDIT : Game is great, And worth the 5$."

21442,"For what it is, minion masters is great.

As per the early access description, the price tag is a buy in for the beta, at release it will be F2p. That said, complaints about a paid game with F2P aspects are not founded.

As a F2P title it is what it is, the model is similar to hearthstones, you can play the game to gamble for better cards, or you can pay money to gamble for better cards.

At the end of the day I think Minion Masters exceeds in the ""send waves of dudes at my enemies castle"" genre in ways that others in the genre don't. It looks great, controls with precision, and is not plagued by obscurities."
21443,"First of, I barely played this game and have 0 intention of ever playing it.

But, unlike any other Steam game where you can choose to ignore it forever, this mass-advertised garbage keeps sending discount cards on your inventory at such an constant rate that it just makes me hate it more and more.

So developers, can you please just fuck off? I don't wanna play this, stop trashing my inventory."
21444,<3
21445,"got this game FREE from alienware lounge giveaway, thought id give it a go..... turns out this game is actually really fun

9/10

could do with more heroes and maybe skins that you can earn, but early access so im sure they will add this at some point"
21446,"Nice game, reminds me of a certain custom game in SC2. (Card wars.) Well worth checking out. Simple, yet tactical."
21447,Since I played closed Beta they actually made positive balance changes. Overall pretty fun. But very hard once you get in higher ranks.
21448,"A shockingly fun game. I got this from a friend who had an extra copy. Both of us thought it would a cheesey little game we would forget existed. I was wrong. Quick ques and the games are short and refreshing. Losing doesn't feel bad at all. Even gaining new cards is fun in how it is presented.

Recommend. Spam minions at peoples. Win. Repeat."
21449,Good Game! :)
21450,"After giving this game a serious go for a day or so I have to say it's much more than I thought it was from first impressions. I thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Clash Royale but the aspect of fighting the same mobs as yours except the other's is a higher level because they paid more killed the game for me. Likewise, being unable to obtain a minion or spell easily is frustrating in this game.

The game itself is extremely fun and I could see myself losing many hours to it, it has a unique aesthetic with some well designed characters, certain interractions on the field are entertaining to see, the only real problem with the core game assets right now I believe is the sound design.

However I do think the current reward system is far too harsh against F2P players. In general I think prices of champions/spins should be reduced across the board. I can't see how I would ever earn enough through F2P alone to purchase any other champions and you would need to win so many games to earn a ""spin"" for a new card.

This has a lot of potential but in it's current state it feels as if Beta Dwarf are money-grubbing. I'm not against the system they have in place I just feel it needs a bit of a price to reward rebalance, I really hope that comes in the future because it would be nice to see this game succeed."
21451,Nice game!
21452,"This game is so cool,i just get it from a friend,beacuse,him seen this game and he alerdy know this game wil work to me 100% and this game is fun,he gifted it to me and i played it.This game is totaly good for playing with friends or to have a litle bit fun in 10 min.
Note:5/5 stars"
21453,"Nothing revolutionary, the way the cash shop appears in this state is that it is ""Pay to Win"" in the same sense that Hearthstone or other card style games are, in the sense that you can get all the same benefits, but you can get them with significatnly less frustration and time by paying.

wouldn't have paid for it, nor would I suggest paying for it at this phase. if you get the oppurtunity tog et it for free, it's worth a few plays at least, I think it would be much more suited as a mobile game rather than a desktop game."
21454,"This was a negative review, early in 2017. Specifically in late January. It's now late December, and I can confidently say I now recommend this game. A lot of my gripes have been solved over time. The 2v2 format is fantastic and reduces the effectiveness of gimmicks due to having twice as many countering tools available. The Expeditions system is fun enough, though sometimes it feels like just a process I have to go through to get what I want. I haven't tried Draft, admittedly. I intend to, sometime, though. The game's solid and I'm glad that I did return to it to see the changes it underwent.

I can confidently recommend this game at store price. It's worth your time.

Here is the old review, for historical purposes:

I admit, I was pretty excited for Minion Masters. I liked Forced quite a lot, and I was excited to see what sort of spin they would take on card games.

While the premise is good, with playing your cards and having them fight without your direct control. In fact, it's very fun to play with friends. We enjoyed messing around with stupid, gimmicky decks.

But that's not the meat of the game. You can't earn more cards by playing against friends; friendly matches reward no currency or even complete daily quests. You have to go into online play for that. Online play is ONLY ranked at the moment. There's no casual mode. There's no draft mode. Nothing. You just get to dive straight into ranked where your losses are punished.

There's no rank lock points. If you make it into silver and then lose a few games, you slide back into Bronze. And because there's no casual mode available, your only way to experiment with new deck ideas is to sacrifice your rank for it.

And in any ranked mode, people will try their hardest. It's only natural. The issue is that in most card games, the path to victory is the path to frustration for your opponent. The effective cards in Minion Masters simply aren't fun to play against. If they have Demon Warrior and you can't end the game immediately, they'll just snowball out of control and you'll end up losing to something you have no way to counter. Some of the aggressive decks demand that you have an immediate response in your opening hand or you lose instantly. I lost a match in 35 seconds to a swarm-based rush with a damage buff, and there was nothing I could do because I didn't have daggerfall in hand. The Rammer is a card that just runs at break-neck speed for your hero and begins chunking, with very little response available.

Ah, but you say, counters exist! You can play daggerfall against the swarms, and lightning bolt against the Demon Warrior, and Wall against the Rammer. But the deck is only 10 cards, and you only have 4 in hand. You can't have a counter to everything in your deck (or rather if you do, you have no way to win), and even with what counters you do bring in you can't guarantee having them on hand if they're needed for multiple purposes.

It's not that the game's imbalanced; while I think the balance is a bit off and could use tuning, that's what an early access is for. The issue is that the game is just frustrating. Your losses feel devastating and your wins feel more hollow than not.

If they want this game to work and feel good, they need to severely trim away some of the frustrating cards. When you're playing with the various basic and common cards like dragon whelps, grenadiers, scrat packs, crossbow guilds, the game is very fun. But the game is dominated by frustrating gimmicks instead of making valuable trades and back-and-forth fights for bridge control.

The game has potential, but for now I have to say that you should give it a pass. If you get it for free, I'd suggest you play through the solo challenges available and then never touch online play--the frustration isn't worth your time."
21455,"Doesn't even run. Black screen with early access text, nothing else."
21456,"0 Wins / 37 Losses

With only about 50 cards to show and people already theory-crafting at the very bottom of the ladder, the game quickly becomes stale as matches are pretty regularly one-sided and based on your opening hand of four cards. It's still in early access, but the game's community and style are already set in stone. Counter, counter-counter, etc. is fun for a few hours, but with such limited options the ""winning formula"" has already been found and shuts out everything else.

The game suffers from a SERIOUS snow-balling effect, and given the ""counter this! Counter that!"" style that they're going for in the advertisements, it suffers badly in favor of whoever got the best opening hand.

Avoid it for now, maybe they'll rebalance a few things before its full release."
21457,"Absolutely gripping, quick tactic game that fits to my tastes. Minion Masters is like a fresh experience for me. Different from MOBA games that are flooding the market of video games. Matches last less than 10 minuts which is amazing if you are sick of long time stifing. Game might not look so but it is certainly expanded so you should not be dissappointed.
Is it worth 20 euro? No. Not in this form. I would instantly buy it if it would be cheaper than 10 euro. Dunno if it's going to be F2P or not, but i hope so ;)
If you have opportunity to try this position, you should definitelly do it!"
21458,"A flashier version of the same game you can get on a smart phone. And just as flooded with over powered paid players. This is why I will never get into one of these games, because it's just not worth it. And I don't have $200 to spend of digital cards. Screw that noise."
21459,"My original review from January 2017 I recommended this game quite heavily.

Unfortunately I can no longer do this, as it grew more and more F2P-unfriendly and incredibly bug-ridden over the last few updates, to the degree that it is barely playable, getting booted from matches and forced to reconnect at least once per hour - of course this is my experience, for other players it might be better/worse, but I can only use what is my own experience.

The breaking point for me was that they decided that the new master - an integral part of gameplay - is only available via the premium battle pass.

Greed took down another good CCG.

UPDATE: It just got worse as they heavily cut the amount of rubies you can get without spending money by removing them as a login bonus as well as reducing the amount of rubies you get from ranking up to a measily 100 total per queue - and you only get those when you play until you reach the second highest rank in the game."
21460,"Although I admire the effort that went into the development of the game; it does look incredibly polished! 
It looks and plays like the sort of game that would lend its self more to a mobile device than PC.
This game is not for me.
"
21461,havent played it much but seems that it has some potencial
21462,"Mine is a mixed review because the game is kinda unfair. some guys get great cards right from start meanwhile im stuck with cards that doesnt stand a chance against 70 procent of the guys i meet. should be more balanced, some cards are to op."
21463,this game is shit
21464,"Clash royale sucks
i liek dis more"
21465,"I was very interested in this game, seemed to have alot of potential. But after a few days of playing I've noticed it has become  quite alot harder to level up if you do not use some of the premium currency. I havent been able to level up at all because all my opponents have better cards as they most likely have the premium addon leaving it a little unbalanced for the rest of us. Has great potential just feel like it is trying to make it so you have to pay to play."
21466,great game
21467,Very much like Clash Royale but with better graphics
21468,"This game is very cool
try it its very good gamme"
21469,"[h1]Kewl game[/h1]
Well I love this kind of games, whatever this is... It relaxes my brain and makes me just play without any stress. Awesome game.. Not worth 20$ tho.."
21470,"lag ccd
"
21471,"It's like the famous mobile game ""Clash Royale"" but in a (very early) alpha stage. My 2 cons about this game are: the very bad optimization it has, it has to improve it and the content, this is normal because of the stage it's on so I hope it improves on this and online ranking, clans, prizes, rewards, awards, achievements, etc. Nice to see this type of games on the PC, let's hope it will be good.

Score: 5/10 (early access)"
21472,"Terribly boring game.

Very simple and not worth spending any money on."
21473,nice games
21474,"if you are annoyed by hearthstone's slow pace and waiting for opponents to finish their turn, this game is for you. I dont play moba or card games but surprisingly I am becoming addicted to this game."
21475,"FALSE ADVERTISING, THERE WERE NO MINIONS FROM THE MOVIE DESPICABLE ME, HOW DARE YOU USE THERE FAME FOR MONEY"
21476,Love it! Lots of great strategies and synergies with cards keeps you on your toes!
21477,Good Games
21478,This game reminds me CLASH ROYALE... i love it!

21480,"Spend alittle real money, make ppl rage with emoji. Good times."
21481,This game is really good. It's kinda tower defence and it has small moba elements mixed with heartstone.
21482,"RIP-OFF of Clash Royale.
Costs more than CSGO and costs as much as Rust, useless game unless you're wealthy."
21483,"https://youtu.be/zs9nQVnLjLw

It's a simple to pick up and get addicted game that could have a vast amount of strategy. Imagine Hearthstone plopped on its side, give the cards 3D models and basic AI, and you've got an idea of what Minion Masters is."

Coins - They are used to buy spins on a roulette wheel

Shards - Used to buy cards or champions

I uses to played and reach Sliver rank 1 and now i dropped back like hell.

UNBALANCE.

Thanks to dumb ass supreme cards. 

TOO BORING TO GET REKT BY MANY PLAYERS WITH SAME DECKS! Send air rush, rammer and etc.

serious? Did you build your own deck or you actually copy from youtube?

btw many supreme cards suck excpect some card are good but over all.

I don't think this game will become serious gaming in our world. 

I don't see rewarding points or community or etc. a least it better than Royal Clash."

21501,"Had low expectations when entering the game but left extremely satisfied, would highly recommend."
21502,"This game is a giant fucking mess and they actually expect you to pay money to buy this and then pay to win in order to continue playing.
Fuck this shit.

You honestly expected that giving people buildings and RNG-based card draws with very little or zero defenses in any deck would be good? Do you know what happens in clash royale when players cant defend a push? They lose.
This is like not being able to defend yourself while they continue pouring more and more garbage into your lane that you can't deal with, on top of what you already cant deal with. The cards too entirely too much damage, with very little drawbacks or ways to deal with it. The 'counter this with this' doesn't work when cards shoot half the map and  one shot each other en masse. 
There is no reason to play this.
Don't."

21510,great time killer and also fun to play !
21511,Reminds me of Clash Royale. A lot of microtransaction.
21512,fun game guys
21513,"What Can i Say... XD its a Fun and addictive game
although.. tbh.. its kinda pay2win :("
21514,"I REALLY enjoy this game.  However, why are you trying to squeeze me for every penny when I ALREADY BOUGHT your game?  I just don't understand developers who lure you in with a decent price for a new game and BAM right hook to the face, pay us more money to unlock the FULL game.  #ModernDayMafia

*UPDATE*
Put a few more hours into the game.

Good money for each game completed, however is it "" several thousand gold PER DAY.""  No, not unless you're a low level getting prizes for each level unlocked and/or spending hours on this.  It's 1000G for 1 spin of the wheel which also has duplicates of cards you already have unlocked.  Depending on the day you can end up getting quite a few duplicates.  Let's not forget to mention Rubies and Shards, yes they give you quite a substantial amount on loadup.  There's also going to be new masters, cards, maps, etc.  WHICH cost rubies.  Goodluck buying those without dropping more cash.  AND no you can't afford all the Arena Maps and Masters from start.  Once again........#ModernDayMafia


*Caution - Kids have found Reddit deck building guilds and are in full force."
21515,"Good fun, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing......."
21516,"Cool mechanics, cool heroes, cool cards BUT:

- waaaaaaaaay too many duplicates in chests (i opened like 30 chests with my hard earned gold, 10 of which were shitty duplicates, all while missing more than half of the collection),
- not F2P friendly (while legendaries don't win games on their own once you know the cards they definitely give you an edge over an equally skillful opponent - ghost, troubadur, serpent, just to name a few-,
- the disenchant / craft values are awful as expected (almost as bad as in Hearthstone)

I like the game but it feels like yet another grindfest...still recommended if you're willing to pour some money into the game.

6/10 as F2P, 8,5/10 as a paying customer."
21517,"Free to play gimmicks everywhere! Let me quit when I want to quit. Don't put the coins in a separate area than the cards on the off chance that I might buy more. Some characters are better than others and you guessed it, you have to buy them..."
21518,"was a good game before it turned to a shitfest, cards randomly disappearing after updates"
21519,Great game!
21520,"It's fun for a bit. The single player challenges against the AI are fun, but the game is horribly unbalanced. The cost for a single spin to get a new card (1 random card) is 1,000 gold. Each match you get about 20-30 gold. So it quickly become a grind for new cards (with average match length it's about 2.5 hours to get a card). Online play is not really diverse and everyone is using the same cards and the same strategies. It is apparent that this game is heavy focused on pay-to-play crowds and if you are playing F2P you are going to not succeed in playing online or against the AI. It's a fun game for a bit, but honestly you might be better off either waiting to see if the game develops more or playing something else. This game isnt even worth installing."
21521,What clash royale should have been
21522,I like it... well i got it for free
21523,Bad game. Gamers assemble. Lets fight shit games like this one.
21524,"Looks like a phone game ported to PC. This game need a fast forward option, the action happens to slow & i have no patience for it. Looks good & fun but need lot of improvements.
After played like 20+ matches online i can say that matchmaking is terrible, i won just 3 of those matches while getting my base nuked by pro players vs. newcomers, so league thing sux.
Also, since is on Steam every game should have Steam achievements, no idea how i missed that to see... maybe in the future... and 2020 is here & game improved + achievements are here too."
21525,"Its good game, i recomend it. It has unique design and it is interesting. The cons are the bad balance and lack of animations."
21526,"This game is made by an orgy of other games , king's bounty , League Of Legends and Hearthstone ,so this is a good game orgy the game is good so play if you have 20 $ :3"
21527,"I really don't know why there are microtransactions in a game that is 20$
If this was a free to play game I wouldn't mind it but come on
Oh well I got it for free so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
21528,"I got this game for free without expecting anything about it, for my surprise I already have more than 400hours on it
the game is pretty fun, easy to play hard to master making it great for both casual and harcore players.
Battles are fun, fair and almost bug-free, with many different cards, a nice reward system to get even the rarest ones of them without paying, a global ranking, weekly updates, some events, everything you want.
If you like this new clash royale style strategy-genre  you must get this game."
21529,"I've only played about an hour of this game but it is amazing. It is graphically astounding and very addictive gameplay wise. I recommend this game to anyone that likes little things to pass the time, or anyone that likes MOBA's. This game is basically a multiplayer tower defense where you strategically play different cards that summon minions to stop the opponents minions from reaching your tower."
21530,"So this is basically Titan Brawl (Andoid and iOS) on Steam, everything particularly similar, especially the 'pay 2 win' session

At least this is fun"
21531,"Feels very poorly balanced, not very noob friendly. Certainly not worth $20"
21532,"One of the best strategy-card games I've played in years. Sure it needs balancing, but it es early access, so it's fine."
21533,"unbalanced and even tho you pay 20€ the game it's still pay to win, i'v met wooden 5 players (lowest category) who beat the shit out of me within 2 minutes, tho i got this game for free so i guess its worth it but if i would have to buy it i'd throw it in the trash and never look back"
21534,"Essentially just a clash royale rip off. Is it good? If it were an early access mobile game and you have money to waste, sure its good however if you don't want to waste money or play a pc mobile game, no its not good."
21535,"Minion Masters - Forced to Duel 
-> more like ""Forced to Pay""

The good:
- very nice and polished look
- cool units

The bad:
- unbalanced
- tries too hard to be different
- some bad mechanics
- greedy pay model
- huge grind

I wish they would have stuck to the good old card game formula we all know with this one. The polished look is something I find missing in most other card games out there and I would be so hooked on this if it was just like any other card game - turn based and without a battlefield that units move around on.

However they tried too hard to make something different. Nothing feels natural, the slowly regenerating mana bar, the two bridge set up that allows whoever holds them to gain abilities for their hero unit, the placing of units on the battlefield. It feels like a bunch of different mechanics thrown together without them really fitting together. 

My biggest gripe with the game is how hectic is and that you can't control your units. The unit ai is pretty dumb, often you will see your units stuck on an enemy they hardly deal damage to while another enemy they could have easily defeated picks them off one by one. The developer says this is a game mechanic that the players need to learn but to me it was nothing but frustrating and didn't add anything to the strategic layer of the game. Talk about strategic, I think the developer tried to make it count where and when you place your minions and to a degree it works but the game is just too hectic and the battle fields are too small for this to really work. For example your units can be attacked by the enemy while they are still spawning, so you are forced to think about where to place your minions. The problem is that the battlefield is just way to small for this, which makes enemy minions reach your hero too fast and gives you too little room and time to properly do attack routes for your minions. 

And don't get me started on the pay model. It's insanely greedy. You earn between 5 and 30 gold pieces per match depending on if you win or not. It takes 1000 gold to roll for another card. You will often roll a card you already got multiple times. There are several currencies, shards, gold, candies... experienced f2p game players will know this is all to make you pay for the game. I think we all know these kind of ""free to play"" games by now that are addicting but only enjoyable if you pay. I don't think I really need to explain this further, it's not f2p done right.

Over all I can't recommend this game. The developer tries to bring in new strategic layers to the existing card game formula but at the same time takes away on the strategy part by not giving you control over your units and basically turning the game into a hectic clickfest that is normally decided by how lucky your card draw is."
21536,Сравнительно недорогой и красивый значок!
21537,"""(...) Minion Masters will be Free to play in the future."" Scroll up and read the ""About Pricing"" section.

I've played this game a lot the past few weeks, and i love it! At first the balance were truly a bit off, but the next update showed that the designers has their finger on the pulse. The game is fresh, short, tactical, engaging and fun. That said it's not for anyone. If you don't like deck building or card games, this might not be for you.

The battles feel fresh, even after 100+ hours of play, and every update shake things up just enough to make space for a lot of interesting choice. It might take some games to get into the game and ""learn the rules"" for this is a digital board game, no doubt about it. So take the time, explore the game and learn the rules, it might be well worth it.

Last i want to say that grinding new cards can take a lot of time. Even with the new wild card implemented, which allow duplicate cards in deck building. So be prepared for some grinding or micro transactions if you want to buy packs instead of grinding them."
21538,"I keep trying to go back and play it, but it's just not very good. There's a lot of balance issues... I'll let the bugs slide since it's still early access, but there's a couple game breaking bugs (that I've encountered myself). 

The game's progression is standard f2p trash. It's slightly improved over Clash Royale, but still involves rolling the dice in hopes of getting the cards that are actually worth using (there's a lot of completely useless cards). 

The heroes need rebalancing as well. There's a clear gap between the good heroes and the bad ones."

Negative comments
Developers, please consider this:

- ""You lost because you used unowned cards"" 
I've lost so many times because of this, not even understanding why 
(Suggestion: Don't allow the player to search for a match if the deck is not ready)

- Loosing XP 
When you win, you get (let's say) 80XP but when you lose you lose the same ammount of XP.
And as I said I've lost so many times because I didn't know how to prepare the cards.

- The crafting was a difficult part for me, I quite still don't understand the thing, newbies like me need more tutorials and explanations :D

Anyway I recommend this game and I am looking forward to see some upgrades and changes"
21547,Its so unstable its mind boggling. wait until these stability issues get fixed.
21548,"I like this game so far. It's a fresh look on a classic board-based card game. Without turns, which is great! The gameplay is so damn intense, you are fighting new people every 5 minutes, so it's really hard to get bored with. Althought, I would like to share with you some of propositions, that can make the game even better!
1. I know that you are constantly working on this, but! New cards and masters! They are a BASE of your game, so you should mainly focus on this topic.
2. More cards in deck! 10 cards per deck isn't bad, especially if you are having in mind poor amount of cards (FOR NOW!). But I really think that you should raise the limit up to 15. You know, anytime I'm trying to think of a new deck, I am always hesitating, which one should I choose, to make my deck perfect. And I am always left with feeling, that even one more card per deck, could make it PERRRRFECT. But unfortunately-I can't add it XD.
3. Add new game type, in which you can just play ""for fun"", without care about your rank. I know that there are players, that are getting upset about being forced to play, while having their rank at stake. Some of us actually want to play without tryharding, and sometimes we want to test some fun decks. And it's really pain in the a*s, that some of us are losing rank, even though they don't want to.
Well, that's all I can think for now. I would be honored, if someone of your team would contact me, in order to help getting balance in-game, or some new things. I am creative as f**k, and I really would love to help you making this game the best one out there. It has potential, that I really don't want to be wasted. Keep up the good work!"
21549,"If you liked hearthstone you will like this one too. I thought it will be bad but actually its a really good game, im keep upgrading my deck and cant stop playing :D"
21550,Pretty nice and entertaining for a f2p the only thing i dislike is not having spectator mode to see my friends while they battle and the prices of the heroes they're way too expensive for a non premium player... Other than that really fun game even better than clash royale in my opinion
21551,"Pro:
Reminds me of old Castle Fight map for Warcraft III
Mixed with board game hearthstone..
Fun
Gore
Graphics
Steam inhouse streaming on touch-devices work perfectly

Con:
[strike]Only 1vs1[/strike]
Limited card number available for now
Shopsystem where you nearly get to 2000 shards you need for realy strong cards, scrap cards for around 25 shards takes forever.
Premium DLC for 20 Bucks.
Season Pass DLC also charged for.
small playground since some update.

So for some hours of funny castle bashing or getting pwnd under 2mins it's quite joyfull allready, if you dont mind that the grind is real it realy starts to get competetive after you reach silver league.
[strike]Also if the developers decide to increase the board a bit and create some gamemode with more players this could be realy funny for long term expierence.[/strike]

The developers meanwhile added a 2v2 gamemode which is pretty awesome, and a adventure gamemode where you have some boardgame type of game and participate against bots which is not my thingy but I guess there are people who like playing against bots solostyle but stuff like shrinkening the playground in all games and adding premium system, seasson pass that you have to rebuy pretty fast is not my thingy.. 
Game still makes fun, but DLC systems make me sick and the reduced size is kind of a slap in the face to pc. 
Also I read some people have problems with ranking duo to all people start from silver every season again they often face to hard enemies inside their quees (can just tell yes we start from 5, but not sure if people get frustrated when we win in 1:37min)
Another thingy is you cant copy over a deck you already created which is kinda sad since you have so many deck slots and often just want to exchange like 3 cards but dont want to forget what your old deck was like it's kind of an issue..

Still if you are not going to buy the dlcs and have some time grinding, you can make pretty op builds from quite basic cards which is still funny after so many hours, so buying the game is still worth it tho. 

Also I bareley meet an early access witch is this smooth which is great."
21552,nice game
21553,good
21554,I got this game for free and its fun!
21555,wowww really gg!!!
21556,BORING AS FUCK
21557,"good game, great graphics but is boring after awhile and is too  expensive"
21558,"I gave this game a second chance recently after the 2v2 update and I have to say that it is much better! Notably, card balance feels improved, daily quests allows F2P players a chance at new cards, and the new 2v2 game mode adds some much needed variety.

The quick matchmaking as well as the short games makes this a great game to just play casually."
21559,gay game but good tho
21560,Nice
21561,Great Card / Strategy game !
21562,Pay to win trash. Got it in a Humble bundle and I regret them adding it in to clutter my library.
21563,"Game is designed around the 'hard counter' fetish. There's several layers of how units interact where something can be 'trumped' by several other units for different reasons, which *sounds* cool, except, when you build your deck and try to play a strategy, the swingyness of the luck overrides any decisions you make. Say you have a solid 3-minion combo that can be effective against anything--whether you get all those cards together at the right moment is luck of the draw. Placement makes another level of what seems like it should be skill, but in practice, just makes any internet interruption potentially defeat what you wanted to do. Thought you placed your units in the right spot at the right time? Nope. You had an internet hiccup, and your units appeared a fraction of a second later on the other guy's comp, and now your hard counter is dead before it gets to act.

It's not fun to explore the deck building process. It doesn't feel like there's a plan you can pursue that has its own integrity. When I play a good CCG, or a Starcraft Tug of War map, I like the feeling that I can see the way the early, mid, and late game play out, and how I have to balance snowballing against an early advantage.

I've watched people take me apart, and I've done that back to some people. But it feels like this is about who can counter, first. It tends to make for games where you sit and stare at each other for the first 20+ seconds of the game. Maybe if you *had* to pick an opening play or there was some kind of unit that was continuously spawning--that you got to pick, then it would be less a matter of figuring out how to drill down on the rock paper scissors and play that straight up. 

There's reactive spells, but they mostly have delays which seems like a poorly considered antidote to the issues with lag. Somehow, the minion playing seems very time intensive, but the spell casting which should bridge that gap ends up showing up so late that it's far less attractive. There are many spells and minion effects which are random, which means it can unfairly win you or lose you the game.

Minion AI seems like hit or miss. Deck building seems to get me nowhere. I guess there's a 'right answer' that I'm not aware of."
21564,"You don't always get ranked with people of the same rank which seriously sucks. Great disadvantage for noobs. Nice graphics and a fun game to play the first hour or two, but not worth the price in my opinion especially when it's ptw."
21565,The only thing you don't have to pay here is to unninstall.
21566,"PAY TO WIN ! Buy cards get them and always win, there is plenty of sick pay to win nerds, if u not one of them skip this poop!"
21567,íts a bit like clash of clans but without pay to win. its funny and im addicted
21568,"EDITORS NOTE: This Review was oringally posted in janurary of 2016. The Review reflects the game and prices at this time and does not cover the 2v2 mode or any changes since that time. Since the time I wrote this review the price has also dropped, 

Okay. So I played a fair amount must have done over 100 games and I feel I'm ready to write a review. So the game is pretty well designed it looks good and has been themed well each of the 'hero' units look pretty awesome. The issue comes from the route wheel.

To explain; The game has 3 currencies. 

Coins - They are used to buy spins on a roulette wheel

Shards - Used to buy cards or champions

Candy(premium currency) - used to buy champions and arena skins. 


Obviously having Free to play elements isn't a bad thing if the game is balanced in such a way that doesn't punish players for not paying out but this game isn't balanced that way. 


Coin System Explained

to spin once on the wheel you need 1000 coins. Per a match you're looking at between 20-30 coins (each match lasts about 3 and a half minutes on average in my experience and getting into game about 1 minute. To make the maths easy Im rounding to 5m / match.


Okay so here is the break down 1000 coins is about 28 games. 28*5 is 140 or about 2 hours 20 minutes. Now this would be an acceptable amount of time to wait, for a 100% new card but; The game wheel has old cards. old cards give you 25 shards. and they also have shard squares (0-2) that give 50 shards. 


Shards system and buying cards Explained

You can buy cards with shards. They have various prices but most cards that are good are 125+ with the extremely good ones being 2000. Given that you get 0 - 50 shards per a spin. lets just average it to 30 as the 25 shards in my experience are more likely than a new card or a shard. so you're gonna need 5 spins to get a decent new card at 125 cost and if you want 2000 cost cards you're in for a huge grind



Candy system explained

Candy is the premium currency of the game costing real world money; 

325 Candy costs $2, 

750 candy costs $4, 

1650 costs $7 

3350 costs $14

This candy can be used for 2 things one of them is buying spins which cost 160 candy for 2 spins or 725 candy for 10 spins.

The other thing is unlocking new hero units. there are 6 in the game and they can also be purchased for shards.

To put this in perspective. you can pay $4 to gain what is equal to 23 hours of play time. So it's a Pay to win game rather than a pay for a slight boon. This is unacceptable as it gives a huge advantage to the people willing to put in just a few dollars. think about this. You have 2 people. one has $14 one who doesn't the one who does gets 3350 candy and spins it all giving them 44 spins or about 4 days worth of game time over the other user. Despite these two users getting the game at the same time the user not paying the small money is at a large dis advantage.



Gameplay

Going onto the game play its self. Its pretty fun. It's like a more tactical version of hearthstone or other card based games.  While those games are slower the tactical nuance of this game is in the timing. choosing when to play or wait to get more mana. This leads to experimental deck play where you build to counter certain styles of play. such as swarm users being countered by area attackers. flyers being shot by range ECT. This is a good and fun core gameplay concept 



Over all Balance

This is why it disappoints me that overall the game is poorly balanced. There are certain cards that are just much stronger than other cards. there is a huge guy called colossus. big and slow attackers. This type of card is normally countered by a swarm style card as it attacks slowly But unlike most big slow attacks with massive damage but slow attacks. this guy hits in a frontal cone.  this means that the swarm is dispersed in one shot. Is there counter play? Yes. There are 3 ways to counter this big guy. the first is to CC them with a stunner and the game provides you with a base stunner... but the base stunners have Very low hp and there is multiple ways to kill them to free up the big guy again. from area ranged attacks coming up behind to get rid of the melee to flyers doing the same. the spell fireball or beam of doom or even having the archer as your hero unit (as his shots target the closest thing and getting rid of the big guy takes a lot of focus) and you can even send healers behind to keep the big guy healthy. 

So I said there was 3 ways. the other is a ranged flyer attacker, this gets rid of the area stopping them as that's normally ground based (with 1 exception) but the other ways stop it.

This brings us to our second over powered card Ghost. 

Ghost costs 3 points and takes control of an enemy unit. given this guy costs 9 there is a low chance of having guys instantly behind him so... you use ghost and boom the titan is now your titan.


Ghost is another over powered card. it takes control of enemy units and costs 4. This wouldn't be so bad but one of the 6 hero units in the game summons as his 1st and 3rd ability big units. and yes even though they only get one and its meant to be this guys primary power. for a 4 cost you can turn him boss unit against your foes.


Both ghost and colossus cost 2000 shards to buy so, though I make it sound simple; put these cards in your deck) unless your either lucky or have spent money on it. this is a very card process to do.



Now there is a reward system along side just playing. which is given upon reaching a certain rank and leveling up  which gives a fair boon towards gaining a spin (as normally it does give 1000) and combined with the steam buy price the leveling up candy can help you unlock every champion to try different play styles.  these systems are good but they do not offset the great power of buying. as I continued playing I found a lot of cards was stronger than the others to the point of you should just have them. there are other cards I haven't mentioned by name that are just generally strong.


Overall I would rate this game a 3/10 It has a good Strong core concept that is a pretty fun to play experience by the fee to pay elements and the pay to win experience within the game tilt the game to the point where it feels less like skill and more like being lucky. If you're looking for a cute quirky card game I recommend waiting till this game goes full free to play where then you might be able to get some enjoyment out of it. but in its current state I cannot recommend this game to anyone who isn't willing to put extraordinary amounts of time into a game or spend more than the asking price to get artificially boosted to the point they can match players."
21569,Really fun nothing much to say.
21570,"Minion Masters is a game that I recommend because:
- it is a method to banish boredom
- it has an acceptable price
- it has strategy
- it has multiplayer mode
- is is indie
- it has trading cards

Enjoy!"
21571,i think it's nice
21572,"The gameplay is very similar to Clash Royale if you've played that with a few key differences and no pay-to-win, the daily challenges are relatively easy and can earn you up to 5000 gold which is enough to buy 5-6 packs a day if you play regularly. So it's pretty easy to get the cards you want and some of them have some really interesting effects.

On top of that the masters all vary dramatically in everything from perks to passives and auto-attacks. For example one is unable to hit flying enemies but deals AOE ground damage while another deals constant damage to every enemy on his side of the field. However they're a bit more difficult to obtain freely. Only obtainable with either paid currency or a large amount of shards (earned from excess cards) you'll probably be sticking to the weekly free rotation roster for a while unless you buy premium.

In summary it's a really fun game that you can easily waste time having fun with. My biggest suggestion at this point would be the addition of a replayable singleplayer mode. There seems to be a ""Queuemaster"" that you can fight but only if you've got long predicted queue times. Being able to fight him whenever you want would be a really great relaxing game mode for testing out cards and card combos without having to risk losing ranks which is currently the only game mode other than the singleplayer ""challenges"" which are more of a tutorial."
21573,"It's like Hearthstone, but fun."
21574,"This game seemed great, before pvp, that balance! Wow, and different leagues, and just ... just wow! 10 pvp battles not one win, it started out as fun, now im considering just uninstalling this.


As an update:

I used all the premium currency ... now im winning basically every time ... very much o2w, very bad balance, in other words :/"
21575,Wanna play Clash Royale with better minions and 1000000x better graphics then this game is for you ;)
21576,I like This Game. It's Like League of Legends and Clash of Clans in one game.
21577,This game is cool and pretty easy put please 1680 resolution.
21578,"Clash Royale PC version.
GGWP"
21579,"Easy, achievable, fast paced, fun, gorgeous, no-bug, granitic, fair."
21580,"Spent $5 to get the new master Settsu, OP as hell, won 80% of my games. Few days later got nerfed, my win rate drops to 10%. Tilted as hell but its a good game if you like clash royale."
21581,"This game is basically Clash Royale with hero avatars, so a bit like Clash Royale meets HearthStone I guess. It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.

I find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a ""free rotation"" on heroes. On the other hand though, the ""pack"" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off. 

Even with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it.

21584,Such a nice game !
21585,"This game is one of the best games ive played. 
right so .
the game is still in early access i do know that but! there is a big BUT here 
you can play without having any problems at all . 
there is heroes to be played (a bunch of them)
and alot of minions ! 
pretty good variety of maps to buy n play 
nice graphics! 
would i reccomend this? yes ! 10/10 !"
21586,"Minion masters is a deck-building pvp game in which you try to destroy the enemy champion by using a selection of cards – minions and powers – to overrun his minions. This is a very simple concept, and sounds like it could be fun. But the problem with the game is that while it’s pvp and needs to have a fairly level playing field, but everything is locked away from you except some cards and free champions.

The way one unlocks the content is through grinding. I think you need to play at least 30 games to unlock a token to roll for a card (besides the daily gifts and levelling up rewards). Roll, as in you get a completely random card. If you got a card you don’t like, you can exchange it for some shards, which you can use to unlock a different card. And again you need far too many shards to unlock the card that you want compared the amount of games you played in the meantime. After getting enough cards, you need to unlock champions, for which you can also use shards. It just never ends. And it doesn’t help that you can’t even test decks out before deciding to buy certain cards, to get to know how they feel against other minions. At least there’s a free champion rotation to test them out. For a pvp game, it punishes beginners with bad luck far too hard.

These problems are “solved” by a system of microtransactions and a premium upgrade. The premium upgrade costs enough to unlock all content immediately. And microtransactions on top of that is too much. And this when the game is still in early access. The way the grinding in this game works really feels like a way to lead the players to spend more money to quickly unlock cards, arenas and champions – and to be honest I am disgusted with such anti-consumerism. Giving away the game to fans of their previous games and to a friend doesn’t excuse a company to implement this kind of things. I have lost a lot of respect for the developers when I saw that implementation."
21587,10/10 Best Game
21588,it's good for an indie game.
21589,"If you like Clash Royale this game is your choice.
Fun and quick games.
Just summon and win the game XD"
21590,Good game to do a quick break when you tryhard on some nasty uni stuff.
21591,"5/10

I played through the tutorial, and it held my hand through it, nothing special about it, afterwords it suggested I play some solo bot rounds, said I'd get a reward after four wins. Played through them, each one getting a bit harder as I went. Expect the last one before the prize, it was way too easy compaired to any of the bots before it. The prize was a little lackluster, I expected a little more than 'Random card spin' token. Decided after that to play a pvp match, test the waters. The wait time was great, thirty seconds max. The person I got matched against was not. I was no where near ready for who I went up against, literally being in a league different than my own (I was in wood league, they were in a metal league, unsure the tier names or ranks). The slaughter was incredibly mood ruining. The game itself is good, a nice spin as far as it goes (I think clash of clans has something exactly like this, however I'm unsure which came first.) the solo play was nice, but, it left something to be desired, and the vs player mode was insanely unbalanced and completely unpleasent. I personally won't be playing more, but simply because the game doesn't interest me too much at the moment. I do suggest trying it yourself if possible."
21592,"I find Minion Masters really fun and challenging. The multiplayer 1vs1 competetive matches are always interesting because you have to figure out what your opponents next move is going to be in order to counter it. 

I really like the game-design, because it scales so well. This game can be either extremely competetive, or a casual game that you play for fun. It all depends on how much effort you put into it and how badly you want to become the best at the game :P

Furthermore there are a lot of cool features in the game. For example, you can try building different decks to suit your playstyle, whether it be flooding your opponent with many small cost minions or using fewer minions that cost more, but are very strong and have a lot of health.
I feel like Betadwarf have been generous with giving new players a chance to compete, because while leveling up, you get free chests containing new cards and you also receive bonus coins which enables you to buy more chests, in order for you to build up a proper deck to compete with. 

Overall I really think this is a game worth playing, especially if you like online competetive games.

"
21593,"Update #3

I have played this game for a while now(~7 months) and was always a big supporter of the game, however, in its current state, I can no longer recommend the game.

I believe the game has a lot of potential, and recommend everone to keep an eye out once it's released, the gameplay itself is incredibly fun, but the game as a whole is suffering from a lot of issues.

#1 - [b]The playerbase[/b] is incredibly small with ~200 concurrent players. The biggest issue witht hat is, that developers decided to release more and more gamemodes, splitting the already small playerbase into much smaller ones.

#2 - [b]Queue times[/b] due to the split playerbase are often very long OR result in playing the exact same person over and over again, which is pretty bad.

#3 - [b]Matchup dependency[/b] is a huge issue due to encountering the same players over and over again. Given equal or even similar skill, the difference in the decks will almost always predetermine the outcome. Another way to describe the constructed/ranked mode is rock-paper-scissors. Metadecks are extremely specialized now due to [i]Wild Cards[/i], which enforce this problem. 

#4 - [b]Score inflation[/b] has gotten out of hand. Win streaks(double score) used to exist until Diamond(Similar to hearthstones rank 5) but now exist until GrandMaster(Hearthstone's Legend), meaning that everyone with a 50% win rate(or even LESS) can reach the highest league. Furthermore there is a new -15% score penalty in place, meaning that even without winstreaks a 50% win rate means climbing up. The problem with that is, ranks are completely arbitrary, and more indicative of [i]time played[/i] than [i]skill or win rate[/i]. From a competitive point of view, that is atrocious.

#5 - [b]Draft Mode[/b] used to be my favorite mode, now it is no longer a mode where good players can farm resources to get a full collection of cards, Masters and Arenas as the rewards have been heavily reduced, to a degree far worse than Hearthstones Arena rewards. In Hearthstone people complain that the 12-win rewards are not good enough, in Minion Masters going 12-0 will give you essentially 1/3 of the gold entry fee a booster a common cards and dust, not evenough to craft the worst cards in the game. The rewards are in fact, insulting, to the player. 

Bottom line, for competitive players, currently is the worst time to touch the game and the direction of the game is very questionable. Since the game has a ton of potential, it is worthwhile to keep an eye on updates and hopefully a much better state once release date draws near. In its current state I can't recommend the game to anyone however."
21594,Great Game

21611,GAME COMPLETED
21612,"I can't remember where I picked this up, I'm pretty sure it was a bundle because I got a Steam Gift key as well. I know its been given out in a couple giveaways already.

Anyway, this game has promise, but it's sorely lacking in content at this stage of development. On the plus side, it runs well on my laptop (2 year old mid range gaming laptop), the gameplay is easy to pick up, graphics are decent. On the negative side, they expect a $20 buy in and the game is almost nothing but micro transactions from then on. You can earn rewards by playing, mainly gold with a daily chance for gems shards (for crefting cards) and rubies (the premium currency). From there it's set up like a MOBA, you have to buy heroes and arenas (which are purely cosmetic so why do they cost money?). And you collect cards to use as minions. Very basic 2 lane set up, control the center points to increase mana production, dispatch minions to defend your hero and attack the enemy hero. Progression seems slow even with the ""Premium"" upgrade, there's no story or interesting flavor text to make the heroes and minions seem interesting, it's just... meh. If you get a free key it's worth checking out, but I don't think it's worth the asking price for the premium upgrade. Maybe keep an eye on it for future development if it improves."
21613,I love it but please put a resolution option for 1440x900. However i love it alot.
21614,"Got this for free!!! Interesting and fun..... BUT..... and this is a HUGE but!

There are certain decks that become common, normally involve either constant swarms or lots of big OP monsters. If you do not have the cards to build these sorts of decks or even defend against them you are stuffed. You are then limited to constant grind to try and get the cards or buy them. 

So the whole game boils down to if you are lucky grinding to be able to build one of the OP decks or you must pay to win!

Would be a far far better game if everyone had ALL the cards then it came down to deck building skill but looks like this game it built around milking people on buying cards. What is worse it is not even buy the cards you want but buy random spins of a wheel and the card you actually want might not even be on that wheel in the first play. So really not pay to win more keep spending spending spending in some hope you might get the card you want.

Good game ruined by greed!


"
21615,Fun game where you summon minions or spells that go foward towards the enemy Master.  This game is basically a better version of Clash Royale.  You can only have 10 cards in your deck.  Each Master has his own set of perks that are earned through getting exp by controlling 1 or 2 bridges.  Also each master has its own type of auto attack. This game is only getting bigger and will soon turn free to play which should make the player base quite a bit larger.  The matches are fairly quick so its a game you can put a short amount of time in here and there and not feel like you have to commit a bunch of hours to it.  The developers also do a good job of listening to player feedback and balancing the cards and masters fairly well for a smaller company.    Defintely recommend trying this game out.
21616,Really great game that the devs are constantly working towards improving. Its a bit like clash royale with more complexity. Highly recommend giving it a try. Here's a free key for the game to give it a go: J84ZE-WXY88-CFNE5
21617,awesome game :) recommending to everyone
21618,this game is great cunt i am no joking its really good
21619,"Fun game, the gameplay is similar to Clash Royale (on mobile phone) but with improvements. I don't think this is an exact copy to CR, this game is doing its best making this genre a thing and it does the job well. 

This game has ""perks"" system, which CR doesn't have. Basically, you'll have to control the bridges that connect 2 fields by letting your minions pass through it. The longer you hold posession of these bridges, the more ""XP"" you get (note that this XP is different from your account's XP. This XP you get from controlling bridges will reset at the start of every game. The more match XP you get, the earlier you can get your ""perks"" which will help you break through those ""stalemate"" position where 2 players keep spamming minions but can't get through each other's defenses. Each player has 4 perks and these perks depends on which ""hero"" you picked.  

Overall, there's still more to talk about this game, it really worths $20 investment to me and i suggest everyone to support the game."
21620,"I realy liked the game its fun its entertaining. But its realy unbalanced, the develepors do everting they can to balance it but they nerf one thing another op pops up, they nerf it and the next op is out. And the biggest problem is that is you have the op cards you climb like mad, if you dont tought luck no win for you. That is sad for me because i realy liked this game and it as great potencial. but or you play mate or you lose. You cant try new stuff wiout losing alot. you cant have fun deck. GET META OR OUT.

Edit: after alot of play time i almost have all the cards and can easly get them, with this in mind, i now find the game extremely fun and adicting. the devs made alot of changes for the best. you can have alot of diferente deck and all work. i dont play at the top of the rankings but i can easly reach diamon playing diferent decks while not being a metaslave, big problem for me in the star.
The game is also very lose with its payed currency, you can get it from daily roll, from rank rewards, battlepass ( i love it ) and more, you can get alot of skins without spending a dolar.

Finally right now i love the game play daily and like every single second i recomend to my frines and everybody who likes card games but with a twist. and congrats on the devs for making a great game i can tell its a project from love and not greed. keep up the good work"
21621,interesting
21622,"Fun for a little while, but got boring pretty quick. Imagine hearthstone in 3d and this comes quite close. Worth picking up in a sale, but not at full price.

Edit: I did not realise this would be free to play at release. I suggest holding off until it is released!"
21623,Nice game! <3
21624,"Early access and pay to win? Utter garbage.

I got this in a Humble Monthly deal and got premium access to the game. I started with enough of the THREE in game currencies to give myself a major boost. Normal people have to rely on luck to get the best cards, but if you pay a little money you can pick them from the get go. Sure there is a tiny amount of skill, but paying more will guarantee you more wins."
21625,cool game
21626,"If you like clash royale, you'll like this."
21627,"TL;DR: Can be pay to win but is still favorable to free players.
January 6th, 2017 Update 12 - Blast Entry 
I recieved this game for free from a Friend. From my knowledge it was not a premium upgrade
so I am currently playing it as any other person would when it comes out of early access. Stone 2.
Currently reading through reviews and seeing a lot of pay to win complaints. I have spent 0$ on the game so far and definetly had a hard time starting out people do have better cards then you and you can spend money to get more cards. Your method however could either be random or through crafting which anyone can do and isn't explained very well at any point and is briefly touched upon.
I'm not good at formatting but this is looking pretty ugly so new paragraph. 
I have reached level 15 in the game and am stone 2. Within this time frame I've bought a new master(Settsu) and gotten enough free cards from the Token system and level up rewards to have a deck that has allowed me a 5 win streak on this very night. The system used for picking cards prioritizes your Masters experience rewards so you'll almost always be able to use your Masters' spells after getting enough xp to do so. This mechanic alone is enough to add strategy in places where in other games you would just be pulling out high level cards and losing in mere turns since these are all helpful and cost almost nothing sometimes even nothing! 
This game is pretty amazing. They're doing things right I'm not sure about the community aspect, but I haven't had any points where anything has seemed beyond unfair."
21628,in its current state its not recommended a win will net you 50 gold which it takes 1000 gold to purcahse a token to get 1 card on top of the the spellcasters you do not get one for free so you have to save up to get one while useing the two that are on free rotation at that time which i beleive the total real world cost of a spellcaster is about 10 dollars a bad business model that will not hold a player base for long.
21629,"not a fan... incredibly unbalanced game. I own all but like 8 cards and still manage to get my ass handed to me. I know how to counter other plays and when i see something new i try to incorporate it, usually to no change in the ass handing. Ive tried swarmer decks, all big uns deck, mixed decks, puff decks, spell decks etc etc. also when i play the ravager, the first raveger i send out dies in like 4 hits where the enemy ravager just tanks everything and i seemingly do no damage to it."
21630,"Fast paced and fun to play.
I could see potential in this.
Has stability issues at the moment, crashes occasionally after game.
Salty kids included."
21631,"A Simple, yet addictive game. 

It's unique blend of Card Game, Tower Defense and Strategy Game is extreemly enjoyable, where the luck of the draw can help a rookie with a terrible deck defeat a vetren with legendary cards. 

Skill, Stratergy and Luck all factor into each fight. Short Games mean short queues and lots of fun to be had. 

"
21632,"I don't know if it is my laptop, but I feel like the game is so laggy and slow. Maybe 30-40 fps. I play many games and I get 60+ fps CS:GO, Dota 2, etc.
It costs $20, AND pay2win. wow.
I'm new to the game and still discovering it tho."
21633,da
21634,"This should be a free android / ios app... not a £14.99 steam game!
My cousin gifted me the game because he got one, although it's asking me to buy premium in game for £14.99? Forget that...
The game is a glamourised, rather boring card battling game.
It's very obvious from the start that it's a pay to win game... no skill involved what-so-ever.
It's going to be whomever's got the best deck of cards is going to win... hands down.
Of course, that's going to be factored by who spends more money on the game...
Sorry just not a fan of these ""money grab"" games.
I'll stick to games I can just buy and play fairly, where skill is the prime factor in winning...
Not games like this where the size of my wallet and stupidity to waste it factors whether or not I'm better than my opponent.
Had I paid any money for this game, I would be using steams 2 hour refund policy."
21635,you must buy this game if you like minions
21636,i got skill AND  LIKE TO WATCH CARTOON NETWORK
21637,Clash Royale kadar güzel hattaha daha iyi
21638,"One of the best games in the world. In this game, the time you summon a monster or you use a spell card,  it appears in the field to fight for you. This feature is not yet available in all of the cards games, like Yu-Gi-Oh! or others, that what makes it the best cards game in the world, and Hearth Stone comes after."
21639,Very Good ;)
21640,game is fun and has potential but it is horibly unbalanced when you get to certain point you will only play against players that already aquired legendary cards which basically makes them undefeatable unless you have legendary cards as well this is unacceptable in ccg and its just wrong once you hit certain rank you cant drop out and that will make you stack with players with much better cards than you and win not many wins you will have to grind through loosing to acquire crystals to craft necessary cards to compete
21641,"no balance, pure RNG"
21642,"this should be a light graphics game, even for intel HD graphics should be no problem playing this game, but in fact is the opposite, please do some adjustment.

for the gameplay, i think it's good.
for developer i suggest to give some bonus minions for every several win and every weeks for example, thats should be make this game more addictive.

make some good offers in shop.

overall, this game was great"
21643,"Great game and i cant spent time to write this review, cause i must play this game forever"
21644,good game
21645,prety good to play
21646,This game makes mincemeat of you.
21647,lmao
21648,"TLDR: Clash Royale + PC = F2P crap in high resolution -> yeah, dont bother.


In short: The gameplay mechanics are good - which is kinda like the tower defense and a card game blend,.. BUT the F2P model ruins everything that the game offers.
F2P model? for what,.. for a f***ing card game?!

[h1]The games price and F2P[/h1]
Right now the game is in Early Access and its description says [i]“Minion Masters will be free-to-play in the future""...[/i]
But that is regarding the [u]price[/u] (right now you have to buy a game for 19,99€ witch is so called ""Minion Masters+Premium Upgrade""), but the gameplay already IS free-to-play right now. And you can already see how it ruins the game.

[h1]The game mechanics[/h1]
* There are ""Minion Masters"" - the one you see on top of each tower in the screenshots, they each have different passive attacks and some buffs. Each one will requere different tactics for you to use.
* You activate the cards during the game - it executes a specific attack at the opponent. Each card uses different tactic and needs different amount of time to get ready for use. (and different amount of money / time to unlock just to use it. The same as with minion masters of course. You think you will be good as a Mordar? He costs 1500 blue crystals and 775 rubies, you buy rubies in the shop of course... )

[h1]Grind and a paywall examples[/h1]
Look... there are plenty of cards and different Minion Masters for many ways to fight BUT it is all not accessible to you. For about first 1 - 20/25 ""levels"" (which is how many hours you have played) you will unlock cards automatically, but they will noticebly stop unlocking at some point (after level 25 for me) and the most powerful ones you HAVE to grind for.  How much? The most powerful cards (Colosus, Ghost,...) cost 2000 blue crystals -> when you have 1000 gold (you get 4-15 gold after each match) ...you can buy a ""token"" at the shop, so you can roll a random chance of card drop, which you can later scrap for about 50 - (maybe 200 if today is your birthday) blue crystals, depending on how rare the card you have dropped.
As a side note: I have ~30 hours playtime and I STILL cant craft not a single 2000 card. Dont forget that you WILL have to craft ""average"" cards too. The ones that you will PROBABLY be good with. Yes you can scrap them later and recraft - but you will lose crystals in the process that way.
And of course you can buy tokens at the shop. So you can,.. you know... roll a random chance to drop something you can/need to use during matches. Or just scrap it for 50 blue crystals.
[u]The point is[/u] you will have to play for DOZENS of hours JUST to get the basic setup. And to get the most powerful cards? I have no idea. For 100+ something hours, I guess. Faster if you pay. You have buy/grind minion masters too. But some of them are sometimes available for free thru ""free week"" or something. How generous.

[h1]Community now and in the future[/h1]
It's not uncommon to rotate thru specific players when you play for 10+ matches.
At the end of the december there was ~5 people talking in the global chat. The most activity I have ever seen. Not many people are playing this IMO.
Because I couldn't find anyone english speaking to play with a couple days later. 
Good thing is it will be fixed when the game becomes F2P.
[spoiler]There will be plenty of 12 year old kids to have a match with you.[/spoiler]

At least the community is good [spoiler]right now.[/spoiler]"
21649,"Great game.

Would recommend to anyone who likes real-time strategy PVP.
The graphics are well done, the physics are amazing(after death physics).
The game-play versus other players/bots is pretty unbalanced at moment(but that's what the beta is for) the cards themselves are good,as the size of your selection is limited to a good amount of cards.
Overall i think its a solid 4.5/5 as a released game.
For a beta this is worth e definite 5/5.

A lot of people say its pay to win and outbalanced.
As I haven't spend a penny on in game purchases and I do not notice me having any disadvantage towards other players.
This game is not pay to win as long as you have decent feeling for strategy and some luck at the power tower.

and people, don't complain about it being unbalanced, read the description why they are doing the betas."
21650,Good Game !!!
21651,Noob Gammes :v
21652,"It's a fun game, but they made it p2w for whatever reason."
21653,"I really like this game, and I think it has some potential. It runs well, and its card system isn't really P2W as the cards you get are mostly random. The games matchmaking also works well for the mostpart, so for anyone looking for an addictive little game to play when you are bored, get this. But not for full price."
21654,"says you get the premium upgrade if you buy, i have not got it.
"
21655,"I received this game from a friend and I thought, oh boy, this looks kinda dumb, but it is sooo fun. Quick 3-5 minute battles, decent graphics, great gameplay, doesn't feel pay to win. I'm certainly grateful for receiving this game and look forward to it being ftp so that more people will join in. They definitely need to advertise when it is released though. I would also like to see some other game modes and 2v2s or something, but it is very fun as it is.

3rd: Edit. Steer clear. The devs seem to be very very greedy and are only in this for the money. Pay to win, stupid events that try to get you to either spend stupid amounts of time into the game or spend money. Broken heroes, unbalanced cards, and there are fewer and fewer people playing becqause of it.

2nd Edit: I played the game after the developer contacted me and I do think they have changed quite a bit of the problems I was facing. I have not fully tested everything, but so far it feels even better than it did when I first started playing and enjoying the game. Good job devs. Stay away from greed and simply have the desire to make a good game and you will likely succeed. This community wants people who love to make a great games and not people who want to make a fun enough game to make a bunch of money. Thanks for taking the time to respond also.\"
21656,"Unique 

Recommended"
21657,"This was one of the best games of its kind that I've played. pvp is relatively good, the community is reasonable and the developers are active and help those who need it. several minions, minion masters, arenas and lots of stuff. even in early access, it's worth every second played. 10/10"
21658,"Who doesn't want to have minion armies? Well, here is your game! Pick a minion master out of 7. Storm bringer is an archer that does all things range, is pretty much your starter guy. Then with a deck of 10 cards, fight against other minion masters and their minion armies! The game is just 2 fields, each minion master at each end and mana grows per second up to 10. Each card in your deck is drawn simultaneously and each card has a mana cost. Thus you play your chosen minions accordingly! EASY? Well yeah, summon minions and have them go at it. Each minion master has skills and abilities they play by killing and gaining exp. Each is different with a theme and neat look and all. Different and unique. Play whatever minion or minion master you want. Some work well together, some are silly and some are OH GOD, when you see it summoned on the field. There is also spells and building card minions. So earn gold, rubies and power tokens to unlock more minions, minions masters, and arenas. Level up gains these rewards too ( level by winning). This game is pretty good now, but more minions, minion masters will only make this game better. The more, the better and I can see this game really rolling. There is a solo short game story line to play, then its PVP.  PVP as of now, seems you go up against anyone on, and well higher levels will just roll over you. Have fun and master those minions with minion masters of your minions! Also dailies help you earn some rewards and have just been added."
21659,Clash Royale clone on PC but not bad if you like Clash Royale you must play this game 2!

21665,Very gud
21666,"The Game is nice and pretty fun. similiar like clash royale but different. 
Lot of stuff to do in this game, that make the game  is fun


My Opinion:
Need some repair, probably in shuffle deck
Need pretty challenge like tournament
Need Guild or Clan
Overall the game is pretty good and challenging."
21667,"I like the game, needs to be verse more ai games so heavy pay to win"
21668,Just do it

21678,"A fresh take on the card game genre. Somewhat like when my wife left me for a hunky optometrist. I just ordered a fresh young mail order bride and she's got a better ass than my wife ever did. Bit of a mustache though... and this game doesn't have enough cards in it yet... 7/10

Thanks for the free game though, really generous of you :D"
21679,The only reason this came onto my radar is because it was offered for free as part of a promotion. The game itself has potential and kind of like the concept but the fact it's a free to pay title at present is enough to put most off bothering with it.
21680,"I dont know. This ""game"" is a pay2win waste of time. It is a disgrace to the gaming industry and it shouldn't be allowed on the internet. It isn't even worth typing 150 characters."

thumbs up for this!"

21692,still a little new to the game i adapted to it really quickly it because a blast to play controlling minions and placing them to destroy your enemy its like clash royales ina way lol

21694,good game but needs some balancing

1. its pay to win
2. its about luck what cards will you get
3. minions dont do dmg but most tanks have a lot of dmg and a lot of hp so if u build a d3eck of tanks its super izi to win
4. the characters or so shit and unfair af
I dont normally post a rewiev but what ever u do dont buy this game at the conditions it is now wait for it to improve bcs right now it cant get any worse"
21696,good game
21697,"good game ..well designed well ballanced and most importantly great graphics and have blood and gore which make the game realistic and fun

its missing many good stuff like ingame chat vs enemy in battle,ability to add friend in game , ability to watch game in friends list


and the game have 11 errors in game hope they fix them soon
"
21698,Good game.
21699,"You remember that flash games where you have two bases, path between them and you just choose units that pushing ahead courageously no matter what? Sooo it is back, but with some MOBA/card game variations. Pretty enjoyable with short (0,5-5 minute) battles. Strong one more battle effect!"
21700,"Nice game, So fun! =D"
21701,"Nicely done multiplayer game, rounds are quick taking just a few minutes to pass the time and have little bit of fun. The game is very easy to learn and grasp the basics, anyone can play it without difficulties. I am eager to see what will be improved as it goes through early access."
21702,"Try hard people, gets boring fast.  You better off finding another game like this but more fun."
21703,"[h1]Another great game from the guys that made FORCED,[/h1]

Although nothing like that previous game as well as no story ties
to FORCED by what it seems, Minion Masters is quite a fun and
entirley different game where you choose a master who must
use a variety of 10 minions and spells to take down the opposing
master through strategy and counterplay.

A match consist of two fields, yours and your opponents and
two bridges in between which are key to getting an edge on
your opponent through in match leveling. You can only play
minons on your side of the field which will head over to the
enemies side and try to take them down, of course they can
use their own minions to stop your minions and vice versa.
Spells on the other hand can be cast anywhere on the field to
wipe enemy minions, or buff your own.

Minions range from weak and numerous, to strong and powerfull
with differing cost of mana to balance summoning stronger
minions compared to the efficiency of a cheap horde.
Some minions and spells excel at wiping out waves of weaker
minions, while others are made to do heavy damage at the
cost of being suceptable to swarms. Some minons only
attack at melee, others range, some special ones buildings,
and others fly themselves. Because of this, making decks
is encouraged to be made with a balance unless you want
something ridiculous like getting killed by one flying dragon
the entire game from lack of a ranged unit.

The masters are just as important as your cards as their
strengths and weaknesses can compliment with your
strategy. A master has a basic attack, mostly used for
dealing with minions that get up to them, and 3 additional
skills which are unlocked in-match through capturing the
middle bridges and leveling up.

For example, my favorite master right now is Ratbo.
He has a short ranged gatteling gun attack, his level 1 skill
summons 1 additional weak minion for every minion card
you play. His level 2 skill has a condition where if you have
10 or more minions alive, your basic attacks range extends
to the entire map. His last skill summons 2 weak minions
per minion card played to activate that 2nd skill easier.
Because of this, he can be reliant on having a swarm of
weak minions to overwhelm your enemy through numbers,
though if you don't throw in a tanky unit somewhere there,
a good crowd clearing spell or minion from your enemy can
completley counter you.

Other masters have their own stregnths/weaknesses that
can lead to awesome strategies, or one sided screw ups
such as when I used Volco, a melee specialist, who wasen't
able to deal with one single flying dragon an entire game.

My only complaint would be, as with all competative online
games are, that playing with friends dosen't really reward
you anything. I got this game through humble monthly
and only decided to play it since a promotion gave me a
free key for a friend. The promotion was for the recentley
released friend battles which atleast gives a daily reward
for a friend match, but after that, its all just for fun.

This game is still in early access by the writing of this review,
and I hear it will be free to play when its fully released,
although I decided to play because of a friend, I have
played quite a bit of random matches now and I have to say,
this is quite a well made game that is worthy of just having a
normal pricetag by how good it already is while still in
early access. Games are quite short, and match-making,
even shorter, which overall is a good pickup game to pass the
time, with enough strategy for deeper play in the longrun."
21704,"I got this game for free from BundleStars, thought I might as well give it a try and loved it from the start.

It's kind of a meld of League of Legends, Magic Duels and Castle Storm."
21705,"this is cool, remembered playing Yu-Gi-Oh! but the combination of the game COC.

interesting.."
21706,If you liked Hearthstone this is it on Steroids
21707,very nice game
21708,"awesome game thx i get 4 key for me and for my friends
thx for your kindness"
21709,"It's a lot like crash royale combined with hearthstone cards.
This game vanishes boredom and is like an better version of crash royale, it has potential of being one of the best indie games of the year."
21710,Game is legitimately a more in depth better version of Clash Royale.
21711,"One of the few fighting, battle strategy games that is quite relaxing to play. I haven't had any problems so far except for when fighting against someone online for the first time and I got defeated. And then it froze and didn't take me back to the default menu. So I had defeated blinking at me until I could shut this down. However, when it is working it's a great game to play. I felt like there should be more single player stages just to get the swing of things. And I'm not sure what updates there are around yet, but I'm hoping they can do a 4-person arena at some point. Like 2 vs 2 (co-op mode)."
21712,"really fun and competetive game has a great potential to be next popular esports

-Premium currency exist but not that pricy nor game changing
-you cant level up the minions which is good thus countering pay to win potential
-choice of heroes gave the game a good number of win condition  from swarmer to power minions
-really easy to learn
-really worth the money paid 

"
21713,nice cards :)
21714,"This game is very unique, I've having a lot of fun so far. It reminds me of hearthstone in a lot of ways but at the same time it is a lot more active and faster paced, taking place in real time instead of turn based. It's a mix of a tactical rpg, moba, and card game. It starts out fairly simple but it has lots of potential to big big as they add more cards and work on balance. The characters are a good mix of cute and cool, similar to the warcraft universe or league of legends.
I'm looking forward to the full release. If they add a good match making a ladder system I could see this game being a big hit."
21715,"This is honestly a pretty fun game, it's good to just waste time playing and it's an easy game to load up, would work on nearly any computer."
21716,It's not a correctly game.
21717,"As if the trailer wasen't amazing enough! Minion Master brings back the imposing assets of a Strategy, turn-based game. Everything is as shown in the video: the smooth animation/effects, it's aesthetics, clear tutorial steps and tips as well as the variety of cards (Monsters) that are available in the game.

This is more than what I was expecting of an Early Access game, and I can say that the developer has done a stunning job. I'd recommend this game to others once the game becomes F2P in the future!"
21718,lol
21719,awesome

21735,NIce game
21736,"More than recommended. It seems simple at first, you have a few cards in your deck, 4 of them in your hand all the time, you continously acquire mana which you spend to place them somewhere in the battlefield, then most of them start walking towards the enemy and they fight whatever they meet on the way. 
It's simplicity is deceptive, to be really effective one needs to know many things and make good decisions quick. At heart it's a game of countering as the trailer suggests, but to effectively counter you need to know the cards in the game well. On the surface it might seem enough to know which card is able to damage which, but in reality their placement and even the timing of casting them matter a lot, sometimes an effective counter is nullified just by placing it half a second earlier then you should place them. Of course it matters what cards you have in your deck as they can be built for synergy and also variety to be able to counter whatever comes your way, but in my limited experience how you play them is more important. 
It's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two.

21743,"Hokay, so, I've decided to re-review this game, as per the comments below requesting I do so.

I tried it again, and I am willing to admit that:
1- I was probably wrong to judge it so quickly and harshly, and
2- There are elements that bug me, but we'll get to them

So, the game: the game is actually pretty fun. I loved the idea, and I still do. What I didn't realise was how important using doubles in games are, nor how important it is to have certain types of cards. Now that I do, I'm getting through issues pretty quickly and easily. It does take a bit of learning, but I will state what I have always loved:

I love the fact you draw your minions from cards, and not just always have them, making you think on the fly and when creating decks.

That being said, I'm still not sold on the marketing idea of random creatures, but I am happier now that I see a crafting system. That does help offset the rng that can mess you around, as well as knowing it's not the rarity of the card, but its usefulness.

All in all I think the game is fairly fun to play, nice and simple for a quick romp, but for me at least, I feel a bit of a lack of staying power, and so will play it on and off as opposed to religiously. We'll see how well that goes in terms of things.

However, I also know there are elements I have yet to play (draft and such like) so I will also need to try that, and observe how dailies are done in this game. Otherwise, I am enjoying it more than I was before."
21744,awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwweee
21745,fairly good
21746,awesomeeee
21747,"[Last update at version 0.11.4 | 24/12/2016]

Soo after receiving a free key for this game, I jumped right away exploring it (had some experience from Clash Royale). The concept is amazing and coming from competitive hearthstone scene, the low rng level (when you have cards and decks) is amazing from the start.

For an early alpha, the game already feels complete, with replays, ranked system and 70+ cards.
The reward system seems fluid, and the legendaries don't feel overpowered (or at least a need to have).
Regarding the ingame purchases, they are purely cosmetic / boosts, soo no pay to win (just pay to avoid grinding).

Overall, looking foward to the future of this game, and specially if a competitive scene blossoms."
21748,"I like it!  

Pros:
Quick (most games are less than 3 minutes.  I have been crushed or crushed others in less than 30 secs.)
Fun
Easy to learn
Consist of deck building skill AND;
strategy and tactics during the game as you and your opponent summon and send minions at one another.


Cons:
-Cost.  $20 for the premium be be too much for many but as the early access has progressed, I am begining to see great value it..  Sure, it is gonna be f2p.  But the want to spend money will probably be strong.  Why?  Because it is fun as hell!,and:

-the earning of ingame currency to craft new cards and buy new masters is a tad slow ( I have 100% bonus for a year from premium account, that helps.)


Good game.  I like it.  I want to play against you in it.  I used to think the $20 premium account was high, but now I am not so sure, as they continue to release new cards, masters, and constantly balance and hold events. 

update:  Game is still fun.  Real money is not needed.  Like many games, it is mainly pay to speed shit up.  You will probably be behind on cards ealy on, but just playing through the game, it will not take long to pretty much be on par with everyone else."
21749,"A friend gave this to me, because he got an extra copy. And it is actually quite fun!
Kinda like Clash Royale, but has much cooler aspects to it! Definitely recommend it.

It is annoying that because I got it as a gift, I don't get the premium Upgrade. So I have to pay for more stuff if I want it. :("
21750,This game blew me away for being in early access. 10/10 This game has a huge potential to be big.

21756,such a nice game
21757,"Nice try of putting a fun game together, but the balance is way out of hand.

If you can't deal with just one wave, you've basically lost the game if they start spamming/sending huge minions.

It goes both ways, I'we won games in a minute, and lost them even quicker. Either way the satisfaction is lost.

Currently the balance issues make it unplayable, but let's see what they do in the future."
21758,"it is basically clash royal with beter cards, a more interesting play style, and a 3d outlook.
In other words it's top notch, and i recommend it."
21759,"This is a straight clone of Clash Royale on iOS. It currently offers no improvement over that title, and playing with a mouse is less fun than using a touchscreen."
21760,"Solo mode is well balanced and fun. Gameplay is easy to pick up.

However multiplayer (which is the core of MM) allows you to fight to a copper 4 or 5 level and then stagnate.
I also got this from HB Monthly which gave me the Premium Upgrade. 
 
I played multiplayer for 3 hours with various combinations and strategies, playing the same 7 people, bouncing between a loss and a win, keeping my rank.

Never moving forward, never moving back.

Great graphics and strategies. Very fun. It sorely needs balancing for multiplayer.
Perhaps a class system with perks for strategies (ranged, melee, flying, building, etc.) or strategic matchmaking?
Maybe add a clever way to earn a flip between deck slots?

REALLY LOOKING FORWARD to what's to come from BetaDwarf.

21761,good game
21762,Free cards!
21763,Love this game srsly 10/10
21764,waste of time and money. lucky i only lost time.
21765,"TLDR
Like Clash Royale for PC, mixed with some elements from Hearthstone.

'Minion Masters' is a game that mostly can be defined as a competitive/duel - RTS, as you battle an opponent in a heads up minion spawning game and see who can crush the opponent's hero/base first.
The game is primarily inspired by the Clash Royale game for mobile and borrow some game design choices from Hearthstone or MOBAs to add another level of complexity to the game.

The game follow the rock-paper-scissor-lizard-and so on structure to bring balance to the game, with the added complexity of a hero/base that has a set of abilities that become available the longer the game progresses. These are in most cases significant 'timing-windows' that players play around which just adds to the interesting play-styles and diversity in each game. 

Games last about 5 minutes at max, and that is probably setting it too high, as games are incredibly fast paced and quick thinking is adviced. Queues are pretty immidiate at the early levels and I never felt like I was being matched outside my league.

It's free to play, and the standard load-out of cards are pretty strong, so you can get a ton of game-play in without taking another bank-loan. Weekly free-hero rotation, as you probably know from LoL or HoN, allow you to try different heroes(bases) each week before you commit to a purchase.

Unfortunately you cannot duel a friend yet, although it will be out soonish.

- Overall a great experience, little time between updates and fixes."
21766,given free a lot but fun
21767,"If you like clash royale you will like this game , the pricing is fair. All in all its a nice bit of fun."
21768,Awesome! Its like Clash Royal for computers. Very hard too :3
21769,"Curator Review:

Indie game developer BetaDwarf brings us an interesting and new Strategy Card Game in the form of Minion Masters: Forced to Duel. Pick a hero, build a deck, and then play cards in real time against your opponent. First one to destroy the opposition's base wins. While the premise is simple, the game is surprisingly deep. Don't let this fool you, however, as Minion Masters is very easy to learn and quick to pick up. Great for all ages, with the option to turn off the gore, you can fight your way through the solo challenges, unlock power tokens to find amazing new cards, and then test your skills online when you are ready. Minion Masters is elegant, fun, fast paced, and a great time! On top of it all, the developers are listening directly to community feedback while developing the game and have even found their way into the Humble Monthly. For all these reasons Minion Masters by BetaDwarf receives a very solid 8.5/10

21770,Nice graphics!!!
21771,"It's basically a remake of an old WC3 mod called Card Shuffle. 

It's REALLY good to pass the time and play with friends.

There aren't a lot of cards yet and it's 1v1 unlike Card Shuffle but it's still a very good game."
21772,clash royale
21773,"This game is exactly the same type of game as Clash Royale. This is game is far superior to Clash since it is not pay to win at all, when you unlock a unit/card, you own the entirety of that unit and you don't upgrade and you are not forced into waiting unlike CLashs where you can pay in gems if you want to quicken the processes of the game, you either buy with a fair price unlike Clash, or you wait. WHEN YOU GET A BOX, YOU CAN OPEN IT AND NOT WAIT HOURS UPON HOURS JUST TO OPEN AND THERE IS NO LIMIT FOR BOXES. EVEN THE STARTER deck is effective, but i believe that you need to tweak that deck a little, which you can for free by playing for a couple of hours, which is very fair for a free to play game. There are no overpowered cards in my opinion, but some cards are very specific in there use so they can be considered as being worse, so you don't need a legendary or epic to win, actually you need to think a lot to win in a hard game. There are a lot of heroes that have 3 abilities that you gain periodically upon obtaining exp ingame while controlling bridges and these heroes combo with card decks, ingenius.

The bottom line is, get this game, you won't regret it."
21774,"I like this game, its like Clash Royale but better"
21775,"Sooo Minion Masters. A game from the company that created FORCED (Superb co-op game with friends btw) and FORCED shutdown (Somekind of a card arena brawler, which TotalBiscuit enjoyed). Minion Masters has to be something different right? Well it is!

Minion Masters is essentially Hearthstone which plays more like a fast-paced RTS than a card game. You don't have turns, your only limiting factor is mana which replenishes over time. You only have 10 cards in your deck but instead of dissappearing after being used they are re-entered to your deck. You draw cards each time you spend one. The objective is to destroy the enemy's altar and master by using any means necessary. Matches themself generally last around 2-4 minutes and can be dominated in less than a minute as well.

The card types are minions, spells and buildings. The first two function similar to Hearthstone but the last one can be different. These are structures you plant on the map and they slowly decay while performing its' abilities. 

Instead of Heroes the game has Masters which each have a different passive attack (this essentially functions as your altar's defensive turret). Some attacks are small range ground AoEs while others are ground-air single target attacks etc... In addition the masters have other abilities which are unlocked through gaining XP during the match. XP is earned passively as the match progresses and also for controlling the two bridges in the middle of the map. These abilities range from adding new cards into the deck to improving the range of your ranged minions. The purpose of the abilities is to end the match and avoid stalemate thus they are very powerful. Each Master plays completely different and you must adjust your deck to favour that Master. Three of the masters are on the free rotation and you can purchase them permanently through crafting materials (earned by playing) or rubies (microtransactions).

Minion Masters is fun and fast-paced 1v1 duel game that has similarities to RTS and Card games. It shines compared to its' competition by removing turns and rewarding for quick thinking and fast decisions. Ever had that Hearthstone match where the opponent spends 95% of his/her turn every time? Well do that in Minion Masters and you are going to lose in under a minute.

PROs:

+ Easy to learn, hard to master. NO TURNS.
+ Short and intense matches (1-5 minutes), a single mistake or a good counter can turn the tide.
+ No casual mode, every game is a ranked game (exception friend matches).
+ 2-3 ""free"" cards each day by completing the daily. You'll get a decent deck running a lot faster than in other TCGs.
+ Card crafting + duplicates into crafting resources.
+ Rewards skill and tactics, higher rarity cards are not like legendaries in HS although still powerful.
+ Very polished and constant updates considering it is early access v 0.11~~.
+ FREE after launch (free keys still going around for EA).

CONs:

- Balance Issues (although very typical for ErAc games).
- Reliance on dailies: The game rewards you very poorly for playing (even with the premium option they offer). ~30 matches for a card with premium, ~60 without, dailies are worth 2-3 cards. So essentially you need to play closer to 100 matches with premium to equal a single daily -> Much rather ONLY play with dailies.
- Sometimes even too punishing, very difficult to come back after making a bad high cost play.

-----

If you are looking for a card'ish game without TURNS to play for 30 min - 1 hour a day then Minion Masters is probably the best and only choice in the market even in its ErAc state. You can play the game for free by getting a key from giveaways/friends or waiting until it launches. The 20$ premium DLC package allows you to play instantly with some additional goodies. While this might be a bit steep, after this purchase you most likely don't need to spend a dime on the game, ever. Unlike *cough Hearthstone cough*."
21776,"Good game play
good visual

21778,"I'm playing now in early access and I see a lot of potential. At this moment there isn't many cards, but creators are introducing many updates."
21779,"It's a really cute game, similar to Clash Royale but way better in my opinion.
It's quite a time killer and I really enjoy playing it.
I warmly reccomend it to anyone so you should atleast consider it."
21780,"Head here for free keys for the game:

http://www.betadwarf.com/community/ - Developer website. Signup, and wait a day or two for a key.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Multiple layers of strategy, (Positioning, timing, your deck, etc.)
- Very generous level up and Rank rewards
- A brief, in-depth Tutorial and rewards along with it
- Very short match-making times, and highly accurate
- Balance for the most part seems fair currently
- It is not P2W. You can gain everything with reasonable time

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Very rough around the edges, but expected in Alpha
- Some design and artwork appears derivative
- Deck possibilities are currently limited, but will improve obviously

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

The game even right now offers a great deal of fun, and minimal frustration. As you can see I received it for free, so I didn't buy the Premium pack, and have won the majority of my games (Currently at Bronze 3 at level 18). The strategy is very fair, and even Common cards can shutdown or answer expensive high-cost cards. To be more clear, superior decision and strategy absolutely WILL trump a deck that potentially counters your own. The game is very skill dependent, much more so than traditional TCG's, as the added layer of positioning and real-time decisions increase the possibilities of misplays and superior decisions alike.

The game is very fair, and generous, and offers a warm welcome to anyone interested in trying it out."

Great idea for the arena / masters purchases, you gotta earn 'em baby.
Of course if you have premium, it's rather easy to get the ideal master and deck for you, but hey, I'm gonna grind it out, unless the devs see this review and give me premium (wink wink).

21793,"This is a great game. 

You can tell the developers put a lot of time and effort in to this game. With very frequent updates and very fun and simple to play, yet hard to master gameplay. The developers also pay close attention to ""the meta"" and nerf and buff cards as necessary.

 I feel that the rate at which you unlock cards and heroes is really good and even though you can pay for a premium currency it never bothered me. It always felt to me that with the unique wildcard system there was always a new deck to try out and play and that even though I never paid I still had a very enjoyable time playing the game and also very good chances at winning. And if you look at the leaderboards, the top decks use very few rare cards, if any, but the rare cards are still fun and unique.

(rare as in they are rare to obtain, so the legendary and supreme cards not the actual ""rare cards"")

Tl;dr : It's a great game that's so worth the price of admission."
21794,"In terms of style Minion Masters takes everything from Blizzard's games - it's like mash up of Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft and Overwatch characters. So, it's a good looking, maybe a bit generic concept, but I like it. I even like that battles lasts 3-5 minutes, so it lets you just hop in and out whenever you have some free time to waste. What I didn't like was the core of the game itself. It's just mindless. You don't need to have any peculiar skills or inteligence to win a battle, you just need to have better cards which obviously costs real money. On that matter later. Seriously, it's even easier and blunt than Hearthstone. On top of that, like I pointed earlier, it's a P2W kind of game (event though it's for 19.99 euro!) which feels more like mobile game than PC. Do I recommend it? For absolute casuals and beginners - yes I guess, but don't buy it. For now devs are just squeezing all the money they can get from sales. Whole concept of in-game purchases with multi-curencies sugests that eventualy it'll be avaliable for free. If not, it's still pay to win kind of game which you need buy in the first place. All in all it's just another title with in-game purchases oriented to squeeze money out of the kids."

21800,"Fairly mindless rock-paper-scissors spam game that is....well, let's be charitable and say Heavily Inspired™ by Blizzard's design philosophy. Expect regular profile level ups, multiple types of F2P currency, chests with fancy endorphin-releasing explosions of loot, and gameplay crafted to make you feel like no matter what you do, you're playing well. 

These developers saw the money being made hand-over fist by Hearthstone and decided to take their own crack at the ""flashy skinner box with puddle-deep gameplay"" genre. The game is 1) technically competent and 2) addictive in the cheap psychologically manipulative way you've come to know if you've played any F2P game in the past three years. These two things are all it takes to squeeze money out of children and those with poor self-control, so I'm sure the publisher's stockholders will be happy."
21801,"A good game for fans of Tower Defense-ish/MOBA titles. The minions appear in many forms, so there's a possibility to come up with all kinds of tactics. The spells are decent, too!

It's still in Early Access and there are many glitches and bugs that will annoy you from time to time, but rest assured that there's lots of potential in this game. Even better, the developers seem to be quite active when it comes to listening to player feedback and polishing the rough edges.

One thing I'd like to mention is that even though the game is not free, it still asks you to pay real money in order to get some of the items you need for advanced heroes and cards/monsters. Otherwise, you're in for some really tedious grinding (online or solo). I really think this makes no sense, and I sincerely hope the developer will do something about it in future updates."

21812,"People calling this a cash grab likely are the same ones who called Hearthstone a cash grab of Magic and they need to actually play the game first.

I find the game very enjoyable and while the art style makes it a little more difficult to see what's going on in the game compared to Clash Royal, I think the other things it brings to the table make up for that.

I like the idea that I have a character rather than just units.
I like that minions do not level up as I found that process annoying in Clash royal.
I like the bridge holding and hero leveling system present in the game as it adds a little more depth to the game.
and I like that this is on PC since I would rather play it here then on my phone.

I understand that last point may be a negative to some people but it is a plus to me.

I admit the only reason I played the game at all was because I got a free key, but I am glad I did. The game is still a little rough around the edges but I feel this could really turn itself into a competitor with Clash Royal.

That said wait for the game to become free to play and don't buy into early acess unless you are dying for this type of game on pc."
21813,"Definite cash grab as a copy of Clash Royale. Do not buy it unless it's 75% off(5 bucks). I got it for free and I like it well enough, but the game is for sure P2W, just like Clash Royale.

Hello,

time for another review...

Sadly no recommendation!

At first I thought this game was actually pretty cool and although I hate
Clash Royale (popular Mobile Game that is similar to this game) I still
liked it. But after a few hours of gameplay I have to say I am very disappointed.
As you now the game is called Minion Masters, I'd rather call it Minion Spammers.
Really. If you spam a shit load of small minions that cost less you automatically win.
Thats bullshit, because it takes abouit 4 out of the 10 cards from your dech to spam
tha absolute crap out of someone but it takes 10 out of the 10 cards from your deck
to counter that. WHY??? There is absolutely no need for that. Because the game
actually has cool cards with cool abilities but that doesn't matter because It is
worthless against a minion spam.

I have to say I got it for free and I got a key from betadwarf to share with a friend,
but I won't let them endure the pure disappointment that Minion Masters
is (right now).

I feel really sad that my review has turned out this way but there is no possibility
that I would recommend this game in it's current state.

After three games against a friend that spammed the absolute crap out of me,
we both came to the conclusion that it's no fun to play anymore.

I still hope you have a great day though because I do not anymore"
21816,Its good for the early access game.
21817,STOP PROMOTING USING FREE SH*T
21818,Great potencial... I like it :D

It's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two."
21820,"A simple game that is great fun! Me and my friends stayed up all night playing. It has a clean UI, simple controls, and is easy to learn and to play. You build a ""deck"" of ten cards which cycle through as you use them, each with their own mana costs. You use these cards to destroy the other player's main tower and win. Or have your own tower blow up and lose. 

This game is still in early access, but that makes it even better. It is a great game with the content it already has, meaning that everything added during it's early access days will only improve on how amazing it is."
21821,"Minion Masters! Like a mix between Clash Royale and Hearthstone, only with less pay to win!

Pros:
- Simple but challenging
- Good mixture of Clash Royale and Hearthstone
- Less pay to win elements

Cons:
- None as of now. This review is subject to change.

Conclusion is, fans of Clash Royale and Hearthstone will like it!"
21822,"geting better and better, and some stuff is kinda unbalanced but hey its EA so i will get fixed. and i hope they go with P2P and not F2P since way to many F2P games becomes P2W games. and this game have a huge possibility to become that."
21823,"Nice tower defense pvp game with cards. Similar to Clash Royale but without the pay to win aspects. Balance seems a bit off, legendaries can easily carry. Good starting point for the game though. Also nice having it for free from Bundle Stars :)"
21824,"The content may not be worth the price tag just yet, but this is still in early access and shaping up to be a great game"
21825,This game is stunning runs smoothly and very addictive. It looks great and cost nothing although i will be buying into this game you don't need to. Currenty in early access the developers seem on the ball with updates and responding to feed back. ive never done this before but 10/10. Keep up the stunning work your doing.
21826,"Early Access Review:

Awesome game and nice tutorials.
The only thing it need, its more ""cards""."
21827,clash royale on ice
21828,Clash Royale
21829,"Super fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)"
21830,"I received this game for free from Bundle Stars today.  It has been really fun and well put together so far.  It is still early access and i think it will be very enjoyable for everyone who likes casual games to just have fun with.

I do recommend this game to everyone."
21831,"Game is a mix of Age of War and a Card dueling game. Quite a flavor.

I've been a competitive strategic card game player before so I believe this game has the potential. If you are also interested in dueling games, give this game a shot. It's worth it.

9/10 for graphics and gameplay.

Overall 7/10 because some people are paying to get advantages in a match, and that sux."
21832,"Absolutely worth it. The game seems rather boring and uninspired at first, but after beating the solo campaign, and then moving onto the multiplayer aspect it's an experience that is difficult to duplicate. Without going P2W."
21833,"I got this game for free, and i really enjoyed it.
I was just a little shocked by the price, i think 20$ is a bit too much for this game, but meuuh, most of the games are overpriced ..."
21834,"its good. its in the early stages so i can see things getting buggy. i am enjoying it. 

the only issue i have is it does not have full support for a controller so i have to switch to a mouse every once and a while to click on a few things. 

The other thing i would like to see tho is if they add a way to speed up the battles."

[b]Review:[/b]
	[i]Collectible Rail RTS with 2 lanes and partial control over unit placement. Utilizes (meh, again) CCG system for loadout and collection management: ""deck"", ""hand"", same ""Hearthstone"" rarities, boosters etc.
	Considered P2W by majority of players, for top-rarity units can only be countered by other top-rarity units, which is very frustrating for beginner players since getting those cards require either grind or money. Plus don't forget to buy Heroes if you want to compete.
	Your nexus is a stationary Hero, with its own auto-attack and 3 abilities, gained at lvl-ups, normally passive or triggered. XP is gained by controlling a bridge (your unit was the last one present on a bridge - means you control it). Other than that typical rail strategy tactics - this unit type counters that, that counters those, those counter nothing but consume time, etc. Everything is fine until you meet some legendary bs which counters everything except big wallet.
	There are 3 types of cards: Unit, Building(timed), Spell. Some building can auto-produce units too. Your loadout consists of Hero and 10 cards without duplicates. In match, cards are indefinitely rotating in your 4-card-hand as you play them, plus you can see which card comes next. As of right now, (before release), there is total of ~70 cards and 7 heroes.
	Map is a small oval halved by impassable line with 2 bridges - basically, its so small that tactics turn into a mess very fast. You can spawn units on your half of the map and some units are so fast that they can reach enemy nexus in just few seconds from there. Thus, matches are lightning fast. And even if tug-o-war prolongs, developers push it to the end manually - resource generation rate constantly increases. So after just couple minutes game already turns into ""smash all buttons really really fast"".
	Biggest R&D failure I found - alot of things allow you to spawn units on enemy territory (read: right on his face) which allows them to instantly hit nexus without giving a fk about anything else. This doesn't make game any more fun not even mentioning it ruins fundamental principles of rail RTS.
	Btw game is strictly multiplayer: there are like 10 AI ""Challenges"" but that is just your tutorial - extremely easy and done in no time (read above: lightning fast matches), after that - PVP duels only.
	Last but not least, game lacks a general style and fixed setting, as for me. Overall it looks like fantasy.. then there are space marines, drones and spaceships.. and then ALL OF A SUDDEN flying kawai rabbit head with huge anime eyes and cute ears. Like, wtf? It's technically Conflux but it feels like Clownery instead, for some reason.
	Few cosmetics are here too if you wish. Particularly, you can decorate your half of the map with arena skin, they look gut and cost gut.
	Kind of fun game for 1 evening, but I don't recommend spending any money unless you are fan of rail strategies and be like ""yeah, this is totally my game"".[/i]

21836,I got this game from bundlestars for free. I'm enjoying it so far :)
21837,"This is what i have been waiting for... it's like Clash Royale but for the PC... it's pretty fun...  but for now YES, i recommend it. so i will update this review with time."
21838,"First of all, I got this game for FREE..which did play a little influence on my review. This game is some light fun and I enjoy it. It feels like a combination of classical chess, Hearthstone and Heros of the Storm. The goal is to destroy the other's base, while protecting your own using minoins. 

For an early access game, this is easy to get into and is very functional. Is this game worth $20? I am not sure as I've only played around 40 minutes. It is definitely worth $10 at the very least."
21839,best 11 minutes in my life
21840,Best game i ever
21841,"Somewhere between a card game and an rts/tower defense. Got a few free keys from the developer, they're quite generous and the gameplay is pretty fun for what it is. Simple yet allows for a bunch of different strategies. 

I really dont understand the negative reviews, this game isn't a mobile game."
21842,"if you like clash royale or star wars force arena there is no reason for not to like this game...
its fukken ohsem!!!"
21843,жёпная игра
21844,This game is so fuckin nice
21845,Very Strategic game.
21846,"This game its pretty nice, its like Clash Royale. Its fun and competitive, but relaxing at the same time. 8/10

Pro:

-A lot of cards
-Nice looking graphics
-Multiple heroes with different pasives

Cons:

-Game its in early acces so gliches should be expected
-The price its not cheap for this genre of game.


"
21847,"This game is really cool. While it's only in an early development stage it has decent graphics.
What I really liked about this game is the short game sessions it offers- each game goes on for about 3-5 minutes making the game enjoyable even for short periods of time.
I reccomend this game indeed :-)"
21848,"So far I have only played the single player. My first impressions:
Fun, fast(15 rounds or more in 1.5 hours), beautiful artwork. 

Will update when I have time to play online."
21849,"Wait, $20 aint worth it. Instead get Sakura Clicker while you wait 



: ^)"
21850,"A mixture of tower defense and trading card game, Minion Masters lets you command a small army of various creatures who will blindly follow your every order - usually that will mean being sent to certain death, but they’re loyal like that. In this online PvP game you must collect and craft minions with unique skills to build your army, then decide their movements on the battlefield in order to defeat your opponent.
It super fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale."
21851,"A game like this has no place being on Steam, especially for its given price. I received this game for free and even so, I feel scammed. Minion Masters had meager strategy, little depth, and its gameplay was atrociously dull. If you wanted to play Clash Royale, you can do so for free on mobile, making this game's existence redudant."
21852,"Oh hey, Steam started letting mobile games onto steam."
21853,7/10
21854,"First off, I like the fact that Betadwarf continues to have a trend that support toasters. Didn't think graphics would go that low, but I am glad that they do. 
Currently, the game is actually a fair amount of fun. I've only played 2 hours thus far, but from the concept, to the business model, I can accept it. The framework is great thus far, and there's a lot of potential. Given that Forced Showdown had a fair amount of depth to it, and there are similar trends, I hope that this game has just as much depth. 
And final thing to note; Seems like free copies are being given out, which is good. F2P is planned. Hopefully this game turns in to a not-so-hidden gem."
21855,"Not very good for its price
Unbalanced
Very little to do once youre done with singleplayer...literally only online so just an online game
Clash Royale"
21856,just.. one more .. match..
21857,this is a really fun game and i seriously love it :D  only *bad* thing i have so far seen is there is a ingame shop BUT then again which game these days does not have that option and it is not like you have to use it ... so i do not really see any bad things in this game so far
21858,"Minion masters is a game I personally enjoy. 
The visuals are nice, gameplay is smooth for me, there's lots of cards making it fun to create your own deck.
You do notice that some cards are a bit stronger than others, but every game has balancing issues these days, you just have to adapt.

I do think that 1000 coins for one card is a bit high though, halving that would be much better since it would takes months to save up gems for an orange tier card if you're not lucky enough. Or increase the coin per match reward. (Note that I have the premium pack so I already receive double coins, it's still slow, around 20 games for one card..)

The game should be free to play already instead of at launch. It'll help creating a much higher playerbase before launch, which the game could really benefit from. 
If the developers want to earn some buck for their product, I strongly suggest making skins for the heroes, as it's vanity, make it cool enough and people will want it, but it's not game changing.

Also suggesting that there should be a ""training hall"" where you can grab any card and any hero you want, to see how they work, and it would be very useful for practicing or trying out new decks or heroes.

I do recommend this game, as I enjoyed playing it, but it's not really worth the price it is right now.
Either wait for a sale or launch."
21859,"It's basically a PC version of Clash Royale that takes place in the Forced universe, but I've got to admit that I prefer this one.
It's a fun and simple game that you might want to play from time to time for some casual fun.
The games are quick but entertaining, which I really like a lot.
And one best thing about it is, that it isn't ""pay to win"" at all.

The game is also still in beta and is still gonna change a lot as time goes on.
So don't worry, there are most likely gonna be more different cards and so on later on."
21860,I like it.
21861,better version of clash royale on the computer
21862,Good Game
21863,This is what would it be like if Clash Royale had a son with a PC.
21864,Thats basically Clash royale but with heroes but I like the artwork! Would like it more if it was easier to get cards tho.
21865,"Its great fun i've been playing since this game came out. At first i thouth that the Reaver is too OP after I got out of wood division some guy just REKT me and i was like wtf i thouth Reaver is the stronger. Thats when i understood that each hero is unique and can be easily countered. This game isn;t pay2win you will get enough cards to beat any deck you just have to find that as the trailer says ""Counter the counter counter counter..."" This game doesin;t have pay2win system  like Clash royale."
21866,"This game is pretty neat. My friend David isn't a fan, but he can eat a dick. Seriously, though fuck you David."
21867,This game is good
21868,"[h1]Recommendation Update 3 - June 2021[/h1]
Legitimately one of my favourite games for both casual fun and a bit of competitive spirit. I've been coming back time and time again to play since beta, and I enjoy climbing up to at least diamond each season with all kinds of different decks. Lots of room for theory crafting, if that's your kind of thing, as well as just experimenting and seeing what works if that's more your style. I simply cannot recommend it enough for the wonderful price of /free/. 

I'm repeating myself a bit here, but I really doubt any of you will read past the most recent update anyway:

While I think the DLC is extremely overpriced, and paid season passes (and even free ones) are somewhat immoral, as well as unfair to people who don't have the time to just grind them out, BetaDwarf have been doing good things with the game, and giving plenty of content for free (including those DLC which are free on release - sign up to the newsletter to get notifications).

I genuinely do think the game is well balanced, even as a completely free to play title. There are constant balance changes, and plenty of new content drops. There is a learning curve, of course, but once you learn how the cards work and what counters them, you will find it a lot more forgiving (don't put money in expecting that'll help you skip the learning curve - it wont). There's always a good explanation for when you can't defend, and while learning how you build your deck(s), you'll have to choose and balance your strengths and weaknesses - because you cannot cover them all.

[h1]Recommendation Update 2 - December 2018[/h1]
I have a few concerns with some decisions being made, namely the removal of cards which I owned. In discussion regarding this, my mates and I reached a consensus that no card should ever be removed or reworked, only re-balanced to fit more suitably with the existing content. 

[u]Time for a rant[/u]
A particular card which I was very fond of, and spent currency to unlock - the ""drone force one"" (you can read about it, and its replacement, here: [url=https://minionmasters.gamepedia.com/Drone_Force_One]https://minionmasters.gamepedia.com/Drone_Force_One[/url]) has been replaced with a card which is effectively inferior, but most importantly, of a completely different design. When your cards and heroes have a certain theme to them, and an entire deck can be built around that theme (as I had done), you can't simply replace it with something else and call it a day; you're going to upset people. There is no reason this new card's stats couldn't have been what was applied to the card I liked instead of simply erasing it from the game. Yes, okay, I got given copies of the new card equivalent to what I spent on the original, but that's rather beside the point.

Alas, the game is now completely F2P and I highly recommend you give it a go. Despite my reservations preventing me from calling the game ""perfect"", it is still the most fun I've had playing a virtual card game and you should definitely check it out.


[h1]Recommendation Update 1 - October 2017[/h1]
So far, my only concern is that if you spend your currency on unlocking the wrong cards (such as you may do without much idea of which direction you want a deck to go), you might find yourself underpowered and struggling to compete with others because you've got a few different playstyles in your deck, but mastering none. The game gives daily chests which give you back some currency and several other modes where you can gain cards and currency (including the new draft mode, where you build a deck out of random cards which you don't even need to own!). 

The game itself is very solid with no huge imbalance that I've seen; every time I've found myself countered hard by an enemy, there seems to be changes I can make to my deck to mitigate that vulnerability. It's more about just deciding what you want your weaknesses to be, and whether you can simply out-damage your counter-decks. 

The community is active and social, as are the developers. You can get free content (cards, currency, other stuff) by signing up to the dev's newsletter. They even added a 2v2 mode, which you can also set up privately to play with 3 of your friends (though still without rewards).

This game is an absolute blast. It's what I wish Hearthstone became. Even if I'd forked out the 5 bucks for beta access, I would not be disappointed, whatsoever. This is probably the best card/tug of war game that I've ever played. 


[h1]Original Review - December 2016[/h1]
Seems pretty fun, worth playing. Not sure about buying, as the game may be free-to-play in the future. 

Balance might need some work for people whom haven't got a full card deck yet (I easily beat a specific boss, while my mate died over and over before passing it). 

There needs to be returns for playing with friends, currently you earn 0xp and currency for winning or losing a match against a friend - which is the majority of what I'm going to do, so long as there's no 2v2 or such modes. I'm actually keen to see more players, perhaps a 3 or 4 player free-for-all map, where your minions run in different directions based on where you place them (already a thing, as there's lanes, so this should be easy). The only problem could be balance with some of the cards and characters, but so long as its available outside of whatever ranked mode they have, I don't see the problem.

All in all, quite fun."
21869,At first when I started to play I was not too sure about this game but after playing for a few minutes I am now addicted to it.
21870,"Very Good Game, I like the graphic, and the gameplay too. It's very simple to play but need you use your brain to win."
21871,"Just finished the intro battles, Really good game tbh! I'm looking foward to see what the updates bring in the future! :)"
21872,Clash Royale on the PC with cooler minions and a sense of humor. It needs time to grow but I really like it.
21873,"Fast Paced
Fun
Pretty Graphics
Nice Voice-work
Addicting

I'll give it an... 9.5 so far!
(WHAT? IT'S EA, SO IT CAN'T BE GOOD? TAKE IT BACK?... Imma rebel)"
21874,This Is Pretty Much Just A PC Version Of Clash Royale But Improved. Looks very nice but can get a bit laggy when there is alot of minions out at once in one area. I Think as long as the developers carry on with this game it will certainly be one that you will keep going back to
21875,"Very funny, easy and fast to play, i like because decks are only ten cards! models are pretties"
21876,"Cool game, I like the concept. Still needs some work, but could turn into a very cool game with not much work on their part. I enjoyed what they have done so far as well."
21877,"Kinda feels abit like a fast pased/no turnbased Heartstone game. Its should probaly not be 20 euro game, but then again it is a game you can keep playing on and off for a long time, just like heartstone. As for me a good game is a game you injoy and can atleast play for 50+ hours. And you should easy be able to play this for 50+ hours, maybe not in a row but over time.

I did not find any bugs or mistakes in the game, so thumps up for that to.

Buy it, play it and make it as a champion! Have fun and injoy a 6/10 star game."
21878,Easy to get in and have a lot of fun. Only problem is that if you want a good deck you have to play a bit more. Overall i would definitely recommend this game.
21879,"I was one of the few players 'recruited' for the closed alpha. At the time, the Stormbringer hero was vastly overpowered but none the less the game was fun. I hope to see it grow into something big, as I loved there second game Forced Showdown."
21880,"Cool game
Its basically hearthstone turned RTS with a few less cards
but it gets updated frequently and has fun and intuitive gameplay"
21881,"Fun little Clash Royale copy. If you enjoyed CR, you will like this. Nice progression, quick qeues, fun quick games. Clean UI and controls. Basically, you have a deck of 10 cards (minions, buildings, spells...) that cycle continously as you place them on the 2 lane map. They will advance through the lane attacking your opponents cards and whoever destroys the opponents main building wins."
21882,Never played these types of games but this is awesome!
21883,"Snowballing simulator.

10/10"
21884,"I really enjoy the game, and i've only been playing for 2 hours. 
It's not too hard, and it's only unbalanced sometimes, (Or im being salty because i lost)
But here are my Pros and Cons
Pros -
Interesting Concept
Fast queue time for Multiplayer
Many rewards and chances to build your deck
Not too hard to win, and games are usually close

Cons -
Limited Solo Play (MOREEE I WANT MOREE)
It can be slightly pay to win, but if you play enough/strategize you'll do fine
STILL IN TESTING (SO GAME GLITCHES SHOULD BE EXPECTED, DEAL WITH IT)

Thanks <3
I love it so far!"
21885,cancer game
21886,"Great game, needs some sort of other single player mode."
21887,There is a bug that virtually makes it impossible to play because you get a 5 second delay on all your action even with good internet. This also happens while on menus and out of a match.
21888," Sadly, this game is either pay2win or grind without end. To get enough resources to build a decent deck you have to grind alot. Even with the ""Premium Pack"" you have to invest way too much time to actually get anywhere. The devs are looking at Hearthstones business modell any try to copy it in regard of how you much you get when you play which is certain death for some small indie game on steam."
21889,"Early Access V 0.9.1

Before we start I got a game key for free during alpha but since Early access I bought the premium upgrade at the same price as all new players since early access launch because currently premium upgrade includes in all new purchases.

The game revolves in the Forced universe. Betadwarf has made two prior games, Forced and Forced Showdown. I have played extensivly Forced Showdown and had alot of fun with it. WIth that in mind I had very high hopes for betadwarfs third game, Minion Masters.

Minion Masters is the PC-variant of Clash Royale were players aquire cards (minions, spells, buildings) and put togethor a deck of 8 cards and battle an random opponent. The goal is to lower the health of the opponents master by 3000 points.
(V.S friend battle is in development).

Tactics and counter knowledge is crucial to be a winner. All new players gets rubies, shards and gold because of the premium upgrade. Rubies are an purchable in-game currency (it is also rewarded by leveling up at certain levels and raise in leauge rank). Shards are also rewarded in the same regard as rubies, but are not purchable and can also be aquired if by spinning the power tower wheel (it is where you spend gold to get a random card). If you get a dublicate card, it is salvaged and you get shards in relation of that cards rarity.

The game is still in beta and under heavy development and balancing. Some cards might be a bit OP. But players with OP cards that plays badly, looses very easily against opponents with common cards. Many people complain over others that have aquired the rarest cards in the game (Legendarys). But the first Master rank I know of (Master is the highest rank in game currently) only played common and rare cards wich are the two lowest card tiers except for regulars that are awarded during the initial level up process. WIth that said. Rare cards does not equal a better card. Tactic and the know-how to counter the opponents card is crucial.

THe single-player campin consist of 3x5 battles I belive and is lack-luster at best. These servers more like a tutorial for the player to learn the game and level-up so that you can get most of the regual cards before you get to online-fightning and raise ones battle-rank. THis is a bit sad since I am a heavy single-player player.

You get one Master at the beginning. Other Masters go through a free-roatiation system that you can play for free at those time. If you want to be sure to always play those Master you have to buy it with the in-game resources. A Master have diffrent attacks and also a perk system. By controlling bridges in the game you get XP that levels up the Master. Up to 4 Perks can be aquired where that fourth and last perk is always Mana frenzy.

All in all I'm happy and surprised how much I enjoy this game. Updates comes regualary and new cards get added with it. New Masters are gonna be added soon. The devs are very communicative and listens to feed-back. Nerfing and buffing is gonna be frequent in teh early stages, but that is to be expected in an EA-game.

Graphics 9/10
GAmeplay 8/10
FUn-factor 9/10

(A tip to new players: Before you spend all your rubies and shards. Read forum and play a couple of battles and ask for tips. THat way you gonna know wich cards to craft and what tactic to use. This gonna reduce alot of frustrations early on before you can get most of the cards)"
21890,"Got the game for free about 2 months ago. Game itself is a generic arena type. 2 lanes and who spawns more wins. It was interesting to play for first 10-20 matches, but got boring affter it. They added in game purchases to buy cards so basicaly you can overpower non-paying players with ease. 
When the game came out as a release 2nd december, I just wanted to check some reviews. Saw 20e price tag, laughed hard and closed it.
Basicly you pay 20e for a generic arena game, with not so big community, and when you get in game, people can pay more. Cashgrab at its finest.


-Gameplay
-Paied transatcion (p2w)
-Overpriced
-No tactics just get few  cards that spawn minions and you can easy win"
21891,Got this game from a key to try... so far hand down no other way to put it the game sucks. Yes it's fun and fast and good but when you have a  swarm unit thats rare and can take out a non rare thats anti swarm game needs fixed its like saying anti tank mines wont destory a tank because there china made ... total bullshit
21892,"if u wanna waste money and play a shit game, then this game is for you"
21893,"1) Why have ranks if they are only ""rough"" guidelines to MM? I've been wood 5 and gone against stone 5's. That's five ranks in difference. If you don't have enough players to make it matter then reduce your levels.
2) Don't make your rewards based on long win streaks. Just makes it stressful when you have a string of losses.
3) Why are there THREE currencies in the game? No reason and it makes it too much to deal with. You're better off just rewarding players with Reactor packs then forcing them to go through the horrible shop.

"
21894,Is this a mobile game? It definitely feels like a mobile game.
21895,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tt8Fq8n69I

My opinion of this game is a neutral one. Minion Masters is a mix of Hearthstone and Clash Royale. It is a multiplayer game where you select a hero and then create a deck of 10 cards. You battle other players to move up in ranks and get rewards. 

Minion Masters looks great, runs great, and is a ton of fun to play. However, it is really lacking in content, the player base is tiny, and the game is a massive grind. The $20 entry fee is a joke as it is obvious this game will go free to play once it is done and the premium upgrade is a farce aside from the in-game currency that it provides.

2x gold for 1 year is pathetic. You earn 20-30 gold per win and 10 per loss. With this upgrade you get 50-60 gold or 20. Meanwhile, a token (this game's equivalent of a card pack) costs 1,000 gold and you get either a card or shards (this game's equivalent of Dust). The permanent EXP upgrade is decent until you hit level 20, then it becomes a slog to level up.

Speaking of tokens, check this out:

21900,"I had the game as giveaway and I've read ""About pricing"", this game is like a mobile game free to play.
The game is rapidly boring and multiplayer without interest, it will be pay to win to have best card. Then only a matter of luck to draw good card at good time. For casual gamers only."
21901,The animaation are to slow need to work in that it´s like clash royale but so slow
21902,"Deck-based tug of war in real time. You build your deck, choose your hero (big gameplay difference, not only cosmetic), and try to outdamage the other guy. Cards have mana cost, but do not run out in a game, they just keep coming. 

Pretty obviously it's gonna be a freemium game, you have 3 types of currency, some cards are obviously better than other, gold getting rate is abysmally slow, but game itself is pretty fun. I wouldn't pay for it though."

I love summoner games, I was thinking only a month ago or so that I wish we had more summoning war games, I usually need to get my fix playing SC2 or WC3 maps.. but now? I think Minion Masters wins.

It needs more to do solo though, I've beaten all the challenges in about an hour."
21908,"Who's writing the review?
A long time player who even made it into the top 3 of the global ladder this season:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=950681417

The basic concept of this game is ""Clash Royale"" - but this game has A LOT more depth to it, better balancing and very active devs, as well as weekly updates and regular events.

[u]Accessibility?[/u]
While a lot of bad reviews of - sorry to be so direct - bad & salty players claim that this game is pay to win, this game is truely not. I've made it to mid Platin with a deck consisting out of only basic and a single common (green) card which is accessable to anybody who played for 20 minutes.
Here's the deck (might be outdated when you read this)
http://steamcommunity.com/app/489520/discussions/0/1354868867706847916/
(Also - as you can see in the first screenshot - the top 2 decks consist of 8 basic cards)

[u]Variety[/u]: 
A lot of people at lower ranks complain about about low variety - resulting from bad players tendency to copy the same, expensive top player deck and wasting all their resources on something they don't need. At higher ranks however variety increases a lot. From gold rank onwards - and especially within the top 20 - the meta is incredibly fluent with everybody tweaking their decks against each other. 

[u]Summary:[/u]
This game deserves a lot more positive attention than it gets, it's simply that a lot of people see that this game's underlying concept is Clash Royale and judge a book by its cover instead of reading a few pages first. This game has a lot more strategic layers than other games under its seemingly easy surface and skill is getting rewarded incredibly well.

Also notice that while the recent reviews are mixed (because they had server trouble and a delayed patch ONCE in a year...) the game still has  2867/3507 positive reviews which equal a 81,75% positive review rate."
21909,This is an awesome game. Thought I would try it for a few minutes and ended up playing it for hours.
21910,"Crashes a lot but is a lot of fun to play.  It's free, and it doesn't push premium content very much.  I got the premium upgrade DLC in a Humble Bundle Monthly deal, but I think you could enjoy this game without any premium items.

Edit-Dec 9, 2016: Premium DLC gave me some additional wiggle room with the cards.  If not for that, I may have quit playing already."
21911,Too simple. Gets boring quick. Play Duelyst instead.
21912,"The game is amazing. All those who complain about it not being ""free to play"" cause you can buy rubies with money and get cards faster are just some cry babies. The game offers you free in game currency when you level your account  when you play online matches or when you do the daily challenges. So far I have seen no bugs and got no disconnects from the server.  The game is very easy to understand and easy to play also a lot of fun."
21913,Got This Free :D btw this game is an awesome tactical game.server work great and i fell loved with this one :D
21914,"Glorified Clash Royale. Though after playing it up to the Flying minion tutorial, my laptop shutdown and when launching this app I'm stuck to the wallpaper after logging in. Typing to the chat says not connected to server trying to connect"
21915,love it
21916,"Great Game even on low Graphics
looks like clash royale but the game is better
tons of battle 
tons of character
tons of card"
21917,Been having a blast with it. Jumped on and tryed it since I got it with my Humble Bundle monthly sub. The matches  fast and its a game you can just jump on play a few games and get off or go hard core and get a high online rank.
21918,pretty good
21919,"Awesome Game that is Clash Royale Style bot i myself prefer this game over clash royale

Pros
- Good Graphics
- Balanced Cards
- Good Variety In Cards
- Got Steam Traiding Cards
- Nice Multiplayer
- Not that much P2W 
- Steam Achivements

Cons
-Microtransactions

Score 7.5/10"
21920,"Recieved through Humble Bundle.
Went through all Training. Having a good time.
Purchased several Heroes. Enjoying the diversity.
Played several rounds online. Got to Stone 4.
People found out about Ratbo. Uninstall."
21921,"Really enjoying this game. Yeah it costs $15, but they give you like 30 card packs (I got nearly every card in the game), 2k shards (enough for a legendary), a bunch of gold. The level progression is quick and full of rewards. The gameplay can be clunky at times, but for early access this is a really fun game. Cards don't have levels so I don't understand people saying P2W. This is no different then hearthstone except the cards duke it out like Clash Royale. I will continue to play this. 

https://youtu.be/mziMcbYgjXc"
21922,Awesome game and very balanced!
21923,"I really enjoyed playing this game, even though I'm not good at.
The game is about a war between two sides: you versus the other, and fight with cards or in other words ""heroes"" (you get randomly).
There are some weapons that feel too strong nor balanced enough.
( edit:From what I can see they are working on it-ver0.9)
But this game really fun.
I had no performance problems, even though my computer is very old.
I wrote this review for Version 0.8"
21924,"First of all, I got the game from the humble monthly, take that as you will.

The game does not seem to be P2W to the degree as others claim. I do have the premium update from the bundle, but it only makes things slightly faster. Mostly the leveling. The double gold from matches, while nice, doesn't feel like a huge advantage, as the majority of your gold comes from daily quests, and those are rather generous. The daily quests I got so far always gave me enough gold for 1-3 new card packs. 

With this in mind, as far as acquiring cards go, at the moment it is far less pay to win than other games out there. Legendaries are also not hopeless to get at all, and assuming you get some cards that work well together, they are not even mandatory. (Up to a certain point I guess, you are unlikely to be the best there is without a highly optimised deck in such games.)

You really do need to have a well-built deck to get anywhere though. If you are just using random cards without a gameplan in mind, it can feel like a hopeless slugfest.

It should also be noted that while there are always free heroes available, and you get a perfectly usable one for free, they seem rather hard to unlock for F2P players, and a deck that works well with one hero, might not do so well with another. That is really my only criticism, and to be fair, the developers do need to make a living here. 

As someone who played Clas Royale but wasn't going to drop a fortune on it, I find the game (at least its current iteration) highy enjoyable, and much less grindy."
21925,"Love the game, hate the pricing. Luckily got this game from the monthly bundle."
21926,"Got to silver1 without losing, then got absolutely crushed by a nazi weeaboo that found my profile and kept spamming 'sieg heil'. Not sure in which other game that can happen"
21927,"OLD REVIEW:

I really enjoyed this game during the first few alpha tests. Yes,its a lot like clash royale,but it still had some unique elements to it. However,im unwilling to support a developer that puts microtransactions and premium currency in his early-access pay2play game. This is just wrong on so many levels,atleast finish developing the game before milking the playerbase even more.

NEW REVIEW 2019:

Damn me,they actually changed a lot of stuff and im having tons of fun playing duo-ranked with a friend. This is free2play done right in my opinion,everything is rather transparent and its not that hard to get a deck that will compete even on higher levels. Ofcourse,getting the most expensive decks out there will still take time or money depending on your preference,but the thing is,not everything thats expensive beats stuff thats common/available to you from the start. Honestly,all i can say at this point is that you should definitely try it out,even if you didnt like it 2 years ago like me. Its amazing how they did a 180 on their business model."
21928,"Fun game, great for both long sessions and just a few quick games.
It still needs more cards, but they have been adding them fairly fast so far."
21929,"Ignore the little kids reviewing so far dont get me wrong the game has an in game store but without spending a dime i have been dominating not hard to get good but hard to master give it a shot and unless your 12 years old and like to bitch u will be just fine 10/10 
"
21930,"If you hate mobile games on pc and hate to lose all your online duals then no this is not for you but, if you love crapy mobile games for your pc and pay to make sure you win, then this game is for yous. With out legendary cards forget it."
21931,"[h1]One Word: Unbalance.[/h1] 
For someone new like me everybody kill me in like 30 to 60 seconds. The game will be fun for at least 3 hours, after you did the PvE fight, you're done. The game is like other card game you have to loot card with some kind of token but in that case the loot is pretty broken. 
[h1]YES BROKEN.[/h1]
On 30 Token I have get 15 cards that I was already having so now I am screwed with some bad card and everybody killing me in like 40 Seconds..."
21932,"Review taken from http://moco.net , Based off 4 hours of play. http://wp.me/p6Upnu-sa
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There’s nothing quite like Minion Masters game play out there, but it does use the currently popular deck building, and earning methods out there. Let me explain, let’s start with the game play. You create your own deck of cards, aka units. In the game four unit cards are presented to you at random. Cards are dragged and dropped onto your side of the battlefield within set space limits, and then the units walk into your opponents area and try to take down their hero. While your opponent is doing the same, your units meet theirs and they battle it out. Cards are set in tiers one through eight, and the higher the tier the longer you wait to be able to summon them. Games are usually take no longer than four minutes with some lasting as little as under two.

Minion Masters BattlegroundMinion Masters’ fast paced game play makes it super addictive. Dragging and dropping your unit cards is fun, and watching your units overcome your opponents is rewarding. A deck consists of ten cards, they are labeled from common to supreme I made a themed deck built around buildings, I had a lot of building cards and one card spawned as many minions for as many buildings that I had on the field, it’s a lot of fun toying around with it and tweaking it to your liking. There are also different heroes to choose from, changed weekly. One hero is good at close combat, another ranged, and another with the ability to raise units from the dead. As you play your hero gains experience which unlock abilities. There are also two bridges, once a unit crosses it, your side controls it, which gives you even more experience.

The game is generous with giving you free units as well. You gain gold by winning games and one thousand gold gets you one unit, chosen at random. You receive one thousand coins just about every other level. Something I didn’t like was that, you are stuck with one deck until you reach level twenty, then you get two. This just isn’t enough to just make a deck to mess around with, while keeping your serious deck separate.

Overall I enjoyed Minion Masters quite a bit and can see myself playing it for some time, I hope it does well."
21933,It is fun but ain't the balanced game ever...I mean stun minions vs stun minions is like who its gettin first da hit...Still beta so I give a reccomend!
21934,"- maybe because I love FORCED
- maybe because I feel a lot of empathy towards the devs
- maybe because it's perfect for casual gaming
- maybe because it's the very first time I enjoy myself in a card game
but I LOVE IT!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit after 100+ hrs of play:
- amazing 2vs2 mode
- it's updated almost once a week with a lot of new stuff/balances/modes
- its community is growing really fast

Buy it and support these guys! You won't regret it!"
21935,"Lots of depth to this game in the variety of cards available.  I hope they continue to add to it over time as I love games that give agency through a selection of units.  Beta Dwarf really knows how to strike a nice balance in visuals and depth, giving their games a very distinct feel.

One thing you're going to see throughout all the reviews so far are that people really enjoy this game, despite not liking the payment system.  I wouldn't let complaints over the purchase model sway you away from trying it, though.  It's something easily changed and I'm sure they're taking that feedback seriously.

My suggestions would be:

 - Persistent elements of some kind.  Either per-player or even with the cards in their collection, still waiting for a game to go down that path and this seems like a great place for it to happen!
 - Clean up the UI when not in a game, having my arena is okay, but it feels cluttered at times.
 - Add polished transitions between UI-mode and actual game mode.
 - Add multiplayer modes where I can play with a specific friend, not just random matchmaking.
 - Add different types of and larger maps.  Not just the two-bridge design.
 - Clearly this game would be awesome on Android and iOS!
 - Address peoples' concerns over the pricing model. I'd hate for all these negative reviews to sabotage this title as I would like to continue playing it!

Again, these suggestions take what is clearly a solid concept for a game and would make it twice as compelling."
21936,"The game  is fun  but is need more works to be a strartgey game because only 64 cards and less than 10 class of unit.

Hope the game getting better everyday!"
21937,"Really basic gameplay and lack of variety in the ""masters"" quashed the exciment I had for the concept.  Can't recommend it in it's current state but maybe with future content expansion."
21938,"Cute game, quite engaging. So far I only did the battles vs. the AI and won all of them quite easily - well, they are the introduction to battles vs. players.

Positive:  
+ Action rich lane-defense system.
+ Well thougt out game mechanics
+ varying masters (the guys we players pick as proxy) with different skillsets
+ AI-enemies are not lobotomized
+ large variety of minions

Negative:
- Payment for Premium Access suggests a gigantic boost. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against microtransactions - even programmers and designers have to eat and servers need energy too - but the act of balancing it is hard. If you can do it as pay for convenience and not pay to win, it's perfect. Well, a bit of balancing ^^
- common minions seem to get replaced with way better rare minions (lower costs to place them). This is a mayor problem. To be a pay for convenience game this would need to be balanced. 


Current recommendation: Give it a try as it is a nice game - don't pay too much though."
21939,For an Early Acces game is very very good!
21940,"an essential monster in this game, can be purchased with 'In-App Payments.'"
21941,"Horrible mobile-like pay-to-win model on a super dumb down game. Basically, place minion on board and that's it. Do not buy this game, unless you are the kind of person that enjoys a game that requires no skills whatsoever and wants to pay to get the best hand of cards."
21942,gay
21943,"Great game but...
it should be for free or 5 € and not 20.

there is no pay to win the game runs smooth and is fun and helps to kill some free time."
21944,Basically Clash Royale but there's no dumb forts and you can choose different castles with unique skills.
21945,"Got this game for subscribing to their e-mail.

I've had fun with the game, kinda sad there is no real single-player but I guess that's hard to do in this kind of TCG/Arena kind of game. You unlock cards at a decent rate, there are so far 6 heroes that play differently(ish) from each other, and you can make really different decks as well!


I would NEVER in my life pay for this though. And since the last update they added a new currency, wich is premium. My thanks for playing during the closed alpha was 300 of this new currency (Unlocking an arena, a cosmetic, costs 1400.)

Good game if you can get it for free, or maybe 3 bucks."
21946,so i played the closed alpha tests and its an ok little game it has a cool concept with rts elements just needs alittle bit more ballencing done
21947,"Best game I've played in quite some time. I fell in instant love with this game is great & exactly what I was looking for!

My initial enthusiasm has lessened. I still enjoy an occasional game, wish it was on PS4."
21948,Nice game clash royal look a like
21949,"Really great game, feels like a game the developers can keep expanding on and it will keep getting more interesting, same kind of appeal as hearthstone, Castle fight from WW3 and Card battle in SC2 :D"
21950,"One of the best game i ever played.
It have all of your desires.
 ------Why do i recommend it:
-strategy game
-not based on level,based on skill,u can easy win versus a higher level
-feels good to play with bots,not easy but not hard,perfectly for training
-nice players
-good turorials :o
-graphic 10/10 
-not a fcking hearthstone
-good ranking system
-no lag,optimized for low spec pc's too
-good gameplay :D
-you don't have to spent money for good cards,just play and open free chests,get free cards on every level
I recommend you to buy this game :D"
21951,"Unbalanced, right now is pay2win."
21952,"Super fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)"
21953,Really fun Tug-O-War gameplay & great graphics!
21954,"THE GAME IS REALLY GOOD.
BUT!
Matchmaking is a complete disaster, like a fucking joke! I was at Gold4 rank and stepped down Silver2. I wanted to get back to at least gold but all of my matches were against opponents are above 5 to 10 rank above me, so naturally I couldn't even get back up to Silver1 for 12HOURS STRAIGHT!! And now I'm uninstalling this shit.
This game is already pay to win thanks to Premium DLC and Humble Bundle. People probably will play faster than you because of premium and you can't win against premium AT ALL. This game was awesome in Alpha but I guess the developers sold out themselves..."
21955,very gud
21956,"If you've ever played Battleforge, this game is for you! Like Battleforge, the game does have microtransactions and there is somewhat of a ""grind"" to it. The matches are generally <6-10 minutes long so it's a good pick up and put down. I received the game for free, but I also do feel the price might be a bit high when microtransactions are somewhat needed (Similar to Hearthstone grinding). The game is really thought out and I enjoy a simple game that does require strategy.

DISCLAIMER: There is a clear advantage when people pay to get cards, there are a total of 66 cards, but I am five hours in and there is definitely an advantage to having a larger advantage if someone paid for rubies which is in game microtransaction currency."
21957,"Disclaimer: Got this game from HumbleBundle, so I didn't pay the asking price for it.

Update after 19h of playtime:
Starting at the Gold league you will constly beeing matched against oponents mostly 1 or 2 ranks higher than you and very many players obviously have bought the best cards available and will roflstomp you.
Be prepared to shed money in their store as the free gold or rubies you casualy get will not make you competitive!

Cute little TCG game. Easy to pick up and little tutorial to get you started. You can play solo or online against human adversaries. Gameplay is like any other TCG out there. Your mana is raising constantly and you play your units according to their mana value. You get XP for winning battles.
When you level up your profile you earn cards and money. With this money you can ransack the ingame shop.
Wait..... a shop? But the game costs $/€ 19.99!
Doesn't matter, it has an ingame shop where you can buy your Heroes (called Masters) and arena skins. If you don't want to buy your Masters you can use some of them for free. There is a rotation for what Masters can be used - kinda like Heroes of the Storm, except you need to buy the game.
If you want to spend money, you can go and craft those legendary units and faceroll all those who didn't spend money in the shop.
So this game is yet another P2W game.
Because of this P2W aspect and that they obscenely are asking for 20 bucks for the game (and after Early Access another 20 bucks for the premium content) I absolutely can't recommend this game."
21958,not doing enough squats
21959,"I hope they add more content... Like a lot more content.... like atleast 20x what there currently is because at the moment its only fun for about 30 minutes then its boring, would make a really good mobile game though not really my kind of pc game :/ will see what its like after early access though."
21960,"Edit: 8/25/19 I decided to pop back into the game to see how it has come along. Worse than ever. Not one of the bugs I put in reports of over a year ago has been fixed, and now there's all new bugs and freezing. There's also a far worse balance than there used to be. 

Edit: The community is pretty toxic and awful, the devs stand in support of said toxic crowd, so beware if you can't handle that kind of environment. It is akin to MOBAs and survival games in that regard. The game itself is pretty decent, but the people are awful. 

On to the original review! 

TL:DR Definitely worth at least checking out, but don't expect to be competitive without a ton of grinding or dropping real cash.  

Minion Masters is basically a Starcraft mini-game with a stand alone client and original art. 

That's not a bad thing, Starcraft has spawned at least two gaming genres. So on that alone it has potential. 

Right now some balance issues, but that'd be expected. It also has standard CCG purchases that let real money people assemble a better deck much quicker and easier than grinders. 

I have not run into lag issues yet, but because of the nature of this game if lag issues pop up it could really hurt the gameplay because a lot of skillful timing is involved, and the gameplay is what is worth checking out the game even if you aren't a wallet warrior. 


Gameplay consists of summoning units who will automagically fight your battles for you, or cast effects on the field. Basically a card battle without the waiting.


Came back to play some rounds, they've made the game even worse than ever. They shrunk the arena for some absurd reason, making the game field way less interesting. On top of that, the shrinking made all the hitboxes wonky and things go off chasing things that are not the visually closest target, despite the game thinking it is. It also makes it so if you're placing units far, far back...sometimes it'll randomly snap to another spot and send it out in the wrong location. None of these problems existed before they shrunk the arena, for no good goddamn reason. (Reason is probably to make the game more mobile friendly, one of the banes of PC gaming.)"
21961,"Great game, don't fall into the negativity.  This game is solid and fun as heck!  The average wait time for an online match is roughly 5-10 seconds. The single mode is repetitive because its the same tutorial just at harder difficulties. The main part of the game is the online mode and it is wonderful! I definitely say get this in the Humble Bundle Monthly package!(December only)"
21962,"Super fun - Needs tweeks

Don't play this game if you aren't prepared for playing against other players as your main objective.

THIS GAME HAS NO STORY BECAUSE THE STORY IS ALL IN THE GAME ""FORCED"""
21963,This is an early access title that allows for a ton of microtransaction purchases that lead to it being very Pay-to-Win. You simply can't compete with people who are higher level or have better cards than you. I don't believe the developer has really considered the tuning values of the cards or how the ranked system operates (everyone starts at the bottom).
21964,"If u get it like realy  cheap or for free its ok, but the full price for a game with ""in game purchases"", no story line, no pve, no chalenges, only the multyplayer and 12 single player mission, its not a good deal. I played vs the same AI with the same minions and the same strategy, sometimes i win, sometimes the AI can spawn minions that are 4 or more mana points faster then i could spwan 2 or 3 mana points minions. Maybe in time it will have more content and it will be balanced, but for now the 19,99 price tag its a *******."
21965,"I..just don't know.

The IDEA is neat. It reminds me of the old Magic: The Gathering: Duels Of The Plainswalkers game on PSX. You summon your monsters when you ahve mana, and they walk across the field. If they run into an enemy, they attack it.
If not, they attack the enemy summoner.

The problem lies in the fact that you have ZERO control of what your Minions attack.
Or what YOU attack, for that matter.

I have seen games lost because 'You' attack the GIANT, 1000 HP minion doing 3 damage, and ignore the 5 smaller minions that doe bigger damage but die in one hit.

So 'You' sit there, forced to attack the big guy while any smart player would smash the little guys first.
Sure, you can summon minions near the smaller enemies and HOPE they attack them, or cast a spell IF you have one in your deck and IF you have the mana for it.
Too random to fele like you won or lost via skill, that.

Plus, the Archer you start as gets 'Global Range' when he levels up..which means he starts attacking the enemy Summoner if there are no enemy minions in play.
That's free damage the enemy Summoner cannot block, dodge, or divert. A bit OP, if you ask me.

Sorry, the idea is good but overall, this game is..lackluster, dull, and not well balanced.

You just summon AI-controlled minions with QWER until someone wins. It's about as fun as an idle or clicker-game, only multiplayer."
21966,"Great Game, I dont think its pay to win because its really situation based, learning to combat different types of enermies its abit tricky"
21967,"So I really love this game, it is fun, its fast and its good to just pick up and play.
The only thing I do not like is its Pay to Win! And for a game that in not free to play
is pretty shitty, Make the game free and have micro transaction, or make people pay for the title
and get rid of it. The amount of people I have played who have spent loads for cards is mad! so until
it changes I will give negative feedback. Will keep playing as its fun, but the gring is slow for so called free 
players who actually paid for a game in the first place.... madness I know"
21968,"This game at a glance didn't inspire me to play it, but upon giving it a little bit of time of content it really drove me and make me want to play more, sadly I'm unable to invite my friends into 1 v 1 (YET) but soon I know it will be, and I'm super excited to play it with those I know who have it.

My adreneline spiked during a 1 v 1 online, despite it being a strategy game my heart was pumping while pushing out the most units I could and I hope to inspire to building a flood based deck, I really look foward to how this game progreses, it has great promise and I look forward to future updates and features, like at least an 8/10 game! I hope you have fun devleoping this game develpers! And I wish to play this game long into the future."
21969,"I am lucky enough to get this game off the humble bundle, because I don't have to worry about refunding my purchase. This is a pay to win game. You spend cash in-game to get better cards even at the lowest level. So pay 100 Dollars = Tons of rare, powerful cards you can summon to beat people even at entry level. My first Pvp match was me simply getting swamped with cards/rares/epics I had 0 Answers to.

The PVE campaign gives you 4 tokens ish, you can also buy 2500 Gems worth of tokens for purchasing the game. There is no real restrictions to your deck except for the cards you place in it. So early game you can just wait till you have enough to summon 2 beef cards with great damage/hp and steamroll your opponent in dirt league. Sounds like a phone game put on steam, just about the same low tier quality too. Save yourself frustration unless you have 200 Bucks to burn to ""Be a pro"" at this game."
21970,I got an email containing a code for this. It was complete shit. It is not worth installing or playing. It is a wate of time. Please Don't Buy This Shit.
21971,"I am enjoying this game a lot. It is pretty straight forward, whoever can spam the most strategic minnions in the most strategic places wins the match. The matchmaking works fine and there seem to be people actively playing. I will say the price is a bit steep. I'd wait for a sale then buy.

-Casey"
21972,"Great concept, really love it!"
21973,"Games really addictive, medium learning curve; dont rush into multi and expect to win all games.
Some cards a little strong, but for early access its fun!
"
21974,"I do like this game, but right now it isn't great. Some things are objectively better than others, which makes it almost imposible to win against some other players. From what I can see, this game doesn't have any bugs or glitches or anything like that. I will continue to play with game and I will change my review when they balance the game better. But untill then, I would not reconmend you buy this game."
21975,"steam version of clash royal! 
if you like it go for it 
if not go play heartstone or duelyst 
it's a fun game you need to try it"
21976,"Really, Like REALLY Addictive So...My First Card From The Power Token Was The Colossus (Legendary)

21977,why whould i play this if there is a better game? ham ham clash royale ham ham
21978,"Minion Masters is a paid ""freemium"" game which the gameplay is a blatantly copied from a freemium mobile game and tweaked just a bit.

There is no reason to play this game over the popular mobile game, Clash Royale, as that game has infinitely larger community. I hate games like Clash Royale where the game is heavily focused around in-app purchases (pay 2 win/gain advantage), but if you must play this game it's better to play the mobile game. You can play Clash Royale since mobile games have easier access.

Don't bother with this."
21979,"Good game, gameplay innovative
It is a fun game and more if fighting with friends"
21980,"This is a cute little game and its pretty addicting
it has a lot of depth and customization that lets you play the game according to your own play-style, the matches are pretty short but can get very intense and there is a lot of comeback potential.
As a dedicated League of legends player I still see myself playing Minion Masters  in between league matches or in the late hours. it has the same competitive and addictive feel but is a lot less Taxing and quicker matches.

I like the fresh vibrant and funny style of Minion Masters and the reward system

This game is still in Early Access and even tho the core game play is great, I'm look forwards to the User interface and introduction to the game getting some more polish and clarity, more Champions would also be a Plus

all in all great game with a lot of potential for the future (and im picky with my games) 
think i would rate it 8/10
"
21981,"Had so much fun playing this! It has very small match lengths 3-5 min but they get super intense. 
Collecting new minions  is fun and you get quite a lot very quickly so you can create a cool deck in no time.
Unlike other ""card"" games it is very fast paced and you need to do a lot more micro/placing units at the right timings and locations to win.
It feels a lot like an intense version of ""clash royale."" The bridge mechanics  and your heroes really set it apart and add a lot more depth which i think is needed on pc.
I would have liked some more singler player content but the game is about PvP so it makes a lot of sence, that the game focuses on that. 
It is  an awesome game to play between league of legends/dota queues aswell when waiting for match making. 
Finally theres also a nice community in the global chat everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Great game! Cu in there :)"
21982,"A rather interesting take on CCGs where everything happens in real time. Since there are no turns, mana grows by itself over time, and you have to both be smart about its conservation and not be too greedy waiting extra 10 seconds to drop that big henchman of yours. There's no way to command your units directly, but instead you have to carefully position creatures and towers on the field."
21983,"it's exactly the type of game i was looking for, it is similar to clash royale on mobile and I look forward to the full release

EDIT: it gets better at higher leagues, and it's easy to unlock cards"
21984,"To be honest i didn't know about this game. Got it from humble bundle and it's a blast to play 5-10 minutes matches, action, deck building. Only con is microtransactions."
21985,"It is a fun game :)

It is more addicting than i expected.
I like that games only takes few minutes."
21986,"**Note this review was written for the first beta prior to the launch and some things may have or may not have changed. I have not played the game since beta and will do a edit on the changes at a later date.** The game is really good but it does have it's flaw. I got this game for free for signing up to the beta and learning about it after buying the forced complete collection for $24 about a month ago (Oct/Nov 2016). The game is similar to the mobile phone game Clash Royale so if you are into those type of games then this game you should check out.

Now the break down of the game:


Pros:
+ The concept of having special abilities as you level up during the match (Passives+Abilities differs based on who you play as)
+ The role to have an objective of keeping both bridges rather than just 1 lane play as in other games makes it more enduring to choose your strategy
+ The visual concept is good considering it is from forced
+ The solo content is a plus with rewards to help you understand the game
+ No need to recollect to level up cards once you get them (this made me hate clash royale and eventually became a grind and pure cash grab with future legendaries taking over with only a few obtaining due to rng)

Cons:
- Needs a filter during deck building (Spells, units, buildings etc)
- Add multiple deck building layouts so you can switch between them
- Limited characters to play as with only 6 (Hoping to see alot more at launch with alot of bosses being playable)
- Land visuals applies nothing but cosmetics (would love for this apply some small buffs or something to help customize gameplay that you can earn through the ingame currency, i.e something like your units gain x% movespeed or health regen while on your side etc which will make it more vital in terms of defending and not getting steamrolled)
- No side towers means getting steamrolled is a bit easier and harder to defend once your falling behind + with the exp and hero passives makes it even harder if you are far behind.
- Some of the spells seem underused due to cost or value being too high in cost as it seems better to just steamrole and spam units to win.

Overall this game is surprisingly good. Its similar to clash royale in a way but without the hassle of having to spend your entire wallet to level up units. The variety in units itself is pretty spot on and if your familiar with clash royale then you will notice that some of the units play similar to those you have seen there henced I used some of my knowledge from that game when i played this one. 

Would I recommend you try it? Yes, this game is good and will keep you occupied for awhile. The quick matches help to be one of those quick play games you go to when you just want to play something to remove some stress or to play if your limited on time. At the moment I rate this game a 6 out of 10. My hopes is that it does not turn pay to win or force you to pay heavily just to unlock something that may be OP.  


What I would like to see implemented or improved:
1. Since your straying away from having side towers, I would like to see innovation like maybe have some random enviromental events throughout the match kinda like how it is in forced showdown. (Ex: like random fireballs that dmg any units, forst blizzards that slow and freeze all units on the field)
2. One problem I see is that if your far behind, it is usually GG considering your hero isnt too strong depending on who you play as and also because there is no side towers to help protect the waves. Also the exp+bonus for controlling the bridge makes it even more of a GG to someone who is far behind. Maybe consider adding like a loser's card bonus that you draw once you take X amount of dmg to your hero (some cards like maybe a windborne gust that pushes all units to your opponents side or maybe a hail freeze to freeze all units for x seconds or a free mana boost card that adds x amount of mana to help you formulate a small comback.
3. The concept of leveling up is good but I would like maybe more customizable characters. In forced showdown you have alot of class cards that influenced class skills. Maybe add in a skill tree where whatever character you choose, you are able to choose the attack it has, other effect, and passive effect. This way not every character plays the same and plays differently. (Wishing they do that in forced showdown as I would love to change alot of the melee play to have a different ability)
4. Add more defensive buildings (Since there are no side towers) as there seems to be like 2 or 3 that i have seen that are actual defense structures with the rest being a spawner building. (Possibly you can use this to customize the characters like idk maybe have side towers be based around the character of your choice, Like if you play as volvo then your side towers can be like fire golems that stand there and erupt a volcanic eruption from the floor that does aoe on the lane)
5. Here is an idea for innovation, Have a co-op play where you have 2 people playing together to fight either npcs or other 2 players. It would work like normal like it is now where there is 2 lanes but there would be 1 hero for each player allocated on separate lane on your side (each teammate protects one lane) and you both coordinate to protect your lane or your team mates lane by allowing the players to summon on either side of their field. If your hero goes down, then whatever lane you were protecting, those enemy minions will start to shift over from your lane once they reach your hero's corpse to your partner's lane till your both destroyed. (kinda like you have an attack from the front which is normal but because your teammate is dead, you will now have assaults from the back as well or technically in this case the side)"
21987,Fun And amazing game. the game is all about strategy and wining against oppenent. you have to get good cards but you can get the for free. thanks Developers for developing this amazing Game <3
21988,"Update: The game has changed, the meta is new, new cards are added and new game modes are added, but to me it feels more and more like the game is bleeding interest and they are trying to throw anything at it to make it work, but at the end it's still a game based around shitty Metas and bullshit cards that were broken as they were re-made.

Minion Masters feels a lot like certain mobile games, and it is pretty close to what it is.

While the devs do try to balance the game a few cards a time there are rarely times where you have a choice out of things. If you meet a swarm army and only have one or two AoE damagers for example you can't just discard the rest of your deck even if it is useless. It's very rare that you find a game you really enjoyed losing because of how fair it was, you either Roflstomp or you get Roflstomp'd.

And what really bothers me is the idea that you're supposed to Counter the Counters, this is not rock-paper-scissors and it will never be because of how a 10 mana ""paper"" can eat your ""Scissors"" and screw you with them.

The chat should be removed entirely as a feature, it's meant more as a way of Trolling than being helpful."
21989,"This game was a pleasant surprise from this month's Humble Monthly.  It combines real time strategy with the simplicity and deckbuilding of Hearthstone, with some obvious influences from League of legends.

It is in early access, so the balancing and the user interface are not stellar.  But as someone who once played dota competitively but no longer has time, I have had a lot of fun with the game"
21990,"The game has so much potential and I'm so excited to see more from the game itself and game's direction from the devs.

If you love Strategy games, give Minion Masters a chance!

Pros:
- Minions' concept/design
- Good Sound
- Short Match Length
- Arena (battle field)/Master mechanics

Cons:
- Chat System is limited at the moment"
21991,"Pay to win garbage that wants to be like hearthstone, worst game I've ever gotten in a humble bundle by far. Its a real shame that the people behind Forced wasted all their potential on a ""fee to pay"" game.

Better cards if you pay, you can craft the cards you want when you pay. This will become more obvious when the premium that everyone paid 20 bucks for wears off and more content is released. I was even getting extra bonuses to my ranking, not sure if thats due to premium or not though, and I'm not reinstalling to check.

Gameplay would be fun when it gets polished, but the last thing gaming needs is more freemium card games that reward spending cash with advantages. They should have just eliminated the cards and RNG completely and kept the core gameplay with some other gimmick like skins to lure in spenders."
21992,Clash Royale on Steam with a lot less pay-2-win.
21993,"I completed the single player in under two hours, which contains no story and just identical arenas with different skins and hero units you either are using ""on loan"" from the game, or that you have to purchase using in-game currency. Then I played one match of multiplayer and won. Nothing else to do except endlessly duel people. Meh. I have no further drive to play the game, whatsoever.

Wait a second...multiple currencies? You probably know what that means! It's a ""fee to play game,"" which is the current label for games you have to actually pay to play in the first place, with in-game purchases which can either use currency you earn at a torturously slow pace in-game, or real money to get what you want in the game. Other companies do it, so that makes it okay, right? And companies will claim it helps them to deliver you a better experience and continually update their games, etc., right? No, developers of these games realize that they're a freaking [i]slog[/i] to get through, and are kept that way to encourage gamers to spend real money in them. It's the reason such games are the grindiest of most games around: to try and tempt players into spending real money as a ""convenience"" to get what they want in the game. This is low. Just because something's legal, doesn't make it genuinely ethical. If a developer sees that the grind it too painful for so many people, the right thing to do would be to simply make there be less of a grind, but that won't line the developer's pockets with money, so instead, they go to the trouble of setting up an in-game store with real-world monetary purchases and different currencies.

The game is only $19.99 at its normal retail price, though, so it [i]has[/i] to be a better deal than even a really good $59.99 ""AAA"" title, right?  Let's add up the costs of the in-game stuff you can unlock, shall we? Cost of permanently unlocking all 5 current heroes (instead of getting certain ones on lone different weeks): 3150 rubies. Cost of unlocking all 8 arenas (they're the same arena with different skins, sound effects, etc): 6450 rubies. Alright, so 3150 + 6450 = 9600 rubies to permanently unlock the heroes (masters) and arenas. The cheapest way to buy rubies is in packs of 3350 for $18.99. So, we would need 3 sets of those, which is 3 x $18.99, which is $56.97 in real money, with 450 rubies left over from that purchase.

Getting more cards costs 750 rubies per attempt, and the other currencies you can use take quite a while to build up. I'm not even including additional card purchases. Just permanently getting all the masters and arenas, which is far too simplistic to be argued as something that would be DLC in a legitimate game, costs $56.97...on top of the $19.99 price tag the game will have any time it's not on sale, and that will run players a total of $76.96 before any purchases of additional cards (or should I say [i]attempts[/i] at getting cards. You could just get 25 or so units of one of the other currencies since that 750 ruby purchase just gets you a random chance at cards, currencies, etc.

Instead of spending $76.96 (and probably more if you want to hasten your acquisition of cards and such), to have access to content in the game that would be available in any game not designed to rip you off, I would actually recommend purchasing a $59.99 game. One might argue ""but DLC! You're forgetting DLC!"" No, I'm not. With rare exception, not having the DLC in a full game does not make the base game less enjoyable. However, not spending real money in a fee to play game almost always makes the base game less enjoyable, since the ""fix"" for the un-fun part of the game is for you to mash your dollars against your screen until your problems go away, instead of the developer programming their game to be so enjoyable that no one would be that desperate as to spend real money to save time in the game.

TL;DR: This is a fee to play game. Avoid it because there's not much to do in the game, and unlocking things is such a boring process that the developers would prefer you spend real money to bypass that boring process, and they would insult your intelligence by claiming it's to benefit you, the consumer, by continuing to update the game with the money they rake in. Fee to play is anti-consumer; always has been, and always will be, and this is simply unacceptable."
21994,Its like clash royale but its different its good game
21995,Its fun and i see it only getting better later on with updates!
21996,A lot of fun. Would definitely recommend it!
21997,"[b]To start I got this game as part of the December 2016 Humble Monthly.[/b]  So, it's not one that I would have normally picked up, but I'm happy to give my review.  To start the game is fun.  It's like a real time strategy meets deck building game.  

[list]
    [*]You build a deck
    [*]You get a small random portion of your deck given back to you as a hand
    [*]You generate mana to buy the cards in your hard
    [*]You hand keeps getting re-filled with random cards from your deck as you buy them
    [*]You can space the cards (units, spells, buildings) where you want
    [*]Goal is to beat up the other player's Base / Captain / Hero, while not getting yours beat up
[/list]

[b]It reminds me of Hearthstone mixed with a MOBA.[/b]  Overall much more enjoyable than I would have thought, and certainly worth picking up on sale.  I think the current game feels a bit too ""free to play"" for the price, but on sale (or if it ever goes FTP) it's solid fun with good multiplayer. It was fairly stable except when I left for a few hours and came back.  It seemed to have logged me out in the background and I didn't get credits for games I won.  An enjoyable early access game, and probably a great fit for anyone who likes deck building type games."
21998,I love it!
21999,"Fast paced and easy to learn. It's great for short sessions though not too sure of it's payment method at the moment. For some context, I got this game from the Humble Monthly Bundle like what I assume a good few others.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
In short it's a tower defense game with cards as your attackers. You can choose a hero to play which give certain abilities or buff as the round progresses. You send out troops that take control of the bridge between you and the opponent to gain exp for your hero. Your goal is to manage to break though your opponents defenses and have your troops attack the enemy's hero. The stronger the card, the more the cost to use them. From what I can tell from my a bit over a hour play, it's kinda balanced. They set you up with a few challenging solo enemies at the start which after defeating a few, gives you a reward of having a chance to get better monsters. My time in online play was pleasing as well. I lost but the reasoning why I lost was easy to understand. You see, the hero he got is able to to revive monsters after he gets enough exp to do so. He's monsters were mostly low in cost and they eventually out numbered me and soon enough out powered me. I was able to put up a fight for a while but in the end, my lack of realization for his plan cost me and I lost the game. Yes, I lost... by getting Zerg rushed. It was interesting to see what other strategies can come about with similar monsters but a different hero. All in all, a fun game.

[h1]RNG[/h1]
So where does the RNG fall in? Well mostly in the card you can draw in. As far as I can tell, they don't seem too unbalanced since the stronger monsters are harder to bring out anyway. I guess an issue you can face is that if you need a type of monster (ranged, melee, or building) it's up to RNG to decide it for you. There are some RNG in the rounds themselves though but only a minor one. Most the monsters you summon. Like mentioned before, there is the use of card. A bad hand can give you a bad day but it's also how you utilize your monsters and how you set up your deck.

[h1]Micro-Payments[/h1]
So like I mentioned before, I got this on a bundle. So you view on it price-wise is a little biased. That said, for a game you pay for it, seems to rely a bit on micro-payments. As of writing this, the game is on early access so I don't know if it will stay this way or the game will become a free to play later on but at least if you got it around the time I wrote this review, you get a free DLC which gives you a lot of the paid currency and some boost in exp and such. The amount given is quite a lot and you can easily purchase a hero you like, a map/arena you like and even some chances to get some new monsters. I haven't the need to use any of the paid currency at this time and the card and the heroes on rotation seem to do me alright. So as of now, the payment method is particularly unfair but it is something you should consider when buying this game. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game is fun. Nothing about it is too offensive, it seems balanced and the strategies you can utilize make it a challenge in higher levels. It's pretty cheap as well though depending on how the developers go through the game (making f2p or keep their current model) it might be fair to consider a price drop before making any rash decisions. All in all, not bad."
22000,Non pay to win version of Clash Royale and its actually kinda fun.

just kidding this is the worst game ive ever gotten"
22004,"Imagine Crash Royal, but on a much grander scale."
22005,"Well here we go as for early acces v0.8.13

Pros:
-Fast defense/offense card game
-Interesting characters
-Fun gameplay
-Ingame exp, giving every character their unique skills. (3 skills per character, every round/game)
-Interesting cards
-You can customize your arena

Cons:
-Annoying way to show what you earned at certain levels
-Non skippable tutorial, yes i dislike it when you can't skip tutorials. The gameplay etc is pretty obvious explanation should be optional.
-Can't scroll back in global chat, the chat is really small and you can't go back to read what someone said.


But furthermore, great game!"
22006,"That's just amazing strategy game.
My rating is 10/10."
22007,Doesn't seem like it was even made with PC in mind. Just a garbage version of Clash Royale.
22008,"'Minion Masters' developed and published by 'BetaDwarf', is a fun and fast-paced strategy game. The game requires you to think on your feet, while still being quite casual, which is something I particularly enjoy, being someone who mostly plays games for fun and not competitively overall. 

When I first took a look at the game, I thought based on the screenshots it would play out a lot like Hearthstone or Clash Royale, however after playing it, I can say that the game is very different from what I originally had in mind, and the experience was much more wholesome than what I thought it would provide. 

The game feels well-balanced, and even after playing against players who had the premium DLC, I didn't feel like I was at a major disadvantage. I see many people who got the game for free complaining about that, which I think is a bit silly otherwise the developers wouldn't be able to capitalize off the product at all, which would mean less time put into the game, which would mean a less wholesome expereince, which isn't what anybody wants.

I think that the price-tag is slightly steep, but chances are if you don't like the game you'll realize it soon enough to refund it, because the rounds played are quite fast, and usually only take around 15-20 minutes, but that also may come off a bit bias since I did receive the product for free. Other than that, I don't have any major problems with the game, it's fun, and my only real complaint is that I wish I would've had more time to play during the beta stages, the servers weren't up very often, but I don't see that really being a problem in the future unless maitnence checks become prevalent."
22009,"Fee to pay, you pay for the game then you pay more.

Its not pay to win, its pay not to suck. You cant buy anything you cant earn, but you start at such a level of sucktitude, you need to pay to get out of the suck.This isnt really very fun to get smashed by people that are paying to get ahead of you. 

This being said, the single player part of this is actually really fun. But its incredibly short, a few hours at most.I would give it a nuetral if i could, but at this point, the monetization model is not good.

Addendum 90 minutes in and done with the single player...yeah not worth it unless you want to put more money towards the game in addition to the base price.

For full disclosure, I got this as part of humble monthly."

22012,"Very nice, this game as a lot of potential. Its enough casual for a quick game and you can feel the deepness of the strategy to come. It feels like a game of hearthstone.  The Meta will fun with this game."
22013,"Game froze and crasht when i played 
Its a fun game tho 10/10"
22014,"TL;DR: A fun easy-to-learn action-strategy game that is good for small rounds.

Pros:
- Nice bright and cartoony graphics
- Easy-to-learn gameplay style. Place cards on battlefield, hope minions destroy opponent's tower before yours is destroyed.
- Fun and fast-paced gameplay. It is exciting to play against opponents hoping to put the right cards in the right places.
- Rounds are quick and don't overstay their welcome.
- Both single player mission and multiplayer fun.

Cons:
- Coins can only be used to buy wheel tokens. I think you should be able to use coins on more than just one thing. Maybe make us able to buy arenas or champions with coins, just make them expensive.
- There are some cards where you don't understand its usefulness."
22015,"I was one of the first who got this Game for free to help with the bugs and testing the game, the deal was to sub the newsletter and then get a 20€ worth key for the main game, help fixing a few bugs, testing online matches and so on, it was a limited time offer. A few weeks before releasing the game in EA, they did the same offer again but this time without beta testing the game, and with the deal sending keys on release out, what they did. also you get the game now free from alienware. (level 2 or higher needed https://eu.alienwarearena.com/ucf/show/1227282/boards/contest-and-giveaways-global/Giveaway/minion-masters-steam-key-giveaway)

Today the Game was released as Early Access Version with a premium DLC who cost for beta testers the same money as for peoples who are buying it right now. No that this is only an EA it also has a overpriced DLC for peoples who helped them, the lie in my eyes was, that they said ""you will get as beta tester the game for free"", sure you don`t need the DLC who gives the game a P2W feeling, but its still a lie, the main game cost 16€ with DLC and peoples who helped has to pay the same just to get the P2W DLC, same is for peoples who sub a few weeks ago, but at least they didn´t support the game before like many others did. 

The Game works good now, it still has a few bugs, a short single player story and an open multiplayer where you can play agains other player, it makes fun for a while, and its better then expected but I think it will go soon F2P because the DLC already gives player a P2W change by geting more money, more xp, more rublies to buy arenas, cards and monsters for 1 year. 

if you got this Game for ""free"" try it, play it, enjoy it as long as you can, because it will not take long untile the game will be unfair with all this pw2 items. 

And if you where a Humble Monthly Sub you already got the game+dlc in december. So it will fast be hard as not premium user to play a funny online match.

thumbs down for p2w in a game who cost 20€ (after the 20% off). Oh and I would still vote this game negative even if I got the DLC as well, because this DLC ruin the game in every mod."
22016,"This looks like something from a phone/tablet game, but works on PC. This has great graphics, physics, and it's a great game overall."
22017,"Lets talk about this game and what it is before I tell you why its good (whilst telling you while its good within this bit) This game takes a spin on the Genre Clash Royale created. This games twist is two seperate things one is Bridge Control as the player you want to control the Bridges very simple but very hard to do and it leads to you having to learn how to remove units safetly and finding counters the Bridges are important because of their second twist, Minion Masters they are the people you play as they have unique abilies ranging from field long auto attacks to dealing 60 damage to a random enemy whenever you play somthing. But here is the catch you need to gain exp and level the master each game to level them up and gain these special abilities. These two features seperate the two games and makes Minion Masters a game of its own.

The Pro's Over Clash Royale 

- No annoying Card restrictions aka get to a rank to get to unbox certian cards (The worst thing Clash every did in my opinion

- The Devs are active with the community and listens well

- Not Pay to Win (Love this)

- You can let the Salt flow through you 

- Looks better than Clash

Con's 

- You can't be Darth Vadar 

- Dark Sides is sadly not a thing

I think thats it well see you in game have fun and don't forget, Don't Blink what ever you do DON'T BLINK"
22018,"It has been compared to Clash Royale, and at first glance it does have a lot of resemblance. But Minion Masters is much more in depth. The game offers characters that you can choose that offer different play styles. Each character has three perks that unlock with XP during the course of a game. To obtain XP, you must control one or more bridges connecting you and your opponents island. One character offers perks that work well with a rush deck, while another character may offer perks that offer slower paced game play with big minions. Each character is different and because of this, there's not a clear cut ""this deck is the best"". Each card is unique, and allows for many different strategies. Minion Masters also includes ranked right from the start. But best of all, each card is craftable and disenchantable so there is absolutely no pay to win. The game also offers spells and buff cards that enhance your army. This game is worth playing and the developers are quick on the updates. I highly recommend."
