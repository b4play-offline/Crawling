1,yo these ghosts scary af ong
2,"Even in it's current form (as of Sep 18 2022) this game is intense.  Some things aren't quite clear like what phrases  you can say with the spirit box (google search you'll find a ton of things), or how to ""stop a hunt with the crucifix"" (many holding, dropping on the floor, etc. have not worked yet).  But the tutorial does a great job of telling you how and why to use various items like the DOT, temperature gauge, etc.  Lighting things like the smudge stick, candle, etc. is a little awkward yet using the lighter...  But the locations are fun.  When activity spikes to a 10 and doors lock, and you're hearing screams, and lights flicker so you know ""it's there"" with you...  It's scary and intense!  BUT AWESOME!  Play with friends.  Triangulate positions.  Watch the monitoring trend lines. GREAT co-op fun.  Highly recommended!"
3,"spoopy

But seriously, for a game that isn't fully released, it is really fun. Especially once you learn what you're doing."
4,epic
5,Overall a fun game. Great as a single or multiplayer!
6,"for it's price this game is really fun (especially with friends) and heck, even if you are solo it's still really fun to play. it starts off pretty frightening when you're not used to the mechanics, but once you get a hang of it the game gets really good. would recommend no matter if you're solo or with a group.

but there are still some things needed, but that is a given since it's in early access as of me writing this; the public lobbies sound really bad atm (never personally tried it), there are a few bugs here and there but those usually gets fixed, and also the fact that this game isn't really that friendly with potato computers (i would know since i go through the pain of playing this game with one) however other than that this game has a ton of potential. Even the Phasmo scene on Youtube is doing well,  with a number of youtubers playing this game on stream or even just posting vids about it."
7,"super fun and good to play with friends
"
8,"a few weeks ago i'd have suggested this game. but online lobbies are plagued with people cheating now.. either spamming spawning cursed hunts, walking through closed doors, or being undetectable by the ghost. would not reccomend public lobbies until this is fixed. overall, in private matches with friends this game is a slam dunk.
"
9,e
10,"This game is ridiculously fun. It definitely is fairly terrifying to play it at first (especially if you play it solo, if you dare). Although, the real fun is in the multiplayer. With consistent updates from the developers, I am shocked how this game has so much quality for being in early access. This is definitely one of the prime examples of early access done right. It will be amazing to see how the game will turn out once it does get out of early access."
11,"not to scary after your first game
but new update soon so we will see"
12,Awesome in Vr
13,fun
14,great with friends
15,"I do not play this game nearly enough, it has so much replay-ability and is super fun to play with friends. The only complaint I have is that for some reason I can't make it work in VR. Otherwise fantastic game."
16,"very fun to play with friends but only when your friends die instead of you

34,"One of the best games I played. The detail of the ghosts are epic. For the first time I played I got scared, but I got used to it and now it's normal. It was worth each dollar and just whoa, I am speechless."
35,Solid game lol
36,"This game is good, just....need friends."
37,Good if you want to be scared shitless when your team member sends you in to use smudges and youy go into the wrong room then just stay there then hear the ghost and die.

them: the monies dude lets go
*none of us took pills
me: let's stay together cause we have a smudge stick
*we get in the garage and walks into the corner room, hunt happens
me: light the smudge stick
them: nah it's just an event
*kronge
them: snaps picture and earns us $10; we still lost more than we made lol

11/10 go next"
44,"Love this game. Spent close to 70 hours having fun with random people in pub lobbies, it's a breath taking leap into horror tactical and (the first one to do it)"
45,"This is by far the best horror multiplayer game in recent memory. Not only has Phasmophobia birthed a new genre of games, it has continued to reign supreme in this space. This game is well worth the price. If you have 3 other friends, I would highly recommend it

Pros:

Development team is amazing and works at lighting speeds to deliver content seemingly every other month. There have been numerous large scale patches, new maps, a ton of new ghost types, new equipment, new settings coming soon (in terms of the time of this review). 

The ghosts are all unique, challenging, but rewarding to figure out. 

Cursed possessions have added a new layer of gameplay along with the equipment additions, this game 

Amazing VR support, you can team up with those playing in VR as well, making for some goofy moments watching someone physically freak out during a haunt.

The map sizes really make a game, the high school may be one of the best maps in my opinion, the maps are clearly unique, all have their own challenges and are designed well (outside of asylum but it's getting a rework!)

The ghost events can really give you a jump scare and are sometimes truly creepy

Cons:

The difficulty of some ghosts can be overwhelming, I can tell at the higher levels that less experienced players will have a very hard time figuring out evidence especially on nightmare

Sometimes the weather can cause severe FPS drops, really hindering 

I have no doubt the dev team has this in mind, but I would really like to see more counterplay during a haunt. As it sits right now, you currently only have two options, loop the ghost or hide and pray it doesn't find you.

53,Good game for playing with friends
54,"I honestly really love this game, it's really fun whether you win or not although it an be a little difficult sometimes. The multiplayer really makes this game that much more fun, being able to have your friends be beside you while you watch them die and then leave their corpse is so much fun. 8/10"
55,Best ghost hunting game!
56,"This game is incredibly fun, scary, hilarious and gets your mind going. I love how you can talk to the ghosts and provoke them by insulting them. I do recommend this game, you'll have loads of fun"

59,"Ghostbusters.....but screaming because its spooky and not been made into a terrible reboot! 

This game is a ton of fun with friends, hit and miss with randoms, but overall well worth the price of admission. (especially on sale!) I have played mostly with a premade squad and find that the experience is almost always better that way as there are some high level randoms out there that will speedrun rounds faster than you can turn the power on! The variety of ghosts to hunt extends this games shelf life way beyond titles like Devour, and the use of equipment to lock down clues as well as cursed items and match objectives make the experience much more varied. The difficulty selection is also well thought out and at higher levels makes the slower, methodical hunting of lower difficulties melt away to be replaced by frantically searching for clues the minute the door opens because the ghost is not waiting around and the tables quickly turn. All in all I had a blast and easily recommend this game! :]"

93,If you are looking for a paranormal game this is the one!! Trust me.
94,"A perfectly spooky game, without any ""real/cheap"" jump scares (other than an easter egg).
Barely any blood or gore (except static blood in the level geometry, half-rotten ghost models and a mostly decomposed skeleton).
Game mostly relies on audio for spooking the players.

You try to figure out which ghost you're dealing with, by figuring out it's location and looking at it's behavior.
For this you have a wide variety of mostly unique items to use.
By accumulating knowledge about the game, you can figure out which ghost it is, much more easily.

The game has fun buggy mechanics, that can be learned naturally through playing the game.
(Remote controlled items, infinite sanity pills, free items, dislocated doors, escaping investigation area during hunt, entering area without unlocking door etc.)
But these might get patched. However pulling them of or figuring them out feels super rewarding.
And some of them have a chance of failing. But getting a successful locker escape on Bleasedale, when cornered is some joy you won't be able to reproduce easily.

Ghosts feel like they have different ""personalities"" making it entertaining to play multiple times, including randomized hiding spots.

For most people this will be a rather short-lived experience, as figuring out the way the ghost work, take away a bit of constant tension, when playing the game.
I'd say many people would only enjoy playing this for around 15 hours."

291,"Tldr at bottom.

Great premise but due to being semi broken at the moment ruins it and makes it mediocre if not terrible
explanation below

The horror is on point.
Great themeing.
Intersing gameplay but completely broken.

had multiple times the ""tells"" havent worked as in FULLY clearing every room with uv lights looking everywhere with not a single fingerprint.
ghosts walking through a hallway multiple times but not triggering the dots in the middle of it with motion detectors on either end of the hallway.

Quite a few minor issues due to how the game handles controls.
you cant open doors without turning off equipement and other minor issues.
ghost opening doors on other floors when its on other floors.


Tldr great idea very good when it works but is occasionally just broken beyond reasonable levels and can ruin runs due to that brokenness"

327,"This game is scary without being gross or made cheap with cheesy jump scares. It has really great replay-ability and with the new updates and how involved the developers are with the community I think it will only get much better as EA goes on. 

This game is ideal for friends and groups, you'll have lots of laughs as you're being spooked and chased by angry ghosts!

I had more fun with this game the longer I played it, in the beginning it's hard and can be frustrating but as you find your way and figure out how all the equipment works and some of the ghost quirks it starts to becomes more fun. 

As someone who does not play horror games at all normally, I've played this game quite a bit! Highly recommended!"

358,"Its a really good game to play with friends. Can be creepy and the Game Devs are always creating new content. I've been playing this game since it first got released and it has had a huge content update since then. The bigger maps can be tedious without a full group but the smaller maps and the campsite are very fun. There has also been new a mode added such as nightmare which can be super tricky.
I play this mainly with friends but you can play online in strangers lobbys too.
Some of the ghost events and ghost skins have been updated and they look much better now overall making the game more enjoyable.

Happy ghost hunting friends! 10/10"

385,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

398,"One of the best ghost hunting games out there.
I with there were a little more jump scares.
Feels kinda repetetive if you play it a lot"
399,Good ghost hunting game.
400,"yep
"
401,Very scary. Monkey filled his diaper.
402,"Can be very fun, especially when playing with the right people.

One thing I would change however is how the ghosts behave. It gets a little old when the ghost always wants to kill you. What if you added different hostility levels? It'd be more interesting if you enter the game, not knowing whether or not the ghost will try to harm and kill you, and instead just wants you to find its body, or how it died, or even have certain ghost types ""only"" destroy your equipment instead of making you lost everything you've put into the match just because you die. Currently if you play on higher difficulties and you want to hoard your items it encourages you to stay in the van and hide instead of going in and actually exploring (especially if you're a coward like me :P).

While I'm reviewing, I'd also suggest different kill animations. I'm sick of every single ghost having the same icky hands on my poor eyes, whether it's the child, or the creepy Ring/Grudge ghost, or an old man with a sickle. The death sound of the hands wrapping around my neck is also getting old, and I'd suggest changing that aspect up a little as well.

Fun game, but it could be better."

407,FUUUUUUUNNNNN. but you need to learn your ghost otherwise its harder but it will still be pretty easy
408,Very fun with friends. when by yourself its pretty terrifying. good use of money
409,"Super fun to play with friends, and the devs are very active.  New content is constantly added, as well as bug/hotfixes to make the experience better. This game will only go up."

415,scared a queef outa me tbh
416,"Before Phasmophobia, I was a husk of a man. I lived to work and worked to live. Everyday was a living hell. However I managed to stumble upon this masterpiece. The more I played the more I was happy. After 3 hours of playtime I found god, after 5 I got a call on an off day for them to tell me I got a promotion. After 10 I realized I can no longer feel pain, exhaustion. starvation, or thirst. As I play more I develop more abilities and good fortune. 100/10 would recommend."

424,i like the scary ghosts. they make me pee mseylf but in a fun way.
425,Amazing game play! Lots of good spooks and its fun to learn the equipment used to find ghosts and other paranormal entities.
426,Pretty boring and way to dark to even have fun inside of the game.
427,scary game. good with friends
428,fun
429,i straight carry my friend this games robussin
430,"Phasmophobia is one of the few horror games that are actually good. From communicating to the ghost, to exploring the huge maps, there are a variety of things you can do in the game. Phasmophobia has also helped my fear of horror and now I only s*** my pants once when playing the game or watching horror movies. The items in Phasmophobia are also really well built and easy to use most the time. The cursed items can be useful for locating the ghost and fit really well in the game. The fact that the ghost can hear you and respond to you inside the house is astonishing to me. When using the spirit box. it gives unique answers to questions and you can even ask how many bottles can you fit up your butt on the Ouija board. Also, the ghost being able to hear you when it hunts is scary as hell. Just hiding makes your heart beat hoping you don't make one noise. The different types of ghosts are also really cool. From Spirits to Obakes, they each have their unique traits which help when figuring out what ghost it is. The ghost events also gives you a small scare each time it happens. I never know if the ghost is hunting or if it's a ghost event when it does a ghost event. The variety of maps are also huge. With the smallest maps having 11 rooms, and the Asylum having a whopping 101 rooms, it really makes it a thrill exploring the place. A lot of the maps seem to fit the haunted feeling as well like a house, farmhouse, camp lodge, prison, and a school. One thing I don't really like about the game is the VR compatibility. Maybe a few fixes here and there will make the VR experience a lot better, but the VR experience (even if a little buggy) is also a thrilling experience. I would definitely recommend this game for people seeking horror. If your too scared to play the game, face your fears! I went into this game scared sh*tless, but after a bit got the hang of it and now I'm level 101 (at the time of this message). Some people may find the game boring, but if you play some of the bigger maps and take more risks, it's a fun and thrilling game. Highly recommend this game."

572,"Awesome and entertaining game, with a good gameplay and great level/sound design great to play in lonely night times.

But I can't recommend it to new users who are looking for other to play with in the multiplayer as the servers are sometimes are full with people with high levels which kicks anyone who's new and has a low level in game. From 10 joined servers 9 will ban you.

If you're buying the game and you have some friends to play with, the game is perfect. Otherwise my suggestion will be to avoid it."

592,I almost shit my pants playing this game with my friends
593,"All the childlike fun of daring your friends to say ""Bloody Mary/Candy Man"" in the dark, however the entity shows up and strangles them in front of you."
594,berry scary
595,I'd recommend making the ghosts horny by playing hardcore furry hentai. It makes them less agressive and you can have sex with them.
596,door funny
597,Spooky Ghostssss

600,"Hi, this is Sam and this is my review on Phasmofobia.

Fhasmophobia is one of the best movies I've ever played. The characters are very funny, especially the ones with a darker skin tone. Their names are Melissa and Tyrone. My favourite map is tanglewood and the reason why is because I like camping in the kids bedroom so I can watch them fall asleep :) Anyway apart from tanglewood, Tomato Town is my second favourite map. 

There are many ghosts in Plasmozambia including: Revenant, Demon, Lifeline, Gibraltar, Tracer, Oryx and Iana. The scariest ghost is the black chinese old lady, she is very spooky :o. When you're being chased by the ghost, it reminds me of dark yutes running from the feds. Anyway I have a serious question: Forteinity y la bubbajay?

Moral of the story: You need dem man dere to schmick on dem man dere.

P.S. I love touching my crotch and fotbol"
601,its fun and spooky :)
602,"no
"
603,"pros: very smooth gameplay and easy to remember mechanics, an absolute blast with friends, lots of jumpscares and heart-racing moments. If you're someone who enjoys a cooperative and thrilling experience, i highly recommend phasmophobia. 10/10 game.
cons: none"

613,This game is fun to play with friends... although it's pretty terrifying playing by yourself
614,scary game
615,gudd
616,good game supewr fun ajsdifj;lksjdf
617,good
618,ghost go brrrrrrr
619,"It's a great game that has grown in leaps and bounds.

Horror update coming soon!

highly recommended!"
620,it spooky
621,Very fun game with friends! Get ready to SCREAM!!
622,"It is probably the best horror game so far. My advice for lonely people out there:  buy it and you will never feel alone again. I am not talking about how friendly, helpful and eloquent the other online players are (don't get me wrong they are indeed nice and skilled) but the fear of getting a backhug from a demon or phantom will surely warm your soul.

P.s. I only have 1.8 hours of total playtime since the one who bought me the game no longer has the courage to continue on after multiple quick deaths. L"
623,"yes
"
624,this is a very funny and scary game 100% love it
625,"neat





k"
626,One of my favorite games to play currently and will probably stay that way for a long time. Playing this game with friends can be one of the most fun experiences ever especially when you have no clue what you're doing. Great game with great replayability.
627,Pretty boring
628,worth it
629,I got kicked out of the ghost pride parade for being phasmophobic
630,bah
631,sexy
632,"Never have I ever played a game where things can go so wrong when the game is actually going super well. I played this game with two very fat obese children where they abuse the global voice system so much it can call itself a victim. These dudes create some of the most ear piercing screams that cannot even be understood by a blue whale. We were catching a demon when this dude thinks he sees it and nearly breaks the sound barrier with his roar when his mom comes up and tells him off. Keep in mind this 16 year old teenager screamed at a shadow made up of black pixels.

Communication is the reason why this game is so fun and I recommend it to anybody who has the rare ability on this platform to socially communicate with others."
633,"awesome game
"
634,"Ghost
"
635,Cool
636,"Gets boring quick sadly, hopefully the final release has some good stuff like a ghost mode to jump scare your friends. The community is full of toxic little snowflakes making it impossible to play the game unless you have friends who own a PC with the game or play solo. Devs don’t do anything to combat the trolls, cheating, and hacking. I could go on and on but guess ill stop it there."
637,"Its a unique experience every time, the jumps still can get you cause they're never the same, and it has a really fun investigation aspect that pretty well made."
638,hate it worst game ever

640,Great game for 2 hours until it simply becomes a game of Guess Who? Once the fear dies the game is tired and it doesn't take long. 3/10. Save your money and visit your local defunct asylum instead.

642,This game slaps harder than I do when I'm wankin' it.
643,Scary fun :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
644,i DON'T LIKE HORROR GAMES BUT THIS GAME IS TRULY A MASTERPIECE.  BUY IT NOW!
645,"grwat horror game, if you play with friends"
646,"''Where are you?''

''Old''

''no, I said where are you?''

''Old''

old is old apperently"
647,"Very fun. A lot of room for shenanigans. The controls aren't hard to pick up, and the game is plenty spooky regardless of the map you choose."
648,This game is a ton of fun solo and with friends while also being super spooky. There have been a number of times my neighbor has contacted me to make sure I'm not dead because a ghost has popped out of nowhere to get me and I screamed. Make sure you let your housemates/roommates/neighbors know before you play and have a blast

656,"I am a 40 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Phasmophobia and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching black men twerk on Tiktok. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, chose a server, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
657,"This game is super fun. I've found out about this game from friends and it seemed pretty cool. U should try it out. And trust me, this is way better than Roblox rip-offs."
658,Fantastic game but after some time my PC would start crashing when in a game.
659,really fun game to freak out friends
660,"I don't typically play horror games as I am a jumpy person, but I love the strategic element of this game. It's fun to play with friends even if most of the time is screaming while being chased by ghosts. I highly recommend this for its replay-ability and co-op fun!"
661,scary
662,very fun
663,crapped my pants playing this
664,made my brother scream like a little girl lmao
665,Who shat my pants

669,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

677,funny ghost game
678,"This is the game that started a trend, and while it isn't perfect, it's fun to play with friends. It loses its scare factor after a while, but it's worth the couple of bucks for some fun."
679,Kinda cool idk. They stole my kids.
680,LISSSAAAAAA!!111!!!!1!!!1!
681,"Still rough around the edges, but its an early access game, i've seen actually do what early access should. Replacing bought and free assets with made ones. Trying to refine it slowly but steadily. Refreshing

In terms of actual gameplay, its fun with friends in short to medium bursts. I only play it in VR. Still has some work to done, but in its current state 6/10. Gameplay premise is unique enough and could be higher with further refinement"
682,"This game terrifies me. I love it. 

I'm not normally one for horror games, but there are a few exceptions. Most of the scary factor in this game comes from the psychological horror of being hunted, rather than relying on cheap tactics like jumpscares. (The only jumpscares you might encounter is if you're unlucky and the ghost spawns in for a ghost event right in front of where you're standing.) Very fun to play with friends."
683,a very scary game that has no over used jumpscares. FINALY!
684,gud
685,spooky fun
686,Very fun game. Better when playing with friends but can still be played solo. Very spooky.

699,"I tried to feed this back in the Phasmophobia discord to avoid them a negative game rating, but then I got told that suggestions have been closed, and that they will only ask for feedback on specific things. 

The journal in the game is too bright when opened. Everything in the game is dark, spooky and dimly lit, yet when you open the journal, I hope you've got sunglasses on, because that thing is BLINDING. Chuck away your strong flashlights, and just press J to illuminate everything. It would be great to get the book to be a bit darker, especially as the contract between everything else in the game and the journal can be quite jarring. As a quick fix, just bringing down the brightness would work, but in the future, the flashlight or a lighter to illuminate the journal would be really useful.

I have a brand new controller and my character still drifts... It is a real deal breaker while trying to hide from the ghost, interact with the environment accurately, etc..."

719,Best game over the ghosts helped me jerk off better!
720,"This game is so much fun with friends. The devs do awesome updates and really do keep up with the game. If you like horror, you'll love playing this one."
721,Ghosts are good
722,"Its fun with friends just to kinda mess around and burn time theres also a pretty diverse community in terms of language and ive found a good few lobbys with people who are actually quite fun to play with.
The game is very mediocre in terms of its ""scare"" aspect ive never been actively scared while playing
Honestly theres a few downsides game being very clunky but that honestly will make it more fun sometimes would id say its worth the 13$ but you need to be in a mood to play this game and have fun cause the game quickly gets repetitive on the fact of every game hunt is about the same yes the map changes and the ghost can be stronger or weaker or sometimes just never appear"
723,"Get some friends and learn the lessons the Scooby gang did not...the the ghosts are real!! Enter the roll of a paranormal investigator, get your ghost hunting gear together and bring a few friends into a definitely haunted house, school or even prison!! If nothing else, you and your friends will have a spine tingling moment or a hearty laugh as a random spirit hunts each and every one of you. Good luck and happy hunting!"
724,"i highly recommend this game, it has been a blast to play with friends and in only handful of exceptions, has been very fun online as well. it is very intense and gets the heart racing for many many hours. it is involved and doesnt get boring for a very long time. even when it does, it is very fun to come back to play later. for sure worth it"
725,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicin"

754,"I bought this game last year to try out the ghost-hunting experience, and honestly, I'm still enjoying it today. Especially on VR! The scare factor has naturally decreased over time due to how much I've played it. But, it's still entertaining nonetheless. I look forward to how the developers plan to expand upon it in the future and how they plan on keeping the thrills and paranormal activity in the air feeling as alive and fresh as it can be."
755,Can't wait for new update.
756,"i havent beat the tutorial
big scary"
757,"An excellent game to play with friends. Still in early access but already a solid game. It's less ""Blair Witch"" and more like those ""Ghost Hunters"" TV shows. I look forward to what they add in the future.

The Good:
* Game is ""Scary"" without being ""Graphic"".
* Even once you're used to it, it can still startle you because you aren't ready for something.
* The higher difficulties and slight randomization of certain elements keeps the game fun even when you've played it to death.
* The maps all have their own quirks which keeps things interesting and gives variety.

The Bad: (Almost entirely stuff that they're either working to fix or are bugs that will likely be fixed)
* The voice detection is a bit wonky at times, either mis-hearing or not hearing you at all.
* A few maps have weird geometry issues where you look safe but the ghost can see *and* catch you.
* The large maps can be frustrating to play solo, especially if you're trying to complete all the objectives and not just identify the ghost.
* The Photo Camera tool is inconsistent in what it picks up (You can be 2 ft away from a ghost and pointing the camera straight at it, but it either won't register or identifies the wrong thing)
* The random nature of the ghost interacting with objects can make them frustrating to identify."
758,funny hoo ha
759,"Amazing game, lots of replay value and unique experiences. It starts off being pretty scary but it gets less scary as you get more familiar with the different items and hunt mechanics."
760,hot ghost woman
761,spook
762,This game is a mix of fun scary and some really cool items and unique things to do
763,I love the in game chat
764,such a fun game and there are some jumpscares too. I really enjoy it
765,Very fun game to play with friends :)
766,"it scary
e"
767,this game make me sooo laugh
768,"Really really good game. It definitely does what it's supposed to do: give you a terrifing ghost haunting experience. Really scary, really fun. The developers are working constantly on it and they have awesome ideas for the game. The only field I felt that lt's lucking is that it has very few different areas and after some point if you play this game for tooo long the levels can get repetitive. Now don't get me wrong, there still is a very big variance in ghost types/behaviors etc which will still keep you interested but the areas can become grindy. I really hope this game continues to improve and get the attension it deserves."
769,"lost all my stuff, pooped my pants, great game"
770,"who you gonna call?

772,"Great for having fun with friends. Little bit boring solo, imho."
773,i saw a murdering ghost and i gave me shivers and my heart was beating so fast. finally a game worth to play
774,"This has become my favorite scary, ghost hunting game. It isn't even in full release, but the dev team is dedicated and making it better all the time. As good as it is, it keeps getting better.

Every game is unique, and that makes the game amazingly replayable. It is still pretty scary after 80 hours of play! It is well worth buying!"
775,"reallly fun, especially with friends! Spooky too."

782,"Despite any short comings you may find in this game, you would be hard pressed to find such and addictive game with such Transparent and Dedicated Developers.  Even after countless Hours of play and seemingly becoming Numb to the frights this game brings I still find myself nearly Jumping out of my Seat in Fright or Shear Excitement While Playing!

I Truly Love this game, and am on the Edge of my Seat waiting for the latest update!"
783,"its horrifying and i love it, its fun to play with the right players"

801,very fun game

819,"This game is a great co-op game for late night scare-fests. Love following my buddies to closets to hide from ghosts, but not realizing that I'm leading the ghost right to my buddy who then dies due to being strangled by the ghost."
820,"As someone who doesn't normally enjoy any kind of horror game, I cannot deny that I in fact love this game! 
While it does have moments where it gives me heart attacks and spooks me; it is still a very fun game!
Getting to meet new friends or play with old friends and trying to figure out what the ghost is with many different things that can happen in each map. Or even just forgetting the ghost when you see the tarot cards and playing roulette to watch your friends die. 
Lots of fun for any fan of the Paranormal!"

984,"Phasmophobia is the current king of the Ghost Hunting genre. Probably the best aspect of this game is the level of inductive reasoning required to find, identify, and survive the ghost. Careful thought and thorough playtesting has gone into the current iteration of the game, and it shows! Bugs exist, but are not game-breaking and generally not severe. If you like solving puzzles, or your work involves troubleshooting things, this game will utilize those skills.

Phasmophobia is a game that requires patience and rewards keen observation. Basically, the primary goal is to identify the species of ghost present at a location, with secondary objectives such as getting a photograph of the entity (easier said than done), or successfully using a cross to stop it from attacking you. What makes phasmophobia so good is that they have devoted probably most of their development time into the one aspect that most developers put the least: playtesting and mechanics. Their goal is to make differences between the species subtle but definite, requiring experimentation to sort out aspects. You have to experiment and repeat to ensure that you are observing unique behavior, as RNG can make ghosts seem to exhibit certain behaviors that they do not. It is so fantastically well done, few other games match it, because it requires a lot of time to really appreciate it, and such deep AI mechanisms do not make for great store page videos. An example of this is the ""twinteraction"". One species, ""the Twins"", can interact with two objects at the exact same time. RNG allows other ghosts to interact with the same object twice immediately, or two close objects ALMOST immediately, but not two seperate objects at exactly the same time. You need to pay keen attention to behaviour to sus out what is going on. At the same time, another Ghost, the ""Oni"", has an ability where it can throw an object much further than others, while yet another, the ""Poltergeist"" can throw several objects at once. Subtle, but definitive if you are paying attention.

Another example would be the ""Mare"". This ghost likes darkness and has a slightly higher chance to turn lights off when it passes a light switch. Again, it's all RNG, and most ghosts can turn the lights off, but the Mare has maybe a 50% chance of interacting with the switch where others have a 30% chance (nobody, save the devs, knows the exact numbers here). Paying keen attention will pay off. Another species, the ""Mimic"", can temporarily take on the behavior of other ghosts, it picks one for a few minutes, exhibits all that ghost's behaviors, then switches to another, acting as a spoiler for all.

And here is where Phasmophobia gets you. You are destracted, you are paying keen attention to the evidence, then the ghost attacks you (hunts). You are caught off guard, you can run or hide, but you can't fight. If it catches you, it will kill you. Each hunts differently, at different speeds, and while you are trying to stay alive, you are also looking for unique behaviours. It is slow burn psychological terror, and I absolutely love it."
985,"love, love LOVE this game"
986,good
987,yes
988,o'
989,AHhHhHHhhHHHHhHH
990,"This game was almost meme-worthy when it was released on Early Access. You would swear at a ghost to attract its ire, then force it on a slow speed chase, cackling like a hyena. Since then, its become a game where all bets are off. The Ghost has Predator Vision. It can now occasionally sprint like a Jaguar in the jungle if it feels so inclined. It can also murder in rapid succession, so If all of your team hides in the same closet giggling like kids in church when the priest falls asleep mid-sermon, you're all toast. And If you even think of using the Scooby Doo method of hiding behind a couch, you will lose the mortal game of Hide-and-Seek and be left with skid marks and a loss of pride. 10/10 Would recommend."

1012,"There's a reason I only played this game for 2 hours. Cool game overall, but there are many features that I cannot enjoy, such as there is no optimisation for the game. If a game needs a 2070 to be playable, that's sad. I have a GTX 1650, and the game still runs poorly on very low graphics. The game just feels like your mining for the devs. Or how about setting up vr? Never had so many problems trying to set up VR for any game. It felt like shit after it started working. Honestly thought this game would be better."

Definitely a must-have."
1083,W scary game honestly the voice chat really brings a fun/scary experience to a horror game like this i recommend playing with friends for a better experience
1084,"good game, scaryyy"
1085,Fun horror game available with or without VR.
1086,I love how I get scared of men breathing on my neck makes me tingle
1087,"Pretty fun game to play, especially if you can find yourself a group to play with. It gets boring quickly though, which is a little unfortunate. The game offers a couple of maps, most of which are pretty small. There's a couple of big maps as well but they don't make the game any better. If you can get it on sale, I'd recommend it. Just keep in mind that you will get bored of it relatively fast."

I'm usually the one asking to go more rounds than others when playing. If you can handle getting whispered at, and loud crunchy noises then I highly recommend this game. Am I good at it? Not really. Do I care? Not really. :)"
1162,funny + scary
1163,"I asked where the ghost was.
It said ""close""
I asked what did it want me to do.
It said ""die""
Then I heard a croak and got strangled to death.

1177," This is a really great game. I love how each different type of ghost has like its own unique personality. This also brings some chaos to the game. I mean like fun chaos. You could either get a ghost that just hands u its evidence right away, or you have to fight the ghost just to get its first evidence. Its very engaging and scary and anyone who plays this should be scared of LISA"

1184,"As much as I hate ""Early Access Game""s this one is solid.  Kudos to the developers for the constant updates.  If you have a couple friends who want to waste and evening now and then this is a fun way to do so.  If you're sitting on the fence then go ahead and purchase this one."

1204,"This game is really fun, if you think it isn't. You need to try it before you even say that, this game sends so many chills down my spines and they aren't bad ones, they are the best chills the the experience is unreal.

1205,Love this game. I like the fact that there is so many ghosts and maps to play. Each game never feels the same.

1207,great game to play if you want to pretend to be a Winchester
1208,Worth It and then some!
1209,.
1210,"I highly recommend this game, I generally don't like horror games but this one is a big exception. It's very complete with all the objects you have to use to find the type of ghost it is, the cursed items it's a very distinguish complement for the game. Anyways I feel that if you really want to enjoy the game you have to do some research to understand better how everything works. I recommend watching insym, he is for me the best player of phasmo."
1211,Great game
1212,woah woah WOAH WOAH
1213,Ghost photos keep showing as 1 star interaction.
1214,"Good game, prepare extra pair of pants"

1216,Spoopy fun and very sensitive ghost. Do not call them out on their shiz they will kill yo first.....
1217,its fun
1218,"Definitely a pioneer and what popularized the ghost hunting horror genre. The game is well balanced and rarely feels unfair as the outcome of whether you succeed a mission(or fail) is mainly based upon your observation skills to read ghost behavior, collect evidence, and ability to evade the ghost during violent hunts. You have various equipment you can buy(in game money ofc) to aid you along your search for the ghost. Each ghost has its own unique qualities, behaviors, and special abilities which helps keep the tension throughout the mission as you're trying to figure out the type. Speaking of tension, the scary aspects of the game come from tension building of ghost interactions and the adrenaline rushing hunts rather than a cheap jumpscare. There is a wide variety of maps that helps mix up the gameplay and keep it fresh. Playing solo is just as rewarding(if not more) as multiplayer and replay value is really high. Lastly and most importantly, the game devs are one of the most well responsive and dedicated to their fanbase. There are usually regular updates (and if not then they are working on a massive update) that bring fun and interesting content- ghosts, maps, graphic overhauls, and an upcoming custom gamemode. I have even seen a hotifix update come out the next day after a major update. Although the game is early access, bugs are very minor and gameplay goes on smoothly with not much performance issues(also no crash issues).

P.S. despite having watched a ton of gameplay on this game before buying it, I pretty much binge-played the game the moment I bought it. I have major respect for the developers and honestly the pricing is definitely generous. Much love DK, CJ, Skinner, and Lavender

TL;DR- 9/10 will love if you like scary games."

1225,its a fun game. Play with your friends and watch some of the stupidest shit happen lol
1226,great game
1227,scary  made me crie
1228,"It is very fun to play with your friends. The randomness of each round adds a lot to the spooky and damn i was scared. This game has got to be one of my favorites. I highly recommend this for horror, ghost hunting fans, and anybody who likes games which have the same concept but different experience."
1229,only if you like getting scared
1230,"This game is a great time alone, but even more fun with friends!"
1231,Good
1232,Game is fun
1233,"This game is amazing game for anybody that likes a horror multiplayer game, being honest this is the best multiplayer horror game I know and it is worth every penny."

But even I have to admit that it's a good time with the right people. If you're not as concerned about being mauled by ghost hands and your own psyche, I'd pick it up."

1264,this is the most fun horror game i have ever played
1265,"At the time of this review, Phasmophobia is listed as a Steam Deck Verified game. However, it is impossible to set the controls or navigate the in-game menus and journal. Frankly, the game is unplayable, and the development road map doesn't make any mention of fixing these issues this year. Without a controller profile for this game, I can't recommend it."

1272,"So to put this in perspective, I really stopped enjoying games for quite some time, up until the start of August. Now I don't often give my review or thoughts on games either since I feel like it can be misleading as you cannot sum up everyone's experience or what their potential experience may be like.

So what I love about this game is you can have so much fun by yourself and with friends. With friends you may make magical moments where one of them may crash and fall apart as they had fear forced right through them by one of the many ghostly entities the game offers. And alone, you realise it is truly that, you alone with one potentially angry ghost doing anything to wipe your existence, whether it be by strangling, making you run or just simply by making your heart beat so fast that it explodes. Regardless, it does keep you on edge.

Now we have 4 difficulties right now, amateur and intermediate which both offer  a beginners level of game play and everything is generally much slower, less freakier. As you play more, you'll realise doing anything on these is so boring that it becomes difficult. Next we have professional, it's very much a dive right into the action, you have less places to hide and well, the ghost may hunt when it is ready, however quick it may be. Then we have nightmare... this will challenge you and everything you know about the game.. you get 2 bits of evidence, and the third will be your knowledge.

Now I've enjoyed 78 hours of this game, and admittedly, nightmare is the most fun I've had because may not always succeed as you may in other difficulties, you may guess the wrong ghost which leaves nothing but a deeply gutting feeling... but no worries! It will be a lesson for next time! You got it right? You feel more rewarded than ever because your knowledge lead you to some success!

Once you have guessed the ghost, you have 2 options, go big or go home. Now the thing that adds so much more level of gameplay is when you decide to go big and risk it all. Risk your equipment, your rewards all in the chance of increasing your rewards by attempting to complete 3 set challenges. Sometimes they may be easy, sometimes they may be difficult, but none the less, it is something else to make those games just a bit more exciting!

With custom difficulty just round the corner, I feel as if it will only add to the game, the depth that it offers and give it far more replayability and far more challenging but yet entertaining gaming hours!

10/10 for me!

"
1273,Can confirm: people have been doing this since 1795
1274,Game is good however could be more scarier. Also I still can't see ghost orbs somehow...
1275,love getting freaked out in this game. It is such a great time with friends!

I know my hours don’t show it but I‘v played an watched this game since the start. I’m also really excited for the new Updates! I can just say, if you like Horror and Ghost, just give it a try."
1319,"Nice niche in fear play, matched expectations and above average learning curve, play with friends is extremely fun"
1320,"don't play the game, be the guy that turns the breaker on and off repeatedly, be the guy that piles all the ghost hunting tools in the spawn room and throw random objects on top so that your team can't grab stuff, be the guy that insults the ghosts mom through the spirit box, be the guy that mocks how the ghost died, be the guy that closes the door when you're ahead of your teammates during a chase, be. that. guy/girl."
1321,"Patricia Wilson did not kill me IRL

0/10"
1322,Super fun with a group of friends!
1323,"Tried the game 2 different times.
Once when it was blowing up on twitch, and just recently (time of upload)

Boring, ugly to look at, and the gameplay loop gets stale so quick.
""But all the different ghost types!""
Same shit. Every time. The only thing that changes is match time. The same stupid breath jumpscare, the same SpOoKy lights flashing and on and on.

I've tried the multiplayer and it's better than the singleplayer by far but only for the social aspect. The game doesn't change at all.

Tried vanilla and cheat tools and mods, but there really isn't much you can do for this."

1437,"Honestly it's a great game but pretty buggy, it would great if we had some difference in ghost events like hauntings or body possesions, and also i think there should be either a second phase to the rounds or even a sequel cause we only have to figure out what kind of ghost it is, is there a different squad who exterminates them or gets rid of them???
8/11 just need to figure out bugs and full game mechanics but thats it"
1438,Best ghost hunting games out in the market with enough content updates to keep players with new things to play with.
1439,"I've gotta admit.. they had something going with this game for a while. That all ended whenever they decided to go to the beach and sip Mai Tais instead of creating new content. This team has been asleep at the wheel for the longest while. It took them half a year to pay for a new box truck model. When will us true gamers get a new map? All of the current ones are basic and boring.

I not only deserve a refund, but an apology from the entire team. Thanks for ruining my life.

Sincerely,

also On PC to use Voice chat Press V or B idk also For Xbox use the left bumper on the controller and for Playstation keep pressing L1 to also use Voice chat every time if you'd like to talk with other people.
The other fun part is to interact with other people that nearly get spooked to death by the ghosts or anomaly/ Event."

I love the stuff that keeps getting added to add to the experience of ghost hunting. I think this is a very well developed game and for the price you cant beat it. Even with you not knowing what to do it is still a very fun time. I have really nothing bad to say about the game nor can I think of anything bad. Overall a 10/10 game defiantly recommend."

1543,"nebal som sa som  chlap
"
1544,"I’ll start by saying ever since the game’s release i’ve heard all about it’s hype and reviews but never bought into it, it never appealed to me; i had no reason to hate nor like it since i hadnt played it for myself. Until one day i was unfathomably bored and decided to purchase it. This decision would mortally wound my steam wallet forever. Phasmophobia has more than one map but dont worry you’ll only be playing on one map, i’ll get into that in a bit. So i paid 14 bucks, money that is earned with blood sweat and tears and spent a long, grueling 4 hours to hear discord mods and their kittens moaning and frolicking in open lobbies when i can literally do that on discord FOR FREE. Besides the uncomfortable and unfortunate lobbies, the game isnt fun either. Catching a ghost is like rocket science and if you haven’t gotten a couple hundred hours, expect to be carried each and every time during your experiences. You’ll spend the first two hours or more dicking around with the equipment instead so say goodbye to the 2 hour refund policy. And another thing, every other public lobby is on the basic house map. Why? Fuck me in the ass if i know. You pay 14 bucks for a game and you’re only interested in playing on the basic ass house map.m? Pfft. I asked a dude why he didn’t want to play on a larger or scarier map like ‘the aslyum’ and he says because it was too long and a lil spooky, well isn’t that the point of a horror game? Exploring and getting scared shitless? Nah, apparently phasmophobia is about replaying the same fucking starter house mission BS over and over again until you exhaust all your braincells. Being tagged as a horror game is just BS, the “jumpscares” are mediocre at most, and they’re rare unless you intentionally seek them out. The game plays more like a bland puzzle strategy game rather than a horror; However i must say that losing my money and time is much more horrific than whatever “content” this game has. the whole game— atmosphere, functions, animations, character models, and details just look like a refurbished gmod minigame. ive played better games that are free. Hell, the starter tutorial didn’t even work properly for me, or maybe it did but who would fucking know! It went through step by step with my how to catch a ghost and identify it, sounds easy enough right? I used every single fucking gadget in batman’s arsenal and still didnt detect a single ghost in the house, not a single light turned off, not a single reading from the EMP, nothing nada from every single gadget. But guess what? When i finally ended the tutorial mission it revealed that there WAS a ghost. If this is a horror game why are the ghosts and monsters not prevalent at all? It didnt even so much as fart itself so i would know its there! Cmon! if you want to play phasmophobia but for a lower price and get 1000% more for your money, just straight up buy Gmod. In the end, i really truly do feel empty after just 4 hours and 14 bucks. Its almost impressive how this game put me down worse than depression ever could. I didn’t feel any joy or anticipation while the game downloaded and im sure the game felt none back. The whole time i played phasmophobia i was just thinking in the back of my head if i should refund or keep going to grasp the game mechanics. And why it was even made to cost 14 bucks in the first place. Cheap blow devs, cheap blow. Not being a cheapskate either, i just don’t think the game is even worth its price. if it was free then i would be a little more lenient with my harsh rating. Sadly the negatives outweigh the positives 10 to none and the price tag on it seals my rating.

TLDR:
0/10 shit game wouldnt play again.
Only play if you have a kitten otherwise you’d be the third wheel in every public lobby you join (the worst part is hearing them pillow talk while you try to catch the pussiest ghost in this piece of shit hole game)"

1561,"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Phasmophobia and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1562,Played with peeps with voicemod on. was pretty cool
1563,Great game! Fun to play with friends and with other people 10/10 would recommend
1564,when they add custom games i will sex the game
1565,the game is fun and scary.
1566,"Everyone should try it, never gets old."
1567,yeet
1568,"took me 30 hours to know the in and outs of every ghost on any difficulty easily with little to no effort, its a game you will play with friends for fun. It stops being scary after like 5 hours or so. I still recommend it 100% if you can find friends who will continue to play this game, you will 100% put more hours than me into it."
1569,"An essential title for late night game sessions with a group of friends, the closer to Halloween the better. Impressive little title for what it is, nothing that's going to change your life and definitely a little buggy, but a fun experience for anyone who grew up on Ghost Adventures and what not."
1570,"Very good game would recommend having at least 3 people playing otherwise it can get a little boring after a little bit, but its definitely fun and enjoyable if you play it for fun."
1571,fun
1572,Lot's of fun with friends and I like to get scared with them around. I am a giant chicken so I'm easily spooked
1573,One of the best and funniest games I have played with my friends and with randoms
1574,56
1575,i nearly crapped myself too many times. 10/10
1576,Always thought about getting Phasmophobia. Put it off because I never thought that it would actually be scary or that it wouldn't be worth the money but my dorm mate convinced me to get it and I love it. Very scary especially when the ghost whispers right in your fucking ear. Very fun with friends and definitely worth the money. 100% recommend.
1577,good game
1578,"Love this game, it's very good, some nice scares, good times with friends. The only problem? The ghost spawns aren't even really that random. Every map the ghost seems to pick the exact same room every time. Don't even wanna go to Tanglewood house anymore, more than 20 games on that map over the course of a few months and it's been in that first hallway to the left of the door every single time."

1590,spooookyyyyy good
1591,"very nice game, one of my personal favs"
1592,"Should have written a review the first time I purchased the game. As if you did not get this game yet, you should have purchased this game a long time ago. I love its replay value. Public lobbies makes the replay value go up. The developers keep adding things on to the game to keep it exciting. I highly recommend getting the game if you have not already. I stream the game almost everyday and it is highly addictive."
1593,its a little spooky ngl
1594,"Best game
"
1595,"While it used to be good, multiple bad decisions combined with extremely slow development progress have made it so boring and inferior that even something like Ghost Watchers has already managed to technically dethrone this as the defacto ghost hunting game.

Unless you get it heavily discounted, this isn't worth it anymore."

1629,spine chillingly terroriffic!!!
1630,"love it! In vr is even better the main problem is that i'm 6,5 and i'm really tall in game and your character looks wierd in game like it's floating or streching. XD But it's a fun game. Why is better than 90% of the co op games? Being so easy to play, just press play and that's it , you got the mic and everything ready to go  , rooms, people, is just so easy to interact with others that's what makes it fun! And good lasting games are those with an good Multiplayer system. it's fun.. soo fun! We need more games like this one! It would be way more fun if there' woulde be jump scares for those who want them or more animated ghosts... one more ideea would be to let the player be the ghost with huge cooldown's on abilitys and to make it that way so everyone wins, the ghost hunters and the ghost too! This is fun about this game, is easy to win that players can focus on having fun with the other players!"

Its a lot of fun and when the spooks get a bit much for me the game still allows me to play without actually being at risk by sitting in the van and watching the cameras or throwing equipment through the doors for them."

1643,Very fun game
1644,Why I have played this game 5 hours you ask? Because after those hours this game wasn't that scary anymore. But you never know when you open this game again. Would still recommend.
1645,"As someone who has been playing this game for about a year now, I can say that this game is an absolute blast. This game is extremely fun with multiple people and single player is still really fun but not as funny with friends to mess around with. My two complaints are that recently the updates have been coming out a bit slower lately but I understand that the developers are doing their absolute best to try to push updates out and accidents happen. Another thing is after playing for a while you get kinda bored so that's why updates are really important.

Other than that, this game in by book is an absolute    10/10.   Would absolute recommend to my friends."
1646,"I played this with a friend, I screamed out loud
I played this by myself and alt+f4rd 5 seconds in
Would Recommend"
1647,fun
1648,she sat in van the whole time wtf is this
1649,good
1650,good
1651,awesome fun
1652,i love
1653,"Incredible potential but still a work in progress. Amazing in VR mode, It is one of the few horror games to genuinely build tension and deliver scares and the mechanics can force players into tense decisions about whether it is worth the risk to return to the house to find that last piece of evidence or if your sanity is so low you might be attacked the second you set foot in the door.

The evidence gathering manages to be fun while still being similar from round to round and each mechanic does a good job of immersing the player in the game. At first nothing is creepier than getting a ghost to respond to you on spirit box saying he is right behind you.

 However the imersion of the gameplay begins to wane after the first few levels acheived and the once imposing ghosts become more of a nuisance than a threat barring RNG giving you the 1 in 12 chance of picking the most dangerous ghost type. I hope more work can be done on this game to preserve the experience I had on my first hunt as a greenhorn ghost hunter unsure if any second an otherworldly being could end my existence. Perhaps more varied goals or unpredictable hunting behavior would force methodical veteran hunters to take risks or face the uncertainty that terrifies you when first playing this game"
1654,"I am a HUGE scaredy-cat but I can't get enough of this game.  It's terrifying and getting caught by the ghost makes me scream, but it's awesome to actually simulate ghost hunting with a group of friends.  The play through can be chill while collecting evidence with cool equipment or you can mess around with cursed objects and run for your life.  I haven't played on VR but headphones are still immersive with freaky sounds and it's really cool that your words affect the outcome of the experience.  Even if you are afraid of horror games, this is one that I would recommend for anyone to try at least once.  It's SO FUN!!"
1655,veri gud game veri scary
1656,mhm
1657,frequently expanded up fun ghost hunting game
1658,"love it
"
1659,"It's not necessarily a spooky game, but it is hella fun with many interesting mechanics and I always learn something new while playing. The devs are really cool people who play publicly and even stream and they love taking community feedback into consideration. Much love for this game"
1660,yes
1661,Very fun with friends
1662,the van is cool
1663,"Great game 
Very underated
Worth every cent
My friends and I have had a blast playing this"
1664,gaem good *spooky*
1665,i shit myself
1666,"A rare coop horror game that doesn't do VERY LOUD JUMPSCARES for its scares. Which is something that a lot of the multiplayer horror games rarely do. I have played this in both VR and flatscreen and it is a blast.

My only issue with the game is that the big maps just suck imo. It takes forever to figure out where the ghost is and even with the sprint it takes forever to get around. Other than that I love this game and this is a game that me and my friends play almost every week."
1667,Its good
1668,gets boring when you have played so many times that it isn’t scary
1669,PLEASE ADD FINGER TRACING
1670,"very fun, and it'll definitely make your hair stand up if you've never played a game like this"
1671,my friend shut the door in my face so she could escape but the ghost kept me company honestly the closest iv'e ever felt to a hug so definitely was an emotional boost 10/10.
1672,Good Game. make's Brain go spook
1673,hunt start you get spooked and die 
1674,10/10 I haven't figured out a way to mute in VR so I just have to not try to breathe heavy like a fucking discord mod when the ghost is hunting or else i'm fucked
1675,itt  to scarty i haet this  so muchf donmet pley it tos scarty i died
1676,GOOFD
1677,koog game
1678,good game but gets boring really quickly
1679,Probably the best cooperative horror game I have ever played. Even after 74 hours it still manages to scare the shit out of me

1718,"For an ""early"" product, is okish, is enjoyable to play with few friends. The game keep you, but at some point it start repeating itself (witch is ok because of alpha). The ghosts are pretty decent, however a little more details and sounds will make it great, for example i except to hear toddle cry/scream when ghost has lower age. Maybe the age of ghost influence the gameplay more?

A great update will be to allow more then 4 players to play in same sessions, for example there we have small/medium/big maps, but only 4 players... If you have a group of 6 you can't play together, its better to give freedom for host, to decide how many players should be allowed to play on witch map.

Another improvement its to re-texture some maps in game, for example wooden house have a really terrible quality even on highest graphics settings.

1732,Nothing fun or good about it played with 3 friends so i thought i could have fun playing anything.... i was wrong this less than N64 quality game really let me down
1733,"Playing with friends in VR, we weren't really enjoying it.

Basic things like just joining a room are incredibly annoying as there is no ""invite to game"" option, you have to send a code for your friends to copy and paste. And then once in a lobby, not even in game, you can't change your settings. Juggling items and working with the UI when in a game are extremely terrible, frequently you will go to grab one thing and end up grabbing another as they are placed too close together and don't give clear interaction feedback to prevent that from happening (unlike, say, H3VR). Trying to quickly turn off your electronics in a hunt is a nightmare as you have to perfectly release the item on your belt, otherwise you will drop it on the ground. I wish they used controller holograms with grab points instead of physical hands to make interactions work better in VR. Even basic functionality like changing settings in the menu doesn't work reliably.

 If even these basic things don't work properly, how are we supposed to trust the actual game mechanics work as intended? 

It doesn't seem to work well with smaller player counts as some of the mechanics such as monitoring from the van are basically unavailable, and you aren't able to take as many items with you.

The main challenge to overcome to get better seems to be learning to survive hunts, and clearly little thought was put into how players are supposed to learn to do this properly. Because hunts only happen after a lengthy amount of time on a map and can be over in seconds, there is almost no time to practice the different actions needed to survive. So you don't get frequent opportunities to get better, and you get no feedback on how well you did since it's survive / die (and you might only survive because it went after a teammate instead of you, not because you played well). Even worse is the lack of communication of how the ghost actually works and what it's doing.

It seems like once you actually figure that stuff out it just gets repetitive and boring."

1870,"Ah yes Phasmophobia, what an illustrious exciting game based off Unity Assets. It's very fun playing with friends unless your friends are like mine of course; they just want to kill me with the cursed objects and want me to suffer in pain whilst they gain the experience and I just sit there on my death bed. I'd say Puffafish and Byr0 are the worst for it, that man would rush the cursed object before I even have time to load in, I swear he has a vengeance against me. Whilst Zornadoh on the other hand is continously trying to find the ghost and he has 3 melons following him (myself included). Slower, what can I say he is a cool guy and never upsets anyone although if he's last alive then damn he's running out of there faster than Usain Bolt. Overall a fantastic game to vibe late night with friends if you want to get hunted down by a Wraith or a Thaye before the hunt even starts as your friends hate you as much as mine hate me. I highly recommend."

just great to meet other player how want to give some guide or how this game work.
on in-game training we don't understand the basic but in multiplayer they tell you how to play this game just very nice.

to my answer is : please the kick system must balaced and greet other people how to play, even the newbie lvl 1 need some help from other player.

1925,"Absolutely awesome game. I got it because a friend recommended it. I have played Amnesia and I know I hate jump scares even though I love the horror genre. I was hesitant too because I hate being chased. But you know what, I'm so glad I did! This game is addicting. I'm now lvl 600 and I'm still learning. No ghost hunt is ever the same. We've had scares, laughs, crazy stuff and it's always a fun time, especially with the right people. Also, the fear factor does go down a bit. So while it's scary at first, you get more used to it so it's not a game that's gonna be scary forever. I love this game, if you're on the fence, get it! Also a tip, join the Discord and find people to play with through LFG if you can't find people to play with. Much better than joining the in game public lobbies."

1974,"Really fun game, particularly if playing co-op. After over 40 hours I still get scared and anxious - which is what I want from a horror game! The ghosts are unpredictable to an extent so the scare factor never completely goes away. There is a huge variety of ghost types to work out which means more variety for each map you play. A decent range of map sizes and locations. And overall, the game is just plain FUN, which it should be, especially as you gain more knowledge of the secrets behind each ghost! It is very rewarding to have the odd moment where you figure out which ghost it is based on its behaviour/footstep speed during hunt etc.

Possibly my favourite thing is the dev team, who care so very much about this game. Asides from the frequent patches, updates, plans, it's nice to see that some of the team also play the game casually from time to time - this gives them genuine insight from the perspective of a normal player, not enough devs do this.  I have some vague recollection of there being ""horror"" updates, where the dev team are very steadily adding creepy horror elements to the game - what a wonderful idea, as this keeps things fresh. What I'd *like* to see in the future, which I have no doubt will happen anyway, is more maps and perhaps more interactivity with the maps (e.g. secrets rooms that you have to find a switch to open, rare items to collect much like the current ""bones""), and also more evidence types perhaps? And rewards for levelling up! (When you do the level reset, perhaps you have to reach certain levels to unlock certain items?)

Overall i think it's a worthy investment. The game has nuance and replay value. Huge well done to DK and his team. You have created something very special, which is still beloved 2 years down the line."

2107,"My favorite Phas moments are as follows: First moment was when we all found tarot cards, 2 of my team members were very excited for them and one was returning upstairs from the basement, instead of waiting the other team member drew a card which was death and it started a hunt... we then heard the team member that was on his way die in the kitchen. My all time favorite moment was when my friend lit all the candels of a summoning circle before i could explain what it does. It drained his sanity and the ghost chased him around the room as we all sat and watched. I then promptly took a photo of his body without saying a word. TLDR I love his game and it's given me some of my favorite moments with my friends."
2108,always a blast with some friends. even more fun while under the influence. can get a little stale after a long play sesh but with constant updates and a pretty good community its one of the games i find myself always going back to.

Well, here I am 53 hours, over $10k, and 198 levels in, and I am addicted to the terror and ""OH SH*T"" moments. I have outright screamed a few times, and yet I keep coming back... what is this crack? I would like to complain that they definitely need more maps to play on."

2323,"Extremely fun, skill based game, requires a lot of knowledge of the game and no two hunts are the same. Highly recommend for horror fans etc. Can't wait for future updates"
2324,"This game is great. I was terrified of it at first, hated being in the house ever. Now I will run in, pull all the tarot cards and hide in a cupboard desperately trying not to laugh so I don't get killed alongside my friends. 
Despite a seemingly small number of ghost types and maps, there are endless possibilities. I have been fooled many times thinking the ghost is one thing only for it to turn out to be another, especially on nightmare. 
You can play as an absolute being of chaos, not caring who you kill or how, or even if you die yourself, or you can play it seriously, taking your time and putting in every effort to work out what the ghost is. Both ways are fun.
As a bonus, the devs are very active in the community, both on reddit and discord, and in the chats of big phasmo twitch streamers, so they listen to feedback, answer questions, and probably laugh at people's misfortunes while playing. They also have some Big Things in the works that are coming soon that everyone is very excited for."

2341,"I recommend this game for 2 main reasons:

-> Since there are no microtransactions, annoying little kids don't really play this game so the servers are pretty great. I've made many friends in this game thanks to that fact. 

-> Devs update and improve the game often - and listen to players when doing so.

Graphics aren't awe-inspiring or anything but they are more than enough for this kind of game. Journal, events, cursed items and many other mechanics are well thought out.

Overall, fun game to play with other people."

"
2396,"         This is a spooky game that is full of spooky ghosts and it is up to you and your team to solve what kind of spooky ghost is haunting the area. Many a time have I entered the various locations in the game, but they are made to feel fresh by the different spooky ghosts that haunt it each time. At the time of my writing this review, I have accrued 119 hours in the game, and I am still looking forward to gathering a group of my friends and entering the haunted locations once more. 
          The deductive nature that the players must have in the game makes for an entertaining role to play. Typically early in the game everybody is fearless, with no concern of being hunted. As the investigation goes on and players' sanity begins to drop, it becomes ever more frightening to search for clues. The thrills of going in to the house to collect one last clue to positively identify the entity while on your last bit of sanity and making it out of the house alive proves to be such a rush that it has my friends and I coming back again and again.
         Also the game is still in early access, and still has room to improve. I have experienced some jankiness in the vr mode, but nothing that has kept me from enjoying the game. would recommend vr mode as well.
           

         TLDR:  Its a fun spooky game with spooky ghosts that I would recommend for players using mouse and keyboard as well as VR"
2397,"Very good horror game but is like a mr potato gets cancer =D
"
2398,"Very fun with friends, and VERY scary when you are in the dark being chased by a ghost! Would recommend to friends with good pcs and maybe a vr headset."
2399,good plz add even more maps and maybe a randomly generated one that would be cool can we have one at a hospital and a abandon building you should add the Eternal as another ghost and maybe character customisation maybe even some like wraps for your gear so they look unique they could be unlocks you could also add jump scares as like events i would love to see different death animations but not for the different types of ghosts just in general they could also add impossible as a difficulty and make it so once you find out the 2 evidence you must survive the final hunt where the ghost is in its true form and will be even more scary
2400,love the game. the ghosts and events are awesome and can catch you off guard
2401,GOOD
2402,good gamwe
2403,nice
2404,It's a really fun but terrifying game.
2405,"GOOD GAME

2407,"A great game to play with easily scared friends, its amusing, however higher level players can be pretty toxic to lower levels, since they dont want to help a lot."
2408,"Scary, fun"
2409,"Great game, with a few jump-scares if you aren't ready for it. Recommend with friends."
2410,Amazing Game 11/10
2411,spooky boi
2412,my friend screamed so loudly that my ears no longer work
2413,i played it with my friends. They are pussies especially the one who is short and french he screams a lot.

2414,"Both fun and scary. Especially when playing with friends this game is a lot of fun, whether you are playing serious or just joking around."
2415,"Great game, does take some getting used to and getting to know the mechanics. Overall fun, not that many bugs and is just a great game to waste some time on!"
2416,ye
2417,ghost = scary
2418,"good

2419,Phasmo has become a staple in recent years for a truly unique horror experience. Best to play with friends and is pretty consistently scary with the AI being so different on every level. This game can be quite funny and also challenging when the ghost isn't providing you with the evidence you need to move on. This game is fun tho and the replayability is great.
2420,I SAW MY FUCKING DEAD DOG HAUNTING ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2421,"Phasmophobia は怖い！でもそれ以上に面白い！
This is my favorite game - not only is it infinitely replayable but it also has multiplayer option and playing with friends is so much fun! The scares are terrifying and thrilling. I highly recommend this game - 10/10!!"
2422,My fellow ghosts didn't accept me
2423,its and amazing game and i think its good to keep playing over and over again
2424,"Cool game for spooks, unfortunately gets repetitive and boring after some time. Still, you can spend some quality time with your friends for as long as you remain interested in it, which is like an average amount of time."
2425,good game would recomend
2426,only good game w friends
2427,"Very entertaining to play! Updates keep rolling out often and seems like this corporation is one of the very few left that actually accounts for demographic and feedback. Me and my friends play this game a lot and its fun to play with others from around the world. Amazing game to try if you're looking for a ghostbuster-ish horror experience, this game deserves some praise and I can't wait to see where it ends up in future developments."

2442,"Pretty fun to play with friends.

few things can be better 
1. add free flash-lgiht spot since it's shown on the shoulder so player can grab 3 items instead of 2
2. Make it bit more scary feel like non scary xD
3. maybe add fight back mode like series Supernatural"
2443,very good and fun
2444,not scary just super funny and good experiennce to play with friends.
2445,cheese?
2446,it is scaary but as soon as you find friends to play with it's an amazing experince!

2450,Even tho i dont really like horror games i still enjoy playing this with friends
2451,PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE VISUAL ISSUES THAT COULD BE A RISK FOR YOUR HEALTH.
2452,POOP
2453,"cute, wud smash"
2454,Pretty fun and spooky for the first 20 hours
2455,"Thoroughly enjoy the game... not many like it at the moment. 

Despite my enjoyment for the game, I do wish that there were moments in the game that were slightly scarier. Say for example, jump scares of the ghost popping out from a door you open. 

Please nerf the spawn rate of the 'Shade'. This ghost type seems to be spawning into most games for me personally.

For the price tag, you will get a game that is good fun with friends and even somewhat fun to play for yourself."

2480,"H, I bought the game phasmophobia on stem in january this year but i wasn't working properly, whenever i tried to load in a match i would get stuck and never load, after this i found out i had a faulty PC, so i thought it was my pc, but i have just got a new one and I am still having the same problem. I have tried to refund it multiple times but i keep getting denied because i bought it a while ago and have more than 2 hours of playtime, but the 3 hours of time i have is me trying to load into multiple matches over the time I have owned it."

2484,great
2485,"This has become one of my favorite games! Never have I played something that has made me scream in terror while also laughing so hard with friends. When I first played this, I thought it would just be a quick couple matches and then maybe pick it up once or twice again in the future, but I find myself playing a few matches almost every night with my sister and having a blast every time. Worth picking it up to play solo as it is a terrifying and fun experience alone, but it becomes even more fun when you play it with friends."

You could even go solo! and show off just how lifeless you are.... 10/10. Also this game is continuously growing and changing and every time i am happily surprised."

2558,"This is very fun to play with friends and if you don't have any friends to play with, then I recommend that you play with randoms. I've joined a lot of different lobbies and have only met people who want to have a good time hunting ghosts

"
2559,yes
2560,"scaryy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i cant even think to play this game alone alawys must need friends! 
but its a best game if  you play with your friends.
fun,scary,enjoyment all mixed.
dev stop the early access and add some more interacts 
there should be a option to kill or capture a ghost
its highly recommended for you guys who plays shooting multi games all-time, you guys will experiance a new thing."

2562,"The best damn ghost hunting game
"
2563,pull pela
2564,game
2565,"Probably one of the best horror experiences i've ever had. one of the only games where you can play with your friends, goof around and the game is still scary. 

you can also play solo. the game is balanced for both Solo play and Co-Op if you don't have any friends playing the game you can join strangers on public lobbies. your goal is simple you need to find out what ghost you are dealing with and if you want a challenge you can ramp up the difficulty and complete side objectives. the ghosts have different personalities and abilities so there is a learning curve. based on your knowledge you can complete missions easier and faster so there is really fun gameplay loop here.

the things above were all the positive stuff about the game now for some of the negative ones. the game has several big and small sized maps. the big maps in this game are not very fun. sometimes ghost rooms are really hard to find and they like to roam around and there is not many hiding spots if the ghost catches you in a big room or hallway it's really hard to get away from. some aggressive ghosts are annoying to play against in the big maps. 

the is still in Early Access. the updates are frequent and meaningful with active Devs posting what they are working on. overall it's worth the price."

Game play good VR is funny and horrifyingly scary. Game mechanics so much to learn simple concept tho. worth the money."
2574,"awesome game to play with friends just started to play this game and its awesome .must just add more scary ghosts and have more updated on the game ,this game have a lot of potential ...."

2577,"Pretty spooky game, really fun with friends."
2578,"- Would be great if they put 2 ghost on the big map and more items to balance. and and and MORE Reward. 
- What if they collaboration on some horror/ghost film like ""The Grudge (KAYAKA), The Ringu (SADAKO) and more, or ANNABELLE on the curse objects etc...""

- Overall it fun playing it on Nightmare and Random Peeps.

2581,nein/10
2582,I came back to this game after like 6 months and it feels like a different game. good job devs on keeping the game fresh
2583,STOP TALKING! TURN THE FLASHLIGHT OFFFF! YOU KILLED ME!!!!!!!!
2584,"good

but devs should work more than ever on this game to keeping it alive
"
2585,"good we friends
"
2586,"its a fun game
"
2587,"This game is scary as f and they did a darn good jerb of it. They've only made it better and better every step of the way. New gameplay mechanics, new ghosts, new kinds of events and effects. It just keeps getting better and better. If you like ghost stuff, this is one of the best games out there.

With that said - the VR version of this game is literally unplayable unless you're immune to motion sickness. The motion sickness in this game's VR is BY FAR the WORST I've ever experienced. It's literally unplayable, and I barely made it through one game and had to put down the headset and lay in bed for the rest of the night. God I wish it wasn't so bad because being able to VR this game is literally the next level of awesome that this game deserves. Hoping for the best on the VR side of development, but otherwise I'll be sticking to the PC version of this game."
2588,"have you ever cracked a rib? no? well now you can when your heart beats too hard while you try to find that last piece of evidence that the ghost is a mare, you are in the high school, and it is twenty minutes into the hunt."
2589,get a second pair of underwair
2590,Please add rape to ghost
2591,Why does the ghost turn me on?
2592,yes
2593,The best horror game just if people can get VR then it would be 10x better
2594,"This game allowed me to immerse myself in a fantastic atmosphere. I experienced various emotions, but noticed bugs. I would like to add a new technique or new small maps to the game, since many people can get bored of the game quickly and it becomes not scary anymore, since you can cheat AI, but I think over time the developers will turn the idea of this game around and it will be even better. And so I recommend everyone to definitely try to play this game!"
2595,"ghost made me scream
"
2596,"Absolutely fantastic game. Community is pretty solid. You'll get some try hards every now and then who take the game too seriously like they are the actual paranormal investigators but you'll come across many more people who are willing to teach others and help you get better.

I absolutely recommend this game as its a blast to play with a group of people."
2597,"unrelentingly boring, runs out of excitement real quick"

9/10."
2615,Wake up. 9/11. Two years. Wake up
2616,A great scare and fun to play
2617,"Co op, horror perfection. They managed to develop it with vr in mind, which is really cool, even just seeing people in your lobby moving in vr can be fun as a bystander,
It is difficult, a lot of the times you won't understand why you were caught, but its all part of the fun. Try not to use discord as it can ruin the fun of getting your coms cut off as you try your hardest to hide, also leave your mic open as it makes things more tense."
2618,is defintly a good game its just its high quality and i lag way to much
2619,"they have ghost sex, love that shit
the ghosts had big titties
fattt asssssss"
2620,don't forget to bring your friends along! should be fun!
2621,"don't waste your money on this game definitely not lying, (update)still bad game"
2622,"It's like Ghostbusters but you never bust the ghosts, you just find them and leave and get paid like $500 for making a huge mess. 

""Oh yeah I threw that book on the floor because we wanted it to draw a pretty picture. Why did I throw a framed childhood picture of you and your family I found on the wall into a pile with your shoes and break all your fine china? Oh that was because we thought it liked throwing things lol my bad. Also please don't mind the corpse in your closet upstairs, that's just my friend."""

2627,good game tbh (pls?)
2628,Every update released for this game makes it better and better. I started playing it last year and am pleased to see how it is growing and getting more challenging and interesting. The character models for the players aren't great but they're putting the effort where it counts which is the ghost hunting. 10/10 great game to play with friends.
2629,slay game
2630,"It's alright I guess. Not really scary, but a little interesting.  I give it a solid ""5 out of 7""  :P"

2655,"The idea of this game is great, but it isn't put into action that well. This is a ghost hunting game where you have to find 3 types of evidence to figure out the ghost. But the evidence, even on the easiest difficulty, is unreasonably hard to find, there is no easy way to understand where the ghost's ""favorite room"" is to find evidence. the tutorial is absurd and not helpful in the slightest. All the tutorial does is put you in a normal game alone. Now the actual game is where it gets a little worse. The evidence is hard to find, the ghost is unreal no matter the difficulty. it takes a good 40 minutes per match average if you want to be super sure.  And don't get me started on the ghost hunting. The ghost, once allowed to hunt, can just hunt whenever. And the lower your sanity is, it will hunt more, for longer, with less time between hunts. Which makes sense, but not when you get to below 20 sanity. Which is very easy to get to, it will hunt for about a minute, and the has a very high chance to hunt a couple seconds after hunting, giving you no time to get any work done. And this makes it hard because maybe you finally figure out what the ghost is, you sprint for the exit. It is now or never, no closets to hide in nearby, no where to run but the exit. You get right there and... hunting. It locks the door and starts hunting, the 20-30 minutes you spent trying to figure out what it is, gone. I love the idea this game brings and I love ghost hunting, but when it isn't made to be fun despite being a game, it isn't that great. I have 11 hours as of writing this review and I have never successfully won and guessed the ghost correctly without dying on the EASIEST difficulty. This game isn't really a casual game. I want to love this game, but they make it hard to. And I'm gonna be honest, this game is not worth buying unless it is on sale :/"
2656,Got rid of wall glitching
2657,boo
2658,"Dog shit game, you can't fucking open the settings while in a lobby"
2659,good game
2660,"A really unique game and absolutely terrifying to play alone!  

The basic premise is your part of a ghost investigation group that has been called out to ""identify"" the type of spirit plaguing the house.   Each ""ghost"" has its own unique abilities that help you figure out the type. 
The game can be a bit repetitive, but you will certainly get your money's worth before you get bored.  

One my top recommendations"

2742,Don't play this at home !!
2743,"Pros:
-Immersive
-Scary
-A ton of replay value


Cons
-maps such as highschool, prison, and asylum will bring the fun to a halt with Asylum being the worst offender.
-Arbitrary leveling system
-some gliches in the game 
-Shade ghost type is boring.

Please make more house type maps. Camp is good too, NO BIG MAPS PLEASE ."

2814,"amazing game, I really enjoy it, but, the problem (for me at least) is that you need friends to play this game, having friends while playing this game makes it a 10/10."
2815,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
2816,"Phasmo is a great game to play late with friends occasionally, I wouldn't play it everyday though. The game is made very well and is a great for a good thrill. I rate it 84/100"

I think there need to be more audio mixer settings, because for some reason when i am playing rings in multiplayer lobbies, the sound of them dropping is uncomfortably loud. And i wish that some of the ghosts could actually do possession stuff, or summon a body that looks like the player character models."

2914,yes it is actually a good game fr fr the ghost railed me though last time it gave me flashbacks of my uncle in 2009 he is now locked up in the pen for 35 years and im still in therapy for it because his dick was genuinely so fucking massive
2915,"I have played a lot in the past but the past changes to ghost mechanic make it no longer fun. Surviving a hunt is no longer possible for me with a lot of ghosts or locations. I kinda enjoyed the ability to escape a ghost and hide from it or even being able to outrun certain ghosts in larger areas. 

It's a shame because it was really great at the start and there are a lot of cool things added. Mechanically it needed little adjustment because the recipe for horror was fun and cool. All we really needed were new maps/tools/objectives."

3091,I believe phasmophobia is the best ghost hunting game out there it still has a few things that needs fixing but overall it's very fun with 24 different ghosts and a ton of maps with 4 difficulties where every game is different it has alot of replay value and is fun to play solo and cooperatively with friends..

3102,"I really like the unique gameplay this game offers! It is hard to pull off multiplayer horror but this game did it so well. Along with the horror aspect, this game is really fun, so it is a good combination of both laughing and screaming. 

I got this game gifted from a friend but I am sure that the 14 dollars is worth it."
3103,"You want horror? you like ghosts? you afraid of ghosts?

THIS GAME IS AMAZING, absolutely wonderful! The developers put a lot of work into this, they also did a great job at getting it working with Proton for the Steam Deck.

3112,You need friends to play this game. Randoms leave immediately. Full of people who leave.
3113,good gam
3114,"When Phasmophobia came out it was ahead of the pack, it was a fresh take on horror games. It has an investigative side that thrills you not by pitting you necessarily against a timer but your hiding skills and practical skills.

Then it stagnated. They've added a few new ghosts here and there but there aren't that many maps which makes it frustrating to play over and over. They're planning one cosmetic change to a map in a future update but that's it.

The number of players has always been and will always be no more than 4. This is great if you like the challenge. Sometimes however you want to play with more friends. Other similar games allow up to 6 players in a team/group. This would be great on the larger maps like school, campsite, prison and asylum(soon to be renamed Sunny Meadows). I feel there should be up to 6 allowed on these maps. Even the ghost seems to get lost or unable to keep up with how big these maps are.

Other games have added additional features like being able to banish or temporarily trap the ghost if you determine what the ghost type is correctly.

An update to the graphics would be great but not necessary.

Maybe instead of just adding more ghosts with similar abilities give them new ones such as walking on the ceiling, being able to drag you, etcetera.

Even changing the way you can be killed, or what appears on your death screen could be great for example a bloody scene instead of just hands folding over your eyes everytime.  

Lastly, this isn't a complaint but would love to see it translated to Arabic like some of the newer competition has done even if it is just community translated.

3119,"This is a review of the VR mode, not the flatscreen one. 

Absolutely awful VR mode. After the VR overhaul they made it worse.

Heres some of the many things wrong with the VR mode

. Objects hold weird
. Objects throw weird
. The notebook is in an uncomfortable spot to reach
. Performance is absolutely awful
. No finger tracking for index users, or capacitive support.
. You can't change your bindings for the game
. Bindings for the index are unbearably awful. It forces you to use thumbstick to sprint, which causes drift on the controllers over time
. Doors open weird, they were fine before the overhaul
. Objects are harder to put into your belt than before
. Your hand is very jittery when holding an item
. You can only see your hands, and there is no option to see your arms, and or body
. Your hands don't change skin color depending on your avatar
. You dont collide with objects unless you pick them up
. When objects collide with each other its very buggy

The game gets boring once you get good too, or when you play with friends that are good at the game. Updates are infrequent as well. Its super bug ridden too.

If you're not playing in vr, and only looking to get 20ish hours of content out of this game, I recommend it."

3125,"amazing game
love screaming with my friends and forcing them to buy it so that we can scream together"
3126,yes
3127,"I used to really love this game, then the latest updates show the clear decent this game is going.
They added many ghosts instead of optimizing the game, most of the ghosts on the list hardly show up anyway.
The problems, Ghosts:
Constantly walking through walls
Killing not even close to you
Spawning in completely different areas consistently(sometimes the ghost spawns where it despawned after a hunt)
Ghosts teleporting
Had a few times it killed without even going into a hunt, door remained open
We witnessed two ghosts in two different areas and we thought ""oh this is cool it must be twins"" nope, not twins.
Most ghosts do not follow any pattern in the book.  An example is the wraith: stepping in salt, leaving footprints, and its footsteps are very audible.

A lot of my friends with VR's are constantly having crashes when being killed, the game locks up as they get to its lair. 
The reflections KILL frame rate and the worst map for it is campgrounds, even my non VR friends have frame rate drops."
3128,"Fun and scary game, best to be played with those more experienced who can show you the ropes of it all. Don't forget to turn off the lights."
3129,Really fun game. Not that scary but with people who don't know how to play the game you are scared for your stuff. Other than that can scare even the most experienced ghost hunter

"
3155,i like the game and also its going to help me get some bitches finally :)
3156,"When you learn how to play, the game is actually fun, only thing id wish is variety and randomisation optimisation since after playing for a while the game becomes very repetitive.

Things i noticed, liked and or would like to see changed:

Sound Design is awesome and well done, most of the jump scares / appearances feel natural / good.

Thing the game needs most like i stated is variety, and more unique level design, since majority of maps feel like a mirrored version of another map with some rooms added/removed.

Ghost design should also be improved and make the game less forgiving. you can basically just hide behind a door in a hunt and the ghost wont know your there.

Add more voice stuff, yelling ""give us a sign"" over and over again ruins the mood.

Overall ambient, sound, gadget, gameplay mechanics design is awesome and executed really well.

Multiplayer works as intended, very fun and spooky with friends if especially if you play for the first time.

Games very good, and i think its the best out of all possible ""paranormal activity"" and scary multiplayer games.

I feel like if they improve on the variety of maps, ghost events, jump scares, ghost appearances, objectives, way ghosts behave, add more ""scary"" id say.

After the hours (6) i played the game sort of feels like a game to grind, or speed run.

Like i said not a bad game, but needs things listed above to keep people coming to play.

3204,"I dont recommend this game,
 First of all you'll get bored of the game after like 2 days game is not scary, games get repeatative. 

Second From my playing experience the US server is filled with RACIST people, If you dont speak English fluently or your accent is little bit different youll get kicked of the group instantly or they'll make fun of you and make you leave. Other than English i dont know any other language so i cant play in different servers. 

So why don't i make my own group you say? because no one want to join a level 10 or 20 or 100 player you'll be keep waiting for ages.

3205,"Made me piss myself, its a good game play it"
3206,Yup

3208,Had fun at start but the updates are quite dull and you get to lose interest fast . Also buy it only on discount .

3210,if you dont know how to play it is terrifying but if you are on flatscreen or know how to play it becomes no where near as exciting
3211,"very pog game, would play again 10/10"

3242,its fun
3243,This game gave me a real scare 10/10
3244,"This game provides a fantastic amount of fun for trying to ghost hunt with your friends. Although I haven't played for too long, every time we play, we find some other new scare or mechanic or whatever else that we didn't know about before. The game can actually be kinda scary and that's what makes it so funny with friends. I just hope you don't mind having a bit of your own feces in your pants after your playing session."
3245,this is a fun game to play with friends and is being worked on with love from the Dev team still. i would recommend this game to anyone.
3246,It was good
3247,"I am obsessed with this game, the amount of strategy in this game is amazing. This game is not something I would recommend to play alone because it is wayyyy more fun and easier the more people you play with. The graphics are beautiful and well thought through. If you are questioning getting this game I would just like to say, YOU SHOULD TOTALLY GET IT."
3248,"Spooky ghost hunting game that is bad alone but amazing with a group. It needs more consistent content updates though, there isn't much in it right now."
3249,Ghosts
3250,Amazingly spooky Devs know what they are doing and each update makes things better.

3253,ah scare
3254,"We haven't figured out how to succeed at this game and we've been playing for 3 nights straight.  It's somewhat fun to do with friends, but frustrating that we never seem to get anything right, except getting murdered."

3280,used to be fun but then we had no updates for 7-8 months. they come up with ideas for an april fools prank rather then trying to work on the things and attempting to give us the things we ask for. Real shame because i used to enjoy this game but now i've lost faith in these developers
3281,"its a nice game and fun to play with friends. if you are alone do not buy this game.

3282,ghsots hate the french
3283,"This game is amazing already on it's own, love to play by myself to try to scare myself when I have trouble sleeping lol, but this game is 100% way better with friends to mess around with or to actually play the game it's supposed to be played."

3312,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked a song and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he taught me how to play. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

3319,yyyyyoyooouyoyo
3320,OoOOooOoOoo spooky
3321,This game can be scary at times but the ways the characters move is funny def reccomend!
3322,"Phasmophobia, the game that scares us all but we never stop playing it.

Behind the tension of entering an empty and haunted house is the excitement of playing with friends while being chased by a ghost who decides to kill one of the four of us.  

If I had to say what one of the best multiplayer horror video games I've played, I'd probably just say Phasmophobia right now."
3323,"Any of these little fuckers ever pop out of the fucking wall and say ""fuck there's a horse cock in my room, or a donkey dick?"""
3324,Still playing it to this day but the updates are slow. Only complaint.

3336,epic
3337,this game is good its also pretty easy to run I have a 4700u with 8gb ram and the only map that is hard to run is the campsite. Every other map is fine 40-60 fps 1080p

3347,really good for the price.
3348,"Creepy and fun, it's a good game to play with friends. There are a decent amount of maps to choose from, with a few different levels of difficulty. The only change I would like to see is the ability to add more than 4 players to your group, especially for the larger maps."

3387,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

3391,242 hours into this game so far. This is my go to game to play with friends. For being a horror game we find ourselves laughing most of the time because it's just that much fun. There are still those scary moments that keep the game fresh. Best coop game so far. Give it 2 thumbs up.

3452,"Great game to play, development is steady and has shown incredible polish over the years with great promise for the future.


I only play with friends so i have nothing to share about random lobbies."
3453,"A very fun game. Just make sure you play with friends, mess with the cursed items when your friends tell you not to, get your highest level friend killed because you used the cursed item, scream as loud as you can and find the ghost."
3454,best game
3455,Its spooky so its fun and scary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3456,
3457,"Great game, however i did almost cry from fear when i asked where are you and the ghost said ""here."""
3458,the game looks pretty good but the animations are terrible the player models look wack the only reason i played it so much is because my friend begs me to 90% of the game is just waiting for something to happen while you sit in a room and do nothing
3459,nice ghost game
3460,great game g
3461,Very good game so far even though its in earlu access. Cant wait for custom difficulty it will be so fun. I play with my friends all the time. Its all fun and jokes. I hope the game is still as good as it is now when it is out of early access.
3462,Very nice game.Recommend it its kinda scarry but you will get used to it :D
3463,"Terrifying when alone, incredibly fun when your with people"
3464,"With or without VR, this game is crazy fun. Especially when you have a mic and the rest of your party does too, it can lead to amazing moments together. Want a fun 4 player game with good scares and endless replayability? This game is for you..."

3476,"Best played with friends, scary, funny, fun"
3477,The suspense and horror is top tier 5/5
3478,"It's a quality game overall. Highly recommend. I can hop on and play a few rounds and hop off.

Even after a hundred hours of playing, I still get spooked by the ghost, and sometimes I get actually scared and have to sleep with the lights on at night. I still die and am able to have fun, and I continue to learn how to get better at the game and challenge myself.

Its quality, I look forward to its further development."

3545,"What can I say about Phas that isn't already well known to the gaming community? This has got to be one of the most iconic horror games ever made, and it's not even complete yet. 
If you haven't played this game yet and you like horror games, then what the heck are you waiting for? Get it now and start playing! This game never gets boring and is a blast to play with others. It's just nonstop fun and spooks left and right. 

I will say the character models and movements are very jank (but also hilarious) and likely are low on the dev's list flesh out. Some maps could use little tweaks here and there to improve the efficiency of your ghost hunting, but it's still unfinished. So don't fret too much about bugs or graphical quirks. Controller support needs a lot of work too in my opinion. So only plan to play this on mouse and keyboard if you don't want to get stuck opening a door during a ghost hunt and die. 

Also, there could stand to be more maps to choose from. They have all 48 continental US states on the map but only have about 10 locations, 6 of which are small street houses or farm houses. These are good to have in order to have quick levels to play, but the game could benefit from more variety in the medium to large sized maps. There's a lot of missed potential with FL, GA, LA, and MA given the amount of famously ""haunted"" locations there are in those states.

Final verdict: 9.5/10 - Excellent replayability, good scary atmosphere, tons of spooks, great multiplayer, and a good difficulty system that rewards players for better knowledge of the game and the ghost's mechanics. Just needs more maps, some polish, and to be finished."

3558,The best horror game iv ever played. Even better playing with friends.
3559,"Great and fantastic multiplayer fun and a solid single player experience. Plenty of fun and unique ghostly experiences with plenty different ghost types in the game. Fun to use items and classic ghost hunting gear like the EMF reader. Tense horror filled moments with ghosts. Big and small maps that are fun to explore in. Overall I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a good horror experience and a for fun ghost hunting game. My only problem with the game currently as of August 23, 2022 is sometimes you get an echo through some people's microphones even though they do not echo in other games and sometimes randomly getting booted out games i don't know if this is just my internet or not yet so yeah I've got to keep testing that. [i] P.S. the developers seem to be aware of the problems listed and might be working to fix it soon [/i]"

3563,
3564,...
3565,"I was excited for this game until i realized i could roam the entire map and not be chased by the ghost, in order to be chased you must provoke the ghost (turning on lights mainly). I reallly wanna be scared when i enter a house knowing that i could walk into a room and see the ghost in the corner at any minute and shit myself, but instead i walk around comfortably knowing i got to provoke it first"

3581,"Game is so fun with a group of friends and terrifying whether playing alone or in a group!! Also, the game is still fun even when replaying the same maps.

However, it would be sooooo cool if when a friend in the group dies, there's a chance to hear them for a few seconds through the spirit box if they are nearby an alive player with the spirit box active. Also, would be neat if a dead player can either aid in leaving same ghost evidence for the living team or can have some way/chance to help stop the ghost from hunting their living friends.

Just some thoughts, but the game is still a solid game as is and tons of fun!! Definitely worth a try!"

3603,amazing game
3604,This game is so much fun. There are some things they should add though. One is more space. You should be able to add more crucifixes. This doesn't even need to be an update for more stuff. We can buy more space. Also put some Dousing Rods in the game. They are a paranormal tool where you can ask a ghost to cross the rods. That could be another kind of evidence and objective. I also think an abandoned factory map could be really good.

Rather play a Sherlock Holmes mystery than this. The community is rather mostly trolls or just vibing. I do want to ask that a lot of the community would push you to get the right answer when of course it's obvious that the situation is quite stressful. The game itself is like ""Oh guess what ghost this is"" some of the variety of ghosts has something similar which frustrates me even more. When trying to look for clues and deduce everything I have to go inside while the ghost is gonna kill us on its territory.
"
3641,"its just kinda meh.

theres no real horror aspect apart from a 2 second cheap jumpscare every time you get caught, and then the rest of the time the game consists of just you and a few friends running around confused yelling some white girls name into the abyss"
3642,"Absolutely epic. Very scary, wouldn't play alone."
3643,"ewe pee pee ewe papa
"
3644,love taking pictures of my friends that are dead after the ghost hunted for a minute straight
3645,"repetitive and one-note after the first few hours, has no replayability once you get good on intermediate. it's just an ugly Unity asset flip game with no actual stylistic direction. the map roster is same-y aside from the high school and prison/asylum. there is no actual scares to it other than it being dark and getting outlandishly loud if you get hunted. it also unnecessarily uses room codes instead of normal Steam invites despite being released exclusively on Steam, for whatever reason.

game is mostly dead in every month that isn't October unless they're tryhards or ecouples.

if you think $14 is worth around 10 hours of monotonous and trite kusoge gameplay then maybe it's for you."
3646,"this is top 5 for me in all games that I have ever personally played, wether you look up the craziest secrets about every ghost, memorize mas and spawns, or play loud music to shit on ghosts its fun"

3686,"If you're here for state of the art graphics, high FPS, or bugless gameplay, this might not be the game for you. This is a game that has a lot of glitches and bugs (it's a feature!), but also a lot of heart. And jump-scares. It's genuinely very fun with a group of friends, and while the clunky controls might be frustrating at the start, it does feel rewarding to keep playing. You will get better at it, and you'll start to learn ghost behavior. It feels worthwhile to spend your time in-game! Your heart will race, you'll belly-laugh, and you'll create inside jokes with your friends that will never get old. 

Also, have a look around your safe room! There are some fun easter eggs."

3712,very scary i love the game several very cool nuances and niche things
3713,I love this game the tutorial is super vital in my opinion to understanding clues and the basics of the game as it isn't laid out anywhere else. I also love the in game communications theyre super scary when supernatural stuff happens and you can't hear each other. the maps are also great and all updates as looking amazing
3714,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

WHAT IS THIS. when i ran it i was excited to try it out, but WHEN I PLAYED, OH MY GOD. i was SPOOKED. im traumatized due to this, i thought you would go GOAT hunting with your friends, but i misread it! its GHOST HUNTING PEOPLE. NOW my friend needs to save me by using the HOLY CROSS everytime i run this game because I CANT STOP CRYING. last time i played, my friend  was protecting me with the holy cross and I STILL WET MY PANTS. ITS HORRIFYING. THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE MORE CLEAR with its SCARINESS AND HORRORS in the title, so that little kids do not buy this (now im not a little kid or something, JUST SAYING.) the only reason im giving it a thumbsup is because HOLY CROSS OF JESUS SAVES US!!!!!!!!! THIS IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN GAME MY LADS! <3"

3772,"For starters, it’s a great multiplayer game for Steam friends. Using your in-game radios adds a whole new layer of play and fear because of the surrounding environment. I’ll explain that in a moment.

At any rate, you can investigate locations on your own or have up to four players in a single session. It’s a great game to get a few friends together late on a Halloween night.
 I enjoy all of these experiences, but even when things get intense I'm never really afraid.

Phasmophobia is a game that gets into your head. When you're playing the real world doesn't exist. When you stop, some aspect has seeped into reality. 
This game has left myself and companions not so much stunned as scrambled, jacked on adrenaline and chatting for hours afterwards about what just happened. 

I like the cabin and the asylum maps, myself. And the school is massive, should you decide to go for a gameplay session that could last a couple of hours."
3773,"This game is just SCARY!!!
I was wondering how cool it would be if, maybe, on nightmare mode, while the sanity is dropping the protagonist starts to have hallucinations and mix up their judgement on what are the real ghost manifestations and the products of their mind."
3774,first time ive ever played it i walk into a room and a guy with an axe chased me. very good.

3780,fun to play with friends
3781,The thrill is thrilling.
3782,its cool.... fun to be had. Lacks challenges tho found myself wanting more of a challenge a lot even tho game is on highest difficulty but overall just a fun time to kill game  5/10
3783,"Very cool game, makes me wanna kill my brother"
3784,"fantastic game to play with friends, really scary and just over all really fun"
3785,The game is amazing to play with friends and get some scare! There's a lot of Ghosts and its a nice experince to get haunted and survive the haunt. The game has no room for improvement from my point of view so I'll give it a 7/10.
3786,This game is probably one f the best games out there. But by far the best for ghost huntin
3787,pls add big tiddy ghost

3808,"If you like ghost hunting you'll probably like this but for me I would rather just play ghost busters or something else because in this game there is no thrill in the chase you can fast walk for 5 seconds and hide sure but its not what you would think, For me its just not scary and to basic for me to enjoy, If I had to rate it 1-10 on how scary it is it would be a 2, The Xbox 360 horror games were more scary then this shit. Now like I said before if you like ghost hunting you'll like this game, They do a good job pumping out content and etc to support their game but for me its really not a horror game...As in the scary feel of it and the animations are just to basic when you die and etc for me but you might like it."

3818,GHOST SO SCARYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
3819,"The one that started all the ghost hunting games.  I love that this has VR - it's the only way I play.

For the longest time I only tried out Training (8 hours), because I didn't have the nerve to put myself at risk in an actual mission.  But a couple weeks ago, I finally tried my first mission.  So far I've done 27 of them and haven't died yet.  I'm now level 17, but I haven't tried Professional yet... 

After you figure out the right way to go about most safely investigating ghosts and going for the best rewards you can, you might think the game could stand to offer a little more.  I've seen other ghost hunting games that add more activities and make the ghosts more active and energetic, but this game has a simplicity that encourages its very effective dread.  I do hope the developers find ways to add more activities that don't subtract from the game's already very strong points.

(Update: I've done 35 total missions, 8 on Pro, and I died twice - still learning the ropes.  Ghosts aren't as predictable as I thought.  Especially the Mimic, which got me both times...)

(Update 2: Now up to 53 missions and level 37, been playing Pro ever since.  Still only the two deaths, mainly because I learned to keep my sanity up and be cautious about Demons, Yokai and Mimics.  I do enjoy the unpredictable nature of the game.  If things happened too regularly, it would be a lot less scary.  I don't really push for perfect games (full set of pictures) just yet, since that takes more time and risks my sanity dropping low and being subjected to hunts.  But I do try to figure out the ghost type, even if that means spending a little extra time trying to rule out other evidence when I'm not detecting what I need.)"

3844,"After only 52 hours In this game I can say this is a wonderful investigation styled horror game.  Here are some pro's and Con's to this game so far.

Pro's
- Great visuals, Music, and Sounds
- Variety of ghost models, shapes, sizes, and movement animations
- Variety of tools and equipment that aid in the investigation
- Ghosts have unique hidden abilities that allow the player to immerse themselves in an investigative mindset
- The maps are well crafted and very enjoyable for each investigation
- Multiplayer is enjoyable, and usually friendly to new and old players
- Smooth multiplayer, for the most part
- Regular content additions, bug fixes, and general updates to the game!
- Different difficulty levels that allow the players to test their investigative knowledge
- The game is still early development and costs less than most games.
- In-game built in voice recognition
- always given the basic equipment needed to find the ghost
- Tons of replayability, and more but ill leave it at that for now

Con's
- Some placement and movement bugs that continue to get flushed out with each update
- Minor bugs and fixes that aren't game breaking but can be noticed from time to time
- Minor ghost movement bugs
- Some larger maps feel more repetitive and empty, however that is being worked on for the next update
- The money system becomes useless after many successful matches, (However if you die a lot then you may struggle with this mechanic and not be able to afford certain equipment)
- The in game training is useless and very uninformative, along with the ghost journal that is suppose to explain the ghosts

Overall, I have fallen in love with this game, Its a beautiful balance between scary, uneasy, and investigative knowledge building.  You end up learning about each ghost and their ability's as you play within the community.  Also you get better and faster at finding the ghost, and items throughout the maps.  As time goes on, and you try harder difficulty modes, you find yourself growing in the knowledge of each individual ability with each ghost. Overall I would say this game is an 9/10, given that it is still early access and still has bug fixes and frequent large updates.

P.S. Look up Youtube videos from either Insym, or Bushwack 18 to discover knowledge about the items you use, and ghost types to help you better understand how to play.  The game gives a poor training tutorial on how the tools work and what you are looking for.  Don't let this small point ruin your time on such an enjoyable game.

3845,Very fun hearing everyone scream from the other room
3846,This game is only fun when your friends arent lame and stay in the truck all game
3847,play good game
3848,I LOVE THIS GAME.
3849,"Phasmaphobia is one of the most fun games I have played in a while. I don't think I will ever play it as I have never been good with horror/scares. But I can say with confidence when playing with friends that 1: Know how to play the game and 2: Have a good sense of humor, it is one of the best digital experiences you can have. 5 hours into my play-through and there is still so much more to this game. The gameplay although simple, does not have a repetitive feel as the different amount of evidence combinations can lead to different ghosts, and the fact that anytime (when on certain difficulties and above) a ghost hunt can start and you have to run and hide for your dear life as you stay as silent as death itself. Whether you survive or not (from my experience) is up to luck. If you complete the main objective of identifying the ghost, there are always sub-challenges for extra spice on the seasoning of this digital masterpiece that even Gordon Ramsey would have to approve. When it comes to the cons, I can't think of many. This might sound stupid, but I play this game on my school HP Laptop, and I have to lower almost all of the graphics to have a smooth experience. That is my only con. THAT, is all I can think of when it comes down to the negativity of the game.     The amount of ghost-to-map combinations are insane, as there are 24 ghosts and 10 maps, resulting in 240 different combinations of ghost identifications, and awesome play-throughs. If you are on the fence about getting this game, and you see this review, my one piece of advice. Gather your friends, and GET THIS GAME."

3871,spooik
3872,very good
3873,"Lots of fun to discover and play with friends. Not so much replayability, not enough maps, quite frustrating bugs or game design flaws. For example, game objectives can be: Prevent ghost from hunting with a crucifix, but even if you place it just a few feet from the ghost location, it will spawn and kill you nonetheless. The objective could also be to take a photo of the ghost, which even if you do, won't matter for some reason and you won't get the objective, so you end up dying, losing all your gear and feeling like you have been played by the game itself because you did everything right and still lost. The game as a concept is great, but in its current state and judging by the speed at which this game updates, I fear there will be better options to choose from before it reaches a better state and has enough maps. I really believe community made maps would give this game the potential to be awesome. 6/10 or 3 stars out of 5."

If at least it was scary, but even slenderman was scarrier back in the day. 
There is no atmosphere, its just black and with a flashlight a tiny bit less so, only danger in the game is clipping on corners and getting slowed because of that. Once you know the map layout its a snore fest

Not even in games, I find more friends. 

Still, 10/10 for making me annoyingly paranoid."

4040,This game is very good when your f*cking around with the homies when they are energetic and high asf and no clue what's going on. only downsides to this game is the bugs but developing games aren't easy gotta give respect to the devs.

And the interactions with ghost is spine chilling, and the hiding spots and the sound effects make it scary. The chases are amazing, and the controls feel nice. I highly recommend this game if your into ghost hunting or horror games in total. 9/10"

4074,fff
4075,istg the cheaters in this game are more scarier then the ghost themselves.

4110,"First experience playing this game...
Playing with nephew who has played it alot more than I have...
Found the room where the ghost is (the bedroom)...proceeds to tell me to set up a video cam on a tripod and put a book down on the floor....
Then stands there antagonising the ghost asking for a sign...quickly runs out the bedroom, shuts the door behind him...leaves me for dead.
I Alt+F4 to save my own life and accuses me of being a scardy cat!!

Moral of the story, never ghost with your Nephew."
4111,Brilliant game 10/10. Community 10/10. So worth it!

4115,"""Hey this new house I just bought is hella nice looking, it will look even better once I've moved all my furniture and shit in. Wait, what was that noise? Lemme go check Im sure its nothing"" That was their last words. Then they saw a demon and it proceeded to eliminate them."
4116,"With only making it 1.5 hours into gameplay with friends, I've found that this game is far too dated for my preference. I do not enjoy the controls, the gameplay, or the movement of your character. Everything feels buggy and dated for it to be in development for this period of time. 

The concept of this game is very intriguing to me but the execution fell short. Would love to try it again in a few years."
4117,"A very good game to play with your friends especially if one of them is drunk enjoyable alone too but a lil bit more of a spooky experience 

feel like it could be better if they allowed ppl to submit community maps through workshop (im aware this allow people to make mod menus and stuff but thats why i feel there should be a voting system among the staff for maps"
4118,Good game fun with freind and scary.
4119,GOOD
4120,Great Game i love it :)
4121,this game is good but to a limit there isnt enough options to hurt the ghost or do stuff with the ghost its just run and hide. oh and if u die have fun sitting for 10 minutes.
4122,I played this game once and now I have to hide from ghost in fear of them trying to have sex with me. Ruined my life.
4123,This game helped me beat my fear of ghosts. Except the Demon - he makes me sleep with a night light on :)

4144,"With a great ghost hunting experience, Phasmophobia is a game with immense potential and replayability. Use different equipment to identify ghosts, while being on the lookout for ghost hunts. Each match is crafted procedurally, therefore making them unique. You can select one of the 10 maps and get into a game to have a great and very spooky experience. Oh did i mention you have coop as well?"

4212,Very Spook
4213,"Easily one of my favorite horror games. In singleplayer, the game is absolutely terrifying. Going into the dark house all by yourself always has you on the edge of your seat as you try to figure out what kind of ghost you're hunting. Every time I play singleplayer I always finish playing with my heart beating out of my chest from fear. This is a horror game that is actually scary and can leave you speechless (or in the case of my friend, paralyzed) from fear. The multiplayer is so much fun. Getting a couple friends together and going together to look for a ghost is one of my favorite way to spend my weekend nights. It is always so much fun, being both scared but also joking around with friends and trying to get the job done. Highly recommendable and anyone who hasn't played this game is missing out BIG TIME."

4229,nice greek game
4230,"Very family friendly got shot up in the school
"
4231,i am waiting for the ghostbusters game
4232,this game is very fun with friends but also scared the shit out of me when im in the ghost room alone...
4233,"friend and i were hiding in a locker during a ghost hunt, he started screaming, ghost killed me

10/10 with friends"
4234,"My favorite thing to do is to close the front door behind me and get my friends locked in there while the ghost hunts, resulting in their deaths. :)"
4235,I did not get to smash a big tiddy ghost girl. Spooky. :D
4236,scary
4237,"very goot.
"
4238,YES
4239,It's probably a poltergeist.
4240,"короче иду я в дом а там какойто негр меня пытаеться убить а афигел и начал убигатьт
за мной пабежал он и я плакал и какал в штана но но но меня так легко не подибить я топ чел и в роблоксе харош ну короче игра хуйня там нету питомцов"
4241,GOOD
4242,"its a great game

4245,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I love it, and I'm looking forward to all the upcoming changes and balancing. 100% worth the purchase for me."
4246,"Very good game, it has so much own things i recommend it!"
4247,The dogs danglies as far as ghost hunting goes!
4248,It's soo good
4249,"Really Good, the community is awesome I truly recommend this game to any horror game lovers and streamers!"
4250,a cool game to play with friends
4251,"exactly what I wanted. Ghost hunting with friends every ghost event is a fight or flight response. They keep adding new content and tactics to this game. The one thing  I don't really like is sometimes the evidence takes a bit to get like they will not touch any door so cant check fingerprints sometimes also there is sometimes it grabs me during a hunt before check my hiding spot, if I'm hiding in a closet it would grab me and the doors wouldn't even open the slightest so i think its kinda ridiculous but i really really like this game waiting for more updates to have even scarier interactions or ghost events"
4252,This game is like fun scary not like horror games would recommend
4253,yes
4254,AGGGGG ITS OK
4255,"Phasmophobia is a great horror game to play alone, but playing with friends makes it hilarious and terrifying."
4256,"Its good and abit sacry

4259,play with friends and watch your friendship disapear
4260,very good for a horror game
4261,"I'd recommend this game for what it is overall. Some things might look clunky a bit, but the game in itself is fun, easy to learn and play, and just spooky enough to get you a little kick when you start playing, even tho you're getting used to it quickly.

The only downside that comes to mind about this game, is how shi* the community might be sometime, teenagers with big ego and kids using cursed item behind your back, trying to get the rest of the squad getting killed is a problem, but at the same time, there's not much you can do to prevent that kind of stuff i guess. Other than that, i'm mostly having a great time playing it."
4262,"Do you like watching horror games, but think you're too chicken to play one? This game is for you! Grab some friends, pile in the truck and have a steak out, you'll have a good time even if you get your pants scared off.

Phasmaphobia is more than a horror game, it's an investigation and deduction game. Each ghost has it's unique combination of 3 types of evidence, AND each one also has it's own secret unique tell. Most of us learn these from other players and let's-players (Luv u Insym <3), so no matter how you learn the game, you get to flex your knowledge every match.

Don't be afraid to start from the bottom. If you wanna get some practice in, there's a tutorial level with a friendly ghost for you to gather evidence from! Play Amateur with your friends until you feel comfortable to try intermediate... and before you know it, you'll be identifying ghosts on nightmare like a professional sleuth.

Dive on in, face your fears. You wont regret it."
4263,Great game and can be hilarious with friends.
4264,i think its pants
4265,w game
4266,yknow this game gets a whole lot scarier when you used to have 3 friends with you and now you dont and its dark with your flashlight goin all wonky
4267,ghost game go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
4268,"Game unlike any other. Relaxing, frightening and fun all at the same time. And the devs keep making it better and better. Strongly recommend if you like horror. Gaming."
4269,"its fun when u play with ur friend, thumbs up"
4270,funky little ghost game take my money
4271,Nugget pooped a little but its fine the pwetty lily did not see it
4272,"Scary alone, but intensely hilarious and fun with a group of friends."
4273,"Shat in my pants a few times while playing this game, not sure if it was a medical problem but the experience so far is quite a spine-tingling one."

4279,"fun, but very stressful. if you get frightened easily this game might be challenging for you so suggested playing with people until you get the hang of it"

LOVE. THIS. GAME"
4285,"SPAZMOPHOBIA - A Review Written by x0Salmon_Master0x

a good friend once told me ""hey have you heard of a game called phasmophobia? we should well play it!"" and ever since then, my life has been changed for the worse

there is nothing worse then loading up into a game, bricking myself before entering the house and chasing after an invisible person trying to check its temperature and trying not to get molested, getting left behind by your 'so-called-mates' and then getting killed and my friend taking a proper mug of me on the camera and making a tenner. i play this game in VR, which makes the little ghost demon chasing me 10x worse, i almost booted it once since i had flashbacks to vietnam when i volleyed these children for no reason, it was hilarious lmao he span around on the spot like sonic and shot off really really fast hahahah

i will share a secret with you. this is normally how talking to the ghost goes:

""hello are you there?""
*no answer*
""what is your name?""
*no answer*
""where are you?""
*no answer*
""how did you die?""
*no answer*
""please can you make yourself present and move something?""
*no answer*
""right f*ck off then""
*lights starts flashing and i am never to be seen again*

hunting a ghost named dave grinnigan has never been so much fun, apart from the fact that im sat behind a fridge silently whimpering to myself holding a crucifix while i hear my mandem pissing about with a plate and a microphone in the van. what is also my favourite part is the constant verbal abuse and hurling virtual punches at each other to decide who has to stay in the room alone and do the spirit box.

one reason i love this game is the ouija board. one time i asked it if it wanted to play scrabble and it immediately went dark and spread me open like a sket at 2am. it was the only time ive been chased by a woman. i only wanted to play a game with it. i remember vividly hiding in a wardrobe with my boy, and he suddenly farted and got us killed.

it is funny however to send in martin to have a friendly chinwag with the ghost strapped with a go-pro on his meathead and send him on his jollies, then to see our torches flash from inside the van, an abruptly long scream and then it cuts off suddenly and we see him folded into the letter 4 in a corner somewhere.


10/10 game though cant lie

4290,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
4291,wow
4292,This is a good fun game and I 100% this game for other gamer's like myself :)
4293,Its Sketchy
4294,"Love this game so much, it never gets old. From playing public matches to playing with friends. It is a bit scary at first but it gets so fun once you get better! Would definitely recommend buying it."
4295,"Great horror coop game! If you wanna be scared and have fun with some friends, this is the game for you. If you dont play the game for long and intense intervals, you can come back and be just as frightened a few months later. Even tho there is alot to learn in this game, when you know what to do the fear kinda disappears, but the game is still fun and challenging."
4296,good 👍
4297,its scary at the start then its more of a speedrun game
4298,"The game is really fun and creative i recomend this game 
"
4299,its god game
4300,"I have been interested in this game ever since seeing a couple of YouTubers playing when it was originally released in early access back in 2020. 
Earlier this year, a friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, and I have been playing it ever since. In the first couple of months I would only play it with my friends' squad, as I am a little squeamish - despite being a horror aficionado, I am not a great fan of playing horror games on my own. It has always been really fun to play, leading to some good and laughable moments with friends.
A couple of weeks ago, after having seen a lot of live streams on Twitch, I finally made the decision to venture on it solo and it has been a really cool experience. I am still a bit squeamish, but I now feel way more comfortable with the game and feel that it has very much improved my overall gameplay.
I recommend this game to any fan of the horror/supernatural genre and investigation games. Also if you are a fan of co-op games, I think you will have a blast at this with friends.
I have yet to try the game in VR but, from my experience so far, I love all aspects of the game. One thing I would like to see improved is some customisation options for the characters. That would be very cool.

4301,funny game! (i argentina)
4302,awesome maps and ghost that make you want to wee your self.
4303,sa mi bag pl
4304,shit myself
4305,Funny game
4306,"I definitely say the game is fun, even better with friends, most of the community is actually nice and not so toxic; My only issue with the games current state is that the hunting mechanics are not as good as they used to be, after the Nightmare implement the hunting is very buggy and you die to things that shouldn't kill you. My best of wishes to all that play and please enjoy GLHF Cheers!"
4307,nice game very good
4308,spooky
4309,yes
4310,"Incredible game, especially with friends."
4311,"Everyday, I wake up and take out my Spirit Box and ask: Are you French or Are Your Pizza?"
4312,a fun game if you like gambling with your life.
4313,i asked if they wanted to be my gf and then killed me :(
4314,fuck yeah
4315,"super fin with friend
"
4316,i shidded
4317,Best thing to do with friends. wait until they are all really deep into the house and searching and use the tarot cards or the music box and hide straight away and listen for the sheer panic as a cursed hunt has begun and then wait for one of them to die. 5/7 would highly recommend
4318,MBB
4319,"Great game with friends, especially if a revenant is chasing you."
4320,pretty spooky
4321,Less Go
4322,"fun easy game, all you have to do is sit in the van while the ai completes every mission for you, although they tend to insult you for some strange reason"

"
4328,good game to play with friends
4329,"Phasmophobia is a very thrilling and exciting game, especially with friends. With each new update, the game gets better and better, although to some people it could be the type of game that gets boring very fast unless you're an expert. If you eventually get bored of it, I would highly recommend trying out VR with this game. It takes the game to a whole new level of thrill and scariness."

4337,the ghosts are thicc
4338,"This game is easily my favorite game ever. It lures you in with the thrill of identifying ghosts, while at the same time trying your goddamn hardest to not be murdered. Each ghost is unique, which makes it entrancing for new players to pick up and learn. The game is constantly undergoing updates, while taking into consideration ideas from its player base. This game is amazing and I can't wait to see where it goes!"
4339,very scary game ...also vey fun.

"
4394,
4395,my favorite activity is sending my friends into the high school and watching them die one by one while chilling in the van
4396,"Hiring new people to help with the project was the best decision that was done.
I am loving the new content and improvements that helped this game get out of its prototype-asset-flip-y phase.
A lot of other ""ghost hunting"" games tried to copy this game with no success, because they miss the key ingredients. Organic and not random jumpscares in your face every 10 seconds and building of atmosphere and eventual dread.

All I'd wish is for some balancing done towards the player's favor. For example when the ghost is hunting, you now have no indication that it is hunting unless you're very close to the ghost. In addition the ghost often is not visible, which might cause you to get killed with no chance to see it coming so you can plan and take action to protect yourself.

Can't wait for the new upcoming content and horror update."
4397,"Great game, ghosts can be trolls (looking at mimic) but over all it's a great way to mess around with friends and experiance the AI paranormal messing with you."
4398,W game with friends
4399,Super fun with friends.

4409,5454
4410,hell yes
4411,"I Totally Recommend This Game! Well If You Love Horror Of Course. This Game Is Actually Terrifying At The Start, But Further In The Game At Around 30 Hrs Of Playing You Get Used To It! But It Still Is Scary, But After 50 Hrs You Kind Of Become A Professional And Rarely Die, Except For Nightmare 0_0 
(And Yes I Do Have 330+ Hours Of Playtime, This Game Can Get Addicting)"
4412,Fun game and mostly friendly and great people
4413,so fun
4414,"Fun game, lots of ghost variety so it doesn't get stale."
4415,Scary at the perfect times!

4422,yes
4423,"brilliant game, especially in the dark with DECENT headphones on. great ambience."
4424,awseome now i know waht to do when i see a ghost
4425,"So I bought this game because I watch Insym play it. I watch every twitch stream of his. Obsessed? No, it's just such a good game. Do I play it? Again, no. I haven't even quit the training scenario because I'm too scared to be even capable of opening locker doors to hide in. I can't manage the mechanic to do it.
Note to devs, please don't make this any easier, I'm quite happy not playing, take my money as support for this game, I'm quite happy to watch.
I've heard people say that there's little replayability, the thousand of hours I've watched say different. This is good fun, especially if the streamer is a screamer.
Buy it, try it. 
It's constantly being worked on, for such a low cost game the value is incredible."
4426,very fun
4427,This game is fun and terrifying! I like that you can interact with some of the household objects. The sound effects are cool too. I love that there are a variety of ghosts so you wont always get the same ones over and over.
4428,yes
4429,keep getting kicked off this shit game
4430,the ghost touched me
4431,druid
4432,GOOT
4433,Very fun
4434,i love the ghost hunting games period. but this one is by far super fun. either going at it alone or hitting it up with the squad. this game just continues to scare me in different ways. i would love to see this game add in a game mode where you could be the ghost or make your dead character more interactive with things in the maps. would make the game way more interesting. but over all great game.
4435,"Spooky game, interesting ghost variety, great with friends, good value product."
4436,"i like this game so much. i saw my friends play and i thought it was boring but i decided to buy and when i did i loved it!! its a fun game to play with your firends for ex 3 people you can laugh, get scared and exited i definetly recommend and i will also play this on halloween it will be so much fun!!"
4437,I kept saying penis jokes to the ghost and then it got angy and killed me
4438,"Fking Ghosts moaning in my ear , like B*tch come out and fight so i can smack you with a crucifix quit playing with me....10/10 game tho lol"

4452,It's a pretty good horror game. i like it soo much and also the multiplayer killed it out man
4453,googaga
4454,the best horror game there is
4455,boo hoo
4456,cheese burgers
4457,"Способы потерять друзей:
1) Взять доску Уиджи, встать около выхода из здания, начать задавать ей вопросы и выбежать из дома как только она ломается.
2) Аналогично встать около двери, взять карты таро, вытянуть Death и сразу же выбежать из дома.
3) Попросить не очень умного друга зажечь все 5 свечей пентаграммы.
4) Взять зачарованное зеркало, опустить с помощью него рассудок (НЕ ДРУГА) и сразу же залезть в шкаф.
5) Закрыть перед другом дверь шкафа во время охоты.
6) Новичку в игре показать скример с дверью в лобби."
4458,Possibly the best horror co-op game for both being actually pretty terrifying and really funny at the same time. 10/10 I love taking photos of my friends dead corpses while they throw cups around to communicate.
4459,"This game is NOT SCARY to me.  I think it seems very scary watching youtube videos because since it's multiplayer there is usually at least one person that scares really easily.  If you are a fan of the Horror genre and don't scare easily than I would say stay away.  Also, the tutorial for the game is not great.   Because the tutorial was so ...lacking I went over the 2 hour limit and am stuck with this game.  I know I'm really hard to scare but I just don't get how this is scary to anyone.  Also, what ghost fighting story has everyone run into the house in seperate directions.  This game would be better if there had to be at least one person in the van helping with the surveilance equipment and at least one person in the house investigating.  Then on some ghosts it would be better to have 2 and 2 and other ghosts 1 inside and 3 outside (having to take turns who goes inside alone) and then 1 outside and 3 inside.  Having kept this game with a more grounded story would have created more interesting moments.  Also, if you scream to loudly, it should make the ghost come directly for you and be an almost certain death, that you could also use to your advantage by having people ready and drawing the ghost where you want so they can take it out.  I love the idea of the game, but I think this game is more of a stepping stone to better games to come.  I think it will seem pretty basic in a few more years, when someone nails the formula.  I'm allowing comments because I really want to hear other people's opinions in case I missed something, or so hopefully someone can persuade me this game has more value than I realize.  Seriously, please try to change my mind.  BUT I suffer from several counts of PTSD, and SEVERE depression.  So please, please, PLEASE BE KIND.  (why I can play horror games with PTSD and depression makes no sense, but for some reason it seems to help.  I have no idea why, but am thankful since I LOVE the horror genre so much)"
4460,"good standalone, better in VR."
4461,Got jumpscared 3 times by the same easter egg
4462,fortnite
4463,scary fun
4464,"i shit myself
"
4465,"This game is amazing! 

*BUT*

I wish there was a little more suspense to the game.

Such as:

- More Jump Scares
- More chases
- More random sounds (Footsteps, screaming, crying, talking, whisper, etc.)

I want more things that will get the player off of their feet and really question 
if they want to complete this or not.

The game is an overall great game! 
Just needs some more things added.

More places, Different style Ghost characters, etc.

If you can add stuff to get the player off of their feet more.
This game would be the best game ever.
Maybe even try adding in another mode where you can have more than 4 people :)

*ALSO*

You need to add in an Anti-cheat system. 

There are way to many people using cheats and it's honestly ruining the game.
For Example:

- People are giving themselves money instead of earning it.
- They spawn in and know what type of Ghost it is and where the room is located.
- People Make it to where the Ghost is not even allowed to hunt.
- Glitch through walls

These are just some suggestions that I have in mind and I hope in the future
the makers of this game take it into consideration. 

Thank you, 
Have a nice day :)

4466,"The best indie horror game I have ever played. I became addicted around January 2022, and couldn't put it down ever since. Also recently got a VR, and have been playing with it on there as well. It's a 10/10 game, lots of replayability, and worth way more than the 13 dollars I spent on it. Thank you, Kinetic Games."

1. you and your friends load in, act like bodybuilders with HUGE pipelines in the van while looking at the whiteboard
2. you walk out of the van and make it to the front door, sadly realizing that out of the four of you, not a single person got the keys
3. you eventually find the room where the ghost is and you run back and forth chunking equipment into the room in question
4. the group decides one person should go in and find a specific piece of evidence even though everyone has the ability to go as well
5. someone dies and everyone laughs 
6. you find what ghost it is and call it a game
7. you find out that you somehow picked the wrong ghost even though getting all of the evidence pointing to that ghost
8. repeat"

4530,"[Intro]
(Secure the bag, know what I mean? Banrisk on the beat)
(Ayo, Perish, this is hot, boy)

[Verse 1]
I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind
And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, ""I'm just fine""
And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, ""I'm just fine""
But the fact is
I can never get off of my mattress
And all that they can ask is
""Why are you so sad, kid?"" (Why are you so sad, kid?)
[Pre-Chorus]
That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

[Chorus]
So you can see I'm tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's rеal, so long, it's real

[Verse 2]
Always bein' judged by a bunch of strangе faces
Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages
But I've been places
So I'm okay-ish, so I'm okay-ish
Yeah, I'm okay, bitch
But the fact is
I need help, I'm failin' all my classes
They think that I need glasses
I just really wish that I could pass this (Wish that I could pass this)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is
[Chorus]
So you can see I'm tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's real, so long, it's real

[Outro]
So long, it's real
So long, it's real"

The part where this brilliant game full of bugs and ghosts... gets frustrating... is; When you are playing solo in public lobbies...  
Trying to find the exact lobby, can be very time consuming... and not worth your time.. Believe me!
I have a list of annoying things, that you might,- or might not encounter on your ghost-hunting journey!

*Selfish people, that dont want to include others.. (Usually premades, in public lobbies in a discord call)
*Rude people for no reason (Usually loud teens/kids/minors...
*No consideration when speaking native language in public lobby.. (You must either speak lobby language or leave)
*No attention to whats going on in the game... sits on social media...
*No listening to whats going on in game.. keeps asking same stupid question...
*Talking private stuff in van, instead of playing the game...
*Kicking people for no reason (usually muted lobby owners)
*Kicking people, because 1 joins, and want friend to join as well
*Kicking people, because u dont speak native lobby language
*No responding to found evidence etc..
*""Dude.... Go touch some grass""
*""OMG!?, Level 2.900!?!?""
*""OMG!?, You must be good with that high level""
*Playing with speakers! (hate hearing my own voice 2-3 times..)
*Playing with background noices! (Dogs, fans, screaming, tv-shows, music, Soundboard etc.)
*Idling in the van (Litterally AFK..)
*Scouting the house, while nothing to be found!
*Idling in the house, trying to get evidence, that isnt possible!
*Russians/Slovakians ""Insists on not speaking english"" 
*Russians/Ukrainians/Slovakians, flooding the european servers...
*80% Swedish people (Rude AF)
*Private games being hosted in Public lobby section..... 
*Premades using discord, but not ingame voice chat....
*European servers has 40-60% speaking or trying to speak english...Amazing...

4540,"I really love the game. I wish you could still talk to your dead friends through spirit box. So, they can still help you out a bit."
4541,"Phasmophobia is extremely fun when it comes to mechanics and co-op play. I don't really like playing solo but I know lots of people who find solo very enjoyable. I was gifted this game by my friend and I have to say, I was surprised and underestimated how enjoyable and how much there is to learn and do in this game. Would definitely recommend this game. 5/5 stars!"

4587,"I genuinely enjoy this game! Especially playing together with friends. 

I usually shit and piss my pants when I play the game on professional or nightmare because I'm scared of everything and I like sacrificing myself to the ghosts while I scream to death.

Do I recommend the game? Yes I sure do. I do recommend first playing with friends together in the discord and after you're kinda used to it, play on discord with everyone muted and only in game voice chat for the ultimate experience!  

What I'd love to see in the future: more maps and being able to play with more friends. Currently it's with 4 but playing with 8 or 10 on a huge map would be super fun!

Enjoy playing Phasmophobia! Good ghosty *patpat* :)"
4588,Ah!
4589,"Wow, just wow. This is one of those games that make it when it happens. I am honestly really glad that the trucks do things that the games allow for it to open inwards. Even the ghosts have a really pointed part that allows for these missions to be theirs and thems. Alo"

4596,"A very fun game. With friends even better. However, I would like a kind of map maker, as the game can become repetitive in the long run. In the map maker you could build your own houses and then play them with your friends. I would also like it if the player could make a custom character."
4597,"thats so cool game horror, i recommend playing it with friends. So scary game my two best horror games:outlast and phasmophobia"

[H1][B] Note that this review is for non-vr mode. [/B] [/H1]

Phasmophobia successfully constructed a setting centered on atmospheric horror, the game is very fulfilling in terms of atmosphere. This is the exact reason why psychological fear increases when there are jump scares present.

In Phasmophobia, you play as a ghost hunter who must explore different areas, use different tools to detect ghosts, and determine what kind of ghost you're dealing with. There are 10 maps available here to play and all of them contains similar ambience. They're somewhat creepy and you don't want to be alone in a room. The game doesn't rely on jump scares that much. It's more like psychological game. 

[H1] Story: [/H1]

Currently, there isn't much of a story in this game. However, the ghost you see contains lore.

[H1] Graphics: [/H1]

For and indie game, the graphics is really nice. Recent updates made it better and not really consuming. 


[H1] Audio [/H1]

This game's audio presentation is excellent; it skillfully heightens the suspense you experience. Ironically, you can hear soothing rain. Basically, the atmosphere and audio you hear vary based on where you are.

[H1] Gameplay: [/H1]

In Phasmophobia, you take on the role of a ghost hunter who must investigates various locations while using various equipment to spot ghosts and identify the type of ghost you're up against. Of course, identification should be backed up by evidence. You already have some tools. ""Main equipment"" and ""optional equipment"" are the two categories of tools. In order to survive the haunted location, you must make use of the eight key items in the game. It has a flashlight, camera, UV light, and other things. basically survival tools for seeing ghosts and paranormal activity. The second category is optional equipment, which includes 15 things in this tool. It will enable you to gather proof to support your claims, get a brighter flashlight, and carefully scout the area. There are a lot of tools here, but you don't have to utilize them all because they are situational. Depending on the type of ghost you're up against, several tools are handy. Of course, you'll need to buy your ghost hunting supplies; you can either do it all at once or simply some of it with your companions. To earn money, you need to do your job and finish the contract. Once you died, you can regain half/some of your items worth depending on the difficulty you play. ""How do you prevent dying?"" The sanity mechanics comes in. A parameter called sanity controls a variety of gameplay-related variables. Sanity is displayed as a percentage and starts at 100 at the beginning of a game before declining over time. The likelihood of a ghost carrying out particular deeds increases with decreasing average sanity.  It is inevitable that your sanity will decrease but you can recover it by taking a sanity pill. There are 10 playable maps here as of the moment, however they're all different in terms of the contracts they have. There are options for playing at either the amateur or intermediate level/difficulty. 


[H1] Controls [/H1]
It is simple to play the game using a keyboard and mouse. The game also fully supports controller. 

[H1] Pricing [/H1]
A full price of this indie game is worth it especially if you are a horror lover or you are playing with your friends.

4638,"Extremely enjoyable, I think I would enjoy it even more if there were different types of interactions that ghosts could do. Another thing i'd be super interested to see is some ghost types being able to walk around the game in an actual form so it creates a more terrifying feeling of not knowing if you'll see something show up or not."
4639,big black balls
4640,waste pants
4641,fun
4642,fun game but if playing with randoms and you are new to the game they insta kick you i could only play with freinds.
4643,"It is a funny game if played with a crew. They still have to upgrade certain aspects, such as visuals and animations, to make it even better and more terrifying. I would definitely recommend it due to the work the developers are putting on it and because it's a good option to chill with friends and get a little scared in the process."
4644,dydrtdt
4645,Great game to play with the mates. Would recommend.
4646,"Its a good game, do try to only play with friends when first starting out. Playing with randoms can be very stressful to a new player especially in this game."
4647,ok
4648,Nothing is scarier than having a friend who can mimic the ghost noises directly into one of your ears.

4657,Totally Claps Cheeks
4658,Im a ghost hunter like in the movie GhostHunters
4659,I've been playing this since the end of 2021. The developer has constantly updated this game which is very much appreciated. A good variety of ghosts and ways to figure out what the ghost is. It's fun solo but highly recommend having friends with you. My only real complaint is i wish after you are killed you could do a bit more. Would love to lightly troll my friends after death. like maybe mess with the lights or cause some kind of scare maybe 1 time a match to them if dead. But as a very small complaint...which isn't much a complaint .....THIS GAME IS A BLAST TO PLAY!!!
4660,ghost go boo
4661,Actively developed updates with interesting new features. A great game with a great community and developer team behind it.

4671,"Always more to learn and you never get used to a ghost spawning on you

some very toxic lobbies though, a lot of throwers"
4672,i love it it makes me wet
4673,poop in my pants fun
4674,Honestly a good ass game for something not fully released yet. It has it's problems every now and then (esp with voice rec and not being able to hear others when playing) but overall is a very good game. One thing I wish could be added/changed are motion sensors being able to play a different noise than just the beep and def more evidence! Can't wait to see new asylum update tbh. :)
4675,VERY FUN
4676,"A very unique and fun ghost hunting game, can be played solo or with up to 4 players, great VR support.

The way the game works you'll never have the same experience twice, the sheer amount of locations, rooms, ghosts, cursed objects and even the specific ghost's personality make each mission it's own little conundrum where you have to plan ahead and measure risk/reward.

Game is still in active development and though it's not in beta it's still far from reaching its full potential, expect massive updates."

4683,at first bought it too play with friends but when i say its one of the funnest games ive ever played its just theres nothing quite like it and its in vr however i do not reccomend solo play as its very time consuming

even if you don't have friends you can play online, i have yet to experience that but its good nonetheless!"

4701,"Used to be a fun game, but something has been updated now it just seems to have sucked all of the fun out of the game. Finding the ghost now is just a chore. all the items seemed useless. 

Used to be fun.. now its isnt. 3/10"
4702,Over hyped bare bones game that gets repetitive as soon as you get out the truck  in a minute you have done everything you can do in the game and even when it is something new the game isn't really fun there's no reason to do anything in the game no reward or any real game play
4703,"Atmosphere is amazing, gameplay is wonderful, and the suspense is juicy. Would definitely recommend to horror lovers!
"
4704,ah
4705,"Super fun game with a lot of replayability. Even after you've played for a long time and you think you're desensitized from some of the scary aspects of the game you still get really good moments of true fear haha. My biggest issues are the menuing (you can't change your setting while in the lobby and walking around, and buying/adding items could be clearer to the user) and the controls in general are a bit weird (for instance, the use button is either RMB or the alternate use button, but some items aren't clear as to which one it is at first such as the smudge stick). Overall, I highly recommend Phasmo and I'm generally afraid of everything hahaha."
4706,Really good for improving your detective skills!
4707,play with friends not randoms
4708,"guys i think the ghost likes me, he keeps moaning in my ear, should i give him my number?"

4710,best horror game by far
4711,this game is lots of fun and has some good spooks to it i have played it with friends and it can be funny with friends
4712,"If you want to know if this game is fun and worth the money, the answer is: yes, absolutely, every time. The game play is inventive, the ghosts are varied, the locations are creepy, and every mission I play somehow feels new. But this game has something beyond the well-conceived mechanics and thoughtful design. There is something really magical here.

I play this game almost exclusively with my best friend, who lives across the country. There are not many things we can do together at this point in our lives, and time we have available seems to get more limited every year. Mostly, when we are able to hang out, we choose to hang out in Phasmaphobia. We know it will always be a good time. This game has proven, again and again, to be an endless well of hilarious jokes and creative inspirations. There is nothing quite like being terrified, locked in a bathroom, while a demon grumbles right outside the door, then watching your friend slowly inch toward the toilet while you beg him not to flush it. 

He will flush it. He will always flush it. 

And then you will die, and it will be the most fun you've ever had - until the next round, when you rejoice because you found a ouija board, and the ghost keeps telling you it is close and harboring a violent hatred, but you don't care because you just want to know whether or not this vengeful wraith likes jazz.

I've played this game for 71 hours. I am basically no better at it than when I started, and I hope never to improve. It's a joy. I could play it forever as a blissful idiot. I wish that for you as well. Buy it. Share the experience with someone you love."
4713,it's not among us 10/10
4714,it fun to be scared shitless with friends who have no idea how anything works

4743,Well I will recommend these game to people with friends cause i got no one to play with it so i play with randoms or alone but sometimes its boring if its alone too cause you can't feel the anticipation with someone. Playing in multiplayer saddens me that most of the players i played either cant speak English and few lobbies appear

As a loooong time gamer, I've kinda seen every type of game out there, and most of the time new ones are just the old ones with better resolution, but this game is truly a breath of fresh air. I'm shocked to see that I've only put 13 hours into it, because it FEELS like a lot more."

One of my favourite games that I loved learning about and there is nothing better then getting the ghost right.
There is a lot of hidden cool features that isn't written anywhere (about ghost), this means that it would be nice if you watch some professional players on YouTube to learn those features.

Negatives:

It's basically all in the online multiplayer. I don't play online multiplayer because of kids earraping or just trollers (with some exceptions in rare lobbies). It can be scary if you play it alone so if you have some friends to play this game with, it's the best ghost hunting game.

4774,Awesome game for chills but after a while you get used to it BUT it never gets old worth all the money
4775,SHERAM
4776,Phasmophobia is a great game to play with friends and solo. The aim of the game is to find what ghost it is by using different equipment. Once the game is out of early access it will be amazing as of right now it does need more maps to make it exciting for older players. I would highly getting this game with your friends or even if your a solo as it is insanely fun!
4777,the ghost got cheeks
4778,fun spooky haha game
4779,"So much effort and love put into every single detail of the game. Every little part of each map, and all of the gear is all so well put together. So many cool easter eggs and it is only in early development, with more to come. They listen to community suggestions and implement them into the game very well. Overall an amazingly well made game and the developers have all of my respect."

4811,I love the game and its mechanics with it. there are hidden details about the game. the game is always interesting.
4812,"It's all fun and games until your friends are just actually dead and you are entirely alone and you gotta fill out the paperwork by yourself.
I love walking into a building and reciting the intro to Hotel Mario to try and get a reaction from something though so I will probably play this a fair bit more in the future."

4826,The game challenges you on a mental and physical level. Not only do you have to use your noggin but you have to be brave and bold to find out what ghost you are dealing with. Recommend you play with friends for this game for it is better to have decoys lol.

4909,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Only play this game while you're wearing you shittin' pants. Maybe even try keeping a puppy pad under your chair to catch the whiz that'll come spilling out the first time you find yourself getting killed. I would try it in VR, but my pants can only handle so much dookie."

5028,"[h1]100/100 If you need a game that emulates how scary ghost hunting could be if the ghost was murderous, this is the game for you.[/h1]
[u]It's recommended you play with friends as this is a great coop experience.[/u]

- No jumpscares, but genuine fear invoking gameplay through ambient sounds, ghost activity such as laughter, rocking chairs, turning off lights, etc. Even when they kill you, it's uncanny and creepy, rather than cheep and ear piercing.
There are loud voices that can be heard, but the devs did a good job using these sounds sparingly or reasonably; spirit box speaker via communication with the entity, some spirits/ghosts will make noises even without a spirit box

- Suspense like no other horror game I've played yet, when hunt mode begins, my fight or flight senses kick in, and I try to find the best hiding spots in a horribly lit building (imagine how well that goes)

- Use of supposedly real spirits and ghosts from Banshee, Jinn, Oni, etc. With (over 15 spirits) each having minor differences of behaviour or evidence, some make the room cold, some turn off the power, some don't become active unless there is/isn't any hunters around."
5029,yes 10000000%

5034,very spooky and fun with friends plus no cheap jumpscares
5035,"Phasmaphobia is an incredibly fun game to play with your friends. After a while you get better at completing your tasks and executing them professionally, but the game never ceases to be challenging and entertaining.
Definetly one of the most fun co-op horror games I have ever played."
5036,"very fun to play with friends
"
5037,"its not a game that constantly jumpscares you, but rather it builds up slowly, become more scary the longer you stay at a location, and when it hunts, it is the moment of pure terror for people."
5038,fun with friends some of  the bigger maps are harder to find the ghost and that makes it harder but overall its very fun
5039,"very scary and fun good graphics and very good to play with friends

5040,This game is really fun and takes a potato of a computer to run most of the maps.
5041,it just scary but funny

5084,BEST game
5085,"The game gives you a lot to learn about each Ghost and even allows you to have some very funny moments with your friends! I really recommend it if you can handle flashing lights or horror elements such as chasing, and stuff!"

5090,spooky ghosts hunted me down and scared the ever loving shit out of me :( friend watched me get dragged to hell. 10/10 can't wait to play more
5091,"I bought a PC just for this game, yes this one game.
I have gotta say this is probably one of the best games I have ever played.
the only thing I would fix is that whenever I try to take a picture of the ghost 
""hey guys I got the picture"" 
*dies for the picture*
""didn't die for nothing let me just check""
*footstep*
there's a pain in my soul every time that happens."
5092,good
5093,Spooky ghost
5094,"Not what it was. Phasmophobia had a methodic atmospheric experience it could have harnessed to make the game even more unique but now it's most of an fps/throwing items simulator. Like many cooking games, you throw items into a room, triangulate which ones are affected by the ghost (Boring, you're gonna do a lot of waiting) and then repeat into another room if it left it's current room. Repeat. The same cycle was in the early game but it was less convoluted which is better and for that price at that time, a good game. Now that the streamerbait crowd has left it has to make its money somehow and it seems to be throwing crap at a wall and considering it stuck, even though it fell cleanly off."
5095,Phasmophobia really impressed me i had heard good things about it so decided to try it out. lets say it didnt let me down.
5096,i wish i could use the spirit box to communicate with my dad
5097,nice

"
5109,"Wow. This game is amazing! You may be scared or think you will never get better at the start, but the game just gets better as you do! You may also think that with randomly generated games that you will get games that are the same or boring. Well let me tell you something. Every game is unique! Sure I have gotten the same ghost before or the same cursed possession before but ever game is different. With a lot of different ghosts, 6 cursed possessions, and a TON of different maps ranging from street house to prison, this game has something for everyone! Want to sit in the van and let your friends die? You can! Want a more hands on approach with killing your friends? (I recommend music box!) You can do that too! There are endless ways to play every game. Endless challenges you can do! The small team of devs work so hard to fix all of the bugs in this game. (I don't thing I have ever seen a bug unless I was looking for it) They are also CONSTANTLY working on new updates like new ghosts, new maps, or new features! This game is flat out amazing! You might be frustrated at the start from the ghost killing you, but once you get past that the game is so much fun! There are a ton of different items to use for finding the ghost! Like thermometer, peramic, emf, video cam. This game is a ton of fun and the devs work hard to make it that way. I totally recommend this game!"

5123,"I like the whole concept that how they make this game replayable. Most of the horror games are story based but this is different. The developers are also very nice to community, especially ""CJ"" & ""Lavender""."

5160,"Ghosts aren't following their own rules anymore.

Several times I've encountered scenarios where: I've smudged a spirit mid-hunt for it to just walk through said smudge and kill me anyways before the 6 second grace period is up, a Yurei has walked/is walking through solid walls and doors, Wraiths leaving footprint trails. None of it makes sense, none of it lines up with the very in-game journal they tell you to abide by. I've watched a Revenant full-tilt sprint at it's target who was hiding with no tech on in a closed room on the other side of the map (new hiding spot too), and no, their in-game voice was *not* active. I've seen Spirits act like Jinn (speeding up when far away, slowing down close, only worked when power was on), and almost every mimic I've seen hasn't actually mimic'd anything, not even the ""Ghost orbs"" mentioned in it's weakness have ever been there.

60% of the time an evidence bugs out and doesn't get triggered for ages (if at all).

All of this was encountered while playing with friends, or in solo-play, I don't play with randoms, so nobody was ""controlling"" the ghost either, before somebody decides to try and claim ""just hackers"" or anything.

Will amend my review when they update it so a single evidence no longer takes 30+ minutes of inactivity to finally trigger, and when ghosts actually follow their own rules from the journal."
5161,"        Amazing game. Every game is full of action and has so much to offer, and is 200x better when playing with friends and messing around. Really hope this game is going to be relevant for at least a next couple years.
                                                                                                                                 
        I vividly remember loading into the first games, the first one being Bleasdale Farmhouse, the dreaded OG medium-sized map. 2 of my friends and I were strolling around the house, all bunched together, shitting our pants. We were just walking around with the normal flashlights, and exploring the area and with our items, trying to figure out how to use them. Everything was a mystery, and I had the dumbest theory that the lower the number on the spirit box got, the closer to the ghost we got. Looking back, even though the game is still very much exciting, nothing will top that adrenaline and passion for the game. Not sure exactly what happened after that, I think we just died off one by one until the ghost snapped all of our necks, or one of us died and the other two pussied out and just left in the truck. I just remember what happened during the start and middle of the game. 

        The second (I think it was second, or it was one of our first games when we all bought it) game was also wild. A mission at Willow Street House, and we were still trying to find out how to work the items we were given and how to successfully beat a mission without getting picked off by the ghost. When we got in, both my friends had the GREAT idea of making me sit at the end of the hallway right in between the master bedroom and the boy's bedroom in complete darkness, while they just stared at me through the doors in the living room, seeing if something happened. Of course my bot self agreed to it eventually after being skeptical about it when they first proposed the plan, so I just sat there, doing absolutely nothing but staring into the long dark hallway, waiting for the ghost to do something, whether it be killing me or doing something that could somehow give away the ghost type. As much as I don't want to admit it, I was actually scared for my life. I wanted to just dip and run back into the truck, and I had my headphones off maybe about 75% of the time, scared of what was to happen to me or what scary audio was awaiting me as time went on in the pitch black willow home. At maybe around 10 minutes of me being there, the ghost initiated a hunt from god knows where and murdered me, helpless as my teammates just watched it all unravel in front of their eyes, watching me choke to death and fall face down in front of the little drawer with my legs twisted in 4 different ways. You know, maybe if we knew what smudge sticks and lighters were (actually it doesn't even matter because I don't think we even had them unlocked LMAO) I could have lived that hunt, or if I just had actual braincells, but too bad. Although it was undeniably scary, we all had a blast and I'll never forget what happened that night. 

        For sure worth the 12 dollars."

5163,"Very fun game to play with friends, especially with the lights turned out, in my opinion it could be a little scarier but it was very worth it especially playing in groups of four, definitely a good buy, and a fun horror game all around, the interactions and most the controls work as they should, and the many maps help keep you from getting bored"

5202,family game night is a blast with the luigi board
5203,"Its an alright game, its really fun when you first start, but the maps become repetitive. It would be cool to see an abandoned missile silo bunker, old office buildings, apartment buildings with multiple apartments, and my personal favorite, a remake of the Chernobyl power plant. Over time the game just gets a bit boring, and the maps are repetitive, but I would still recommend it."
5204,"A great way to spend time with friends. Unless you have friends who like to provoke ghosts. Then you are going to have a horrible time (jk, its even fun when you die.)"
5205,"yes
"
5206,I always get lost when playing with friends
5207,"You'll have much fun with this game, especially when you're playing it with friends. It may feel repetitive at some point tho... same interactions, same evidences, same maps. It would be nice if the ghost had more freedom, like seperating the players from each other or maybe jumpscaring you on the camera :D
But overall, it's a great experience. Specifically in the first 10-30 hours, there's always something new to learn! For the 12€ it costs, you should definitely get it :)"

If You Like Ghost Hunting Games I Will Recommend this game it's super fun to play with friends"
5220,fun with friends
5221,Very spoopy
5222,spooky
5223,"Phasmophobia was the first game I bought and installed when I purchased my gaming PC. I put a lot of hours into this game when I initially started playing. It is a ghost hunting game and if you have a few friends to play with I will most definitely say you'll get your money's worth. 

Pros: You can play with up to three friends, there are several different maps to choose from, several different ghosts, the game is constantly being improved to make it more challenging (ghosts that are harder to detect,) and depending on your own personal threshold you can prepare for jump scares.

Cons: Over time the scare wears off- especially once you've put almost 200 hours into the game, it can be a bit buggy at times, and it does tend to get repetitive once you've played for so long."
5224,Really fun and scary to play with your friends. Public lobbies aren't nearly as good tho

5228,It's a nice and bone chilling game for those who love horror. Highly recommended!
5229,"Extremely well designed game. From mechanics, to atmosphere, to graphics. The game boasts it all. I continue to play Phasmophobia repeatedly due to its unique gameplay characteristics, thrilling atmosphere and visual fidelity. The game creates a chilling atmosphere that other games just don't manage to do as effectively. There is never a point where I don't feel uneasy when roaming the halls of a haunted location. I like how the game manages to create scares with out doing too much, It is extremely different to most horror titles I've played and subverts typical horror stereotypes seen in most other horror games creating a unique playing experience that is not for the fainthearted. The game also boasts unique mechanics such as being able to talk to the threat and further more being able to anger the threat with what you say to it. This feature is unlike anything I've seen before and it is extremely well executed and at least in my experience, it has no noticeable flaws.
Besides the gameplay aspects, the games graphics are also something to note. While the graphics are extremely simple, it manages to maintain a great graphical style which always provides a pleasant viewing experience. The use of reflections is also well implemented adding a touch more of realism to the game while not being too overbearing.
Overall this game is fantastic. Every aspect of the game is well thought out and provides a satisfying and addictive experience that keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend it!"

5418,good
5419,schönes spiel. gruselig.
5420,"The OG ghost hunting game. As a mainly solo player, it's not my personal favorite gh game, but it's certainly the most polished. Very atmospheric and well made. Even when playing other gh games there are things I wish were more like phasmo, like the smoothness of opening doors, emf readers actually responding to everything, and the perfect feeling of progression in each hunt. It may be a simple ""Phase 1 gh game"" where you only play ghost detective to identify the ghost type, but it's very good at being just that. Needs more jump scares, though."
5421,"Using the equipment to find the ghost is pretty easy after a few playthroughs. But I have played this game for about 100 hours now and it still scares the crap out of me. Even going in fully aware of everything and whats about to happen, it's hard for me to play this alone."

5441,good
5442,bueno
5443,"Its fun
"
5444,its a fun game with good scares. played for 128 hrs now so far. would love to see new death animations or even ghost interactions. could ten times scarier if you looked over and saw your friend being dragged down the hallway. unfortunately you just get choked out and die when you get caught. otherwise it is a fun game.
5445,This game is really fun but i still after 9 hours have no idea what im doing but i still continue to play it so i guess that's a good sign but i would recommend having friends to play it with or atleast do multiplayer because the doing it solo seems really difficult and its not as fun

5480,"yup, good"
5481,"I usually play with a black character and I keep on being the first and only player to die each round. I must conclude that this isn't because of a lack of skills, but because the game is racist. Otherwise real fun with friends."
5482,10/10 would recommend to friends that will scream in terror.
5483,"Awesome game! Great visuals, great gameplay, very replayable, and always amazing to play with friends. The constant love and passion that the game devs give is amazing!

My only problem is the lack of compatibility for MacOS for such a widely popular teamplay game. I was able to play it since my laptop had an intel chip, and could therefore run BOOTCAMP, but I have a bunch of friends that have the newer models which can't run BOOTCAMP anymore, which is an absolute travesty. Please, Please, Please make it compatible for MacOS. Summon a demon and make pact, pray to the gods, I don't care what needs to be done. I want to play with my friends ;-;"

5568,COOL GAME.
5569,"the game is pretty nice, only one small problem. for me, my save files keep getting corrupted. and that means ill have to reset. which means i lost all my levels, money, and equipment. the worst is the level reset. because in multiplayer everyone thinks you're new and they wont want to play with you. i went from level 47 to level 1. and from 1,400 dollars to 0."
5570,ghost go hunt hunt
5571,aaaaaa scary ghost
5572,"purchased this game for a friend and i because we were looking for some new games to play, i have to say this game is far more fun and scary than i could've imagined. the suspense is always at an all time high because you never know when something is going to happen. i have no complaints, this is my first horror game and im hooked. definitely recommend playing this game especially with friends."
5573,"Don't let the other reviews fool you, there is absolutely and completely 100% no super sexy ghost sex at the end of this game. I played this game for the sole purpose of having super sexy ghost sex, and I was very disappointed to find that this did not occur.

Camera mechanic was neat."
5574,loved it because I got all my friends killed
5575,"confidence over time, always encounter something new, with there being many ghosts in the game and multiple ways to play, scared or confident, until the ghost does something."
5576,"Fun game! Voice chat works pretty well, and it's super fun to play with friends
"
5577,"played once, already (s)creaming"
5578,"makes me scream like a girl 

would recommend!"
5579,d
5580,Best game ever in coop with vr ez
5581,This game is so AWESOME!
5582,This game is spooky at night without friends.
5583,"Lots of fun, and does not get you with the cheap jump scare. This game is heavy on anticipation., Walking around with seemingly nothing even eventful happening is still absolutely nerve racking. Then when you find the ghost, or the ghost finds you, that is when the real fun happens"
5584,efgbdsrdfsg
5585,"i've played this game a decent amount and i still get jumpscared out of my boots all the freaking time. good game, great with friends."
5586,gay
5587,"I've been playing strictly with one friend. We were both scared at first and barely made any progress (we also skipped the tutorial :P). As we got used to how the game works, we got less and less scared and started having many successful missions. I wouldn't play this game without at least one friend.

You would think the game gets really boring after you've seen everything but it's actually fun to figure out the ghost type once you have experience.

At this point, I am not sure for how long the game will entertain me but there is decent replayability and it's still early access so I expect it to get a lot more content considering its success.

TL;DR
Better with friends, good replayability, fun to play a couple of missions here and there."
5588,yeah this game pretty cool raaaaaahhhh
5589,Very interesting and special horror game i ever seen.
5590,"Had to take a shit, went back in the van for 10 minutes

5634,overall great game to play with friends. you get jump scares a lot and it is so enjoyable! i 100% recommend this game
5635,phatsophobia
5636,One of the games of all time
5637,Very funny games to play with friends. it is also good for meeting new people
5638,"Pros:
* Can play solo or with up to 3 others
* Easy to learn mechanics with time
* Walkie-Talkie voice chat system makes for some interesting games
* If you die you can walk around and move stuff/potentially help out your team which is either helpful or hilarious
* Randomized ghosts and evidence keep replayability very high!
* Multiple Locations to Ghost hunt at
* 24 Ghost types to encounter (as of 8/11/22)
Cons:
* Hiding spots can sometimes make parts of your character stick out resulting in a death
* Ghosts sometimes aren't active enough resulting in a lackluster time

All in all the negatives are minor inconveniences at most. Phasmophobia (or Phasmo as most players call it) is a great game all about hunting ghosts with your friends or other players. I recommend it to anyone who likes horror games!"

5694,im so scared im so scared im so scared
5695,good
5696,"(Scroll to bottom to see why this is a negative review)

Love the game really good, fun and would recommend picking it up if you want something close to those videos on Telly where they sit in a room and spend and hour trying to talk to something that isn't their, but with this game it is real.

(what I would like to see or mostly like to see once the game leaves EA)

Things I would like to see in this game further in development when it's finished.

-Better animations for the player's and ghosts. 

-Non Fuze Models for the characters and most likely characters made by the developers (Preferably with body slider and face slider and full customisation).

-Better sprint since you run out of breath in a second feeling so unfair and un-natural.

-More Ghosts designs (Preferably ones that show how the ghost died or can give a hint to what it can be, ghosts that fly like the wraith and banshee actually fly).

-better and smoother controls for Non VR players.

-A way to exercise the ghost.

-Players when dead can interact with more things as well as use the spirit box to talk to the living.

-More Items, maybe some that do the same thing but have it a different way (Like a Drone or RC car that has a camera on it but has a battery life as well as can be disabled or have it's battery drain faster by hosts that feed from electricity).

-Better rewording system since mostly now it's best to just play on nightmare and take pictures of the bones, Cursed Item and then other things like the take multiple pictures of the Quija board after you ask it's age for the 50th time.


(Reason for negative review)
Also just giving it a bad review because the developer made it harder to mod now and now it's hard to increase the server size, This game isn't competitive or anything and is just a fun game to play with friends but the fact they are trying to restrict modding and increasing the player count is why I am giving a bad review. Just let people do that stuff it only benefits the game. Won't change my review to positive until they make the change to make it more modifiable like it was before the recent update."
5697,Good stuff. Play with my frenz
5698,ghost
5699,it a good game if you want to be a goast hunter
5700,ghost hunt fun
5701,fun and somewhat scary. Betty Rhoudes is a pussy and is too afraid to show herself to me. sad
5702,"Best scares were playing alone. Most fun playing with friends. Are you brave enough to call its name?
Enjoyed this game a lot! Nice scares, enjoyable hunts and so much more. The game has improve a lot since its released. And I hope it continues like that."

5707,Really good ghost hunter game... and they do update the game so much more fun stuff always coming up
5708,it gud
5709,"I love this game! it is so much fun to play with friends. But i really wish that there were more maps, I would love it if there was a hospital or some sort of clinic/old folks home map or a hotel/motel map! That would be so cool!!! Also it would be so cool if there were more things to do as a ghost, because as of right now, if you die the only thing you can do is pick up and throw stuff. But overall, this game is one of my favorites as is."

5730,10/10
5731,I got this game a few months ago and this game really changes a person I will start off by saying that you need extra sets of clothing when a ghost just decides to appear and make you poop yourself but after you are used to the game  playing jokes on your friends is about the funniest thing you can do especially if they just got the game I will give you a free prank all you have to do is start talking on the radio when the ghost is hunting and your friends are in the building it may end up killing them ;) overall a 10/10 game.
5732,"Okay so transophobia is a great game, that you can summon ghosts that can be sometimes gay and touch my ass and children and then those ghosts locks in their house and start to pump me hard!
but then after 1 min of pumping, they let me go out of the house traumatized.

5753,Extremely fun game.  Just started playing it recently and I'm already super addicted to it.
5754,Friends to Enemies speed run.
5755,"game : start game , get ur stuff , run from ghost , identify the ghost , die"
5756,"It's....fine? I'm not a fan. Very repetitive, movement is SO SLOW. I mostly find myself more bored than scared. Especially if you have friends that spend way too much time playing the game and bring all the equipment, there's no real risk for you to just run in and die. Got a few jump scares I suppose, but not worth the hours it took to get there. Go watch a good horror flick instead. 

I'm sure it gets better if you're hooked up to VR though. Still painfully slow and repetitive, but the extra immersion probably adds to the suspense."

5773,I like how the game changes with every map. I enjoy that theres almost constantly new things to the game. Im currently having a problem with a bug where people can hear me in the lobby but not during actual hunts though. Im hoping itll be fixed soon so i can get back to playing.

5886,"good
"
5887,"VERY fun game, pretty good graphics, runs pretty well, and just made well in general. You start with a few unlocked maps and unlock more as you progress, and the developers add new ones all the time. There are a ton of ghosts, and they all have specific behaviors and difficulties. Very fun and spooky game, well worth the money! 
(I would recommend playing it with friends, it adds so much more chaos and fun!)"
5888,"great game for ghost hunting

5889,"The game gets repetitive. Anyone who've played the game for atleast 30 hours can agree with that. But, It was really fun when I started playing it, heck. I still have alot to learn. It is not scary after like first 10 hours, but it is still great game. Real time waster"

5904,"Great game, stuff is always being added and seems to be going in the right direction. Ghost models are a bit corny but that's not too big of an issue. Looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future."
5905,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
5906,If you're trying to find a good scary game well this game is amazing but it needs a lot of bravery and some patients.
5907,super gierka
5908,Very spooky ghost game! 👻
5909,this game is ogga booga scary
5910,"Definitely feels like it needs more, and the bigger maps kinda suck, but it is a very uniquely fun game that I cannot recommend enough if you have the people to play it with. Solo or with randos doesn't do it for me. Absolutely worth the price."
5911,"The game currently lacks majorly in UI / UX and is very very hard to learn the core mechanic if you don't look for external content

Pros:
 - Very fun to play with friends
 - Scary AF
 - Supports VR (I don't have one, but it's a cool idea for the game)

Cons:
 - Very very poor UI / UX
 - Game lacks on teaching new players and in tutorial content (e.g How the hunts work? What exactly are the main and other objectives of the game? What are the benefits of purcashing an specific item?)
 - Literally needed to watch youtube videos to properly understand the game mechanics
 - Most servers have at least 1 cheater that uses an ESP and/or infinite money (Can be a pro if u just want to collect money tbh)
 - Cant change game settings while in a multiplayer lobby

Overall it's a great game idea, but the devs should be careful whith the UX, making the game more user-friendly could provide new players a better experience instead of basically throwing them into the gaming and expect them to die because they will spend 10 minutes to figure out how to use Smudge Sticks"

5915,Love this game
5916,ig noob
5917,"Played the game, very fun.
Then one of my friends broke the cursed possession.
It was all snot and tears at that point."
5918,"This game is amazing! This game is insanely fun to play with friends. It's a good mental challenge using your game knowledge to run tests to figure out what the ghost is, and inviting new players is always entertaining because you can mess them up by getting the ghost to hunt them! 

All the updates are very well polished and I rarely find any bugs with me and my friends while we are playing. Cannot wait for the newer updates to come.

The only issues I have found with this game is every now and then, someone in our group has their Spirit Box not work for some reason, and then it magically fixes itself after a certain amount of time."
5919,funny with freinds
5920,Really fun Game. could use some patches. But all in all its awesome!

5954,The multiplayer was full of slutty ghost houses
5955,"Piece of garbage game. The developers have not added any new features, nor have they made any adjustments to the game. It would be amazing if they decided to add content."
5956,das good ya

5964,"relaxing game. if you are scared at first, just dont be scared"
5965,"Can be terrifying alone at first, but absolute blast with friends. The proximity voice chat effects are amazing, and are how more horror multiplayer games should do it."

Phasmaphobia is:

When you scream at a blinking flashlight, but you can't scream at the sight of a ghost.

When you want to hide in the closet but the ghost is already waiting for you there

When you run with burning incense in your hands, but the ghost doesn't give a f**k.

When you die for the 10th time and can't understand why the cross didn't save you

When your friends call out the ghost's name at the front door while you set traps in the basement.

6003,sexy mommy demons. on a serious note I don't even like scary games bc im a scaredy cat but this game is the perfect level of fun and scary. There are no jump scares and when the ghost kills u its not scary at all either. I really recomend this game for people who don't enjoy being scared but they want to try it out yk?
6004,play hide and seek
6005,My goodness this game is very scary. I've been searching for a game for years that can strike the perfect amount of fear and adrenaline into me like this game did. I wouldnt recommend for the weak-hearted but other than that. ROCK ON!!!!
6006,"How to escape the ghost hunt.
1. Hide in the closet.
2. Hold your fart so your mic won't detect.
Congratulations, you survived!

Or just simply change to press to talk,"

6017,this game got me fr nuttin and what not
6018,"It's fun to play with friends. I don't always enjoy the 1 v 4 format of other horror games. In Phasmo, you work together to ghost hunt and it's mostly easy to learn. The tutorial is very helpful in instructing how to use the base equipment. Anything you need to know about how to play can be found online too if you're still having trouble figuring out what to do to get the ghosts right."
6019,Only had to change my underwear twice ;)

6053,ur gonna shit ur pants the first time playing this game
6054,I would say this is definitely a game to play with friends! Even though we've logged over 200 hrs there's still much fun to be had. I've never laughed harder than when I've played this with some of my buddies. There are a few bugs from time to time but they are usually quickly addressed and patched by the efficient dev team. Can't wait to see what new things they think up!
6055,"Game became a bit too overwhelming with the types of ghosts, and become a bit overly complicated ruining that simple feeling when it was in it's prime."

6114,"Game is extremely fun without cheaters, and I hope support for this game keeps growing, it can turn into something amazing, the casual fun you get is top tier, I really wonder how would a ranked system work, but the game is nowhere near to start focusing on that, if devs read this, I suggest polishing core mechanics, I been talking with friends that played this game since the beggining, and I know you devs have been enchancing a lot the IA and reworking visuals, players model really need one and the shadow system is weird sometimes, I can't see my shadow, after all that game can strive towards success and become a great game!"

6148,"Not scarry, but not boring"
6149,There's an easter egg where the house you go into can be haunted. I heard its pretty rare though.
6150,"amazing game, a few bugs/lags at times but other than that i love it! just please can the banshees stop only attacking me like i know im irish but damn"
6151,I'm a ghost offender!
6152,very good game funny
6153,"Very spooky. Lots of replayability due to the variety of ghosts and ghost behaviors. It's pretty fun figuring out the secret abilities of ghosts; this becomes necessary when you play on nightmare mode, where one piece of evidence is hidden from the hunters. Lots of stuff to learn and keep you occupied, with every hunt you take part in being a unique experience. There is still content and updates to come as well. Very fun with friends but playing solo is its own challenge and enjoyable as well. I love playing mostly solo now, but it can be pretty terrifying/daunting at first. Knowledge is power though, so it eventually becomes not as scary. There can still be those terrifying moments however, even after many hours of play.

The only problem I have had is trying to get games with randoms in public lobbies. If you are a low level, a lot of players will instantly kick you due to your inexperience, preventing you from learning anything. People will also kick you for seemingly no reason. To counteract this I recommend playing solo or with friends only on a low difficulty at first, and gradually build your way up. There is a lot to learn about this game, so a lot of players will get annoyed with you if you don't understand everything, which is pretty dumb."
6154,"A bit fuzzy and janky around the edges, but the core gameplay is a lot of fun especially with a team of friends. Played a lot in early access, hopefully going to get even better with more polish."
6155,The Ghost doesn't like getting fired.
6156,"Been playing it here and there, and I'll have to admit, it's pretty fun. However, after all of the updates that it has had, I feel that there is still something missing. If the developers are reading this by any chance, I recommend updating the death animation so the player can see in 1st person getting knocked down onto the ground. Other than that, I'd say that their efforts are otherwise paying off and that everyone who plays/played should appreciate them for making such an amazing game."

6163,Very recommended for someone who's need cuddle <3
6164,i like the game/ but can you like add a spirit box setting like that can let you ask the ghost questions without talking like a book appears on the screen with a bunch of questions and you click one of the questions and your character ask the question on the spirit box without you having to talk.
6165,yes.
6166,This game is really good and is really fun although after you get around level 20 the game starts to lose its horror aspect. The death “jumpscare” is so predictable and it’s not really that scary. Some ghost events are scarier than dying.
6167,Very fun
6168,Yes
6169,sus
6170,"I got this game right around it's beginning release, since then I can definitely say that it has never gotten better, in fact it has only gotten significantly worse. Voice recognition seems to be worse off than it was before, often time not being able to understand what was said in any capacity other than registering words were indeed spoken. The cursed objects update introduced mostly nothing fresh to the gameplay, just more picture opportunities, a worse ouiji board, and useless objects that would never help in the hunt, at least play tarot card roulette is fun. The evidence is boring and repetitive, you'll see the same ghosts and evidence frequently because there isnt enough variety with the amount of evidence you can even collect so many of the ghosts just share 2/3 evidence. When you find the ghost there's nothing left to do and it doesn't feel fulfilling in any way, cool I found 3 pieces of boring evidence and know what the ghost is, time to do it again and have nothing be different. On bigger maps they look awful mostly just looking the exact same in every room, like they copy and pasted each room over and over again next to each other to increase size, most of the time on big maps you'll get stuck in a hunt loop where you finish a hunt, get close to the ghost room and then immediately be hunted again because they poorly designed every aspect of ghost hunts. The sound design is awful, you'll hear the same groan, crying or whisper ninety percent of the time, maybe just maybe you'll hear singing once in a blue moon but none of them, minus the later, actually sound good at all. Half of your evidence doesn't register itself properly because of terrible ghost ai which can be broken or cheesed even during hunts or they act so super-powered that from across the map they'll chase down your hiding spot to kill you because there's no balance. Not a single update has come to this game to give it more personality or flavour and almost always make the gameplay worse. This game spawned a ton of copycats and ironically almost all of them do it miles better because the devs for this game clearly don't give a fuck about making it fun, and they aren't good at adding anything useful. They just toss a new map that's just a recycled older map and then move on."
6171,"This game was really awesome, unfortunately now it's just getting worse and worse, with every update the game is getting further and further away from the fun game I know, long ago when I first started playing it in 2020 we played it with my friends every day, it was entertainment that managed to frighten, laugh, etc
I don't recommend this game at the moment, if I was giving a review in 2020 I might even say that it was one of the most fun online games I've ever played, it would be great if the developers made a version of the game that was the good old one, at that moment I think that it would also make a big boom in the internet world, by which I mean twitch, youtube, etc."

6186,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week, he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character, and started playing but I was stuck on what I was supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

6188,"I am a 46-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Phasmophobia . I am a single father to my son, who is now 19. My son started playing Phasmophobia in 2017. In less than a month, he had already played for over 100 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent hours playing Phasmophobia. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Phasmophobia has ever since brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

6197,"In the almost 100 hours I have played, this game is so much fun with friends, especially when you are outside of a room, waiting in perfect silence and in the night, and your friend goes in to do spirit box, and you hear the ghost reply, ""Behind"" and then you start turning your flashlight on and off to scare the living hell out of them. 10/10 would fuck with friends again.

They serve no purpose other than to be a bunch of lil bit-ches, Furthermore i want to give a shoutout to the only cool ghost in the game who just sings at you and dosent do anything. And big hate to all those wannabe thugs that try and hunt. im the only one who goes in screaming their names, cause i need to call them out on their bullshit. ""Micheal Jackson, are you here, are you here, are you here?"" No gtfo out of here with that bullshit, i go in screaming that they a lil bitch and should do sum about it, but now every ghost in this game are all losers who cant do none. mad respect to the game devs, and disstrack coming soon to those wannabe chicago grim reapers inhabiting the houses."
6248," Love the game!! Been playing since release and it's always been a repeatedly fun and engaging adventure that has--and still--always seemed to surprise me around every corner. 

The mechanics of the game encourage fun and difficult challenges that you and your friends can constantly be fascinated by. However, even whilst alone the game promotes a thrilling experience. The multiplayer and single-player aspects of the game are so vastly different that it is seemingly an entirely new confrontation, one of which grasped my attention even more. Whether it be the wild variety of ghosts with their slew of thriving personalities or the number of tools, that you as a ghost hunter, can use at your disposal to find said ghosts; Phasmophobia always finds a way to keep you playing to see every facet and capability. 

With 130 hours currently under my belt, I plan to play this for years to come!

.
But since playing this with friends and all the funny bits; I'm almost numb to the scares now. 
.
What I'm not numb to is my friends screaming at the ghost through the spirit-box while crouching, looking up ( your back looks impressively broken ) and running through many rooms asking if its french. 
.
This games pull your friends closer and the scared ones closer. 
I would highly recommend this game if you enjoy investigating unique ghosts and team building skills ( I guess lmao )

6295,To be honest I think this game was really overhyped because of streamers and after having played through with my friends I don't get the hype. I'm probably the minority here who didn't think the gameplay was that interesting or fun but I just think it was a waste of time and money.

6310,"Incredible survival game but can be subjective based on who you play with. I highly suggest new players play solo if they dare, or try to find friends or other players who are also new. Many seasoned players, understandably, have many mechanics and strategies down second nature and it can take away a lot of the fun for new players. (I say this as a very seasoned player).

For example, a lot of people who’ve played a while have watched videos or just learned through experience how to solve the ghost puzzles through advanced means that really take away a lot of the danger and scare.

I implore any new players to just experience the game through trial and error. Done this way, this is one of the best value games I’ve ever purchased. 

Learn by trying and failing/succeeding. Watching too many videos or jumping in with experienced players can really alter the gameplay experience.

Use the few tools that the game gives you to start off with and do your best. You don’t have to figure out the ghost and solve every bonus objective to succeed. It’s better to survive and leave with what items and money you have earned than to try too hard and die, which sets you back on money and equipment.

TLDR: amazing game but it’s based on your gaming integrity. I still play this every now and then for hours of fun and scares."

6338,"At the time of writing this review the game is still getting consistent updates so this may change over time. If you can get it for a decent price I'd recommend it, playing this with friends is super fun and it will last you a good bit. The unfortunate thing is that as of writing this review the game does not yet have enough variety to last much longer than 30 hours, once you unlock everything and play all the maps there isnt much else to accomplish. If you continue to play after that point the game slowly becomes less scary and more boring as things become predictable and your adventures slowly start to all play the same way."

6462,"Was bought this by a friend to play with them. Three games later, refunded so they could keep their money because i'm sure not touching it again.
The gameplay is extremely slow and unrewarding, it mostly focuses on menial tasks and trial and error. I assume it's intended that you're constantly on edge scared of the ghost - I was not, particularly, because there's not a great deal of atmosphere. I was just running through a dark house. When the ghost actually shows up it's very obvious what's going to happen - either you're totally out of position and die or you aren't, and live. 
The whole game looks awful - I can't hold this against the developers, I understand they're a small team. Having said that, when the game is billed to me as the scariest experience of the year and i'm being chased by what looks like a gmod npc moving at a slow pace, I really struggle to get engaged. I have played other small budget indie horrors that look way better and cultivate a way scarier atmosphere as a result.

I can see why some people like this game. If you scare easily, if you have a group of friends and are in it for the 'funny moments' vibe, this might be for you. For me, this was a dreadful experience, not scary in the slightest and also not particularly fun."
6463,VERY GOOD GAME AND HOROR
6464,"Really fun game.

I only have one complaint.  I just wish the devs focus on making scarier ghost encounters.  Obviously playing the game a lot the ghosts stop being scary.  The game is still a lot of fun but i do miss being scare."
6465,Love helping my SO survive the spookies!
6466,Screamed like a girl. Scary as shit 12/10 will never play again
6467,"Where to begin with Phas.

*It is a great Ghost Hunting Horror Game.
*Even better with friends.
*If you are using the spirit box and someone comes with the Ouija Board, stop. That is all I will say,
*It is scary. The breathing, the doors opening and closing, things being thrown. I love it.
*This is a game I keep coming back too even with how much it does scare me.
*Play in the dark.

Things I wish for:
*Different ways to die
*More of a back story with the Ghosts
*More options on places to hunt"

6474,"It is something new to the market of gaming, something that maybe not everyone can like, but if you have a group of friends and you are looking for a good game, which does not bore you quickly and does not have many bugs, phasmophobia is your best bet."
6475,"If you and you're friends are looking for a horror game that won't get old too fast I'd definitely pick up Phasmophobia. This games great, especially with friends, if you are alone there is public lobbies that i haven't played yet myself so i won't talk too much about them. I say you give this game a go if you and your friends have been thinking about it."
6476,"FUN and scarry
"
6477,"I need to get this message out before it is too late. Phasmophobia is a PC game gaining major traction, it is played by thousands, even the biggest Twitch streamers are starting to get involved with it. I was a part of the development team, specifically the team that came up with the concepts behind the ghost lore. The concept of the game is to walk around haunted locations and hunt ghosts using various equipment. The ghosts can hunt you back, it is actually quite an exciting game. Unfortunately, there have been unforeseen consequences with the game. When you play Phasmophobia, you are given a name, as well as clues to discover the type of ghost you are hunting. Once you discover the ghost type, you can use its name as well as its ghost type to generate a reaction out of it, make it angry, and get more money out of it. There was a concept that we never realized, that maybe calling out a dead person’s name, as well as the name of a malevolent entity could have dire consequences. They just might actually be listening; they might actually be hunting.

When you are sitting in the game with your headphones on, calling out to an unknown entity by name... you are not just calling out in game, you are also calling out in the real world. Recently, some of our team have felt like they are being watched, followed, and unsafe in their own homes. A picture knocked off the wall, doors open that were closed before, cupboards open in the kitchen. Initially, it was just enough to cause concern, make them lose a little sleep, keep them on edge. Their work started to falter, they were showing up late for shifts, and above all they were absolutely TERRIFIED to play Phasmophobia, a game they invented. On Monday morning, one of our gameplay testers, I will just be using his initials, KW, failed to show up altogether. He had never missed a day, not for any reason whatsoever. We decided to go to his apartment to check up on him. When we arrived the door was open, and KW's neck had been snapped. There didn't look to be any sort of struggle or forced entry. The police chalked it up to a fall, just a sad accident.

While we were cleaning out KW's apartment, we noticed certain irregularities. For one, KW purchased a Ouija board the same day he died. He also purchased a walkie talkie, an electronic thermometer, and a UV flashlight. All items we use in Phasmophobia for the user to track the ghost. KW had spent 30 hours playing Phasmophobia. 30 hours calling out to ghosts, entities. 30 hours calling out to evil.

Today, I finished my shift, and signed off at exactly 30 hours. Maybe KW did just fall, maybe there really is nothing suspicious about his death. But my apartment feels cold... and I think I left my bathroom door closed? I definitely turned off my kitchen sink before I left... Or did I? I think there must be an issue with my electricity, my lights keep flickering. Maybe I am just paranoid, or maybe something heard me repeatedly calling it out. Maybe our lore was too accurate, our information was too good, and we are actually calling out to the spirits beyond the grave.

I will be sleeping with my crucifix tonight. Based on our game... It will not be enough. If this post does not get updated, my worst fears were realized. The entities we have been calling out to have heard us, they have heard us taunting them, calling to them, and they are coming for us.

Here. Adult. Pain. Kill. Close. Behind. Attack."

6498, Guys i think this game is haunted. I think I saw a ghost.
6499,good
6500,"This is a wonderful game that I play often with my son on the PC! I enjoy working together as a team to figure out what ghost we are dealing with in each investigation and look out for each other as it tries to hunt us down and murder us. The developers actively work on the game so it always seems fresh with new things on the horizon. It's very smooth gameplay on the PC and just the right mix of spooky and fun!

You can also play the game in VR but I don't really care for that except as a ""once in a while"" novelty. I've logged many hours using the PC/mouse, and the VR mechanics just don't have the same feel and speed I'm used to.

Here's a few videos showing both solo play and playing as a pair with my son:

DEFINITELY recommend this game!!!"
6501,"gud game, wud recommend"

6506,Got baited into a room while my friend watched from the van (like a coward). Ghost opened the door for me and I walked in like a fool. 10/10 would recommend.
6507,10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND for a really good scare and fun with friends. Hunt the ghostygoos.
6508,The Scariest Part is when my friend dies and picks up a book just to taunt me while I'm cowering in the van
6509,10/10 would recommend. From the Van i watched my friend get baited into a room on cams. The ghost opened the door for him but as soon as he entered it was a trap. F in chats for my boy Trevor.

6544,e ghost event stati linistiti
6545,very scary
6546,very nice very good very swag
6547,This game is good game but it has really to big lags when i have granpa pc so it not good to play at grandpa pc so play it at you pc :) if you dont have pc welcome in family
6548,I bought this game while it was on sale. I played it with a friend and it wasnt really as scary as people were making it out to be so i refunded it. Something like a month later someone gifted it to me for free. Instantly got scared because the lights went red. also filmed an xxx video at the camp site but thats beside the point.
6549,"Fantastic experience. I can't remember ever being as genuinely terrified playing a game as I have been when playing this. It's an authentic-feeling, ghost-hunting experience, akin to the paranormal activity movies. Currently, it's also £10.99. For the price, it's such a bargain, but it really, really benefits from having friends to play with. I also think it would be exceptional to have a go at it in VR too. 

That being said, it's still early access, which means there are a few areas I'd like to see improvement in. Specifically, the multiplayer needs some changes. It could do with the ability to filter lobbies by language for a start. It would also be great to have a 'vote to kick' mechanism rather than just having the host able to kick. Quite often, when you join a public lobby, you'll be kicked by the host straight away if you're a low level, despite the fact that your level has virtually no impact on the playing of the game. This means you'll often spend quite a lot of time trying to join a game without getting kicked. When kicked, the game puts you back onto the main menu, which means navigating back through to the lobby menu every - single - time. Jarring. 

I'd also really like to see some depth added to the single player experience. At the moment, there is a single player mode, but it just isn't compelling at all. I think it would really benefit from having a 'campaign/story mode' added to it - gradually unlocking new missions, equipment, and locations - to make it a viable single player game. At the moment, it feels like it will live and die based on its multiplayer audience."
6550,"This game is scary, but I like it."
6551,I mean seems like a good can but i just didn't have the right cpu or something like that to play the only thing that wasn't laggy was the menu but everything else was i even tryed to put it to the lowest settings possible but still would be to much lag.I like the game a lot but i guess my computor (laptop) just doesn't work.
6552,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

6559,"great game, but you can shit your pants"
6560,"Its really a lot of fun, especially if you get ur friends to buy it aswell. Its so much fun. Its scary and hard sometimes, but it gets more and more fun overtime. I played it with my cousin and we love playing it together, just the two of us and its a lot of fun."
6561,"Loved the game in the start, but the more money they got the more they abandoned it. Play Forewarned instead, since they actually care about their fandom, and update the game with major updates. 
Can't recommend it, since there is better games out there, like Forewarned and Ghost Hunters Inc.
Greedy fuckers..."
6562,I hardly play this but I quite like the game. I get kicked a lot for not using my mic when in reality I'm just shy. So most servers will kick you If you don't speak with a mic but overall the game Is pretty fun!
6563,"It's a great game.
We sacrificed our dear friend and then set up a marriage for her and a demon in prison. It was romantic until he snapped my neck...
I also recommend that you sing while playing, our success rate went up by 100%! Ghosts love when you sing."

6579,"This game is amazing. Go into a haunted place to learn more of the ghost that haunts it, while it hunts you. Scary and a lot of fun."
6580,"Fun game, especially with mates! :D"
6581,"Well to start off, I think this game lacks a certain content, that makes a game good, good directions, they throw you into the game without instructions, and you have to figure everything out by yourself, and the fact it's also kind of boring in my opinion, just go through levels with no stages or prizes, just pass on and pass on, this is a carbon copy of a bunch of games, it should be worth five dollars."
6582,"absolutely fucking terrifying, i am a ""pussy"" i take pride in that shit when i got donna fuckin johnson chasing my ass cheeks"
6583,Good Game if you are into grinding.

Also have had other times where its def 3 boxes, and says its 1 ghost, then we finish, and its a totally different ghost, that doesn't require the evidence that was shown.  Love the different levels from start out as an Amateur to playing in Nightmare mode (which is terrifying!) great game to play with friends.  Be sure to get yourself a headset or a decent mic, there are objectives that require you to talk to ghosts."

At first this game was super scary by myself.  Most horror games imo get boring when the horror wears off.  Not this game because the detective angle is satisfying on it's own."

6724,"My friend gifted me this for my birthday. This game is great. I originally found out about this game out of Steam, when I was playing Roblox. There's a Roblox game called Blair that is very alike to Phasmophobia, and I wanted this game for years and I finally got it. This game is very realistic, and horrifyingly fun. Although, it could take skill to play this. I am currently a level 1 on this game while I am writing this, sadly level 1 ranked people don't have access to all the maps I've heard of. This game could be very scary, you need a mic for this. It could respond to you through a Spirit Box, you can see zombie like people with axes, and more. Very fun game."

6801,Very fun with friends. Each map adds a different feel from the other. I wish they would add more jump scares or death scenes instead of the same death scenes over and over. It would add more variety to each ghost and more excitement and fear.

need something to make u laugh cry? you need phasmophobia. want a super good game to play with friends?
well, you get the idea. 


looking for a game that is very well made? this game has barely any bugs and IS very well made. i have not seen many horror games near as good as this. you can play the game online, singleplayer, or, best of all, with your friends. not to MENTION the amount of gameplay machanics. its deffinetly worth $15.


if you are easily scared or have phasmophobia (see what i did there?) do NOT play this game."

6844,The ghost doesn't know privacy. Because I will be taking a fucking shit and the god damn ghost doesn't fucking knock. He or she will generally walk straight in. put their hands on my face which is very fuckin abusive and I feel very unpleasing. Then they rape me and then I get pregnet and then have to pay child support. This game is very funny because I can scream at the ghost. hahahah ghost rape funny
6845,"This game used to be really fun. But after some recent updates, it doesn’t run well in VR at all. Hopefully this gets fixed, so people can play this game in VR without lag."

6868,"Hi. I'm Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution says you do. And so do I. I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent. And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque! Better call Saul. Saul Goodman, attorney at law."
6869,"The game can really grab you, it has atmosphere. As a co-op game it's great, I feel that alone you don't enjoy it as much and it's more difficult. The character movements feel a bit clumsy. If there was another mode in the game, for example not only to identify the ghost but to eliminate it, it would add a lot to the game. The system of arriving, identifying the ghost, leaving (if it goes well) takes away some variability, the scenario is still the same. You can see that the developers are still working on it, every now and then there are some new features or optimizations. It's an original game and it caught my attention. 8/10
"
6870,v spook. game fun. controls weird
6871,Amazing game needs more maps but really worth the purchase played for 12 hours straight in a day and still supirses me sometimes.
6872,such hard game will take lots of big brain iq to guess the correct ghost. It does get scary at some points. Can give quick streams. Def recommend especially to play with friends

6878,funny ghost go boo
6879,"Overall great game, has a lot of potential and in my opinion there is not much of it that they wasted.
Sure, there are some imperfections here and there,
but since the game is only in the Version 0.6.3.1, I expect a lot more to be released before it leaves Early access.
It's a lot of fun in multiplayer with friends, but I didn't yet test out public rooms.
Anyways, here are some ideas and wishes for the game's future:

[h2] Character Customisation [/h2]

In the current state of the game, there is barely any. You have around 6 selectable characters (3 men and 3 women I think) and nothing else. 
Another problem is the leveling, since you get absolutely nothing for leveling beyond the highest shop requirements (About level 24-26 or so). 
A good way to tackle [b] both [/b] of these ""problems"" (It's not really a problem but rather concepts that aren't that ripe) would be an approach like leveling past Level 100 in Destiny 2.
In Destiny 2, you get a so called ""bright engram"" every 5 levels past the big 100. In these bright engrams you can find 2 possible things: An in-game currency called ""bright dust"" or cosmetics (like weapon skins, ship skins and emotes).
I think that getting a random reward every 5-10 levels would fit this game too! Now, I don't mean that we need to default dance on a demonic circle or something, I had things like in-game Money, Character customisation items (like a different jacket for character #5 or a mask for character 
#2) or simply investigation gear (like a parabolic microphone or a sound sensor) would be a good reason to make the level system feel more like something that actually rewards you and not just a number below your name on the whiteboard.

[h2] Equipment [/h2]

Stuff like traps where you can contain the ghost for a few seconds during a hunt (like a demonic circle but without the summoning part) would be an awesome addition for the game, and maybe (but I don't feel like that would really fit a game like this) adding a class to the different characters like it was done in the Chernobyl Liquidators game would be an idea to test for a short period of time and see if it qualifies as a good mechanic.

[h2] Miscellaneous [/h2]

Add EMF-5 to hunts from ghosts that have EMF-5 please.
Add a little map of the, well map where you play on into the journal, where you can mark different locations like the found bone or assumed ghost room on, but not see yourself or your teammates.

That's it. Now, you don't need to add these, it's just something thast I would really embrace to see in the future of this game, and I'm quite sure that I'm not alone on that"
6880,"It s very good!
"
6881,It's easier to play with friends (to get over the ambiance and the fear). But! It's rewarding and very much fun the more you get over the general fear.
6882,good

6888,i heard a phone ring and i alt f4'd
6889,"I like horror in general ig, i like the game
"
6890,"I played the game with a friend for a few hours and it was alright at first but after several hours, it just became boring and really repetitive. the game is really slow and you are doing the same things over and over again. Sometimes the ghost would be in the same spot several times in a row. Big maps just take forever to where the ghost is, then you sit in the truck for 20 minutes waiting for evidence. I do not recommend this game to anybody, and I wish I could get a refund."
6891,its scary spooky but also fun
6892,"This game is really fun with friends especially with the proximity chat which just makes 5x more fun, (Play at night and use headphones) I have never played the vr version but if you have one try that version also."

6929,"[b]""A surprisingly challenging, unnerving and detailed game focused on detective work.""[/b]

[i]Feet touch the walkway,
during the middle of the night.
A building covered by moonlight
entices footsteps close by.

Within its dark corridors,
Laughs heard, as if miles away.
Apparitions seen on cracked mirrors.
Outlet sparks, nearby a fallen toy.

Something is here.

Camera on the kitchen counter, 
observes an ominous mirror.
Within the garage a projector,
and salt spread on the floor.

The camera observes a figurine.
A reflection of what once was,
Cryed it did, it has been seen.
Ran it did, up the stairs.

Purple light clear the darkness
Shine on the door, for it moves
Reveal the unseen prints
Though its time to face the fears

Spirit box, let them speak
""Where are you?""
On the floor, a written book
""I'm with you.""

Within the room, again, the toy
A case, yet, an untold story 
What was once a kid's joy
Became a nightmare, scary

It appears, allows to be seen
He holds the toy by the hand
The Generator broke down
eternal night claims the land

He cries alone, on the shadow room
There was no anger, gone long ago  
Yet, the misleading feel of doom
Teach us, nothing is greater than sorrow[/i]

A normal case solved by evidence
Yet, a detective's weapon
Always its own deduction
Dare to venture into this universe?"
6930,"i've really enjoyed it. the thing is that you should get at least 3 people to make it more entertaining and good to play. overall is a 9/10, i just wish that there were more locations to hunt, and maybe add an SLS camera for equipment?"
6931,10/10
6932,i own tarot cards in real life. after playing this game i will no longer own tarot cards
6933,"Wow

I've only played this game for only four hours but I'm already loving it. Even if you don't correctly identify the ghost you want to play more. The game looks great and works as it should. iamskillz and I have also found a lot of small secrets in the lobby. There's a lot of details in the lobby alone, not even the actual game!"
6934,"So spooky my friends avoid the ghosts at all costs.
They run in, get the evidence and run out.

Not really fun to play by yourself. Definitely recommend you play with friends."
6935,It's a very nice game. I'm still happy my friend bought it for me.
6936,SUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
6937,"If you sing ""Jesus Take The Wheel"" it can hunt, you can also just tell it to fucking murder someone and it will
10/10 you break doors like crazy and it's really fun to fuck around with your friends"

6940,is good game

6946,"The scariest and most interesting game I've ever played. Everything is fine in this game, it's a pity I can't enjoy it completely due to poor graphics and lags. I recommend it to everyone!"
6947,=)
6948,"This is an incredible game if you enjoy either being scared and having fun with your friends and if you like looking deep into game mechanics this game is also for you, with (as of writing time) 24 ghost types with difference behaviours and abilities. It has a lot skill floor but a really high skill roof. It gets a few updates big ones around once every 2 months."
6949,its trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrruck month
6950,"Karen kept trying to get in the closet with me.. I think she likes me

In all seriousness though, great game. A bit repetitive but special moments are often created with other people that make it memorable. The community is absolutely lovely, if you get this game, I 100% recommend you join the Discord server as well

I usually get bored of a game after 5 hours, and I'm writing this review at 30 hours, which should probably count for something.."
6951,"This game is incredible!
Played for 293 hours and still isn't boring and the updates are always amazing.
There's gonna be 2 big updates in the future that I know of and I'm so excited!

6963,"Phasmo is not a game without its flaws. But I think that's part of what makes this game so charming. While even after 50 hours (I know, baby numbers compared to other players) the game still manages to frighten you, yet it manages to reach this sort of calming, ominously relaxing cadence."

6989,"Very much a multiplayer experience. I have no fucking idea how half the items work 90% of the time, but it easily makes me shit my pants and gives me that adrenaline that most online horror games honestly lack. If you have friends, I would check this out with 2 or 3 friends."

7014,Got into this game and was immediately addicted. I began to learn about the game only to find out there was a surprising amount of depth. I can safely say this game has hundreds of hours of enjoyment.

7018,I liked the game a lot
7019,"It is scary to walk in a pitch dark room with only a flash light in your hand while you try and find the light switch to turn on the light in that room, and also the fact that you know that the ghost entity will mess with the lights, so keep your flashlight handy at all times, its your best friend. You also have that gut feeling that someone or something is watching your every move as you hear the floor creaking and doors open for you to find. The objectives are sometimes challenging as well and it puts your mind and investigation skill to the test to find evidence that lead to what type of ghost your dealing with is."
7020,"Are your pants too clean? Do you feel like you don't have enough fecal matter in your undergarments? Want to constantly have clammy hands and a bad grip on your mouse due to palm sweat?

This is your game.

While for the most part, Phasmophobia isn't scary, it builds on the atmosphere being creepy. Then the ghost starts hunting you.

Coordinate with friends or randos to figure out what type of ghost it is before it finds you and turns you into a ghost."
7021,good
7022,it is really fun
7023,This game is amazing in pc and vr
7024,pretty shitty ghost game 5/10
7025,"Highly addictive, nearly everyone has a mic, truly breathe taking community!!"
7026,"Great game! Wish there was a way to change the server name to let it know if its new or experienced players only. Wish there were more ways to track a ghost. Wish there was more cursed items (example: a teddy bear that will come to life and have a chance to walk to the ghost room, point you in the direction of evidence, or kill you.) Other than that It's one of my favorite games."
7027,Scary but fun
7028,ah ghost go boo
7029,"totally addictive, absolutely obsessed!
can't wait to see what the final release will look like."
7030,"Really fun to play, especially with friends and family. Like the set up and game play and all the equipment. Is good for beginners and challenging for those who play professional. Fun and addicting, highly recommend thanks"

7040,"yes

7041,"This game truly makes me feel SCARED. Between the dark environments, the silence of most areas, and the fact that you know something is in there with you, it all adds up to one of the scariest experiences you could imagine. Along with this, there are a bunch of cool items and features to mess around with, and in-game voice chat is really easy to use. Items are easy to collect, and finding evidence to prove what type of ghost you're dealing with is the perfect challenge. On top of all of this is the price. The game is $13.99, which is a steal for how much care and attention this game still gets from its creators. 8.5/10, would highly recommend!"

7087,"The game is in Early Access since 2020, I can't really tell why because it doesn't feel like an early access.

I Took a picture of the ghost right in front on me and I received: Footsteps 1 star.
Spended 1000 hours to get 666 points in basket, better thing I've ever done, no regrets.
Game with no bugs.

7091,"good for building up immunity to phobias and constipation but bad for sleeping.
over all very good game, my friend thinks worth the money because he gifted it to me and 4 others, as well as himself"
7092,"this game is still the same since it came out, only new maps which are either the size of the china or the size of andrew tates bugatti, new ghost are the same as every other ghost but with one slight change.
after a few days this game just tires you out form the boredom it curses you with.
scariest part of the game is the user reviews somehow being ""Overwhelmingly Positive""
someone on the dev team must be giving good gawk gawk to its player base"
7093,big ghosts good game dont play
7094,Its Ghost hunters meets paranormal activity except it doesnt suck
7095,yes
7096,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
7097,you can take pictures of your dead friends for money :)
7098,"I loved this game when if first came out.  Even after some of the updates it was still really fun.  Now, it's just gotten ridiculously hard.  The game is no longer fun.  We had 3 of us playing yesterday (all veterans to the game) and 3 different sites we all died and that was on intermediate. I'm sure others like the extreme challenge, but intermediate should not be impossible to play for users who have been on the game since day one. One game we played we got zero clues and had been in the game for at least 20 to 30 minutes.  Of course we all died.  It's just becoming impossible to play since being able to advance depends on money which depends on being able to complete a quest.  I can't recommend this game anymore because of this."
7099,yes

7101,"great fun with friends and solo players if you are brave enough.
verry good game for the price and gets frequent updates"
7102,very very very very very very very scawy game

+ Good audio with voice chat
+ detailed games
+ Fun to play with friends

- multiplayer isn't that good (depends on the people in the lobby)

Overall a great game if ur looking for a ghost hunt/horror game

7142,"""Guys it's okay the ghost is just messing with us again.""
My friend proceeds to drop dead in front of me."
7143,It’s Pretty Good
7144,"Phasmophobia is a very intriguing game, that uses strategic tactics to make you use equipment to find ghosts. Phasmo can be a multi player game for up to 4 people. My friends and I love jumping on phas and joking around to pass some of our free time while hunting and determining the ghost. The developers are always coming out with re-vamps, that always bring a new aspect and excitement to the game."
7145,"This is the first game of its kind that I've purchased, there are A Lot out there that are very similar in concept and style. I picked this cause of the overwhelming positive reviews over the others. This game is far from a perfect title by any means, lighting needs to be worked out a little better, the game is frustratingly dark. I feel in time, with the Developers support fine tuning this game it'll get way better.  It's just not there yet, yes its fun, yes its atmospheric, I just feel there's so much that can be done to make it even better then it is. Luckily its in Early Access, so that is why I'm recommending this title. If it was finished as is, I'd probably skip on it after a demo, but its definitely worth the $13.99. I have no review of its VR capabilities.

Tried to use a Xbox controller with this and the controls were wonky at best, it kept drifting when I used the controller and the key set up didn't make it any easier to use a controller. Hope they can fix the controller set up and usage to be a little more user friendly."
7146,sussu
7147,"There are really scary ghosts!
 
Agh! So damn scary!"
7148,funni but scari
7149,"Its amazing,just needs to add jumpscares"
7150,"best game tbh, there is ghosts, pretty poggers if u ask me.   
if u ask anybody else they will also say phasmophobia is poggers. and if they say otherwise they are not tgaf, they arent real ppl, probably npcs who act ""different.'
this game really helped me get through my deppresion while battling gods on my porcelain throne, i won all those battles tho, tbh they were all trolling gg's

7164,"Great game! Very spooky atmosphere and very fun to play with friends, BUT the game loses its fear aspect somewhat quick. its creepy but not very scary. I think the developers need to add more scares and have a jump scare mode for the squad or something. Some people may not like this and enjoy it the way it is and that's why an option or something for this would be cool"

Nowadays I play because it is fun with the scares as an added bonus, and trust me when I say it is still scary (If its not you are playing it wrong)."

7181,I really really love the aspect of searching out for the ghosts and determining which ghost type it is. The Multiplayer option is also an added bonus as you can meet people globally and have the ability to make friends worldwide. The challenge of some ghosts present to determine the type is also intriguing
7182,good game
7183,"over 300 hours on record, i've been playing this game since there was only one guy working on it, and let me tell you having help was both the best and worst decision ever. with every update this game gets more and more demented. even those who fancy themselves immune to horror will find their heart racing at least every few rounds. i especially love the flexibility of solitude - you can play with your friends, make new friends in public lobbies, or play solo when you just want to risk being killled by a ghost in peace."

7188,best game ever
7189,"Honestly, this is probably my favorite horror game ever. I've gotten to the point where I'm level 500, which is small compared to some other people's ridiculous levels. Firstly, the game looks and feels stunning (and this game is still in early access). The character models are a bit interesting, but this can lead to some very hilarious situations. In the current standings of the game, it is a bit hard for new players to get off the ground, but with a little determination, it can provide a challenge. The devs also put in a tutorial for new players, so you don't just get thrown into the mix with very little instructions. Each mission gives you a ghost with different abilities, interaction rates and aggressive behaviors. Each mission also provides the players with three different optional objectives for people to complete. These can include having the ghost walk through salt, stopping it from hunting with a crucifix, and many more. If the player manages to complete these objectives, they are rewarded with extra cash, which can be used to buy extra equipment for your next mission.  The game (as I'm writing this) has four difficulties to choose from, with custom difficulties on the way. The higher difficulty, the more money you get. You can play solo, or you can gather up to 3 friends to find the ghost together. If your feeling brave, you can also join random public lobbies, or set up your own. Suffice to say, this game is a must if you like co-op horror survival games. Hope you don't have Phasmophobia ;)"

7225,"As a person who hunts ghosts all the time. I can say this game is 100% accurate as i have encountered many ghosts being an expert ghost hunter. These ghosts love me because i am a great ghost hunter, they like to touch me because i have big boobs and very big butt. I love ghosts because they love me and i'm very cool and good at ghost hunting."

7241,"""Based""? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is ""Based""? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only word you can comprehend is ""Based"" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be ""Based"" once again. Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about five fucking letters? I bet you took the time to type those five letters too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing ""send"". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want ""Based"" on your gravestone?"

7255,"Yes yes yes!

Pretty lame on single player but on vr with friends its frankly amazing.
A lot of the horror is psychological but when it gets you with the jumpscare... oh it bloody gets you hard!

Me and my friend took turns playing it (a good way to play if youre the only one who owns it) and we were screaming Josie David into the mic or some bs and we got jumpscared and died.. scary

Another super cool thing are the ouija boards.. so fun, we learnt a ghost was 3, died drowning and was sick... and then they chopped our heads off. great.

I really recommend this game to everyone it is an amazing Horror game I have only played for 11 hours but I have had the game for a while and during those 11 hours of playtime I met and made so many new friends even having fun in Asian server where they only speak little English and struggled to communicate. This game was one of my best steam purchases and its sad that not as many people play this game now but overall the game has made laugh, scream and even made me turn off my PC more than once.

I can also say this game is made for everyone people who love scary games and even people who don't and it is a very easy game to run smoothly on most devices.
I 100 Percent recommend this game full of fear and laughs.
:)"
7288,great game
7289,good
7290,"Highly reccomend, if your friends are pussys or like me... a pussy; This game is perfect for you, its difficult but fun, it shows friendship and communication. But most importantly, them ghost fuckers scary af

I recently had a 1st time event recently when playing with my friends, i had died
and was watching and this goofy ass big sackboy head ass mf was sitting there just watching my friends in the corner of the room... not attacking, making lights flicker, it was horrifying and i was dead

10/10 game, cant wait to see more things they add
I hope they add the ghost will sometimes be at end of hallways looking at you and stuff, be pretty cool
"
7291,"I don't really like horror games, but this one is just awesome, I can't remember playing a game with friends as fun as this one. I love the cooperativity required and the fun stuff that happens with my friends makes me forget it's a horror game."
7292,Interesting game to play! Make sure to play this game with your friends! Will def make you thrilled!
7293,"Easily one of my favorite games. Play weekly with friends playing in all sorts of ways, from our normal rounds to rounds where try to be the first one to get killed. Plenty of spoops to be had and with the updates that the devs are always giving us, I will always be wanting to play more, I highly recommend this game to anyone whether or not horror is your thing, you will not be disappointed."

The co-op experience with friends or good hunters is where the magic is - hatching semi-suicidal plans and choosing someone to be the bait when things are going very badly feels so desperate and fun, especially when things go wrong, which they often do. Success isn't guaranteed, even with pro players."
7555,Very fun and scary
7556,GOOD game to play with friend
7557,love me some ghost huntin <3
7558,good game

7566,"So I have no idea about this game but I have a rift S VR headset.
So I buy the game and install it and go right into it without any clue whatsoever.

First I land in the team room where everyone is amazed I have VR and can apparently move my arms.
Anyway, So my first level with this crew is that appartement. I go into the appartement with my team and I just walk around and enjoy the VR experience. Everyone is talking and I decide to walk into the basement. Suddenly no one is talking anymore and i hear steps. I walk upstairs and everyone is gone. I start feeling weird what is happening. I walk to the door but the door is closed. I dont understand what is happening. I scream why they closed the door and if they can hear me.
I hear footsteps behind me when a shadow or something is walking torwards me. 

This was honestly the worst horror experience of my life as a 37 year old gamer. I had no idea what is happening and it certainly peed myself a little. Its hard to describe but playing this game in VR and having no clue is a great experience.

Btw i actually survived. Whatever the thing was it walked in front of me but then it dissapeared and the door opened.
"
7567,yes
7568,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

7585,"Phasmophobia is a great game if you have friends or siblings to play it with great fun it gets a great mixture of funny and scary if you play it on your own say it might still be fun but less funny and more scary and less fun.
It's just a great game so i recommend so you should pick it up if you haven't already GREAT game"
7586,this game is the most phasmophobia phastic game
7587,Its very fun and good to play with friends
7588,"I love this game, BUT I recommend waiting for the game to fix a lot of things before buying if you have a computer that doesn't have a great track record of running beefy games. 

It has a little ways to go in terms of optimization. Watching youtubers and streamers with beefy computers play this game does not prepare you for the actual gameplay experience. Even with a good computer I hit a ton of lag spikes whenever the game is trying to load something. Rain cuts the FPS down to like 5. The campsite is so god awful. I cant open the tent doors without lagging the game to hell and it sucks because I love that map. Some of my friends have found the game borderline unplayable. 

A game like this should not run so badly even on the lowest settings. The game looks nice, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like it should be this resource intensive. The game is great, but it's badly optimized. If those problems were fixed (and if the tripod wasnt damn near impossible to pick up) I would completely recommend it. But until then, buy at your own risk.

"
7589,many good game
7590,gost
7591,did the devs add a ghos event where the ghost poops your pants because i think it happened to me

All jokes aside this game does make you feel like Zak Bagans in an episode from Ghost Adventures. 
The game has a lot of room for improvement and some other parts they should've fixed ages ago but still, the game is quite something. I love it!"

7651,"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat. Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90° or slightly greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."

7656,"Phasmophobia is a very good game, and it will always be scary to me. Overall it has a genuinely scary atmosphere despite it's common visual glitches. The sound design is also spectacular, combining the quiet eerie ambience and general lack of noise can make even the smallest of sounds terrifying. 

However I believe it could take some changes. First off, it would be nicer to have an expanded variety of maps, ghosts, evidence, and maybe different ways to die aside from choking to death. Also I think it'd be nice to see some more story in the game; so far it has only been ""This person died and is now a ghost."" Some indication of how they died would be cool to see, it wouldn't be too important, but maybe some sorta side-objective could be implemented with it. There should also be something to help players without microphones play the game, maybe a chat of some sort to communicate with their team and with the ghost. And finally, a versus mode would also be interesting, however it probably shouldn't have any rewards since those matches might probably be cheated in with friends. It should also probably be on a bigger scale of maps, so that the matches aren't just the ghost camping at the door and spamming hunts.

If you are looking for a great horror game that works with single-player and multiplayer, this is the game to get."

7673,shat my pants on this one.
7674,scary
7675,"What a well thought out, and highly addictive game! I would gladly pay over 40 dollars for this game! I never was into the ghost hunting genre and, when I first saw the click bait youtubers pretend to freak out while playing, I thought it was going to be a colossal waste of time (what game would make anyone throw an expensive headset and and scream like they were actually being murdered?) ....until  I played it for the first time! Playing this game in the dark will freak you the efff out (not going to give spoilers here though). I don't know that I could play it in VR. I can not overstate how much I enjoy this game. The game mechanics are generally smooth. The ""lore"" does come from real world beliefs, and tools are what you would use in the real world. It is possible to get lucky in this game, but you do have to think your way through each map. No two hunts are the same. Even adding more players does not guarantee success, but it IS just as fun!
Developers are always adding Holiday themes and fun events. A lot of developer time goes into small details that just make the game special. Love the continuous updates! Tools are always changing to be as realistic as possible. developers are very open with future plans for the game  Not like other games that over promise and then get abandoned once the developers made the early access money."

7686,"This is a good game, but to me, this game is continuous. Now, you can say that with just about every game, but this game, you go to a certain place/map, you bring some ghosty equipment, and you go in the house and decide what ghost it is. But after a while, it feels continuous, and it just isn't fun with randoms and to do a LFG you have to go to the discord server, but the discord server always asks you to be like a certain age, which is kind of dumb honestly. But, if you've always wanted to go ghost hunting but never had the balls to do it, then this game might be cool."
7687,very good game!!11!
7688,"the ghost killed me in the truck, bad game"
7689,"The game itself is good, but the community is cancer."
7690,This game may be scary for others but when I played with others it made the game more fun. Being able to hear the reaction of others makes the game so much better. This game I find addicting.

7706,"I'd like to note first of all that all the negative reviews I've read thus far have been inaccurate. This game is amazing, although more of a game to play with friends or other people.
There are lots of bugs, unfortunately. None of the bugs I've seen are major, although if you plan on playing in VR, I've broken the game during VR sessions many times. It is super easy to clip through and inside things, or even fall through the floor if you're trying. I'm really disappointed with the VR experience, that being my only major gripe with the game. Everything else is awesome. Give yourself about 30hrs of experience and by then you should be decent enough at the game to join the public lobbies.
Unfortunately the community doesn't like playing with the newbies, which is understandable as the game takes a long time to learn and when newbies mess up (which is very often) then the people who bought all the in game equipment have to pay.
Those are my concerns. However despite them I love this game, the are trying really hard to update and add to the game, adding new features which add more depth or customization or a nice coat of polish to areas that were lacking. They seem to listen to the community and actively participate with streamers. A loving team who put their souls into this game. 
The game is always exciting to load up, me and my friends giggling over something stupid we did, like making fun of the ghost only to have it hunt us, or to have the door close on the last person and then they die. Just stupid funny things like that. I highly recommend picking this game up!"

7713,good soup
7714,Love the game so far. I tried VR and it gave me a stress headache because of how horrible the controls are (managing items on my belt and placing items like the camera for example). I would really love to see a 'seated with game controller' VR mode or even 'seated with keyboard and mouse' so it is the same controls as non-VR but you use the VR headset to aim. Then standing mode can stay like it is for people that can somehow not get stressed out with it.

I love the game just not the people."

It can be a bit scary, but it's definitely better with other players. Sometimes I play with my friends and we never experience any problems, we only experience lots of fun.
I think there is a slight problem only from past experiences. The campsite map can be really laggy & buggy. This happens around 85% of the time. I don't play it too often, so it doesn't bug me a lot.

Do you like playing card games for kids and getting your friends killed while you cackle like a maniac in a closet screaming about the heart of the cards? You can do that too! Do you want to be the guy that tells the Ouija Board ""Hide and Seek"" while asking your friends if they'd like to play a game? Go for it!

Get your friends killed and be scared all while doing it. Or do it by yourself and get yourself killed if that's your kink. I don't judge!

Solid ghost investigation game. Ghost scares (and the ghosts themselves) could use a little more variety and be a little more psychological in nature but otherwise a worth it game."

7783,"This game is addicting! I love the jump scares, and the features of this game, but I do miss when it first came out. Yes, the game is a bit harder now, but our team of 4 had trouble getting evidence without dying on intermediate level, while we used to have no trouble on expert. On larger maps, it's too difficult to tell when the ghost is hunting.
You should also be able to have more players on your team, depending on the map. for larger maps, I think you should be able to have more than 4 players."
7784,if you like competitive games don't buy it

7800,"When you first start to play, don't try to be a hero. You will be absolutely terrified. Don't even bother trying to lie to yourself. We all know you're scared. Ghost events are horrifying, and the ideaof a ghost hunt fills you with dread.

Now once you've made it through your first few hundred levels, you can call yourself a veteran and will only let out a mild squeak during jumpscares without judgement. But you own the ghost now. The ghost checks its closet for you before going to sleep, so when you come through the door, it's frightened of you rather than the other way around."
7801,scary ghost game
7802,"tutorial is bad, controls are bad there is no real tactic in the game u find urself doin anything and hoping it works every item is bad explained and doesn't really do what it should do, u die very fast bcs of nothing all in all the horror aspects were pretty good at first so if u like that ur first 5hrs should be good but otherwise i wouldnt recommend"

7843,"a wide variety of ghosts and each one has its own unique traits tha maps are well structured and i found little to no glitches at all even though it is an early access game,"
7844,Ghost
7845,"fun ghost hunting game with a lot of variables that make each game a bit different. the ghosts are all pretty well designed and have little powers that set them apart. or some ghosts have personalities that make them menacing or very shy. sometimes they act up and do things you don't expect which leads to funny games. play with your friends and you can totally kill them which is a huge plus. or you can be super serious and speed run. i've played a while so the game rarely spooks me anymore but sometimes a specific ghost can come out of nowhere and surprise you. 

pros 
-very fun to play with friends
-ghosts are unique beyond just their 3 points of evidence
-diverse maps that offer different challenges
-houses have enough furniture to seem realistic without being distracting
-sound effects are pretty great
-you can kill your friends with cursed possessions in the first 2 seconds of entering a house and then have them convinced it was an early hunter (epic)

cons
-laggy sometimes
-no way to join another lobby as a premade (you have to wait for people to join you which can take A WHILE)
-large maps can be boring if you get something like a shade"
7846,i asked him to suck my d and he killed me instantly :D
7847,very fun and you can choose how challanging the game is and if it is to hard play online with good people
7848,I did not recieve this game for free either
7849,pretty fun game if you have people to play it with i would recommend to you if you and your friends are looking for a game and trying to get a laugh out of it !

7855,good if you like scary games
7856,fun
7857,Good horror coop. Can't believe it took me so long to try it.
7858,"Totally awesome and even better with friends! (who don't kill you on purpose.)

You use your ghost hunter tools to essentially locate and identify the evil ghost. And when i say evil I mean it. They do anything and everything to scare you, and if that doesn't work they just hunt you down and kill you. Sound fun right? Well it is! 

P.S. - Don't forget to hide!"
7859,"It's really fun, but I do wish there were more small maps, I work odd hours and often don't play at the same times as my friends."

7899,"Very good game to play with friends! Really tests how well we listen and understand what each other are saying, so essentially tests teamwork compatibility! The game is slightly buggy but other than that definitely worth it! :D"
7900,"This has been such a fun game! 

It is one of the few games my wife enjoys playing with me. she calls it more of a puzzle over a video game. She really likes to solve what the ghost is.
She initially always had me go in to look for evidence alone, and she would man the truck. But now she will run in and do things with me. 

It is worth every cent! Exciting and spooky ghost encounters! Problem solving and evidence gathering!

You wont regret it."

The constant updates to improve the game are always the best and most terrifying aspects when you play. Its unsettling and I still refuse to play this game alone."

7935,awesome scary game for the whole family
7936,"Overall it is a pretty fun game to play. My biggest complaint about the game is when you are trying to take pictures of the ghost. I will set up to have the ghost hunt me and try to take a picture of the ghost and then escape the hunt. Nearly every time I snap a photo, it won't count it. I have had times where I will wait for the ghost to pretty much be kissing my face and the photo still won't count, or it will give me footsteps or interaction only. When I take a picture of the ghost during a ghost event, I could be outside, up in a tree, eating popcorn, while looking in the opposite direction and will at least get a one star picture of the ghost. Very frustrating!"
7937,it used to be super easy and not too scary and then the updates came out and now this game scares the shit out of me :')
7938,brilliant 4 player game

7941,You know those dreams where demons are chasing you but you're only able to run in slow motion? This game is that but with friends. It's fantastically fun and the community is still in that phase where no one yells at you for sucking at a game. The devs are also hard at work and updates are worth the wait!
7942,spooped myself
7943,yo mom
7944,"Sometimes when they do a big update it can be buggy, but other than that it's an awesome game to play with friends!"

7973,"I absolutely love playing this game. I don't have incredibly high amounts of time in the game, but the time I've spent in game has been amazing and I love that they added an anti-cheat to the game, which was very helpful in preventing annoyances and game ruining players that prevented me from playing without knowing what the ghost type was immediately. Phenomenal game and I would definitely suggest buying this game if you're ready for a scare."

8022,"Came in expecting nothing more than every other horror game out there, jump scares, cheap tricks.

Phasmophbia, when played with friends is a tonne of fun, you begin to learn the patterns and tricks over a few hours and you begin to feel like proper ghost hunters. I'm sure at some point you ""figure out"" the AI and the magic wanes but until then, bring it on.

Does horror in that ""it's not what you see"" way, it's carefully crafted, but with enough abstraction to make a replay of a level interesting enough to try again.

I would say however that some of the levels, especially the larger ones are bland and empty, School seems to have this disjoint between the classrooms and the corridors, the quantity of rooms is excessive, it'd be just as good with half as many. Prison suffers this too. 

The smaller, more detailed levels are the most fun, content needs to keep coming though or the game will get stale, we need new voices, new behaviours, new ghost types, new maps to keep this fresh.

So for now it's on our regular cycle and getting a lot of laughs and scares, I would reccommend."

8034,"get it jayden
"
8035,"just a new player 1st impressions -but please consider

for this games 'size' the textures and maps look decent enough, much more (everything) needs to be more interactive especially for a VR game.. the lack of interactivity leaves the buildings feeling flat like pictures..

should be able to push against and cause reactions and or result with realistic movement to ALL objects (furniture!) as player via movement alone & everything should produce sounds/impact as brushed against.

Games 'Interact' command should be expanded to include actions for anything in reach; windows blinds, beds sheets, ect. (all this gives more for ghosts to flirt with too)

The player should more feel 'Sanity' level IMO- say think more along Rm#1408's hallucinations-style entrapment potential and scares."

8071,"I used to really like this game when I first got it. Now I can barely play it because of all the stuff they've added. The sheer amount of ghost types has made this game ridiculously hard to complete in any mode higher than medium difficulty, as you usually die long before you even get the second of three required bits of evidence. I will say that it's great for bonding with friends and has gotten a few good laughs out of me and some others, especially with the built-in proximity chat cutting off players upon death, but it's just not worth the frustration it causes now with how annoying it is to find out what ghost you've got before you die. barely runs well enough for me to walk around, too, which doesn't help, and you can't adjust graphics settings once the round starts."
8072,"scary, lots of tools, fun quests, multiplayer works amazingly, its the perfect Ghost hunting game!"
8073,"OK
"
8074,"Very spooky, decent VR mode and generally fun and engaging gameplay. The only criticism I have of the game at the moment is that it gets very repetitive after a while, but I expect that issue to be resolved as the game receives new updates. 7/10 at the moment, I expect it to be a 9/10 in the future."

8081,"The game is a nice mix of horror with mystery sort of/ end goal. Basically you can play by yourself or with the homies and try figuring out what type of ghost is haunting u at the map u chose. As u find clues u will know the ghost then u leave, u get money to buy extra stuff to help u with ur missions and level up to get harder maps and bigger maps to plus more difficulty (the bigger maps and higher difficulty might still be a feature i don't really know I just downloaded this game so i'm waiting for the homies to download"

8131,"is good

8132,"Incredibly fun and equally scary as hell, it is alot less scary and even more fun with friends or on multiplayer! The programming in this game is phenomenal, these developers have so much talent and I haven't even touched the visual or sound design (they are equally as good at setting the scene of haunted residences). This game never fails to impress and entertain me. Even scarier in VR, I highly reccomend!"

8146,"Started playing this game just to play with my husband who really enjoys the ghost hunting vibe. I am a big ol' chicken and am easily spooked, but I've started to get the hang of it. I still panic during a hunt, but my ability to survive has gone way up! It's been a lot of fun to play with my honey and some of his friends, and interest in this game has led me to some good content creators on YouTube. I definitely recommend it."
8147,scary
8148,"Very great game, if you have friends."
8149,if you need a game to sh!t yourself this the the game for youuu
8150,Great Game Def worth the money when playing with friends!
8151,Ghosts
8152,It really gives you phasmophobia
8153,"Let me preface that this game is in early access so you should expect some bugs here and there, not game breaking or anything.

The game at its core is really fun, it mixes the fear of unknown and the need of deduction to rule out ghosts (especially in Nightmare difficulty), but you will also have to take notes of strengths and weaknesses of the ghost you may be facing; on top of it, a lot of different ghosts make the game feel unique in any contract.

The maps are only a few so especially on the smaller roadhouses you may just get bored of the usual environment, but with some differences based on RNG (breaker position/hiding spots, cursed possessions and the ghost room) it really feels like a different game everytime.

Of course sometimes it may feel unfair with some combination, but with it being a PvE game you can quickly just get into the next match easily, also, farming money in this game is really easy, so unless you die really frequently you will be able to stock up some cash to buy the best equipment.

This game is also fairly scary, especially when playing by yourself, ghost events really set the tone and can catch you by surprise, or the sound of footsteps getting closer during a hunt can really be unsettling.

Overall my personal experience is pretty postive, and I'm looking forward for more content for this game (also personal reccomendation is to not play too much in a single burst to avoid burn out)

pretty good game"
8216,Pretty fun with friends
8217," This game is really great, but unfortunately I must say this game in early days was better, more precisely, the update Exposition changed the entire game and in my opinion it ruined the entire game. In the early days I played this game with my friends every day and we were excited for the new update Exposition, but it wasnt that great like we expected. After the update we played this game less and less until we completely stopped played this game and further updates also contributed to this, which changed, for example, the position of all items in the van. Honestly, if i would bought it today it would be money in the bin. But I and my friends or other people would appreciate some OG version of this game thank you. So yeah in early days I would recommend this game but today nope."
8218,the game is amazing.
8219,must i say that this game is quite a spooky experience and i am certain that the smudge sticks are just cigarettes which are used to ward off an asthmatic ghost

8281,"I started with Ghost Exile and then came to see the OG....


Phasmophobia still is the king for now (7/27/2022).  

Ghost Exile has some things above Phasmophobia, but this game is just smarter, I would say.

THATS ENOUGH OF MY COMPARISON><   now to review

Phasmophobia is clucking terrifying!!!  I have almost ruined like 7 or 8 pairs of underwear playing this game.  In between shidding your pants, you will find a detective type mystery game.  You are to determine what the ghost is!!! I mean, while you are literally freaking out and running and crying and wondering why the front door is now locked.

This is the penultimate ghost hunting game.  There is someting so eerie about exploring a vacant luminal space while you hear doors far away creaking open.  Ive set up a video camera and watched as a door slowly opened from the safety of the ghost busting RV.  

If you like horror.  This is your game.  If youve never tried horror... this is it.  This about as scary as it gets.

Happy hunting"

8320,This game is excellent for paranormal horror genre fans! Each ghost is unique to the point you don't even need all of the starter equipment to figure them out. The devs appear to consistently push out updates to keep the playerbase alive and the TLC put into this game is evident. Excellent bang for buck with plenty of scares that will keep you jumping out of your chair!

Its footsteps are slow from far away, which makes us begin to wonder. We are prepared to loop it around Willow kitchen island. The moment it sees us it begins hauling ass to come kill us faster than Epstein. Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am's us in four seconds.

Turns out it was a mimic that went from deogen traits to revenant. 10/10 would die again with he sounds of my friends screaming like children."

8399,"I could see why other people like this, but it's just not for me. It's very repetitive and I could never play for longer than half-an-hour as all missions just felt the same. The locations are decently diverse but they're all so dark and gloomy, it doesn't really make any difference. My biggest complaint, and this might make me sound childish, is that there's no way to defeat or incapacitate the spirits. If you enjoy the gameplay of identifying the type of spirit, good on you, but to me it's just going down a checklist with no climax. That said I have to applaud it for having a really good online community, I hardly ever encountered a troll when joining a random lobby and everyone was very polite in helping a noobie like me. Ultimately, you might still be able to get some enjoyment out of the atmosphere, and it's always worth giving the game a try, but if you share my sensibilities on other games, I don't think you'll like this one."
8400,This game quickly became one of my favorite games to play very nerve-racking and exciting at the same time!

8438,"good game best with people
"
8439,"10/10 game with nearly infinite combinations, have not had a same game twice. Very solidly made, even in early stages. Devs consistently update, listen, and involve themselves within the community. Cannot wait to experience the full release."
8440,"This game is super fun to play. While initially very scary, as you play more of the game you get hooked on the investigative aspect of the game. With plenty of different ghost types, each with their own quirks and special abilities, Phasmaphobia creates a learning curve for players to be able to figure out different ghosts not only from the evidences that they give, but also the characteristics of each ghost.

Pros:
-Horror game but still addictive for its investigator aspect
-Multiplayer allows you to investigate with your friends for hours of fun
-Moderate learning curve to learn the different maps each with their own spawns of the cursed items, as well as specific hiding spots to look for.
-Moderate learning curve to learn the different ghosts each with their own evidences, characteristics and special abilities
-You get to laugh at your friends dying from ghosts and take a picture of their body for profit
-Even when you get less scared of the horror aspect of the game, you still get scared at losing the $2k worth of items you just bought for the game!
Cons:
-Voice activation is still bugged and doesn't work for all accents
-Numerous bugs still in the game, some more severe than others
-No other thing to grind other than making money to buy items, could be cool if there was a way to grind for special skins or cosmetic things
-GUI is kinda crappy
-The dead do not play any part of the game from the grave, it may be fun to have ways to signal to the people still alive what they think the ghost is
- You will be mad when you die multiple games in a row while your friends laugh

Overall: 9/10"
8441,Do you like deafening your friends and internet strangers with excessive screaming in the mic while singing the Ghostbusters theme song? This is the game for you.
8442,yes ghost is scary yes baby ghost chase me down im shaking goodbye smudge it and leave

Leaves me hung like a horse after seeing that ghosty girl hunt me down with an axe."

and came out of the closet more times than i'd like.

10/10, would f*ck again."
8480,fuck
8481,"it's scary
"
8482,"The game is great but the scare factor goes away pretty quick. Needs more atmospheric events like whispers in your ear, loud knocking on doors or just something to make it scarier. If they focus on that then I think it would catapult the game even further."
8483,"Oh, it'll spook you. It's a game that gets better as you become more experienced. In that way, it almost feels like you actually are becoming a more seasoned hunter. Very neat game with friends."
8484,"It's more fun to watch then play. It takes a lot of hours to understand everything as well. It's ok, but just not for me to play for more than 10min."

Some ghosts are pretty annoying to get active and it is pretty enjoyable to learn all the different means the ghosts hunt. I look forward to any update the creators post. Surprised this is still early access as I write my review, I can't see what additional updates would get posted"

8510,I love this game
8511,"Great Game. Process of elimination trying to figure out what ghost your dealing with. Sometimes you live, sometimes you die. Great fun regardless. 
What do i dislike about this game? Well, the dying part aint so hot but part of the fun, really ;) Cant say there is anything I can specifically say about the game that I have disliked. Great theme, well designed, decent effects and lots of fun. The hours just float on by like ghost orbs and before you know it, it's almost time to get up for the day and you've lost out on another night's sleep. Oops. :P

8527,"This game is an absolute blast! Quite a unique take on horror game play, or at least executed very well. You basically just have to gather clues, and determine what kind of ghost is haunting this location. Using various tools and tactics to bring the ghost out. There are many different kinds of ghosts, and it is never straight forward answer. So it provides a pretty good challenge every match and I haven’t even went up in difficulty yet. 
	The atmosphere is pure horror and I love it. The ambiance and sounds of the environment is top notch. Tension slowly builds up of the course of a game and will have you panicking by the end. Even in a party or if you play the same map over and over, it remains fresh.
	I only hope this doesn’t become a permanent early access. Hopefully we get the full release soon, and updates for years to come. That said, even in early access, it is still easily worth $13. The fact that it's this cheap, has no micro transactions and isn't a over the top grind fest, if refreshing to say the least. If ya want a new horror experience or to get scared with some friends, pick this one up!"

The maps are all so well done and are really fun to play regardless if you die or not. I also really love the proximity chat because it allows people to feel more alone when they are away from the group even when playing with friends, raising the fear level. I think this game is a must play especially if you're playing with friends!"

8544,"the ghost stared me down in the nursery. I love how interactive the game is, for example, if you say that you're scared and your mic is plugged in then the ghost could be attracted to you. There are many other examples of keywords and interaction which is hella scary yet really fun. 10/10 would happily have a staring contest with the ghost again"

8655,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8733,"One of the best horror-esque games I've played in the last decade. It's entertaining, thrilling, creepy, and events can be unexpected, keeping you on your feet. Additionally, it's one of the few games that can actually give me jump scares, and they do it consistently. 

The developers are really good at adding things in to make me come back to this game and their ghost types are varied and random enough so that unless you get definitive proof of the types of evidences, it keeps you guessing the entire time.

9.5/10 - reason for making it not 10/10 as it doesn't have support for VR without having a PC, which limits a few of my friends from playing. Aside from that, one of the better games I've played in the last year, and definitely a top-tier horror game for me."
8734,its fun to play with people.
8735,this game is fun and spooky and its fun to troll your friends
8736,fun but make sure you have friends with this game first

8738,"I really liked this game because it is a ghost hunting game that doesn't revolve around jumpscares. Yes the game can get intense, but it isn't overall terrifying. It also is able to be played with friends and is a co-op not a PvP. Lastly, there are a lot of great people that play this game on streaming platforms and post videos online of their gameplay. This allows for the player to see other ways to play and is an easy way for the community to get together and share tips and tricks. It is perfect for finding a quick game or spending the day."

8753,HOME SAY YOUNG FROM THE SQUID GAME
8754,"This is a half-indie game about ghost hunting... well, duh. Specifically it's all about investigating the ghost at hand and gather information about it. The reason every youtuber played it at some point, is that this game is constantly listening to your microphone and has voice recognition, which is essential for gameplay. You can interact with the ghost by calling it's name, asking them to do something like ""Where are you?"", ""Give us a sign"" etc. This is very interesting and fun, as this keeps you immersed, and the ghost doesn't necessarily do something if you ask it to. Cursing, saying you're scared, telling others to run/hide are some of the ways to increase the ghost's activity or anger it. The main objective is to find 3 pieces of evidence to find out what type of ghost you're dealing with (which there are over 12: spirit, poltergeist, demon, oni etc.). Each ghost type has unique behavior, level of aggression, strengths and weaknesses, which is an alternative way to determine what it is if you're having trouble getting evidence, as those might take a while (ex.: some ghosts take over 20 minutes to make the temperature go below 0 Celsius, thus letting you know that it has the ""Freezing Temperatures"" evidence). Problems getting the required evidence are presented as: the ghost trying to kill you in it's hunting phases, the ghost trying to scare you, the ghost messing with items nearby, the ghost messing with electricity etc. Although you get used to ways the game tries to scare you, every once in a while it gets me, and even people who played it for thousands of hours still get scared every once in a while. There are still many problems in this game, like: cursed player animation, players clipping through walls/doors/closets, numerous bugs, bad progression system (this one is being addressed by the developers), glitches involving voice chat/voice recognition etc. For me, personally, the game is just not fun playing it by yourself, you kind of take it seriously with 1 friend, and just plain old fun with 2 or more. I still recommend it, it's very good for enjoying sleepless nights with your friends."

8758,"Great game overall, a lot of fun to play by yourself or with friends. I currently have 200+ hrs in the game and am over level 500, so I've experienced pretty much all this game has to offer (including VR). 

I play single player 99% of the time because I enjoy the challenge of finding and researching the ghost by myself. The game was scary the first few times I played but you get used to the scares and the different ghost behaviors. I will say the VR portion of the game is pretty well made and is pretty fun. If you're in for scares, play VR, it works on Oculus/Meta Quest 2 with the cable-computer connection as well. There have been many updates since I first started playing and the developers seem to keep busy both fixing and adding new items to the game. 

Overall one of my all time favorites and I highly recommend this game to anyone curious or on the fence about buying."
8759,I love this game and i have very fun playing it. Even when i play solo. and the updates are very nice and makes the game better

8813,"I'm a huge fan of shows such as Ghost Adventures, and at first this game was almost everything I wanted from this genre. However, after playing it a lot and waiting for updates that would expand the game mechanics and gameplay itself, those never really arrived.

Almost every other ghost hunting game out there has the exorcism mechanic built in, others even implemented amazing ideas such as the Ghost Exile's World of Shadows, Ghost's favourite ítem or the Labyrinth of death. Phasmophobia still is just a ghost identification game. Just as it was on release day. 

This game was the fírst of this genre, but it definitely wasn't able to keep up with what the community expected from it.

To be honest, after 90 something hours invested in this game playing with friends, I find it disappointing and just flat out repetitive. The whole premie doesn't even make sense: 

- Find out what ghost you are facing. 

+OK I will, what do I do once I find it out??

- You leave.

Honestly, I appreciate the amount of hours that it kept me and my friends entertained, but overall it's a huge missed oportunity. Even some games released after this one managed to implement more gameplay mechanics in less time, so it's fair to assume they just don't care about what's missing.

I uninstalled it recently and decided to give a chance to other phasmo-knockoffs, and honestly... I should have done it much sooner. I got that spooky feeling back and they feel like there will be much more content added in the future, which is much more than I can say for Phasmo after so long playing it. And more importantly, I finally do MORE than just identifying the ghost.

To sum up, check out Ghost Exile, add The Hauntings to tour wishlist (I'm so excited about this one, definitely check it out of you are into this kind of games) and check out Forewarned as well if you would like the same concept applied to mummies. Even Obsideo and Ghost Exorcists Corp managed to do most of it better than Phasmophobia. At least these ones listened to what their community was expecting from them and started applying those ideas into their games.

I hope one day I can rectify my review of this game, but so far it doesn't seem like the game will have any significant updates that will make me change my mind about this game.
"
8814,"This is a great horror game with friends that gets updates on the regular. Currently they are giving their assets some TLC. Some of my friends have said that this game shares assets with House Flipper. Maybe they got the same assets from an assets store? I wouldn't consider this a bad thing, just interesting.

The horror elements are on point! There is a build up of terror because you know the ghost is in the room but can't see it followed by the release of horror as the ghost suddenly appears to either spook you or hunt you.

Early on the game was very easy but they have ramped up the difficult by adjusting how detecting ghosts work. And then there's Nightmare difficulty...

Devs, custom levels would be excellent! Allowing the community to build custom levels for you would be fantastic and would increase the longevity of the game. Playing on the same 10 levels quickly leads to burn out."

"
8892,jake paul
8893,"Definitely a game that's great with friends, especially in group Discord calls. Best played at night for full effect, 10/10."
8894,this game is FUCKING AWESOME
8895,Phasmophobia is at it's most enjoyable stage when you first start. If you can start playing the game for the first time with a group that is all new then it's hilarious and terrifying at the same time.
8896,"Me: Where are you?
The ghost: Behind
Me: *Proceed to cry*"
8897,ITS FUN
8898,Good wholesome Christian fun.
8899,boo
8900,"Very good horror game, game gets much more fun when you start to learn how to play."
8901,game is so fucking scary
8902,"This game keeps my friends and I entertained enough to come back. If you're interested in the paranormal, check this game out!"
8903,"It's, a game. It's fun, it's scary. But it really only gets it's charm when you play with friends, and to be honest I don't really like voice chat. I recommend it for people who like voice chat, but otherwise it's not the greatest.

But with voice chat, it's fun and really hilarious. I've watched multiple videos about it, and it's comedic. If you don't mind using voice chat, it's worth the buy."
8904,scary game
8905,fart scary
8906,YES
8907,get scurred with friends lol
8908,I'm a pussy that is scared of the dark so I only ever play this game with other people.

8934,"I'm writing a review just for the funny 666 joke lol

I'm kidding this game has improved tremendously since it first came out (when I bought it) & it's really scary & fun now
10/10 really good & burping at the ghost is really funny too"
8935,Awesome team game.
8936,"definitely one of the best games I've ever played, it's the perfect horror game no questions asked. I rate this game 7 ghost orbs out of 10."
8937,It's a fun game! It does have some quirks though. Like how everyone is so out of shape they walk very slow or can only run for a couple seconds before you have to catch your breath. Another one is that if you die you lose all the gear you bought and brought with you into the locations. But if you survive you get to keep everything and get a lot of money to buy more stuff. So overall it's a fun game! Definitely recommend playing with others though. Makes it more of a blast.
8938,Definitly worth it
8939,"By this point, if you're looking here, you know what Phasma is. You've seen the streams, maybe you have some friends who own it. Maybe a friend bought you a copy so you could play with them.

Have fun, get spooked, and enjoy the hunting. 3/3, this game does it for Dale."
8940,This game is SO scary. Never felt fear until my friends locked me in the house and while the ghost was in hunting mode.
8941,spoopy
8942,"The scariest thing is how this game isn't more popular. Fun, scary, dope with friends. HIGHLY Recommend if you're looking for a new single or multiplayer."
8943,it is fun with friends who never play scary games
8944,Great game for flirting with ghosts.
8945,"Is good game,."
8946,really scary game and its good ghosts cream all inside of me
8947,It is a fun game. Not extremely polished but it is from a smaller developer. Love everything about this game and how fun and unique it can be.
8948,"Why is this game so f***ing good! Even though it makes me want to scream like a 5 year old losing a balloon, I keep coming back hoping to be a man and take on the ghosties alone! It's the most fun I've had playing online with my friends in years and now we get to see how scared each of us are of some pixelated ghosts! 10/10 IGN ""It really makes you feel like a Ghost Hunter""."
8949,"ghost game
👍"
8950,"Accidently killed the highest level player by opening his closet door during a hunt, 10/10 would do it again."
8951,"This is a very straightforward ghost hunting game. You'll experience the fear and jumpscares of a horror game... but once you've figured out what sort of messed up being is haunting the house... you get to just book it right on out of there. No exorcism, no nothing... just ""Yep, m'am. Demon is confirmed. Have a great day!"" 

Nice and short multiplayer game for those who don't like spending hours and hours on one game. I'd say it ranges from 15-45 minutes per hunt."
8952,yes
8953,"This is a great game, but I really think the steam workshop would help this game."
8954,Game is good
8955,Its fun but only if you have friends
8956,i did not enjoy
8957,Is a very fun game. But they need to put more stuff in the game

8959, good ass game but SOMEBODY HELP ME FIX MIC ECHO
8960,very dedicated devs
8961,"Game is cool, i asked the ghost thru sprit box are you piza and it said AH YES"
8962,"I dont like this game, I pee my pants every time my friends force me to play it. I reconcider my life choices every time I launch this game, and that is also pittyful knowing I only have 8 hours played. Other than that the its a great game looking at it with developer eyes, good for poeple who actually can plau horror games."
8963,"yes play game it fun
"
8964,inanılmaz
8965,fun. Anyway just yell the ghosts name u instant win
8966,"Can give you a good scare, and listening to your friends scream is great. If they stream and have a soundboard it's great fun to scare the heck out of them while streaming with the soundboard."
8967,"Was very great however rose the ghost didn't show up at all for the 20 minutes we spent in game, unsure if she got camra shy, we shaked our booties still didn't come out. Must only like the orbs which is the moon. Will try to send her help she did flash the light, might have been trying to say SOS. I'll come back tomorrow to see if she changes her mind. In the end we found out she was a shade. Didn't think to check the lamp for her. Maybe next time."
8968,spooky
8969,"I find myself downloading this game once, every few months. play 1 game with friends who drag me into it. scream and cry my head off. leave the game. uninstall just to reinstall it a few months after. Rinse and repeat."

8980,e rekomandoj
8981,The most terrifying fun I've had with a VR co op horror that isn't just jump scares. Having to actually agitate the ghosts and speak to them with your voice is so immersive and extremely scary when it works!
8982,"good game, shit myself a lot"
8983,Macht Spaß mit Freunden zu spielen. Der Gruselfaktor sinkt aber ziemlich stark nach paar Runden

8998,"When the Revenant is morbing checklist:
- Sacrifice a femboy
- Eat all the salt
- Inhale all smudge-sticks"
8999,This game is amazing. The attention to detail and game play are phenomenal. Its so realistic you feel apart of this ghost hunters story.  Especially if you have the right friends to play with I could be on for hours and never get bored. There's rarely any bugs and overall a 10/10. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good spook once and awhile.

9008,honestly just a really fun game that has honestly made me scream a few times
9009,game has a great idea behind it.... but the ghost will keep appearing the second i walk into the building not even show itself... lights start flickering and ill instantly drop everything and lose all my equiptment.... 5 times a row it happened
9010,"Fun game if you HAVE the requirements... Don't buy it for your shitty 2018 HP laptop you got for your birthday one year,, Get it when you can get an actually good pc or gaming laptop, unless you want to see a glitchy and freezing mess :/"
9011,"Infinite amounts of replayability. Really fun horror investigation game.
Although having played the game for this much time, the game still spooks me sometimes.
The mechanics of this game is absolutely excellently designed, especially the ghosts behavior. :chefskiss:
Definitely wish for more maps though.

Regardless, it's a REALLY GREAT game. Very much recommended.

9075,Quite the Spooky game to play with some homies
9076,its a great game i love playing it with my friends
9077,epic game
9078,"Glorified tech demo. The control system in VR is CRAP and so is the gameplay. Klunky, akward, and slow. Just opening a f*cking door is an exercise in frustration.

I don't get the 'overwhelmingly positive' (??!!) rating for a game so poorly engineered. I guess all these people buying into these 'early access' games have conditioned themselves to have incredibly low expectations. News flash: By paying the publisher before they actually finish developing the game, we're removing their impetus to do so. We're not actually promoting independent content; just mediocrity. Hopefully now I have learned my lesson."
9079,"Good game with friends, just a little buggy but overall good to have some funny moments."
9080,shit fun with a squad
9081,pretty fun with frens but kinda scary when you are alone . It is fun either way so probably 7/10 .. the downside issssss .. it uses unity so you get laggy sometimes :D

9110,it gets dull after a bit
9111,"I really wish there could be more than 4 players. Even if you have to add stipulations or just generally make it harder if more than 4 players are playing.  Otherwise, we love this game! It's so much fun to play together as a family. Even when we swap out players, we can still help guide and give input to help solve each case. I used to be afraid to even walk in a house by myself (couldn't even get through the first step in the tutorial), but now I'm not afraid to die for a ghost picture. LOL"

Other then that its pretty fun. 6/10"
9148," love this game! its good if you like interactive scary games and if your into ghost hunting, the only downside I have had is that i had to restart the game after changing the graphics settings, it might just be caus i have a sh*ty PC but overall awsome game!"
9149,The game is good from the short amount of time I've played and can I suggest adding that if your teammate dies you can talk to them through the spirit box
9150,I AM PUSSY

9183,good
9184,"Extremely immersive - Great use of brightness for flashlights and night vision, unpredictable AI, in-depth lore and over a dozen unique paranormal variants. VOIP sounds really cool and can be used to taunt ghosts. Diverse range of kit that you can purchase or find, with an emphasis on teamwork. Downright scary even with all of the tools you are given."
9185,Really fun when with other friends who are also scared of everything xD
9186,Well the game dont have too much maps with house and tiny maps to play in 2 are big maps that are booring like school or asylum where in 2 its imposible to play because you run 3 sec and you cant run 1 min idk who idiot think thats a good idea in a horror game but ok and the ghost are very booring and repetitive same scenario over and over nothing nou no drawing on the walls or something to see in the uv light nothing or to see ghost walk in the house spoky nope just a booring hunt or not game and graphics same in 2022 its a little booring and i play on ultra 2k resolution yea dont buy it  no worth just to repeat over in over same scenario its very booring trust me and comunity nope you can t play with it too toxic or lots of kids or italians or ruski and they play like .....shit/dont play dont wast the money anyway.

until... when I got into the game.
At first it just feels like a lot of reading and not knowing what to do,
but after that step, it's fun, creepy, 
oh, and I forgot to mention enjoyable to play with friends.
all in all, just a really fun game when you know what to do."

9209,fun game to play
9210,very spooky
9211,Very unique and fun take on horror + like the overall vibe of ghost hunting
9212,"This game really deserves even more recognition than it gets. 

You put 4 random people who DO NOT know each other into a server, and the only way to identify the ghost is to work together. 

That's it. The comedy and horror writes itself from there. Every game feels like a B-Movie ghost story with 4 actors who have no idea what they are doing, but have $5,000 in ghost hunting equipment sitting in an ice cream truck that you park outside of a location with one objective: Find the ghost. You get no clues where the ghost is. Is it cold? Maybe ghost? Guess what? It's snowing. Maybe try the spirit box? No reply. Why are the lights flickering? Oh, the ghost doesn't like voices and is now hell bent on killing your team 3 minutes into a hunt, which only just started because someone sneezed into the spirit box. Hunt over. One guy left. He has no mic. He panics. Door slams. Ghost moans. Mission failed. 

10/10, I would've gladly paid $60 for this game."
9213,nice game
9214,skaree
9215,"THIS GAME IS FUN AND INTERESTING
"
9216,good
9217,good
9218,this is a fun game
9219,l ilke it
9220,It’s hard to play when it only goes for you.I would be hidden and people would be in the open and it would only go for me like walk right pass the people in the open straigt up would ignore everyone accept me
9221,poop'd myself so many times that i no longer own boxers. 10/10 would shit my pants again
9222,I love it when we get freezing and ghost writing and my friends realize that two of the remaining choices are Demon and Revenant.
9223,very good you get to talk with a radeo :)
9224,"So, Lets Get Started:

Story: None, At least None That I Know Of

Graphics: SO HIGH (The Lowest Graphics Option Is Still So Good Looking)

Repeatability: I Could Definitely Play This Game For At least A Year Without Getting Bored, As There's Different Items And Ghosts. And The People You Play With Change It Up. 

Lag: You Would Need A Gaming Laptop or PC, As A Standard Office Laptop Would Never Run This, Sorry.

Horror: The Ghost Talking To You And Controlling Objects Is Always Spooky, They Need To Change The Current Jump scare As Its Not Very Scary Or At Least Add More.

Rating: 7.5/10 :D

9225,"The best game ever created I swear to god very good game

The only game where you can feel the ghost in real life when talking to it in game very good game

Maybe It would be great if it was more expensive"

9227,"Great game with friends. It has a high skill ceiling when it comes to memorising which ghosts have certain traits.

I don't play it alone, it makes my scalp crawl."
9228,Gimme more maps
9229,"Actual name of the game is: Shit In My Pants Simulator / Screaming Simulator. Whatever floats your boat. Pretty fun game, when i'm not getting trapped inside the house at the front door when I was about to leave! :)"
9230,Worth playing with friends. Pro-tip yell the ghosts name over and over again as soon as you get into the house to assert your dominance.
9231,great game multiplayer is annoying for lvl 1 as alot of people will boot you out of their lobbys but once you find someone that good and nice its really fun
9232,"Make your friends buy this game if they've never played it, especially if you're a veteran at it, cannot stop laughing!!!!"
9233,"Horror games do not scare me. There are so many that fit under that umbrella, from Resident Evil to Amnesia, and most hit familiar beats: a few good jump scares, the dread of being pursued, nasty monsters and creepy sound effects. I enjoy all of these experiences, but even when things get intense I'm never really afraid.

Phasmophobia is a game that gets into your head. When you're playing the real world doesn't exist. When you stop, some aspect has seeped into reality. This game has left myself and companions not so much stunned as scrambled, jacked on adrenaline and chatting for hours afterwards about what just happened. 

The best summary of Phasmophobia would be a detective game about ghosts. You play as one of up to four investigators who go into various locations, from roadside houses to an asylum, and try to identify what kind of spirit it is being haunted by, and then leave. Though there's a serious Ghostbusters vibe here there's no actual busting: you're the pre-Ghostbusters, if you like, solely there to work out what kind of threat this is.

To this end you have various pieces of equipment, all simple in utility, stored in a van that acts as the team's command HQ at each location. There's a flashlight, which nearly always occupies one of your three inventory slots (VR players get four slots, which seems a tad unfair). The EMF reader is the PKE meter by another name, a little box that begins to light up in the presence of ghostly activity. A UV flashlight will show up ghostly fingerprints or footprints. A thermometer detects drops in room temperature.

All of this might make the game sound quite basic, like you just run into a house with an EMF reader, find a ghost, and that's job done. Well, try that the first time you play and good luck. Phasmophobia's genius is that this is a game of restraint and subtlety. Detecting the ghosts is always only a matter of time: the real beauty is that this is just the start.

The player character has limits. You can't move fast, you can only carry three items and so, even after working out where a ghost might be, you have to go back into the location multiple times with different equipment. Each type of ghost will (eventually) provide three types of evidence—for example, setting off the EMF at level 5 is one piece of evidence, freezing temperatures are another, and seeing ghost writing would be yet another.  

Here's where things start to get fascinating, terrifying, and even exhilarating. The game makes your initial hunts relatively gentle, then the ghosts move up a notch. They start to notice you faster. They'll start to mess with you. Maybe you temporarily lose track of the team, then hear an unmistakeable breath passing close by one ear. Maybe you even see a silhouette for a second. 

Phasmophobia's ghost will kill you but, more often than not, they will simply freak you and your team out. I've been coy because talking in-detail about a game like this risks ruining some of its best surprises, but I'll give one example.

It was a street house. The maps are three street houses, two farmouses, a school (huge), and an asylum (huge and confusing). This was one my team had handled before, and we quickly identified a child's bedroom upstairs as somewhere the ghost favoured.

I bravely hid in a cupboard. After a minute or two of radio silence, three of us regrouped but one was now dead in the hall. We went to the van, and went back to the child's bedroom with more gear. As we were setting up, the car alarm went off again. My companions went to turn it off, and I stayed to set up the last bits of gear.

I finished, turned and went towards the door, then saw my breath freeze in front of me. I heard my heartbeat, the lights started flashing, and a toddler's silhouette flashed by the corner of my eye. What exactly happened next I'll leave to your imagination, but once dead you can observe and listen-in to your former companions from a blue-lit realm where you can see the ghost but cannot help any further.

Key to Phasmophobia is the sound design: you have to run voice chat through the game itself, and then there's a local chat and a radio chat option. The difference matters because the ghosts can 'hear' you. In fact, some ghosts will speak to you, and even respond to an item called the Spirit Box that allows you to ask questions. 

But the 'hearing' element of the ghosts is so much more than it might seem, because what it seems to do is pick up on the moods of your team. It responds when people are scared and say hasty things like ""let's just get out of here."" I've seen people try to deliberately provoke it, and get absolutely nothing, then two minutes later when they're isolated for a split-second something shoots from the darkness and rips them apart. I cannot tell you what it's like to hide silently for minutes, then hear someone say ""I think it's gone.""

As all of this implies, Phasmophobia's greatness is in the human interactions that it's set up to provoke. It knows that no ghost is ever going to be as scary as the one in your head, and shows real restraint in how it uses small events and subtle clues to build an atmosphere that, at its best/worst, can be absolutely horrifying.

Phasmophobia is an early access game and reflects this: multiplayer works through lobbies, there's a levelling system but no real overarching structure, and it does need the new maps and ghost types which will surely arrive over time. 

But the beating heart of this experience is unlike anything else I've played. The experience depends on camaraderie and communication, as well as a decent smack of bravery, and the ghosts will mess with that combination in ways equally surprising and horrifying. Even when you're experienced, even when that first fear of the unknown has passed, Phasmophobia comes up with shit that'll turn you white."
9234,yes
9235,If you have a VR headset and attempt to play this i'm sure u will die. Great game tho

9246,"I'm still new to the game but I absolutely love it! It's fun to search for ghosts and work together with friends to figure out what type of ghost we are seeing. It's also very fun to use a soundboard and have your friend die because you were playing the WII Sports Menu Theme. I'm excited to see where this game goes. O

Overall, 10/10, no complaints, excited for future!"

9252,"Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film produced by, directed by, and starring Orson Welles. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Herman J. Mankiewicz. The picture was Welles' first feature film. Citizen Kane is widely regarded as the greatest film ever made.[5] For 50 consecutive years, it stood at number 1 in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound decennial poll of critics, and it topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as its 2007 update. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories and it won for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Mankiewicz and Welles. Citizen Kane is praised for Gregg Toland's cinematography, Robert Wise's editing, Bernard Herrmann's music, and its narrative structure, all of which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.

The quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a composite character based on American media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, as well as aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited the film from being mentioned in his newspapers.[6]

After the Broadway success of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast ""The War of the Worlds"" on The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Although it was unusual for an untried director, he was given freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane, collaborating with Herman J. Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940, the same year its innovative trailer was shown, and the film was released in 1941.

Although it was a critical success, Citizen Kane failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but it returned to public attention when it was praised by French critics such as André Bazin and re-released in 1956. In 1958, the film was voted number 9 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Citizen Kane was selected by the Library of Congress as an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[7][8][9]"

9264,"Honestly enjoyed the gameplay, but the amount of hackers recently have made the game unenjoyable.  

When the only line of defense is ""Leave the lobby."" My worry increases.  I have been told from one of the discord admins that the hackers may be able to access my information through the game.  So for the time being I will be uninstalling the game until the security is assured."

9347,Please play this instead of LoL
9348,"Extremely fun to play, best horror game to play with friends, involves a good amount of teamwork and communication while trying your best to stay alive with everyone and figure out what ghost you're dealing with and it's extremely fun with multiple difficulties there are on the game if you feel it's too easy for you and your friends, and with multiple maps increasing the difficulty by itself because depending on the map if it's a smaller map it could be easier to figure out where the ghost is most active and figuring out what kind of ghost it is but making it harder to run away especially if you can't find a hiding spot in time while larger maps make it harder to find where the ghost is most active but making it easier to run away and find more hiding spots so in overall this is an amazing game to play, loads of fun, sorry for writing too much but it's just how much fun I had in this game with my friends with all of the screaming and stupidity we do trying to figure out what ghost we're dealing with and so hope y'all get the same experience with your friends as well."

But then I felt guilty because a friend bought this game for me, so I gave it another shot doing actual gameplay. This game is deceptively fun and definitely freaky if you limit your comms to in-game. It gets more fun the better I get at it."

9411,"I love hunting spooky ghost with frens 
Walk around with a uv light or video camera, photo camera, and emf reader only.

This game is actually really fun and the events they do have been cute.
I will never forget my first round when all my friends died and it was just me. They were all laughing in the spectator mode and I couldn't hear them since we were muted in Discord. They left the crucifix in a drawer and me being new to the game, I didn't know how to pick things up properly or open things because I instantly went into a game with them. They told me the cross would save me from a ghost hunt which is why I wanted it so badly. I had 0 sanity and I was scared panicking trying to grab the cross, my friend threw a cup at me and I scream as if I got stabbed irl. I started laughing hysterically, crying, and almost pissed myself since I was home alone at night in the dark. 10/10 wish I could go back to being new. You're also evil if you prank your friend in spoopy gaem. XD"

9450,"I'm not one for scary games, but this ghost hunting game has my friends and I hooked! I've spent about 50 hours on this game and still have a blast. There are many different ghosts and types of evidence for you to collect, ensuring every game you play feels a little different. My only knock on this game, is the limited number of maps, but I hope they come out with more in the future! Definitely worth purchasing if you and your friends are looking for another game to add to your rotation."

9480,10/10   Literally spent a solid hour tossing balls at a hoop.  Better than any EA Sports game.  would recommend.
9481,"play with friends, have fun."
9482,i think clash of clans is a great game. i love the fact that you can fight with your friends in clan wars. my only problem is it takes too long to upgrade after town hall 8.  i recommend anyone with a coc (clash of clans) get back on there old base. oh and phasmophobia is fun
9483,"Spooky and fun. Pretty novel gameplay style that keeps you interested and uncertain no matter what map you are on. Unfortunately, death is pretty punishing when you are learning how the game works and annoying when you get to higher levels. The game is almost hurt by the money system as it exist now, at least for me. Also, the scares can diminish once you die enough times.

6.5/10"
9484,"it is fun. i like how it is a constant detective game even if you repeat the same map. i would like to be able to read about the ghosts without starting another round to see where i messed up though, but otherwise that is my only issue."
9485,"hahah 6.9 hours (also game is fun idk but idk any of the mechanics)

update game is fun and i now do know the mechanics, some of the people on this game are... strange to say the least but you kinda get used to it"

9499,"Very fun game for the price I got it for on sale. Worth the money and worth the hours you'll spend having fun. There's some various bugs, but it's early access or whatever who cares."
9500,I poop pant tonite. Very nice. My toe is also itching and it is not unitching. It's not funny. I don't know why you are laughing. Now you go poop your pant.

9514,Good game
9515,Well. yeah.
9516,"ihihihi, jørgen died when i stabbed the voodoo doll 5 times"
9517,gud
9518,"I haven't been at this game for over a certain amount of months, and now that I've gotten a better PC, I can finally play it once again, and have fun playing it with my friends that I've waited a very, very long time to play with.

It was, a literal dream to play phasmophobia with my friends, but I just couldn't because of how frequent I would crash, It ruined everything.

But now, I can finally play and enjoy the game! I hope to meet new people along the way and have a good time playing the game.


This game is good and really scary at the same time, you can play this if you feel brave or just out of nowhere feel bored and want to play something to get that filthy boredom out of you.

This game is more better played with friends because it's more fun and you can enjoy it a lot.

However, Multi-player itself, Isn't that good, You get kicked out a lot because you're a low level, even though you could be good use or just be taught stuff to become better at the game, But that doesn't happen often, Sometimes you also get kicked out for being young, Which is sometimes understandable, but sometimes it's just the microphone quality.

Obviously it's still possible to find good Multiplayer lobbies but if you have no friends to play with then it's better to stick with Singeplayer even if gets difficult, Also gets pretty fun.

Everything about this game, the interactions, ghost events and hunts, are really good to give someone a quick spook, Especially the cursed items that sometimes make the game easier, but most of the time just gets you killed.

I would recommend this game to everyone that are interested in horror games, because this game is the exact thing you might be lookin' for."
9519,"super fun to play, i would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a sense of humor, and like problem solving games. Its not that scary, only at times you may shit your pants, but its a blast with friends, definitely check it out!!"
9520,fun with friends and spooooooooooooooky
9521,W game
9522,yis yis bery gut mr lav it veri much i will pee bcus if not me will piss on bed
9523,"This game builds tension like no other. New players are able to dive into an unknown and terrifying experience, while experienced players suit up for another dangerous case. The game never loses its sense of fear even for the most experienced players in the world. Grab some friends if you can because it makes the experience just slightly less spooky."
9524,Samantha Winters ripped my anus in two
9525,"Scary for the first house, the novelty wears off after that but it's worth buying and playing for a scare/laugh."
9526,scared my nuts off
9527,best game ever
9528,It seems awful scary at first.After 30 hours of play it's really cool <3: 3
9529,"Awesome horror game, i have enjoyed many hours of it even on my alt account. It is being maintanted a lot, updates are coming frequently and that makes this game to live little bit longer, if you love horror games like me, just buy it, you wont regret it."
9530,"Honestly pretty mediocre game, great idea, executed decently. But it is very fun and entertaining, I prefer to play in VR if you have a VR headset I would recommend this game, it (in my opinion) is not very scary but just fun."
9531,very good
9532,If you're looking for a horror game to play with your friends then I recommend picking up Phasmophobia! It's super fun and easy to get into!
9533,This game has some small bugs but those bugs can really make the game amazing. just last night my friend and i were able to get items for free and mess around while looking for the type of ghost.
9534,good game
9535,"Very good. The gameplay is amazing and very fun with friends. didnt know a game about stacking spray paint could be so fun! i recomend not doing the glitch where it makes you teleport to a spooky place as those maps are probably not finished. My record is 9 cans and 5 twice on the table
"

9574,"Game is funny, but yet at the same time thrilling. Getting spooked with your friends is a great time all around."
9575,very good
9576,"Phasmophobia is completely void of any character or fear factor. When first playing the game, the period of discovery and intrigue that comes with figuring out the ghost identification mechanics was quite fun but the game completely falls off after like 15 hours. There is simply no replay value for me, you load into a map then complete a set of chores. That's it, it's all there is to the game. There are genuinely no actual scares or threatening occurrences and the game hardly plays with the fact your hunting ghosts to scare you at all. Because of this, the game completely hinges on its gameplay to provide any entertainment value at all, and it's simply just not there. Map design specifically is awful, playing on any map above small is tedious, because it never changes ghost behaviour, it doesn't create a more involved experience like a larger map should, it literally makes you trudge through more rooms in order to find the one specific one the ghost is in. It's the only discernible gameplay difference between the small maps and the larger ones, and it doesn't offer a more in depth gameplay experience for those interested in what Phasmophobia has to offer, it simply makes you spend more time walking through uninhabited rooms and less time actually engaging with the game's main ghost identification mechanics (which aren't particularly fun themselves when you never feel any real danger or intimidation from any of the game's weak attempts at horror. To be frank: I don't even really hate Phasmophobia. It's fun for like... Two games. But for some reason this game has overwhelmingly positive review. Nearly everyone I know praises this game endlessly, it has a reputation online for being terrifying, and I just don't get it. It doesn't properly explore the idea of ghost hunting in an interesting or scary way (in my opinion, of course). Not to mention that presentation wise, the game is incredibly bland. I understand It's early access but this game really needs a face lift, it has really stiff animations (first person ones included), in terms of visual aesthetic the map's look like they could be from any indie horror game put together in unity and put on itch.io for free, same could be said for the majority of the ui (though I admit the journal is cool and feels neat in VR). I dunno, when compared to other contemporary co-op horror experiences like Devour, the game generally is quite boring to look at. It really does lack character. I hope through the continued support from the developers, Phasmophobia can become a more interesting horror experience. I'm still going to keep an eye on it: a ghost hunting game like this is a particularly unique idea that, given more time, could be explored much more thoroughly. Personally I'd just wait for this one to come out of early access, but who knows, you might enjoy it. I'm clearly in the minority here, everyone else seems to really love this game.

As it stands, you can experience everything the game has to offer in like 3 hours."
9577,Creep horror game fr no cap
9578,hi
9579,"This game can sometimes be the definition of fear, but when you sprint into a house with Dream Speedrun music blasting your team's ears out, it can get kinda silly. I've had countless moments with my friends in this game. The only down side is I'm running out of storage on my hard drive from all the clips I've taken XD"
9580,Genuinely a game I would buy every time given the option.

9640,"Something about this game keeps drawing me back in. Weather running with friends, or solo running, I always get addicted again."
9641,This game is a perfect horror game. I got mini heart attacks when a ghost hunt/event occurs. I do recommend it even if it is £9.34 as a discount. It's a decent game to play with friends but also hard to figure out the ghost.

9657," Do you like games that make you want to scream and stay up late thinking your not alone in your house.
 Well Phasmophobia's  the game for you its got all the spooks and scare's you'll need for two life time's turn 

     things in this game that will make you're pants brown 

       1. Being in the house alone because you playing solo or your teammate's like to camp the van.
 And you hear the front door slam shut your teammates are yelling get out over and over. You hear foot steps you try to hide but there's no hiding spot in sight.
    
    2. Getting hunted for the first time.

    3.  playing VR game mode for the first time and it being your first time playing.
   
    4.  death scene.

        ( Trash review im not good at this stuff )"

9660,"I absolutely love this game, if I'm to be honest. Besides the fact that I needed a horror game that was actually cooperative, the way that this actually sucks you in is surprisingly good. 
Sure, the graphics aren't perfect, and there are some glitches here and there, but in a way I feel like this adds to the strange nature of Phasmophobia as a whole. I love freaking my friends out with it. (It's hilarious to play with people that get scared easily.)
This game actually freaks me out here and there, too. I'm so excited to try it in VR."

9705,I've never been one for horror games because I am a whimp. This game hasn't changed my whimpiness but has cured my dislike of the horror games. I love that this game isn't about being scarred it's about trying to get scared the least amount. It's the best to play with some friends and the whole dective work aspect is gold.

9717,HELL YES i love the game really gave me goosebumps playing alone for 7 hour so addicting 10-10 for me. WOULD RECOMMEND.
9718,"So, I've loved ghost hunting shows for ages now. There's something about the adrenaline rush that makes me really feel alive. This game is the perfect replacement for the real thing, because I am not looking to get haunted for real. 

It's just scary enough to where you get that fun fright, but not so scary that you can't sleep (at least for me). The ONLY thing I would complain about is the fact that I think you can only have up to 4 people playing at a time. Only because, at times, I would need one additional spot. Other than that, it's a ton of fun. Highly recommend if you want a fun game to play with your friends when you're looking to get a little spooked."

9726,"Every house you go to is a different experience. You never know what the game is going to be like, what challenges you will face, and what will happen. It's a really neat game for those who love to be scared, love investigating, and having fun."
9727,"Pretty good. One complaint is only one person in every friend group goes in. It's always me. I end up wasting money just to die, and then my friends guess wrong. That's the worst part. The best part is hard carrying though, and it feels so nice when you finish.
Asking if you found this relatable, because I've seen it with almost everyone.
Don't say that you are just comms, it's an excuse, you are just scared."

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it

It honestly caught me off-guard. The graphics are actually pretty good, even if you're running on a decent laptop like I am.
---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't
The game has lots of things to learn and figure out and it's really refreshing. There are flashlights,
---{ Audio }---

☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf
It's audio ig
---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma
If you scour the reviews hard enough you'll see a review of a father saying he was able to spend time with his kid because of this game. Broke my heart and then put it back together before stabbing it and using love to stitch it back up.
---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
I'm currently running on an i3-11th Gen for my CPU and an Intel UHD integrated card for my GPU, however, I was able to run the game very smoothly in singleplayer as long as I wasn't doing anything to stress my CPU, like opening a bunch of tabs in my browser.
---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☑ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
When you first start, you're thrown into a van with, hopefully, equipment on the left side of the van. On the right side there's a whiteboard with tasks and near the exit of the van a sanity graph. You can use certain tools like an emf reader or the thermometer to figure out what kind of ghost you're dealing with, which is another topic. Phasmophobia [i]does[/i] have voice-recognition which will be something you have to keep in mind. You can say phrases to possible provoke the entity you're dealing with, which is quite fun and new.
---{ Grind }---
☑ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
It's more of a ""well if you really want this ig do some missions to get cash for it"" kind of grind. There isn't really a specific grind that the game requires which is nice.
---{ Story }---
☑ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
There isn't an overarching lore that you have to worry about or watch a 2 hour long YouTube video to understand what's going on. You simply hunt ghosts.
---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
There are lots and lots of different ghosts and they've added tons more since I last played. This game continues to grow and will continue to add more ghosts and if you have a mission of finding every ghost, then good luck.
---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☑ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
This game is definitely worth the price (at least as I'm writing), and to be frank, I recommend buying it now more than ever. 100% money well-spent.
---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
Don't get me wrong, I'd be lying to you if I said the game had no bugs, however, they're bearable.
---{ ? / 10 }---

☐ 9

Solid game, definitely recommend getting it if you have any spare cash as-well. Don't let the bugs scare you away, the only deal-breaker I ever experienced was the game crashing while trying to play multiplayer, which happened and still tends to happen a lot, but that can't really be considered a bug. Anyways, peace.

It does not seem to rely on jump scares which was a huge plus for me because if you can be scary without relying on jump scaring then I feel like you're doing it right.

9894,"Game is slowly losing its atmosphere it once had, maybe it was us learning how to play and being terrified by everything, now this game lays dormant and is completely RNG if the ghost wants to interact with your or said world. But tarot card roulette is fun"

9910,"So I played the tutorial, knowing full-well that I was safe from ghost attacks until a certain phase.  I walked into the spooky house, heard a door creak open, and spun around.  The flashlight was in my hand  and I was able to swing it around to see what was there, and scared myself by casting shadows.  Quit on the spot and have been too scared to launch a real game ever since.  10/10, great immersion."
9911,This game fucking rules
9912,felt so real that the engine in my room fell and then there was freezing temps :/
9913,This game is so much fun!! I love being able to play solo or with people. This was my first PC Game in over 20 years and I am hooked in PC gaming again. This game doesn't get dull and I keep on learning!!

But the game is super intuitive and very fun to play with your friends. I played this on VR once and it's 10 times as scary. If you like horror games, this is a must try with your friends."

10024,"This game saved my life.

I am 36.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.

Variety of challenge levels and location provide for a customizable experience that keeps us coming back to play again and again. Especially love the voice recognition and vocal locality trait."
10029,i like da gamez alotz
10030,legal
10031,"a really fun game to play, a bit difficult to get started as a new player like i did but once you know what tools do what it gets alot easier. i wouldnt recommend for people who get vivid nightmares but its not a terrifying game. I was reluctant to try it out at 1st cuz i have a vivid immagination, but i soon found that its not to scary and i have been enjoying it alot."
10032,I guess it has something to do with ghosts? I wouldn't know because I watch the cameras.
10033,Got a couple hours in the game addicting with friends. Scare good game fun yes yes.
10034,"GOOD BUT I ALWAYS FALSE TO GUESS THE GHOST.

10035,great game
10036,i like it good ig
10037,NIce horror game and fun to play with friends :D
10038,NICE GAME
10039,"Very spooky

made me fard and shid pant"
10040,"Take zero to three friends (or strangers) with you to a steadily increasing variety of houses (and a campground!) and try to find out which of the steadily increasing types of ghosts is haunting it and murdering the inhabitants.

Honestly speaking, the world needs more spooky games that don't mash the jump scare button until it's broken, so this is a breath of fresh air. And by breath of fresh air, I mean incoherent screaming because our not-so-friendly neighbourhood ghost knocked over a mug like your typical cat. The update to the spirit box made me swear off the tool forever. That's what my friends are for.

In minus points, smudge sticks. Might need to be careful about your usage of native practices. And not all of the entities the game calls ghosts are actually ghosts if you look into their original lore.

That being said, Early Access so Things Are Yet To Come, excellent proximity chat, very solid voice recognition, and enjoyable gameplay."
10041,The game is good but it kicks me out every time i get to 90% on singleplayer
10042,I pooped my pants as well
10043,Alex is a ******
10044,good game fun good community love it
10045,The game is cool and kinda horror when the hunt starts so i recommend this game who wants something NEW in their gaming life.

10070,"Idk they removed australian servers for a while, made me not cum :( too scwary"
10071,"If you love ghost hunting shows like Ghost Adventures you'll love this game. Collect evidence to figure out what kind of spirit is haunting the location, sounds simple right? That is until the ghost shows up, starts playing with lights and slamming doors in your face. Can be played solo but is much more fun with a friend. I've had many good scares over my playtime, though don't expect every mission to be terror inducing."
10072,"very interesting game to play with your friends, i will recommend it."
10073,im only commenting so i have the early access tag on my review. theres nothing special i gain from it other than knowing i was here before the game's full release. yay im so happy... :(

10103,LOVE THIS GAME
10104,"Pissed my pants around 7 different times while playing this game. Very Fun, but I need new pairs of pants..

Game's great and real spooky, love the different types of ghosts there are, ghost models are just as scary and very fitting.
Even better and funnier with friends, seriously dude love the times with my friends!

I remember one time when I was in the closet during a hunt, and I turned on the light and saw the ghost crawling on all fours walking away from me and somehow not seeing me but hey, the hunt ended right then and there.

Another time I remember when my friend wanted to prevent a hunt by using me in the basement with a ghost named Karen. It didn't work at all and well.. I died to her because she turned the lights out and she started hunting and I unfortunately couldn't tell. But luckily i didn't lose anything because I already put all my stuff in the truck.

I would love to talk about the great stories of my adventures in Phasmophobia but I'm sure I made this review long enough so.. I highly recommend this game especially if you got friends who also have this game and do some ghost hunting. Bring a soundboard too, the ghosts will love it! Trust me!"

10148,very fun. much better with friends
10149,FUN GAME but onryo fuck him dosen't hunt us
10150,good
10151,"the most fun, stupidly scary game around. Def  the monopoly of the ghost hunting co-op games"
10152,amazing game to play with friends
10153,good
10154,"aint too spooky a lil fun doe
"
10155,"Me and my boy Pringles have enjoyed many days on this game, lots of hot driven sweaty ghost contacts, my bunghole has been very tight and i have been concerned for my well being. i also have considered seeing my therapist. Great game."
10156,"as a bisexual, i love getting the living day scared out of me"
10157,Spooky
10158,Very interactive and love the team work in the game online.
10159,Its a fun game to play with your close friends. I was actually gifted it as incentive to play. The game is also being updated frequently to keep up with its users wants and needs. Sit back have a drink and a laugh... or a scream.
10160,funny close door on friends and listen to them die
10161,"I absolutely love this game! My family and I are always getting closer by ghost hunting together. We have had some real spooks and laughs. The only thing I would ask from the game creators is to add more unpredictableness (can this be a word)? I'm clocking about 100+ hours now and seeing the same full-bodied apparitions is becoming less scary and more routine. How about an unexpected whisper in the air to ""leave"" or a random shadow on the wall appearing for such a short time you weren't sure if you imagined it or not? Or perhaps even a glance of a figure in the mirror as you cross by it or random screams or crashes? New spirit box voices and more options of questions? It's the little things that I think we are missing here that would add to the whole spooky experience. I think it would make it more realistic, or at least as realistic as a ghost-hunting game can get!  I also can't wait to see Steam achievements become available for the game."

10193,scary ass
10194,Great game. Took the pills and my friends went away though :(
10195,"As much as I want to make this a joke comment about how the physics in this game works, I'll give it a proper review here.

Phasmophobia is a great 4 player investigation game that requires teamwork and cooperation in order to get the job done without any players left behind. I'll save you from the game summary, I'm sure you've seen a video on this game by now, so instead I'll jump straight into the opinions.

The idea behind this game is actually quite unique. I'm surprised I've never found a ghost identification game before, granted we mainly think of blasting them with lasers, or sucking them up with a vacuum. Being able to play with 4 people really changes the feel of them game, and is a catalyst for a surprising amount of fun memories. The game also has consistent production on it, making it able to be picked up and played as you please and still be able to play with new features. Now, it isn't updated daily per say, but every two or three months we get a pretty big update, the latest being known as the ""VR Overhaul"" update. I'm excited to see how this game grows and becomes stellar one day. 

Every game has its flaws, though granted this is what makes Phasmophobia Phasmophobia. The physics engine is notoriously buggy, allowing you to unhinge doors and sometimes find them missing when loading the map, only to find them floating outside. Biggest nit pick is it's genre. Technically speaking, this is a horror game. However, the fact you have 3 people experiencing everything with you at the same time, it very quickly loses that genre as it moves from ""scary"" to ""mildly stressed"". It still has plenty of frights your first few go-arounds, but after that it just becomes boring or comedic. I think it should be used as an introduction to new horror players personally. Ah, tangent, sorry. Where was I? Oh yeah. Breaking this door.

In the end, it's price is super worth it, especially if you can convince a group of friends to play with you. Even if you don't there are plenty of public lobbies for you to join as well! Worried about what you'll find online? They have a discord that has a large base of players looking for someone to join them! And if you want to be more horrified with nothing more than you and the ghost, there is a single player option too! Phasmophobia's got it all, and I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants the rush of being chased by a ghost, the IQ required to track the ghost down, and who wants to maybe not ruin a friendship over a video game for once. (Disclaimer: Friendship breaking results may vary. Play responsibly.)

And alright fine, door go brrrrrrr"
10196,scawey
10197,spooky
10198,Its a game ig

10218,HORR GAM
10219,"If you like some jump scares and being able to hunt down ghosts with some friends, or even alone, this is a game for you. Phasmophobia is a great deal of fun and glitches that you get to experience with your friends. Along with being able to cooperate with your friends to find out what ghost type you're dealing with, or even you can join some public lobbies and make some more friends. Overall it is a really fun game that if you have $14.00 and want to try this out, I'd say it is worth it. Good luck to you all if you decide to get this great game!"
10220,"This game is so fun, i be laughin for hours!"

10242,"game needs a lot of work still but the skeleton of it could be a good game one day. sometimes the ghost literally wont do anything for 30 min. you also start off with zero money or items that are needed to complete the objectives it gives you. being on a bigger map doesnt really add difficulty, it just makes finding the one room where the ghost lives take longer. the rest of the map doesnt even get used. you also cant kill the ghost, you just drive away after it killed half your friends and thats supposed to be a victory?"
10243,Very Very niceeee
10244,"Amazing ghost hunting game, extremely fun with friends. I enjoyed and still enjoy this game a lot. 10/10"

10260,"Awesome for jump scares even after 30 hours in, playing solo is obviously the scariest mode to play but the multiplayer is also good. The lobby system is probably the only thing letting this game down, you either join the EU servers which is mainly full of Russian speaking lobbies or you join the US ones which are limited with the time difference, I just wish there was an option for filtering out the lobbies based on language."
10261,Fun game!
10262,meiras
10263,"Upon being convicted about my actions I have been prompted to alter my review, this game is very good i enjoy it very much"
10264,"My nan internally combusted a while ago. I could have appeared at her funeral, but instead I appeared at the doorsteps of Brownstone high school. we found out it was a demon, which gave me the idea that maybe this ghost was my nan, as she was one too, just in a different circumstance. she was a demon when it came to raw dogging. anyway, great game, 10/10, helps you get over relatives deaths and the good times you had with them, even the pleasurable times."
10265,"Nice game, played for a long time. but it would be much and much better if there were exctual jumpscare's like a face popping on your screen when you die and that kind of stuff, it would make the game so so so much better, jumpscares are the only good thing missing to the game."
10266,обосраться можно
10267,I have played a lot of horror games but have never had a game give me chills like this game did
10268,ahh scaRY
10269,its fun
10270,"Are you here?
Are you close?
Are you support LGBT+?
Are you gay?"
10271,"BIG SCARY , very big scary"
10272,"Had 40 hours and was more ""ahhh spooky"" but honestly its the money system that makes me more scared of dying than the ghost itself. I just don't want to have 6 perfect nightmare rounds to make up for one death. But anyways it's positive anyways I've had a great time playing for ten hours straight yesterday and then six today, I can just hear EMF after the game closed. Sounds like EMF 4..."
10273,"Great game, we bullied and called a ghost names until it gave up. It killed all 4 of us at once."
10274,would not recommend if you shit your pants at dora the explorer
10275,fun
10276,"i is a great game to play with friends, not just a horror but a comedy when you have them"

In all seriousness, good game. Get if you have spare cash.
Haven't experienced the game with randoms, so I can't give my two cents on how that feels."

10300,"phamsophobia :thubm:
=D"
10301,told the ghost to suck my dick and it killed me
10302,its good
10303,"Yeah, so me and my cousin got this game cause I saw people I knew playing it. We knew it was a scary game. When we loaded in we didn't know what to do at first so we screwed with each other closing doors, etc. . . Then we loaded into an ""easy"" mission we got the Moroi spirit, and lets just say wow. We were in a kitchen looking around when all of a sudden he see's a figure dash into the room and stand on the other side of the kitchen island. I didn't see it at first but when I did let's just say I had to change my shorts. Plus in the lobby, the garage there is also a jump scare which also scared me. So this game does a very good job in being scary, 10/10 would play again, but with other people, with two it's scary af. Also don't play in the dark unless you're built different."
10304,"This game is super fun to play with friends, and is a really fun scary experience. Phasmophobia is a game about hunting ghosts, but it isn't something like the ghost busters. Ghost busters can defend themselves. But in Phasmophobia, you only have to discover the type of ghost using evidence and gadgets you can buy. If the ghost starts hunting you, you just have to hide and hope for the best. Another thing I like about the game, is that they do not rely on cheap jumpscares to make you scared. Instead, the horror is in the tons of creepy/scary things the ghost does and the feeling of the darkness and being alone. The horror when I'm sitting in a corner with my friend's corpse on the floor 5 feet away from me, my emf reader blaring, hearing footsteps and floorboards creek as the ghost searches for me, is amazing. The game's graphics are quiete decent and I'm really exited to see what they do with it in the future."
10305,"This game is balanced.

Not Too Scary so that the Faint-Heart can play.
Scary enough to put you on the edge."
10306,"Overall a great game.
Pros:
Very good immersion
Good Jump scares 
Non toxic community, most people you play with work as a team
good variety of items 

Cons
Some things are buggy but the developers keep the community in the loop and try to make updates frequent 
nothing i can really say that is bad about the game the feel and game play is very good 



I do hope in the future we see and get a better variety of maps, i would also like to see some steps we could take to exercise ghosts from the area or something along the lines of it, the difficulty is great though and a fun challenge 
I do think if you like ghost hunting games you will really like this 10/10 for me
"
10307,"this game is fun, the ghost be cool asf nigga!!!!!!!"
10308,I'm loving it badababada
10309,im homosexual!
10310,Game gives me a boner its so good
10311,if you're looking for a game about hunting ghosts this is about as good as it gets
10312,scary fun
10313,good game we love getting scared
10314,"scary at first
easy at second

10315,Very overrated and overhyped game. I do not recommend unless you can get it at a huge discount.
10316,"One of the greatest friend experiences ever and even if you're solo this game is still a 10/10 experience. It is a bit confusing at first but learning how to play is the fun part.

10323,its fun
10324,LITERALLY GHOST HUNTING WITH FRIENDS. If you got friends do yourself a favor and tell them to get this game with you.
10325,Amazing game. I already played 43 (*102) hours and I've only had it for about a month. I would play it with 3-4 but 2 player can still be enjoyable. Also VR mode is funner and scarier so I would not play single player in VR. But it's worth the price and the future seems promising!
10326,its good for hitting the griddy in
10327,Definitely worth the buy. More fun with a full group of 4 but great fun regardless.

10371,amazballs!!! Only thing is wish you can have a little bit more players in a lobby instead of just four! But other than that i fricken love the game!!!
10372,"I love this game. I hate being scared, so the fact I enjoy this so much shows how well they've made this game. I do wish there were more maps, as an hour of playing can quickly exhaust your options if you don't like the massive maps. We've encountered a few bugs but none so often / inconvenient to deter us from playing. The constant overhauls are amazing, and the cursed objects are really cool in their different mechanics. Can't wait to see what they do next!"
10373,fun.

10380,"EDIT: I run this on lowest settings with NO dedicated GPU, just an APU and it runs fine. :)

This game was gifted to me by a generous friend

Its not SCARY, but if you're skittish/have low blood sugar/sleepy you might be easily startled.
Mostly a walking sim; the uneasiness is a simple, relaxing kind. Can co-op with up to 4 players.
""Guess Who"" but 3D and interactive where you deduce what type of apparition you're dealing with based on its behavior. Nothing too impressive happens. Very chill game.

VR might provide a spooky scariness the desktop version doesn't."
10381,"One of the greatest co-op horror games ever, truly a masterpiece, ghost huntin is better with homies"

10392,"I really like the premise of the game and the diversity of ghosts to be found. The tools are cool, and the VR version is great! The only thing I don't like is how underwhelming death is after the first few times it happens. The death animation is the same for every type of ghost. Since there's 24 different types of ghosts, I wish there was at least a few different deaths, if not an individual one for every ghost. Overall, a good game. I'd recommend it."
10393, my friend shits his pants while he plays this game;)

10403,this game is vary fun if you like psychological horror it like to play with your mind man
10404,this game is fun but they need to upgrade more. all i hate about this game is that they focus on one thing at a time like truck overhaul was a little much but really cool i wish they had more updates to this game

10422,"Pretty great game.  As with every other game there are a few issues in terms of bugs (ghosts killing you through walls to name the most annoying one but a couple other very minor things), and a bit with difficulty scaling (my friends and I can breeze through 95% of Professional games but Nightmare is a solid 10%).  On that, I hope they plan to add something between the two difficulties.  Otherwise, definitely a solid pickup."
10423,"nice game 
"
10424,I highly recommended this game if you wanna get scared and have 4 people play at the same time. Very fun and intense game.
10425,"Good i have a Dog in my locker and my wife is staying outside and my daughter is in the ceiling Good game
"
10426,i mean its alright overrated in my opinion but aye yk what tho thats typically how the bs goes
10427,ghost go boo
10428,"hello Phasmophobia developers the game is cool but there are some drawbacks the first drawback is that in single player mode when you summon a ghost in the summoning circle the ghost instantly attacks you
I also have two ideas, the first idea is to make all the ghosts even scarier, namely, they start attacking just like in the trailer, namely, when the player wants to leave the house, the ghost closes the door at the entrance with a 5% or 10% chance and starts attacking, this will add a more scary atmosphere to the game and will balance
The second idea is that the spirit of the deceased player can turn on and off the lights in the rooms"
10429,"The interest of the game depends on the initiative of loyal players, unfortunately these are not always found, so you have to take everything into your own hands to spend time with pleasure."
10430,"Most ghosts sound like they need to quit smoking, like damn imma try to hide and the bitch breathing down my neck."
10431,"great
"
10432,sharted a few times but its pretty fun
10433,"Teammates left me in a room, saw a scary child running at me and disappear, spent the next five minutes sitting in a corner with a crucifix. After five minutes. I asked where the ghost is. It said ""close"". I asked what did it want me to do. It said ""die"". I screamed so loud and ran. I saw the exit.....the doors closed. Then I heard a croak and got strangled to death. Friends took a picture of my dead body and made $15. Highly recommend. Its fun to play with friends."
10434,"people with no push to talk on ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"""
10435,Fun game to play with friends
10436,"* You will spent most of your time finding the room that will match for you.
* Public players will kick you 100% of all time if you are newbie.
* After you got kicked, you will then spend some time selecting server region because of bad UI design, which sometimes always be ""CustomAuthenticationError""
* When playing in VR, the longer you stayed, the lagger it gets.
 * Very toxic public rooms.

IF YOU ARE NEW, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME

10446,Great game
10447,Good game for black men cuz you can hide in the shadows.
10448,"Phasmophobia is the most fun I've ever had with a horror game. It's definitely not for you if you want an immersive story like Amnesia or something like Resident Evil or Silent Hill, etc. This game is a multiplayer-centric game played in randomized sessions in different houses (or sometimes schools, asylums, campgrounds etc.)

The ghost can be one of many different types, chosen at random, and it is your goal to try and determine what kind of ghost it is without dying, by using various tools to gather evidence and listening/tracking the ghost's location, while also having to hide at times when a ""hunt"" begins. The game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. If you've got a group of friends all ready for some virtual ghost-hunting, the Phasmophobia experience can't be beaten."
10449,A relaxing game about the real estate business
10450,"ghost told me i was pretty, great game"
10451,Love it!
10452,One of the best Multiplayer Horror Game for sure
10453,"TL;DR: Great horror/scary ghost hunting game. Still in Early Access but regularly updated. Worth my money.

Great game of investigation. Gather 2 to 3 hints to find out what type of ghost you are dealing with. With the ghost behaviour and by elimination of evidences, you can get by with only two to identify the ghost by guessing. But be careful, because the ghost could start a hunt to kill you (very scary btw). Very atmospheric, especially in VR (i rarely play desktop), VR is the way to play the game imo. If you have friends to play with, the better but there is a lot of public lobbies so you can find a group to undertake the medium and larger size maps easily. The devs are very active on updating their game, which is good. The game can seem a bit repetitive, having few small maps, a couple of med and one large, BUT the room which the ghost haunt and the hiding places to survive hunting phases change with each contracts. Looking for them at the start of the investigation is good practice. All in all, i am glad i bought the game, for the price tag, it is a no brainer if you are looking for a scary game of ghost hunting. 

Oh, also some would say that Ghost Excorsism Inc. is better than Phasmo. For having both, the big difference between the two games is that in Exorcism Inc., the ghost is like always in a hunting phase but is easily warded off with ghost defence items or simply by running to the Camping Car. In phasmo, it is very difficult to ward off the ghost in a hunting phase (i think only the smudge sticks are of any help) and the ghost locks up the entrances to the house, forcing you to hide and pray for the best to save your life. Choose your poison lol!

Also, take Pictures!! Ghost writings in the book, foot or hand prints, Ouija boards, cursed objects, even friends dead bodies. That is where you can make a lot of extra money in a contract.

 And don't forget to picture the bone evidence in each map and to take it. Easy money there.

"
10454,"This game, despite having a very repetitive gameplay loop, is just as fun each and every time you play it. It is wonderful for newcomers as well, since there are 24 ghosts, and more coming evetually, there are so many things you can see and learn on your first 5, 10, even 20 missions. The mechanics feel so fleshed out despite this game being early access, and the idea of a ghost hunting game where you can use your own microphone to ask questions or just coax the ghost out of hiding is genius. Definitely reccomend."

10508,"Honestly the most realistic dating simulator I've ever played.  It can take awhile to find who you're looking for, but once you find him or her its easy to get to know them.  Talking to them can be a drain after awhile, but they appreciate it by opening doors for you and even tossing things your way!

I've had some of them playfully whisper to me that they're behind me and follow me all over the place!  Truly a fun filled time for both parties!  Although like any date, it's wise not to overstay your welcome.  The most realistic part of this dating simulator?  Once you leave, you probably will never see that same person again!  Always someone new to experience on the other side of the door!

10527,"I love this game, and I don't even like most horror games!

This is a game that is best enjoyed with the lights turned way down, the volume turned way up and always in short bursts. I've found that after a few dozen rounds, I become desensitized to the scariness - so it's good to take long breaks. 

The game itself can be quite challenging, even when you understand the basics pretty well. Players have to deduce what type of ghost is haunting various spooky properties; often this is done by antagonizing the spirits in various ways and tracking their reactions. Coordinating with your teammates is key, especially on the tougher settings and larger maps!

I did not play this in VR, but based on what I've heard, playing in VR is a completely different and more terrifying experience!"
10528,"Wonderful game, very well made. Does not over do it with the jump scares. I recommend this game for any one who loves detective style games and also horror. Play solo for a creepier time or play with friends to watch them get freaked out by the little things. Cant wait for the new update."

10555,This game is so fun and well made. it's so much more scary with out friends by the way
10556,Terrible game design. How much YouTube do the devs expect us to have to watch to learn to play this?
10557,Me and my wife saw a video of markiplier on youtube playing this game and me and her loved the dynamic this game has. we both can whole heartedly say that we both love this game and the teamwork it requires.
10558,"A good game COMPLETELY screwed by terrible player controls:

1:This game highly rely on the player having a mic to communicate with your team and talk to the ghost. There are no chat box that you can type into. About %60 of the public rooms of this game are filled with like 10yo kids, crying and trolling or yelling over the mic once they join your room. Personally think this is the WORST part of the game because you can't expect what creatures are in your room,

2:Player kicking permission is completely GONE as soon as you start the game. Yes, that means not host-kicking, not vote-kicking and no ""report"" function. This game does require every player that is ALIVE to be inside the van(Spawn) to be able to end the game. Even the host can't leave everybody being ready. That means if anyone decided to afk outside the van(and not inside the hunted house which is where players can only be killed), everyone else's work is just wasted. Regardless of how many evidence you found, or how hard you try to find the ghost type, you must abandon the game without any reward. Or, stay inside with that afk forever. 

3:Game rooms are divided into ""private"" and ""public"" rooms. You can only invite your friends in private room which means no random people can join your room.  If you have 2 friends and are interested in playing a harder difficulties mode with 4 person to secure win, you can't do that with strangers. In the other hand, creating a public game will only allow strangers to join where you can't invite your friends."

10617,"Phasmophobia, the game that has changed everything for me. A game that introduced a new type of game that I love dearly. I have made so many new friends because of this game. But enough about me, onto the review!

This game brings so many things to the table, and plenty more to come. I got this when it was just 1 dev, and he did a great job. Now with a bigger team, they have changed this game completely with new content, maps, and are currently remaking Asylum, new main menu area, UI and ranks. Horror 2.0 soon to come and plenty of new maps and remakes to come as well. (hopefully) There are a good few bugs in this game, most being for the VR side, the bugs make the game an absolute blast sometimes!

With my current hours being at 509 hours, I can say that the jump scares are predicable a bit if you pay attention, but it can still give casual players a good fright! It is a good game to just absolutely chill and possibly drink with friends.

As this is a very small review, I highly suggest this game, on sale or not. I have high hopes for the future of this game and community!"

10639,"A great game for fans who enjoy investigation games with a horror aspect. There are some really cool elements to the game, but it does take awhile to learn the ropes for how to use each item. I haven't tried the single player aspect of the game, but it's a great multiplayer game for all your friends and even better when you use the in-game chat versus discord so you can get the full thrill. The graphics aren't the absolute best and if you are playing via wifi you will have to adjust your settings to enjoy the game better. Overall would recommend."
10640,"Good horror game, Love the ghosts, Fav ghost is ""The Mimic"" best ghost, 10/10, had a creepy ghost in a boys bedroom who was 68,"
10641,"get it with friends, it good"
10642,"Phasmophobia is not a perfect game by all means, but god damn is it pretty good and fun to play with friends, as a fan of the paranormal it captures the spooky essence well, lots of funny moments with friends.

 DONT go into this game if you are expecting something REALLY scary because to be honest the best moments of this game arent usually the scary ones.

 but dont get me wrong there are certain spooky parts I enjoy a lot, overall very great would recommend with friends."
10643,"Incredible potential but still a work in progress. The game is something completely new unlike anything I've played before. It is one of the few horror games to genuinely build tension and deliver scares and the mechanics can force players into tense decisions about whether it is worth the risk to return to the house to find that last piece of evidence or if your sanity is so low you might be attacked the second you set foot in the door.

The evidence gathering manages to be fun while still being similar from round to round and each mechanic does a good job of immersing the player in the game. At first nothing is creepier than getting a ghost to respond to you on spirit box saying he is right behind you.

However the imersion of the gameplay begins to wane after the first few levels acheived and the once imposing ghosts become more of a nuisance than a threat barring RNG giving you the 1 in 12 chance of picking the most dangerous ghost type. I hope more work can be done on this game to preserve the experience I had on my first hunt as a greenhorn ghost hunter unsure if any second an otherworldly being could end my existence. Perhaps more varied goals or unpredictable hunting behavior would force methodical veteran hunters to take risks or face the uncertainty that terrifies you when first playing this game.

Even after hours of play the game still delivers terror, suspense and jump scares that will catch you out every time.

I have also noticed that the game loads slower while playing VR but not by much so it's not game breaking. Campsite has been the only map to crash on me in VR but only after I died. All other maps work fine and I'm sure they will patch any other problems."

10712,Best horror game out there!!
10713,hell yeah
10714,"Best played with friends. The game is fun, scary for some, and at the very least generally entertaining. The money aspect of the game (earning and spending) still feels tilted to not earning enough at times, but overall it's well worth the purchase."
10715,.
10716,"Have you ever wanted a vr game with suspense and mystery, Well this is the one for you. 

Gameplay: Oh boy this is a pretty suspenseful game. (Except when you open the door for the first time  and the ghost appears right in front of you. Yes that was my first non tutorial game and yes it depends on the ghost.) note: The ghost eventually locked the door and killed me... 

You can play in a group but so far i have only played solo as my friends don't seem to play it yet. And i need to convince them to try it. 

Solo is alot scarier as there's no one to help you find the clues but yourself and if you die that's game over.
9/10 (factoring in bugs)

Bugs? Few bugs with spawning outside the trailer but a few reloads of the map fixed it.

Did i scream my balls off in a discord vc when i saw a ghost? You bet i did!

Did i regret playing this game after seeing a ghost? Heck Yeah it scared the hell out of me.

Would i play this game again?  I mean it's a well rounded game. Apart from a few bugs with spawning here and there it's a really good game just don't play it if you really can't handle the jumpscares.

Will i ever scream like a baby again? Hell yeah.

Do i recommend it to others? 

I have only played the VR version but i know you can play without a VR too. But if you want something scary and enjoy the added bonus of being able to look around in virtual reality. Then it's a no brainer buy this game as soon as you can. If it's on sale why wait? just buy the damn game and have some fun... 

Solid 9/10 Needs a few more features polishing and a few VR bug fixes but easily could be a 10."
10717,"Love this game !!!!
Every session feels unique"
10718,i shit my pant
10719,"Very fun & scary game, specially if you have 3 more friends who will go and explore haunted places with you. Doris Wilson kept giggling in my ears, followed me all around the house and teleported teddy bears wherever I went but she was very sweet and made me love the game even more. 11/10, totally recommend buying this game even at full price."
10720,real fun to play with friends
10721,Its a fun multiplayer horror game with alot of stuff to do
10722,"I know I amassed quite some hours in this game, but I'm still going to leave it behind with a negative review. The reason for this is about the ratio of its popularity against its quality.

Right now, it's sitting close to 400,000 reviews with 97% of them being positive, awarding it the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" status. However, the only reason this game got this far is because its popularity is owed almost exclusively thanks to Twitch and YouTube streamers, predominantly during Halloween. The actual game leaves a ton to be desired.

This game isn't better, more special or unique than any other in its genre. It's yet another paranormal activity/ghost ""hunting"" game in early access. It has glaring shortcomings, rough edges, rigid and stale gameplay, constantly changing rules (almost monthly at this point), ghosts hardly differ from one another, and so on and so forth.

Despite all of the successes that these streamers have brought the developers, with the influx of hundreds of thousands of players buying the game, the actual development of this game has been slow and not very impressive. Sure, the visual overhaul was nice and they are making some progress, but the game is still the same, plays the same and collects dust all the same. After a few games, all games are practically the same. Rush in, plop down your gear, run back and forth, determine the ghost, get killed randomly or escape. Even with some scaredy cat friends I've played this game with have moved past it because it's simply boring.

The only real reason people are still amassing hours in this game at all is because they enjoy playing it together. I can't imagine anyone playing this solo just for fun (streaming doesn't count). For that reason, you are better off looking for a game that stays engaging after the initial few games and doesn't rely on your buddies to not become dreadful.

Bottom line: the devs have received an unfathomable amount of revenue for this run-of-the-mill game but have barely managed to improve it. Maybe it wasn't meant to be improved that much beyond what it is right now. I'm sorry, but it feels like an alpha version or demo at best.

Out of all the games that could have gotten this much attention, it had to be this one. There are plenty better co-op experiences out there. This isn't it."

The devs are so committed to improving this game and taking actual legit feedback it's impressive in a sea of game devs that are just lookin' to take advantage of their playerbase. This game is both fun solo and with friends, and from what I've experienced the community is very helpful in teaching people in areas they are new or just didn't know. 

The game honestly keeps getting better with each update, I love how every ghost has their own 'personality' of sorts making each subsequent match feel fresh especially when you add in your own blend of goofy into the mix. 

TLDR: I can't recommend this game enough, but you do you boo."
10841,"SOMEONE (who will remain unamed) downloaded cheats and when i played with them, it destroyed my game making it never work. (Adrian)"
10842,Good
10843,"Really fun game that I did not expect to have a meta. The devs seem really passionate about updating and making it the best game they can. I enjoy it both single player and with friends, probably more with friends but it's still a very fun game solo."

10924,"I absolutely love this game. Although since the new update I get weird static noise in my headphones when I'm inside. I thought it was the rain, but it's still there when it isn't raining. It's also not in the truck or outside, it's really odd. 

Beyond that, this game is one of my absolute favorites and I play often. Thanks so much for the hard work you put into it!"
10925,"spooky, scary, cool, and quirky"
10926,"Haven't played a lot of the game because it definitely gives me the creeps that all horror games should have. Never played alone, always had friends to make the experience more enjoyable instead of talking to myself. In my opinion, the best multiplayer horror game you can find that involves ghost hunting."
10927," Great horror experience if you're a weenie like me. More of a detective game than a horror game and it's really fun once you're proficient with a group of friends. I'm not a fan of jumpscares, and this game doesn't really have any to speak of. Happy hunting!"

My only gripe is that most updates seem tailored to what the two main streamers/content creators for the game want instead of what the community wants."

10953,its fun when you play with friends

10955,Awesome game! Love it. Just a bit creepy. The cursed items make it even better. 10/10!
10956,"Incredible potential but still a work in progress. The game is something completely new unlike anything I've played before. It is one of the few horror games to genuinely build tension and deliver scares and the mechanics can force players into tense decisions about whether it is worth the risk to return to the house to find that last piece of evidence or if your sanity is so low you might be attacked the second you set foot in the door.
"
10957,"This game is getting regular updates, and the devs are great about providing updates that at least I think are sufficient. Environments are great and the game's atmosphere really ups the creep factor. The different types of ghosts on the roster that are ever expanding keep the game from getting too boring imo, and they can be different enough in how they behave, which is fun. Heavy recommend to use the game chat, not discord as that separates you from the challenge of local/radio/dead chat. Undoubtedly the biggest enemy of this game is your friends who slam doors just to scare you. 



Sorry lads, was too funny. Promise I won't do it again. Probably."
10958,"This game is definitely worth buying if you love playing horror games with your friends. It is super fun to use the different tools to try and identify the ghost,(while trying not to be killed along the way), and, honestly, I really like the radio communication. I would prefer the game to have more interactions somehow? Like, you can see the ghost more or something. Whenever I play the game, the ghost either kills me through a wall or I see a flash of them and then I die. All in all, buy this game!!!!"

10974,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

10978,"this game is good very good in my opinion,  i just wish i  had a better computer to play this"
10979,"I enjoy the game, however if you're expecting it to work properly this is the wrong game for you. Half the time the evidence literally just ignores what it should be.
Example: Ghosty boi walks literally on top of the EMF and it only climbs to 4, yet the evidence was needing EMF 5.

It is fun, but it's not functioning correctly."

10982,"Honestly a amazing game if u find the right people online or with friends! they regularly update the game (about once every 2 months) outside of smaller updates and fixes, u can easily put hundreds of hours of gameplay into this when u have a nice group that u find"

11001,"This is a fun game but you should only get it, if you enjoy a scary and thrilling experience."
11002,"I felt the ghost models are all samey and bland, except for the ringu girl, she was good. We need more variety, rather than the same three zombie rednecks all the time. 

Where's like a shadow man? Children with black eyes? A demon with cloven hooves and horns? Or maybe one that looks like Pazuzu from the Exorcist. How about an Oni that resembles an Oni? I hope as this game gets more developed we see more and more variety in the ghost models.

Just for fun imo, you should throw a Nosferatu in there. Something that looks like Orlock and drains the life out of players."
11003,this is a great game if you want a way to do a paranormal hunt without being at the actual location.

11023,This game is scary and very fun at the same time
11024,"only play with a friend
;3"
11025,"Has to be one of the best Indie games out there when played with friends. Fairly original and well produced concept that has many layers of complexity beyond what can be seen on the surface. The game is best played with friends, and as you learn some of the depth this game has to offer it becomes more enjoyable to play solo. The devs are active and interactive with their community, and seem to update the game frequently. Note: This game is essentially a puzzle game. This game is difficult for beginners, it takes a while to learn but once you do you'll begin seeking more challenges.

Additionally, I think this game would really benefit from a progression system that ""unlocks"" the hidden information in the in-game journal that is often required to solve the missions at higher difficulties. As it stands now you have to utilize 3rd party sources (or an ungodly amount of trial and error), like the wiki, to have a chance at solving the 'Nightmare' level missions; which, is where the game really gets to show off its depth and complexity."

11100,game
11101,I absolutely love this game. There is so much to learn and find out. This game really tests out your capability to memorize and learn what all of the ghosts do. It is also very scary. I would suggest this game to anyone who wants to play a ghosty game and have fun either along with friends or by themselves with a little scare!
11102,.
11103,very good game
11104,i played in vr and my pants shit themselves

11106,"I love this game to bits! If you're looking for a fantastic time with your buddies then I highly suggest this game. Love how they're adding new maps and are consistent with their bug fixes and updates, developers keep at it because you guys are doing an awesome job!"
11107,"I must like it, I've bought 6 copies so far for friends and family. Really atmospheric, even at my age it makes me jump. The AI is just exemplary. Even the little things like opening a door reducing temperatures in the room are spot on. Well done guys, keep up the good work!!"

11115,"I love the fear this game gives.  Instead of relying on jump scares, is serves unsettling noises and eerie music to really put fear in your mind."
11116,Game is spooky
11117,don't ask just play
11118,nut
11119,super game
11120,this is a really good game it scares me a lot but its so silly!!!!!1111
11121,"i called the ghost a dumb bitch with no friends the moment i entered the house and it killed me instantly

10/10"
11122,Spooky ghost
11123,"A really fun game to play with friends, my only problem is lag but that could just be my wifi.  I for sure recommended for people who like to play horror games with friends or by themselves."
11124,Sure you can kill some time on it. sure. especially if you have friends.
11125,"I bought this game so my friend can activate something that will spawn a ghost from the middle of nowhere right into my face, and then she laughs her ass off after it kills me. It's fun, though."
11126,fucking scary
11127,"This game has 2 main ways to play for me, both amazing:

SOLO: go into a mission alone with no protection. This way of playing makes phasmophobia ONE OF THE SCARIEST GAMES I CAN THINK OF, the aspect of losing items on death is a great way to make players scared for their life uppon finding out they're dealing with a revenant or thaye.

FRIEND MULTIPLAYER: Playing the game like this is great fun, a group of hunters that knows what they're doing just have a blast messing with each other

How opposite the game feels in these two ways really shows it's greatness. A comedy show or a horror"
11128,"I really love spooky games but haven't found anything with a really good paranormal investigator background. I introduced this game to my brother and he got the game too so we could play together and it was a fun experience. I love the ambiance when you first walk into the location (spooky). The noise the ghosts create are even creepier than when I first started playing. I also really like the spook factor of each ghost. To be honest, playing this game by myself is something I have yet brought up the courage to do so I usually wait for my brother to have time to play with me. 
They do update this game too and it seems like each update there are some pretty decent improvements. I would recommend."
11129,This game is amazing with a ton of features and constant updates! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining ghost hunting game.

11142,called a ghost a pussy and every light exploded :)
11143,"This game is great, especially if you have a tight group you play with each time, you all figure out your roles and routines. 
A few things I think would make it more fun: 
At some point if you play a lot you end up with a lot of money and not a lot to spend it on unless you die and lose your equipment. I think there should be more unlockable content and customization. Like if you could buy new clothes and traits for your avatar, or different interiors for the truck (then whoever is hosting the game it would be their truck). 
I also think something needs to change with the larger maps. With only four people it's nearly impossible to play in the prison or school etc on harder levels cuz there's not enough time to really scout out the rooms without losing your sanity, and it takes too long to find a place to hide or to get out. There need to be some different advantages to these maps or new elements to make it more fun. 
There's some issue with the objective ""escape a hunt"". I'm pretty sure it's a matter of whether the ghost is choosing to hunt you vs a different player because we escape hunts all the time and it never checks off the objective. I think there's some technicality there that needs to be tweaked, its basically up to the ghost if we get it or not which makes it near impossible sometimes to get it. 

I'm excited for future updates, i think this is a great game that can only get better."
11144,You can take pictures of your dead friends and lead the ghost twords them to kill theme XD
11145,terrifying
11146,i literally hate this game so much i wanna play more
11147,"Ghost Game Very Fun! Very Scawy make pee pants! But, is pee in pants really bad? I mean it warms them up, but I guess it also makes them very wet. It might also be hard to clean up if your pants are white like all of mine and then it would have stained. I have played this game for a long time, and the newest update is very good."

11161,"Before any keyboard warrior tries to get on here telling me what I'm doing wrong....I know the game pretty well. I know how things used to work and I know it's changed a lot. I know I can no longer hide from a ghost....ever. I used to be able to smudge and run / hide. Now I can smudge and half the time it doesn't even disorient them, when it does it's for 0.5s and they continue to chase before i can even cut a corner. When I do manage to get away and hide, they b-line straight to me EVERY game. I don't know what they changed, but whatever it was made the game immensely unfun. Also, I play on nightmare or Pro only....same as before..and it's changed for the worse in the last 6 months."
11162,more ghosts like Deogen pls i love looping
11163,w
11164,"Amazing game with hours and hours of game-play trying to solve the ghost type and maximize profits, all while getting jump scared and creeped out along the way.  Multiplayer and Single player game-play each bring a fun and challenging aspect to the game that is both addicting and enjoyable.  I love that the developers are committed to continuously improving this game and bringing the users more features and difficult challenges.  Keep up the awesome work Kinetic Games!"

11174,"I do not recommend this game unless you want to struggle with some of the bullshit mechanics and how stupid some of it works. I have a love hate relationship with Phasmophobia and it has the NTR'ng the fuck out of me

If I'm being honest, it is the embodiment of the ""Are you winning, son?"" and how I hate it"

11237,"The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hit points, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks.
The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a Mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring.
His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider.
Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings. 
Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.

11261,"Great game it has lots of things to do and lots of ghosts but vr is even better.
"
11262,OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Spooly ghos and demon rawr very OOO WEOW
11263,"A very interesting game with a unique dynamic gameplay loop of figuring out what ghost you are dealing with. The game is simple in that which you enter a building, usually a house, and start testing various areas for paranormal activities using ghost hunting gadgets, either brought in or available in the mystery machine. Each ghost have different strengths and weaknesses and unique abilities, such as a poltergeist tossing shit around, or a banshee hunting a specific target.

Usually co-op spooky games make the horror experience fall flat. However, Phasmophobia somehow makes it more scarier in groups. Its obviously made in Unity by one guy who appropriately uses assets as temporary placeholders, but delivers updates on such a high note. I would play it more but I have no friends and I can't handle the stress alone. For for some reason it makes me feel like I'm playing Clock Tower Ghost Head for the PS1.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUXT5PT6zOw"
11264,Please update for custom difficulty this game bores me
11265,I mean i would but nightmare mode; someone in my lobby just literally cussed so much to me for being the most f****** useless teemate and it was really hurtful. I was not used to playing in nightmare mode and it terrified me because i found out i have the actual fear of being alone and of ghosts because all my teemates died.
11266,poopie
11267,Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror. Paranormal activity is on the rise and it’s up to you and your team to use all the ghost hunting equipment at your disposal in order to gather as much evidence as you can.
11268,fun. and it very scary i almost peed myself

11281,"very good game, my friend sacrificed himself and it was funny"
11282,great game but need to handle with the amount of hackers
11283,An enjoyable game with a friend. 4-player is a bit too many people however 2 or 3 is probably an optimal number. I do wish there was more customization but I understand the game is in early access. Also hoping to eventually get achievements and the new custom difficulty update is more difficult than nightmare as nightmare is a snooze. If you are looking for a scary game this probably will not scare you. 7/10 Overall
11284,"This is a great game... unique, well thought out game play, and over all fun even if you're not typically into this kind of game."

11290,ghost
11291,Is good
11292,"This game is horrifying. I love it.

(TIP: If you find the Ouija Board you can say ""Hide and Seek"" and the ghost will make noises so you can easily find it! Great trick for new players.)

Ghost is in a room, you need to find it.
You can use various pieces of equipment, including EMF reader, Spirit Box, D.O.T.S. Projector, etc. 
The ghost will interact with three of these, giving you evidence for what type of ghost it is. 

(EX: if the ghost gives you EMF 5, Spirit Box, and D.O.T.S. then you know its a Wraith.)

Each ghost also has an ability, for example, the Wraith can fly, which won't give any footprints if it steps in salt.
When the ghost hunts you need to hide so that it doesn't kill you.

10/10 Game would recommend to everyone.

11306,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

Игра пушка, но явно нужно переделать систему поиска лобби, так как достаточно трудно найти игроков своего уровня и соответственно игру определенной сложности."

11394,"the randoms in this game are either really new or pros who speed run this game for fun
"
11395,"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!! the replayability is immense, and i have no meaningful issues to speak of. it's a lot of fun, with or without friends, though i will say i find it a lot scarier to play on singleplayer..

a bit of advice i have for any new players:
because the game is still in early access as i write this, this is subject to change, but as of right now, there's some pretty important information about items and such in this game that the tutorial doesn't really tell you. don't worry; you can still start the game blind - the tutorial does give you a pretty decent gist of it, and you will naturally learn most things on your own, and have lots of fun doing so - but it will almost certainly be very helpful to read up on any objects or mechanics that come to confuse you, or that you can't seem to ever get to work. alternatively, if you find a good youtuber or streamer who is well-versed in the game, you could pick up some very helpful tips from them. maybe you could even learn from some high-level strangers in public lobbies! in any case, it's worth noting that there are some things you probably wouldn't think of or realize on your own."
11396,"This game can be simple or complicated, depending on how you're playing. At first, I was just having fun with my friends messing around with ghosts. It was a horror game, it honestly is super fun, how the concepts work with each other. It can be a very scary game. You can troll your friends, discover new cursed possessions, etc. Overtime, however, the game becomes less scary and I became better. I still get scared quite often, but calling it a horror game is disingenuous after you've played the game for a while. It has almost infinite repeatability. Learning about the ghosts and how the game works is fun too."
11397,"if you're feeling a little confused on how to play phasmophobia, allow me to post a short how-to;
just get 3 friends (and at the expense of their lives and hundreds of dollars of electrical, a/v equipment and other tools), go on a ghost hunt with literally no protection except a cross that weighs about 2lbs and a 'smudge' stick whatever the fuck that is. oh also lets get him to blow out the candle and step in some salt while we're at it. we'll call it 'evidence' even though it could have just been any fucking one of us running around like chickens with our heads cut off. now that we have our evidence, you can guess what ghost it was. oh sorry you were wrong, ya guessed spirit, but it was actually the Ghost of Christmas' Past from the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. your friends are dead and you barely learnt a thing, oh well. you did make $5 tho!!!!!!!"
11398,Lots of funny definitely a great game to play with friends. its spooky and  alot of fun :)

11411,"For those skeptical of voice recognition. YES the spirit box sucks ass and bugs out constantly.
Tip, ask if the ghost is French"
11412,yes
11413,we should split up gang
11414,I have been playing phasmophobia for awhile now so when your in the main menu i would highly recommend that you start of training to get use to being in the dark and getting to know about the equipment and then after a bit of training you will be able to start your ghost hunting for being in early access still 14 bucks isnt that bad for this game and for updates happening the game is like progressively getting better and the quality is amazing like how some of the equipment shows that shine off another is amazing and when your playing with friends it get so much funner and your just trying to figure out what to. and when the player die they could mess with the items in the house and still communicate with them even tho there died so i would recommend this game to my friends and everybody

11428,"ReallY SCARYT GAME
"
11429,"This game is hands down the best horror game I've played.
Phasmophobia has the best atmosphere as soon as you enter the location you want to go. 
The ghost is always around you which keeps you on your toes and once a hunt happens its pure panic to get to a hiding spot or looping it around large pieces of furniture.
Tarrot Cards has to be the best item because you could randomly get killed of be revived depending on your luck.
There is 24 ghosts at the time of writing this and they very a lot from the evidence they need& their behavior (chosen randomly).

Overall:
Perfect game for you ghost hunters or if you want to play a indie horror game."
11430,"So I have cemented myself as the dumb bitch who dies first in horror movies, the game is scary at first and then a few hours in you just kinda scream YOLO running into the house while cussing out the ghost
so anyways thats how I got strangled- several times 

great game would recommend"
11431,ghost. soo scary :(
11432,"I absolutely love this game. I've never been one for horror games, but I feel like Phas is my gateway drug into the realm of spooks and terror. Well made game, and great to play with friends. I'm still too scared to play by myself yet, but one day, I might conquer my fears and get good at this game by myself."

11461,"One of the most terrifying games I've played, especially solo. A must play for fans of movies like The Conjuring, Sinister, Paranormal Activity and so on. If you've ever watched those scenes where a ghost hunting team arrives at a house and starts setting up cameras, monitoring hauntings etc. and wished for a game that could simulate that experience, look no further."

I've heard from others that they get bored of the repetitiveness of the game, but I haven't had that problem. If you do have that problem, fret not because they're constantly adding updates to improve the game and introduce new content: new ghosts, new maps, new mechanics and more. It does occasionally have it's problems, as does any game that is receiving consistent updates, and one that I've had to deal with is my game randomly crashing, but they're quick to fix that problem when it arises.

11543,"Cock and ball torture (CBT), occasionally known as penis torture, dick torture, or male genitorture/male genital torture, is a sexual activity involving the application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.

Devices and practices

Similar to many other sexual activities, CBT can be performed using toys and devices to make the penis and testicles more easily accessible for attack, or for foreplay purposes.

Ball stretcher

A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one's testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.

While leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer's testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from 2.5-10 centimeters (about 1-4 inches). A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one's scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length.

Ball crusher

A ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself.

Parachute

A parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.

Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3–5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the participant wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.

Humbler

A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive participant in a BDSM scene.

The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep their legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing anything from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.

Testicle cuffs

A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock, which cannot be removed without its key, may also be locked around the scrotum.

Some passive participants enjoy the feeling of being ""owned"", while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of ""owning"" their partners. Requiring such an individual wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that their sexual organs belong to their partner. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or their partner.

However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:

Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional few centimetres of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view.

Improving sexual arousal. While some participants may be aroused by the feeling of being ""owned"", the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one's legs and pointing the toes.

Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse.

Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the ""point of no return"". It is much harder to reach an orgasm.

Cock harness

A cock harness is a penile sex toy designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities. The Gates of Hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for CBT. Kali's Teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections.

Ball busting

""Ball busting"" is the practice of kicking or kneeing participants in the testicles. It carries several medical risks, including the danger of testicular rupture from blunt trauma.

CBT in Japan

Tamakeri (玉蹴り) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of BDSM within which a man's testicles are abused. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting (""bb"" for short). Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian people—mainly women—are participating in it. The dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist. The fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.

Denkianma (電気按摩) (lit. ""electric massage"") is a popular Japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion. Often this is done by grabbing the other person's feet, raising them, and then placing one's own foot on their crotch and vibrating it. This is often done between school aged boys as a prank similar to kancho and could be seen by a western audience as a type of bullying. In 2006, Frito Lay released a special, Taitsukun-themed edition of Doritos chips, that referenced denki anma.

Safety

Loss of blood flow is one of the greatest risks in cock and ball torture and may cause irreversible damage. Bleeding is an indicator of unsafe behavior. Because numbness may result from circulation problems in the affected member, the level of pain is not an indicator of a problem and signs of danger include numbness or loss of color and edemas. Bondage in which the testicles are tied to another object is especially dangerous, increasing the risk of damaging the testicles through excessive tension or pulling.

The most serious injuries are testicular rupture, testicular torsion and testicular avulsion, which are medical emergencies that require urgent medical attention."
11544,"Used to be a great game, but it seems with every update over the last year they continue to take out the features/bugs that truly made the game amazing, also none of the ghosts say it's Phasmophobian time over the spirit box before hunting, truly the greatest downfall in modern gaming."
11545,"i purposely broke the cursed mirror (which immediately causes a hunt) and i was hiding in a closet while i hear the horrid sounds of one of my friends dying trying to get help and little did he know i made the ghost kill him.


the game is fantastic"
11546,amazing
11547,"Used to be great fun, (especially parkouring onto the counters and yelling at the ghost), but they have proceeded to suck every inkling of fun out of the game in trying to make a sweaty ghost hunter. It was simple great fun and now its a drag to play. I have great memories of friends running in circles around a couch during hunts as we are all laughing our asses off, but now the ghost is faster than you, no fun for you consumer. There is no way to fight back against the ghost in this game, (also the smudge stick fails like 80% of the time but who cares I guess.), so your only tool is hiding. But motherfucker, on higher difficulties, they REMOVE hiding spots. Its not enjoyable walking to a closet you used to hide in and screw around with the ouija board in and seeing that its full of shoe boxes now preventing you from accessing it.. OOoooOoo spooky fucking boxes. My friends and I can't seem to ever do more than one game before closing it anymore because its just boring. This game doesn't have exorcisms like the other games that came after this, or weapons like the salt shotgun or neutrino gun. So it needs to have that simple fun of hiding, and running away from the ghost on maps like high school as your friends laugh at you when you get caught on a locker then nuked. Cause other than that loop, there isn't much else to really do. If you play the game as intended, you will get maybe 4-10 hours of scares and fun which loses it's novelty very quickly. There is NOTHING to spend your money on, which completely nulls any incentive you may have to complete the mission because you buy more tools that you have 2549+ of already. Yay. Which is why making your own fun was such a huge component of replaytability. Well too bad, there is LITERALLY zero way to make your own fun anymore. You play the game as intended, find ghost, make 200 dollar, or die, repeat. Anything outside of that? Kys too much to ask for you greedy consumer. Things like the little bugs and parkour stuff was so fun. You could MAKE your own fun but there's no tools to do that anymore. They enjoy removing features like they did today where they decided to remove lighting a teammates smudge for some reason. Like okkkk? Just why lmao. Its such a small thing but they do self sabotaging shit like this all the time for no reason at all.  They spend a year to do any meaningful updates that aren't lighting fixes that no one cares about, then proceed to release shit like Willow Street House. I've never seen developers that had something so good and then just decide to take a hot dooky on it for no apparent reason. Ironically, the only time i saw people excited in their update section's comments, is when they posted the April Fools patch notes and people thought they were real features coming to the game. There were things like if there's the ghost pair, one of them would join your team and help hunt, emotes, 3 new maps, poltergeists throwing players, and other great ideas that were all just ""jokes"", despite being leagues ahead anything these creatures have produced in over a year and a half.  These stupid mongs joking about features is unironically what would make this shallow cum stain of a game actually fun again. But instead they go, ""lol no sorry that was big funni, not real hahaha. Anyways here's a water texture fix in the sink no one noticed HEHhehHAhahheh."" Ghost Exorcism Inc and Forewarned do it much better.

Also my homie joined these masochist's discord server and requested the old build of the game that was actually enjoyable and they banned him 💀, (and he asked once, he wasn't being annoying about it. Some youtubers were given access to the original build and posted videos a few months back so he was like, ""they clearly have the old build, just give it to me. I'll even pay extra lmao."" Comments on the videos were also expressing how they missed what the game used to be). These devs are incapable of taking criticism so instead they just remove more content and add more lighting changes. YAY! YAY! YAY! 

I made this review because seeing the teammate smudge stick thing kinda put the nail in the coffin for my hopes with this pile of doo doo. Its not a huge change on its own, but its par for the course with their constant removal of features, and with how this game will progress going forward. There just is not enough content for them to be removing anything. You don't get to remove 20,000 things then release fucking Willow Street House or the Campsite lmao. Plus this game REALLLY deserves that overwhelmingly positive review score to go down. It used to deserve it, but not for over at least a year and then some.

Seriously though, for indie devs that we used to love supporting, your heads have really shot far up your own asses now. Dickwads

If you still enjoy this game and find a good time playing it, I envy you."
11548,"This game is so good! It gives you the creeps..the anticipation is intense, you have no idea what it going to happen and when it going to happen. I love playing this game, its good to play alone for a scare but it is so fun when you play with others as the scare is shared and it can be hilarious! I recommend this highly to others."

11571,"This game is nothing short of a great time to play, either solo or with friends (though I will say playing with friends is the optimal way to experience it). Genuine scares and dynamic game play make this title one that rarely feels stale or stagnant. While the real-life TV show counterparts to ghost hunting may paint a ridiculous feeling on its premise, this game is a real thrill to get into with investigations, problem solving, and truly heart-thumping chases (which can be fatal scenarios). 

It's impressive how much love & attention to detail this game gets from its developers; they've come a long way from the start in terms of graphical & mechanical quality! Today, the overall atmosphere is stunning due to updated visual quality, terrifying new sounds, and pretty interesting options to interact with the in-game world. 

If Phasmophobia has come this far in progressing its quality, there's only good things ahead as the developers regularly add new content and fix existing content. I'll be sticking with this title for as long as it is available!!"
11572,"David told me to tell you guys to play this game. He wrote the book ""how to get women"" and I bought it for Hugo, my friend to get chicks. Go read that book it'll help you trust me it's amazing. Hugo likes this book very much and it has been helpful for him. Thank you David and we'll talk later, I have some ideas for your next book you'll love them and I hope I can get credited for it in your next book. Also you can interview me if you want I scored chicks too. More than Hugo. I'm a lesbian. Remember the shoe I put in my gf's butt? it's still there."
11573,"It is an amazing and addicting game, there are some bugs you will encounter here and there but that is the same with all games, I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a multiplayer horror game to either screw around in with friends, or grind for 72 hours straight."

Apparently they're going to do an update to make it even scarier? Looking forward to it."

11591,Can't wait till the game leaves early access. This game has SO MUCH potential to be even better than it is. Absolutely fell in love with this game recently despite having the game in my library for so long. They fixed a lot of important issues I had with it originally.

But i really do think should add more animations to the ghost when it kills you. But overall, its a great game. I'm still confuse on how to play it but i have friends to play with me so it balances it out. Very good. I recommend it."

11617,"Honestly, I enjoy this game, but not to a great extent. I still think its an okay game but I have been waiting for so long for new, interesting content to be added to the game with respect to the game mechanics. I love new maps, and love the truck overhaul update and everything that has been coming out; it's all amazing. The only issue, is that the gameplay has felt static and unchanged for a VERY long time, even with the release of DOTS and new ghosts. It practically feels the same every game, where you yell into the spirit box until the ghost finally says something, or you wait for 10 minutes for the ghost to finally write in the book, or you get a ghost thats TOO easy that has like fingerprints and ghost orbs as evidence and you solve it in 2 seconds. The ghosts are all really easy to find out and you can expand on the gameplay by doing your own personal challenges like the youtuber Insym does, but the fact that there is no workshop or modding capability in the game is really a HUGE let down to the community. You shouldn't have to alter how you play the game for yourself after only a couple hours of playing just because the gameplay is so static and boring. This game is very fun to begin with, but fair warning to all newcomers - after a couple hours, you will become bored very fast. Hopefully some game mechanics are changed or there becomes a workshop capability for people wanting to play the game, because it has so much potential but falls very flat with the gameplay. No shade to the developers, because the recent updates have been extremely necessary and have provided some good bug fixes and quality of life changes, but I don't see the game continuing to grow and progress in the future due to the bland nature of the game. Anyone that watches Insym should be wary, as he claims the game is fun and is in no need of these changes and sides with the developers a lot. I love the guy, but his almost 2000 hours in the game has blinded him from the true faults of the gameplay, because he's truly in love with the game. So be careful y'all! Do I recommend the game? Yes. On sale? Definitely. Will you get bored after a day or two of playing? Absolutely. Have fun guys!"

11642,good game. did scream.
11643,game dev why is it that the mimic can do any evidence that makes it so much more frustrating when you spend awhile trying for evidence and you get some for other ghost but it ends up being the mimic and you basically wasted time because I've had multiple investigations where it has been the mimic and I've gotten evidence of a different ghost but didn't get evidence for the mimic but overall the game is still fun to play.

11705,I shit my pants multiple times throughout one session with a group of friends and it was the funniest shit we have played
11706,REALLY GOOD GAME AND NOT IRONIKZ
11707,"Phasmophobia is almost everything you could ask for in a horror game. A lot of elements in this game work together to create a very dynamic experience. The wide variety of ghost hunting equipment all play a solid role throughout any level. This game delivers when it comes to a horrifying, intense, and unpredictable environment. On the contrary, I wish there were more story elements added to this game; ie: diaries, crime scene evidence, newspapers that associate with the deceased individual you're investigating, etc. Without these few elements, I personally believe I'm not really serving a sole purpose on why I'm investigating a particular ghost in the first place besides rewards you receive from the contracts you accept. That isn't considered to be a bad thing, but it definitely adds more depth to this game if Kinetic Games were to acknowledge that and update it in the foreseeable future. I did enjoy the multitude of levels in this game, a lot of them were very unique in their own respected ways and they're not too complex in design (besides Asylum).  I highly recommend this game for anyone searching for a unique, but terrifying experience either playing solo or with a couple of friends."
11708,it good like good
11709,"Phasmophobia has a lot going for it and even more so that it's being consistently updated by the developers, especially since the big updates always include new ghosts, improved systems, and so on. Each time there's a new update there's also a lot to learn/relearn as they do tend to change up how equipment is used. However, Phasmophobia is a game that deals with a lot of detective work, and a lot of hustle. You'll be expected to spend quite some time in the professional and nightmare modes trying to figure out what signs the ghost is giving (which can be time consuming) and you may not even get an answer. It's a game that I wouldn't call horror, but more a coop detective piece with the supernatural being the main driving force.

TLDR: It's good, it takes time, it's not that scary but it is fun."

I can creep up on my friends and scare them by peeking through the wall Bethesda style. Their fear fuels me.

The ghost will also say that it likes to be choked on the Ouija board. I can ask for it to moan on the parabolic and it will scream. Sometimes the ghost likes to whisper sweet nothings before becoming your Daddy.

11780,"Initially was interesting but became extremely repetitive for a long time with ghost variation.
While they added content it feels like the same loop and the same handful of ghosts every time."

11782,not even scary at all :)
11783,"One of the best co-op games to play with a group of fwens.
The devs did a good job on the AI when interacting with the Ghost.
I hope there'll be seasonal rewards or something we can look forward as this game is a big hit."

11797,This game is one of my all time favorite Horror games. I love this genre and Phasmophobia really captures that. Phasmophobia is an amazing game to chill and play with friends as well. I also love how you can play this game in VR and just on your desktop computer with Keyboard and Mouse. The only thing that I would love to have though is more maps to play because I just find myself playing the same maps to often. Overall this game is a truly AMAZING game.
11798,this game should not be played with little kids
11799,"Incredibly fun and unique game, designed for VR but plays super well on a standard device - I bought it in the recent steam sale but would happily pay full price! I had never heard of it before a friend mentioned it was on sale and boy was it worth copping.

Tense eerie atmosphere throughout whether single player or coop but definitely better with friends or even randoms"
11800,Very fun
11801,berrrreeeeeeyyyyyy fun

11819,The ghosts hate Taylor Swift
11820,I like it
11821,Its a really fun game to play with friends
11822,"There was a time when this game used to be fun. It was easier in terms of the signs used to find which type of ghost you were dealing with, and the overall difficulty of the ghost was easier. Now, there are far too many ghost variants, and the hunting period has gotten a lot harder. I'm sure to some this was a welcomed addition, but for myself and my group of friends, it made the game almost unplayable. You can now get hunted through doors, attacked while in hiding spots etc. I personally think they've ruined this game and made it substantially more ""sweaty"" just to complete missions, hence why we have all given up on it. Devour is a better game for the money, more fun to complete missions with, and overall just better mechanically."
11823,have an extra pair of underwear
11824,pretty scary but the unique mechanics make it work
11825,me and my friends angered the ghost by talking about hamilton. would recommend
11826,OKAY

11837,"Where do I start with this piece of fuck.

The community is fucking trash and toxic as hell if you're joining public games. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENJOY THIS GAMES WITHOUT FRIENDS OR JOINING THE PHASMOPHOBIA DISCORD LFG. 

Once that step is complete, I rate this game 9.5/10. Why the fucking high rating? 

The ghosts literally fuck you in the ass. The gameplay design is such that you and your team will be delving into the unknown where, on the harder (proper) difficulties, you could either end up with a harmless ghost or a crawling hell demon that slaughters your co-investigators on first contact. The ghosts in this game are fucking scary. The amount of variation both in models, visibility (ie some may only be visible by placing salt on the ground and having them walk through it, some may only appear for a split second through video cameras while hunting, some may only appear as ghost orbs, some may talk to you. These fuckers have utterly no limit in variety and villainy.

When I first played this game there were about 8 ghosts, some small amount like that. Now we're on 24. TWENTY-FOUR. And that is just ghost-type. Within those types (ie the hell demon or pussy-clad ghost) they will inevitably have different models and interact differently with the environment. Every new job you do in this game feels new and fresh. Phasmophobia is a moist, lubricated cock ready to fuck you right up in your asshole, and the correct response to that is ""excellent, my asshole is ready"".

I recommend Phasmophobia to any and all degenerates who can suspend their disbelief that ghosts could exist."
11838,"those ghosts are gigachad. 10/10
CaN yOU FeEEEL My HEARTTTTTTTTTTT"
11839,scary
11840,"10/10 spooks, love playing in VE with mates."
11841,"The best game ever created.
I enjoy so much talking with the Ghost and when I leave the house turning me head back and seeing that my friends are being attacked by the ghost is the best feeling I can't explain in words how it feels.

Overall 10/10"

11938,"I used to like this game a lot, and I really wish I could still like it. But quite a few things stick out to me, 

1. The game isn't even the slightest scary, I'm sorry but it truly doesn't deserve the ""horror"" tag. I have yet to even be startled. 

2. The game sometimes takes absolutely forever to give you hints on where the ghost is or what it is. Sometimes taking upwards of 35-45 minutes. Really Really REALLY boring. 

3.  Hunts are poorly designed and end up being more frustrating then fun. Your ghost hunter must never exercise in the slightest, and I get it, the houses can be small and a big sprint pool is bad, but it makes it way more obnoxious to run away from the ghost. I'm tired of losing my stuff because my guy can't just jog a little faster. Not to mention you lose all your stuff and if you play on the harder difficulties, means you lose all your money and now, since you probably need to rebuy equipment, means in the next case you might be unable to complete challenges resulting in you earning less money.  

Putting this all into something tangible, you effectively get a game that is marketed as scary or at the very least suspenseful (which the first few times you play it very well is) and then it quickly erodes into a boring ""Clue"" game where the evidence is drip fed at a snails pace. And when you finally get your last piece of evidence, you get into a hunt where your hunter can't even hide. Lame. 

Overall, I usually only play this with friends because to be honest, its fun to just hangout and do this on the side. Wish the devs would make the game a little more fun and a lot spookier and anyone who says ""BuT JUmPsCaReS ArE CHeaP!!!111!!!"" I'm not asking for that, I'm simply asking for gameplay that feels actually terrifying. 

Maybe you look out the window and see the ghost staring back and an audio cue, maybe a mirror. Maybe little things like the door you are entering opens automatically for you. Maybe the flashlight flickers a tiny bit just to mess with you. Maybe there is writing in a mirror or a loud bang of furniture being moved. Or the sounds of a voice crying or yelling. And please, overhaul the journal, there are so many things you need to google to just figure out. Like, Wraiths cannot leave footprints but apparently can touch salt and leave a footprint? Huh??? And you'd need to google it and even the couple top results don't answer your question.

This game has potential to merge both the case solving and horror ghost game it was meant to be, but instead we get a dry-rot version of a ""horror"" game, a horror game with the foundation there but the true meat of the experience withered away."

12010,i bought this awhile ago but i started playing it again and it is super fun with friends so buy it whenever you can but before you do you should ask your friends to get it because if you don't you will not play the game as much.
12011,Ok i change my mind phasnoohobpnoia is a scary game when it comes to the hypothesis of ghosts and demons. this game helps me change my mindset to the gothic and relatives side of the hyopthesis of english. so when the hypothesis evaulautes itself then the ghosts 🤮🎄💯💕

12017,"AMAZING SO FUN. One thing though is that it's extremely hard to remember the ghosts, so you need to be patient in learning them. And sometimes hosts randomly kick you after joining, since they are too dumb to make a private lobby lol. Be ready for horror fun with friends, by yourself, or with random people!"
12018,gud game
12019,Ghost's are either very active or you won't even know they are there. It's lots of fun and very enjoyable to play with friends while getting spooked.

12037,"A lot of fun with my friends (there is an option for single player which is equally as fun but a little bit more terrifying), I love that this game is regularly updated unlike other indie games, the creator/s have so much love for this project and it shows. Thank you guys for giving me and my friends hours of entertainment :D"

12047,Woah spook
12048,Highly recommended with friends!
12049,As long as you don't play with dumb people you'll be fine.
12050,"Scary and fun game. The first few hours are extremely scary in this game but you will get used to the ghosts and atmosphere and will more feel like you are the monster later on. If you play enough, you will have balls of steel later on. Loved this game in VR... only with friends. Spooky game."
12051,Good game really recommend
12052,You can take photos of your friend's dead body for profit
12053,Very fun. Very Scary
12054,scary but not scary
12055,The feeling of dread when you step into the atmosphere of the building. Or at least it was like that for 10 hours of gameplay.

12064,"This game is so good, anyways i think my house is now haunted"
12065,a nice game
12066,"makes me pee 
"
12067,"Phasmophobia is a great horror game that even after playing for 31 hours is still scary, but prehaps less than in the beginning. What holds the game up still is the gameplay, wich is different each game depending on the events that happen, cursed possesions, ghost types and maps, wich each provide unique ways of etenrtaining the game."
12068,This game is very sex. After my gay friend gifted this to me my life changed i turned from an average hentai enjoyer to a gigachad in 1 second. Now i get a lot of girls and boys that makes me very happy :)
12069,ghost
12070,i like everything about this game its fun to play with you friends
12071,this is the best pc game i've ever played wish it came to console
12072,i really like this game if u are with friends but if u join a random public server most guys will be toxic or will kick u instantly anyways the game is very good but the comunity its bad hope that i helped u!
12073,Very spoopy and if u find it boring try running it solo for more ambience and more spoopy
12074,lord have mercy
12075,good game veri good
12076,very goed
12077,The game is very entertaining but I didn't know how to play it in the first time. I think this game should have a tutorial
12078,Being able to use sound sensors to detect the Twins is honestly such a good mechanic. Can't forget the first time I played and a Mimic messed it up.
12079,ghost scary go boo :(
12080,The perfect ghost game
12081,"Ghosts are pretty fuckable and hot. (I also fingred one in VR, but she accidently pulled my face in 2 parts bc she was to horny)
I also found out it's possible to kiss teammates in VR
Also pushed up a flashlight up my ass and when i asked the ghost for sex on the box it said ""behind you""
Very good game 
Funny is when you turn the tv on in VR and hide the remote control somewhere where the pc players can't reach you can really bully others"
12082,fun multiplayer horror game
12083,"Great game with some unique ideas, and new content being added all the time. A blast to play with friends and spooky to play solo, would very much recommend giving it a try!"
12084,"i like 1 on 1 action with the ghosts, friction in a cold dark basement.

It gets me going"
12085,fun

12105,"haha this game isnt even scary...

12115,The only game i am scared of...
12116,Perfect game to play with your friends!
12117,pissed myself probably
12118,"Some ghost are questionable, like the one ghost that had a hard on for me for simply asking how old you are. Or the fact that some would merk me on the spot. the only reason i'm not mad is the constant bitching of my friends. 10/10."
12119,a lot of fun especially with friends jump scares really get you and gameplay is a lot of fun.
12120,fun game
12121,"me and my friends are a bunch of scaredy cats who just simply cannot deal with the horror genre but we're enjoying pissing our pants whenever the ghost whispers in our ears or the pig dude starts humming, we have at least one of us die every game and honestly its probably more fun that way. it would be nice if you could jump though, either just for the sake of it or maybe enabling you to escape the hunt by jumping over some furniture that would be otherwise in the way! looking forward to the full release. 8/10 would panic again"
12122,This game is great for old people and toddlers. highly recommend.
12123,"This game could be so good if it was not so prone to crashing and breaking every 5 minutes. I mean this with complete honesty, this game literally will not stop crashing, the audio system literally never works, and attempts to fix these problems are either unsuccessful or non-existent. I don't even remember how much this was worth but it was not worth it :("
12124,I love gang banging my friends after they die!
12125,Beast of a game. With the right people this is an amazing experience and no matter how many hrs you have on the game you'll still shit your pants every now and then.
12126,"Since once i was a little one I had this one big dream
To walk inside a haunted house and make a loud ass scream
But this game showed me something more,
Something that I do adore,
Bestowed upon me was the grace,
Of closing the door in my friend's face.
"
12127,"Its a great horror game for the first like 10 jobs, then it just gets repetitive, if it had more variety in ghost types it would last longer, and i dont mean like phantoms, banchees, etc, because as of now its all just invisible things that chase you with minor differences, but other than that its great for a little while"
12128,"Just casually taking some world class ""FAPPABLE"" photos."
12129,its fun
12130,"Ok, so when you first play this game, I highly recommend to play multiplayer so other people can teach you. Most of the time, they're super nice people. Also don't go into this game scared, it will make it worse."
12131,awesome game loved it
12132,Made me shart a bit. GOOD GAME
12133,"dead

12134,its fun to play with friends
12135,Get some friends and allow chaos to roll
12136,boo
12137,Its really good
12138,"It's amazing how well this game works. Calling out a ghost's name, the lights go out, and in a flash you catch a glimpse of it standing just a few feet away... Absolutely incredible. The learning curve on this game can be steep if you want to get really good at it, but for the casual spooky shenanigans with friends this game will more than satisfy even with only the basics under your belt. If you're the type who wants to play by yourself then have no fear (ok, maybe a healthy amount of fear for these ghosts) because there's a single player mode that gives you the same experience alone. 

Are there some rough edges? Yeah, maybe a few. But if you want to feel the tension ratchet up and suddenly jump out of your seat from ghostly surprises, this is the game for you."
12139,Is pretty good.
12140,"yes
"
12141,Watched my friend die in front of me. Which then James Charles suddenly got summoned and started having sex with the rest of my friends.

12149,i can talk to Anna Barton
12150,I love this game but everytime i play it i wanna curl into the fetal position and cry
12151,"good

12152,"This game its fun, especially with friends, however it ends too quickly, hope they do add more stuff coming up! its a blast the first hours you play it, hopefully it gets even more stuff.

solid game, i hate when the ghost are children coz they run so fast."
12153,"Players will leave you if you aren't a ""high level,"" but overall a good game. I seriously love ghost hunting, being able to socialize, and have fun with the right people in this game."
12154,cool

12161,"i love this game i met my sexy anime girlfriend
"
12162,"I have a 2 year old who is obsessed with it.

I watch it probably twice a day. I could put it on mute and recite every line (including car sounds and tire screeching) from memory.

I see cars when I close my eyes, I hear “cachow” while I’m drifting off to sleep. Clouds are starting to take the shape of lightning McQueen and ‘Mater as they drift past my window. Cars haunts me"
12163,super fun to play with friends
12164,"this game literally isnt scary, if you think it is thats a you issue.

9/10 some of the most fun ive had in a long time"

12170,have fun murdering your friends while pretending to be accomplishing the mission. 10/10 would slam doors in peoples faces again
12171,i reccemend because i like hearing my friedns scream in horror then watch em die and my body gets dragfgged across teh rfoom oh and im colou blind
12172,Absolutely horrifying yet good game. However I do have one issue. The ghost always irrationally targets me for no reason. So if you end up in a game with me I will die first.
12173,really fun with friends
12174,"i like winning but not loosing
"
12175,Tons of fun with friends. Really great game for some scares.
12176,is so good game
12177,super funny
12178,"If you've never played it or seen it before, then play it in the dark first. You'll love it.  ;)"
12179,"yes

12181,not scary...... at all... repetitive and boring.

"
12184,fun with friends who die instantly.
12185,its nices
12186,love this game and it's attention to detail.
12187,"its a very nice game, good for making friends and killing time or immersing yourself! i also suggest like making more characters and maps also adding the estes method or however its said and itll cost like 150-170 but thats just an idea. how it would work: like you blindfold yourself and the screen is pitch black but u can hear only the ghosts voice when other people ask questions and then you repeat it to the other players. and it can be questions like how old are you, why are you here, who are you, what are your intentions, so on. also i suggest adding a gamemode called hell, every screen is broken, 1 evidence, 2 different spirits at the same time, no cameras, and so on"
12188,very fun game to play with friends but too scary for me by myself
12189,"Scary game, but rly funny :D !"
12190,"1: have friends 
2: play a horror game 
3: thats life"
12191,THIS GAME CAUSES ME TO PISS MYSELF UNCONTROLLABLY. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME IS LIFE EVEN REAL ESPECIALLY WHEN I BUY A STRONG FLASHLIGHT AND THERE WERE ONLY THREE ON THE TRUCK AND THEN I HAVE TO GO INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL WITH A FINGERPRINT SCANNER AND HAVE PURPLE LIGHT. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. PHASMOPHOBIA GANG STRONG
12192,scary
12193,"Fun if looking for a ghost multiplayer game
"
12194,the game sooooo gooood
12195,You've never felt real fear until your friends locked the door behind you in Phasmaphobia.
12196,Fun game with voice recognition. Novelty can wear out after a 100 hours or so even on Nightmare.
12197,"great to play with the homies
"
12198,"Would recommend this game it is a very nice blend of scary and fun, Not much of a fan of scary games but this one I can play for a while"
12199,"Very Fun, but gets a little boring after a while. The full release will probably be more interesting but this game is totally worth a buy! Very fun, scary, and enjoyable!"
12200,Great game if you wanna sh1t yourself with you friends!
12201,very very fun
12202,"my balls
"
12203,Its pretty fun for the first couple weeks then it kinda gets boring because its very repetitive.
12204,good
12205,GUD
12206,"Scary yet fun, if you cant play solo being too scared to go in the house I would recommend starting with friends to help fight that fear, after all it is PHASMOPHOBIA."
12207,ghost
12208,veri good
12209,its alri
12210,"Do you want to play a scary game?
Buy it and play with your friends
Be afraid, laugh and make fun of each other
Spend 25 minutes in each house
You are happy that you are going to get a lot of money, but either you died or you guessed the ghost wrong
You lost a lot of money and close the game"
12211,pp
12212,spoopy and I can live out my youtuber lifestyle
12213,amazing 10/10 very funny sometimes and also terrifying (this was gifted to me by a friend)
12214,Game is great when you play with friends!
12215,Very good game but my friend is weird so he doesn't like playing it.
12216,very cute game

12218,good game to play with friends
12219,very emoties in this game
12220,"honest to god one of my favorite games of all time. challenging enough to be a bit frustrating, but complex enough that you don't want to stop playing"
12221,I really enjoy playing this game. The multiplayer is great. It's scary but not too scary. I think it would be better if there were more animations for when you die.
12222,Have been trying for weeks to get my friend to play this game with me...now we don't talk anymore.
12223,"This game is cool with friends. 
**9/10**"

12233,funny ghost kills me when i say your mom
12234,hot n sexc
12235,nice
12236,I've never experienced anything like this before.
12237,this game should add in game kicking if one of the players are afk for a certain amount of time like 2 minutes and if they still arent moving after the 2 minutes the host should be able to kick him and add chats and the ability to mute people and the chats should work with the spirit box
12238,Game is a 10/10
12239,The narrator is British
12240,"This game is very fun, It is always getting constantly updated. It also can make 4 grown men scream"
12241,fun game

12244,Yeet
12245,it cool
12246,add anticheat
12247,Podophobia
12248,Dis game be good and spooky.
12249,I totally recommend this game! Its a good way to get some of your nerves going! Its a really good horror game I enjoy the suspense and the eerie vibes it gives but in a way that makes it in a fun! But I totally recommend it if your looking for a good horror game to play by yourself or with friends!

12254,"This is a great horror/thriller game. I like that this game doesn't have any jump scares. I HATE jump scares, but even when you're being hunted and see the manifestations of the ghosts, there's many signs that its coming for you. I had seen in some play throughs on YT some people were able to buy walkie talkies and so far I haven't even seen them available in the shop. Thats a pretty big bummer, especially when youre using in game chat and not steam chat or discord. Aside from that this game is great!! Highly recommend playing with friends - would be great at LAN parties."
12255,ratio
12256,It's very scary and also super fun to play with friends c:
12257,"If you have your blinds closed, this game can def be scary. will def play this game even more"
12258,very fun to play and its very entertaining
12259,Really enjoy this game and it is even more fun when you play with your friends. Definitely recommend!
12260,spooky scary women on the floor
12261,I love how its a spooky game but it isn't scary. Its a good mix of mystery and thrill at the same time. Even when the ghost is hunting and you possibly die your still having fun with it. The only thing i dislike about it is how its such a big game it lags your game some. I personally cant play it on full screen or ill be froze in one spot for 5 minutes and then dead on the ground from the ghost when it unfreezes.
12262,cool
12263,L
12264,good
12265,So i went to africa to eat meat infront children who were straving most of them died and then i pulled up in my kidnapp van with the children tied up in the van and played some phasmophobia its a pretty good game for kidnapping children who are straving and african yes
12266,"I enjoy playing this game.  It has both a great single player game and a multiplayer game.  It is just the right amount of scary.  No game is the same, There are many ghosts and maps. The addition of the cursed items are great (even if my personal least favorite is the music box).  I will continue to play this game!!!!  Absolutely Love it"
12267,"i like how people literally storm the house at the beggining of a mission but then 10 minutes later the last guy living is just scared to even enter the house and fights for his own life, and getting scared by just some pixels on the screen made by some graphic designer...

although pretty good coop game 10/10"
12268,spend my time working with the ghost and make my freinds get scared from light off/on and random items throwing
12269,Love this game!!! Don't play it in the dark though!!!
12270,nice
12271,Very good game to play with friends
12272,"Best played with someone in VR. Also played well with someone in general. You don't need friends to play, which is great for me. For a fun lil secret, look behind you when you're in the lobby, and open the locker on the left. :)"
12273,/
12274,"Pretty fun, if you have spare underwear. I had to stop playing for a couple months because i ran out of non-streak underwear."
12275,"very fun 
with friends
"
12276,scary
12277,It is a very fun game to play with friends and winning is always satisfying. Wish there were more maps.
12278,mommy pick me up im scared
12279,"I love this game. (Understatement). I simply cannot get enough of it. I go to sleep and I dream about Phasmophobia. I wake up and I think about Phasmophobia all day every day. I am afraid that I'm either going to become an adrenaline addict or fry my own amygdala. Maybe both, who knows. Oh goody, so worth it! The ambiance of this game is dang near perfect- I hear so many of the creepy sounds throughout my everyday life causing me to daydream more about it. Honestly that part feels a bit unfair. I can't sit in a squeaky chair without going into fantasy horror ghost land. I also tend to be a bit more jumpy around the house when someone surprises me around a corner, or my cat is hiding my closet. Phas seriously has made my life more fun and exciting in a lot of ways outside of gameplay. I listened to the Ghostbusters theme song 5 times yesterday before 11 AM. I ain't afraid of no ghost! >:o 

While my fears of becoming an actual adrenaline addict and frying my fight-or-flight response are very real- in the case that my house is ever haunted, I feel that I would be able to handle the situation with more ease and less sheer panic after diving headfirst into this game. I also have only played solo or with one other person, which I now realize is not the most popular way to play this game. It may be terrifying to play solo, but you really only rely on yourself/have all equipment available to you at all times. It's also kind of a birch tree to walk back and forth to the van on your lonesome constantly with those pesky 3 inventory slots. BUT! Sanity drainage is a lot slower, and I feel that I get hunted less/can complete all objectives much faster while playing solo. I also might be a glutton for pain, so take my advice with a grain of salt. All I'm saying is that I never died playing solo. *Shrugs*

I hope that I don't get tired of this game, it truly is one of the most unique experiences I've had while playing video games. Actually, it's one of the most unique experiences when it comes to horror that I've ever had- and I'll just say that nothing does it for me anymore- but THIS GAME DOES. Over and over and over again. Maybe if I get tired of playing this on my PC, I'll opt for VR and experience this game the way it should be (probably 100x more terrifying). A+++++++. Thank you Devs :'-)"
12280,"i'm new to this game, it scared the hell out of me but it's the best ghost hunting game so far"

12302,"Super spooky, extremely fun to play with friends. I this game only during daylight."
12303,GOD
12304,"Highly recommend, very scary, but below are the things I wish to implement in further updates:
1. multiple death ways, meaning the ghost can hang a player, break his head into the wall and other to scare alives.
2. The ritual - the way to finally kill the ghost - very hard to do and only after fully identifing ghost, well payed
3. Random stories in each house depending on the ghost - random diary notes, books, photos, phones - everything which could give us a background random story about the current ghost - how he died, what he did etc."
12305,very wow big fun

12319,yea its alright recommend it
12320,I like how you are able to interact and have fun with the really nice community. however it would be better if there was a friending system that may allow others to find people who the have recently played with and have a invite system through the game as well.
12321,Did a 30 minute run to find a ghost type and do some pop quiz with them
12322,i like how you have to talk to the ghost.
12323,played my first tarot card and hanged man was the first thing I pull. good job game

12326,"Pretty good game to play with friends. Lots of fun with some predictable scares and pretty easy to play too. Plus, they're updating it regularly with new content which makes it more interesting"
12327,cant sex ghost :(
12328,One of the best games I played. Even tho its a horror game when you played for around 20 hours I promised its not that scary its just you get nervous when playing. That's it have fun for the new comers.
12329,I speak with ghosts
12330,spoopy ghost
12331,"It's scary how much fun this game is

I don't normally play horror games as I'm usually too scared to jump into them but this ones just too much fun to put down. 

VR adds a whole nother level to the scare factor and is definitely worth jumping into. Also happy to report that this works perfectly with Questlink so you can freak out without worry of damaging your PC."
12332,This game is an absolute adrenaline rush playing with friends
12333,so much fun to play with friends!!! gotta love a good spoop! cant wait for new maps!!!

12335,made me have really bad diarrhea but it was fine also i think i have ibs
12336,Scary but Fun
12337,terrible game
12338,"As many others have said: this game is good with friends. My daughter and I played this and had fun! It can be a slow game, at times. There's a bit of ""let's do this and wait to see what happens"". That's not bad, but if you're hoping for non-stop action, you may be a bit disappointed. 

I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys spooky games, having fun with friends/family, and fans of shows like [i ]Ghost Hunter [/i]."
12339,got killed by a dead person 10/10 game
12340,Scary and fun

12351,"This game is the perfect mix of platforming and story with a nice focus on combat to accommodate those aspects. If you are a big fan of the classic super smash brothers, death stranding, and call of duty modern warfare 2 then I think that this game is for you."

12363,Uniquely fun and addicting. Horrible UX.
12364,despite my potato laptop it looks good
12365,"Game is amazing.  I'm a p#ssy at horror games, but Phasmophobia is different.  The way it scares people doesn't just involve jumpscares and weird noises, it's the ambience and suspense that truly make it a masterpiece in the horror genre.  I'm very happy a game like Phasmophobia exists.  But let me tell you, don't go thinking VR is similar; it's absolutely not xD"
12366,"I love this game, I basically only play with my partner because other friends get busy. I would play for so much longer, my partner's limit seems to be 3 houses. Either way I would suggest it, I get terrified but keep wanting to play."
12367,Sacraficed my cousin... Id say its a good game

12401,heckin spooky
12402,Super fun. Takes a little bit to get used to the controls and has the right amount of difficulty. Truly scared me at some points and has made more want to play more PC games.
12403,scary ass game
12404,"I think peed myself a little bit, I also enjoy turning off the light to scare my friend and pretend it was the ghost!!"

12411,The only thing separating newbies to the pros is just experience. Paying attention to which each ghost usually does is a dead giveaway as to what ghost it is to pros. Very easy to learn and very fun to play with friends.
12412,its pretty good... spoopy
12413,Ghosts are pretty scary man
12414,"welcome back, i've got some jobs ready for you"

12426,"Overall cool, but shit isnt true to the fight with the light that when it is on, the psyche goes down less, this shit is true because when I turned on the light, my mental health is still fucked up"
12427,it is cool cuz you can kill your friends by voodoo dolls
12428,ghoast was in shower help
12429,its a good game for as far as i know
12430,KINDA scary but still fun. And with friends its EXSTRA fun
12431,"This game, is outstanding, I don't even know where to start. I only have 300 hours but am at level 1100 because of how addicting and different every mission can be at times, some frustrating, some fast, some slow, some fun, but the game never gets repetitive. All the little secrets make the game that little bit better knowing what every little thing means and how to react to it really shows how much time the devs put into this game and to think this only started out as a one-man job and is doing better than better than triple A studio games puts into perspective how amazing this game is."
12432,Probably the most erotic and sexual game i have ever played. My penis was erect as soon as i started the game. 10/10
12433,"SO SPOOKY THOUGH.

Despite it's shoddy interactivity with tools/objects it's extremely thrilling.
Wouldn't advise playing if you don't like the idea of seeing someone snapping their own neck in a dark living room."
12434,"VeRy GoOd, VeRy NiCe!"
12435,yes
12436,shit game i wanna kms
12437,hahaha
12438,"[b]TL:DR -Phasmophobia is just an all around great game, it defined a new genre for scary games that is a winning formula.[/b] 

I am level 1212 currently with 302 hours, and can honestly say that while you get used to the jump scares and such, the most fun part of this game is teaching people that are new to the game, letting them make the same mistakes that you did until they ask you a question where you can give the insight that you have gained over your play time.

[b][u]Some pro's for this game:[/b][/u]
-Fun gameplay that you can play with friends up to 4 players. (my sweet spot is 2 players)
-A variety of maps
-Many ghosts (doubled since release)
-Active Developers that care about their game and the vision that they have for it.
-Difficulty levels for those who want the hardcore experience, or there is also a noob friendly difficulty.

[b][u]Some Cons:[/b][/u]
-The Developers have a vision that I can respect, but I always hoped they would add Steam Workshop support, which they have actively said they will not. I respect their decision but feel that the maps and ghosts the community could add would make this game immortal like gmod.
-When you have 4 experienced ghost hunters, you tend to find the ghost out very quickly with little to no danger to yourselves.
-The game can get a little boring or even a little annoying on some of the bigger maps just looking for the ghost for 10 minutes.

[b][u]Additional Comments:[/b][/u]
-You can spice up gameplay by limiting yourself and ally's, such as trying no evidence runs, or trying to get all of your equipment back to the van before leaving.
-The ghosts they have been adding have all had really cool abilities and unique gameplay. Although some ghosts could use an update such as the Spirit which doesnt have any strong ability only a negative ability.

Overall with 302 hours I would definitely recommend this game with a 9/10 score."
12439,love it
12440,gud game
12441,iot is a very fun social game to play with friends
12442,"great game great mechanics amazing game, you really need a lot of skill to play this game im literraly can do this on amateur solo..."
12443,"The only game I know where I can summon a ghost to kill my friends. 

p.s.: And the doors are very ""bugless""."
12444,-
12445,The only game where you can summon a ghost at your mates and laugh. 10/10 would recommend

12489,I don't really know I know the dev team is small but this game is kinda odd there isn't really a ton to it its the same few maps and a couple of difficulties the only thing that isn't super lack luster is the amount of ghost you can possibly get. I do feel this game is good for a certain amount of time and it is really good for anyone who has a group of people to play with as random ques are for some reason toxic or no one speaks. I didn't even know you could beat a mission without speaking in-game but I guess it's possible.

graphics is ok, but nothing special.
some of the effects like screaming or ghost effects are preatty good.
it can get boring very quickly after you discover all the stuff game can offer.
after like 20+ hours game can get repetetive. 
buy only if you have friends to play it with."

But I don't leave the truck anymore!  The truck is safe!  Listen up devs.....don't you unsafe the truck! You hear! The truck is base! The truck is safe!

12605,ogga booga
12606,Its the best Moving Company/Thief Simulator i played so far. Has a big downside tho that being those ghost beings with can be very annoying at times not letting u take their stuff without defending it and at times killing u aswell. But it is rewarding to see all the stuff u stole from a dead person. Also i can talk greatly about football

12640,"I hate this game so much because of the jump scares. Also... the characters you can play as... ,as well as the ghosts during the haunts, are designed in a way that makes everything so much creepier, because they look just human enough, but not quite right, so you know something is off."

His dog came in and joined the raping party. we played together the next day and because of his gaped ass, when he got to scared, shat himself. Thats how i got my revenge. Thanks phasmophobia"
12672,"The game is scary at first before you know the limits of what a ghost can do, so go get hunted and die. After that its very fun to play with friends- and even better when you kill one of them with a tarot card 60 seconds into a map.

10/10"
12673,"Ran into a house playing music, made the ghost angry, I hide in a bathroom, hears distant screams of friends, sits there quietly contemplating choices, ghost chills out, take pictures of dead bodies for money, get to the front door with my friend, shut the door on his face, ghost kills him, he screams, then apologizes for breaking our eardrums, I leave with photos of my friends bodies and a crucifix."

12727,Not a game I can play 24/7 but it's a hell of a game to play with friends or strangers whenever you're board for a few hours.
12728,ghost so spoopy
12729,best game ever its so fun and a scarry that i cant stop playing
12730,the game is scawy
12731,"k
"
12732,"Game is ok, community is toxic as hell. If you're not getting your ears raped by a 10 year old using a stupid robot voice, you're having to listen to mysogynistic assholes latch on to anyone with a female sounding voice demanding to know their age and location and wanting to send dick pics. It's a shame because when playing with a full group of socially funtional adults this game is great. Apparently the problem is that this game mainly attracts the ""yelling racist and homophobic insults at the imaginary ghosts"" demographic.

Finding a lobby worth staying in is a mini-game all by itself. You have AFK hosts, TTV yaks who play solo but create an MP lobby to do it, people who are waiting for their friends but instead of using a private lobby decide to be a-holes and use public, lobbies created purely for the purpose of being used as a voice chat room, lobbies where everyone else is on Discord and refuses to use the in-game voice, lobbies full of 10-year old trolls who deliberately get their team killed...

If you want to play ""Find a decent lobby simulator"" this game is 100% for you. If you want to actually play Phasmaphobia, just wander around your house with the lights turned off and have a friend whisper creepy things to you in the dark. It's cheaper and easier."

It can be hard in the beginning but once you understand how the game works its so much fun!

12750,"I really enjoy this game, it can get a bit repetitive sometimes but they keep adding new things to keep you interested. This game has many Easter eggs and and fun hidden tidbits. 
I have never been jump scared so many times in one sitting lol. This game keeps you interested and when friends join its even better."
12751,yes
12752,This game slaps harder than Will Smith.
12753,Get the ghost
12754,"One of the best ghost hunting games out there. Twice as fun with friends, and triple the fun with vr! Recommend to anyone a fan of ""scary games"""
12755,very spooky very nice yesyes
12756,It's an amazing horror-survival game that can scare you
12757,W game
12758,If you are bored with friends this is the game it can be fun and a amazing experice with your pals
12759,gost game good 👍
12760,I love shitting myself on a daily basis bc of this game 10/10 if you like spooky games this is for you.
12761,"Not A game I would typically play, but in the end I found myself VERY grabbed by the dynamic adventures the game has to offer.
A total change of pace for me as I normally play FPS games, and the mood the game sets is very relaxing.
That is until you are being hunted !
I feel when seeking a ghost, it would be terrifying to have MORE confusing and misleading apparitions or noisy encounters.
Perhaps Multiple Ghosts with a longer list of optional objectives.
It would be very scary to be able to communicate with one of the dead, intelligently to help you understand who else (Ghosts) is in the house with them. 
Just a longer game mode where there are breadcrumbs to help discover the OTHER ghost that refuses to communicate!
I do not expect this to happen but there is my perspective for my long-game players!
With 56 hours in 2 weeks, Great game overall!"
12762,It scary T^T
12763,Funni ghost hehe
12764,shit my pants many times
12765,ghost hunting god
12766,I like playing with friends idk i ghost hunt in real life so this is dope
12767,great ghost game
12768,Just Get it do minimal research for best experience 10/10
12769,where is my flashlight
12770,this game is so addictive i've played for so long in such little time i think i now have phasmophobia
12771,"Hmm good game but, when i asked the ghost if it liked Pokemon he said no :("
12772,"It is a good game, good way to troll your friends and have a good time"
12773,fun
12774,scary but fun
12775,if you have bad pc turn down resalution or dont get it :)

12779,THIS IS GOOD! I hate horror games and I cant stop playing
12780,"no matter how many times i weeped and begged for the ghosts to give me that metaphyiscal ungodly head through the voice box... i never got it. 0/10
actually the ghost did grab me from behind once... 10/10"
12781,Boo
12782,Good game to play with friends. very thrilling and makes me about shit my pants sometimes.
12783,"i love the game very scary but i would love to see more maps. like a cematary or the warren mueseum, or a old church or hotel. or castle maps like these would be fantastic. really fun horror game to play with friends
"
12784,"Being viciously mauled by a spooky specter while my friends take photos for insurance money is my favorite form of gameplay. 10/10, would be ripped apart by those meaty ghost hands anytime. Highly recommend if your friends hate horror, makes their shrieks of cowardice all the more sweet."
12785,"It's always funny to me when games like this capture my attention despite inferior graphics, silly movements, and pretty basic game play. Maybe that's what makes this title so good, I can't really say, but what I can say is that I am over 200 hours into playing this game and haven't gotten sick of it once. There is nothing like doing a fun ghost hunt with a beer and some friends on a Friday night. I would consider myself a pretty experienced ghost hunter at this point but when I first started playing it was quite terrifying going into the house and even more so after the ghost went on a hunt, you don't want to go back in. Please give this a try, it only gets better with every update they release!"
12786,made me suffer a stroke. 10/10 would recommend
12787,Very scary made me shit myself once also dont be a dick to the ghost they take it personally. ;)
12788,goodgame
12789,It's a good concept but the controller support is limited. I found myself switching between keyboard and mouse. Single Player seems a bit boring too i can't comment on multiplayer as i didn't try it but i'd imagine you would need too play it with friends or make friends too really enjoy.
12790,it sucks ass

12818,"This is a 1. We went out of our way to go to this place expecting great food. It was gag inducing awful. The burgers were rancid. Fries were over cooked. Place was dirty. Waitress was sweet but I would not recommend this place for dog food. $100 for 4 burgers, a loaded fries, and 4 Dole Whips that weren’t really Dole Whips. The drinks were ok, but more like a slush rather than Dole Whips.

"
12819,fun!
12820,e
12821,I called the ghost a bunch of very nice things!!! and it got mad at me and hugged my face
12822,"Fun, also hard to get money after you lost all your stuff and have no money left after you spent it all on smudge sticks. I spent like 3k on smudge sticks. Also spooky"
12823,waaa
12824,really scary game i love this game i come back to it every now and again with friends
12825,"spooky innit, dont play with min"
12826,"Its really creepy!! Especially when the ghost responds when you ask the spirit box ""Where are you"" and it says ""Behind You!!!!"" This is better to play with a group of people but 2 people work fine for the smaller houses. But you need more people for the High School and Asylum and places like that. FUN GAME!!"

"
12843,This is one of the most boring games I have ever tried. Clunky controls and very unimpressive.
12844,"95% of the game is dialogue with other npcs and yourself. So if you don't want to read for 30+ hours this is not the game for you. There is absolutely no combat. The RPG aspect is that you can level up different aspects of yourself like logic, reaction time, composure, endurance, etc. and as those skills come up in conversation you are having not only dialogue with the npcs but also yourself on how to proceed. It is very unique, and very awesome if you are into it. One of the most unique, thought provoking games I've ever played."
12845,Runksex i analen

12847,super fun to play with friends and hear them scream in fear lol
12848,this game is best wif friends
12849,"""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA""
-me after having my friends close the door on me and the ghost starts hunting"
12850,This games Exellent love the paronarmal doing a urbex channel my self but the down side of the game is that the ghosts come in to fast still and could do with being a bit more simulated still and a better sit in but still love the game.
12851,After 10+ hours i can say i'm definitely impressed. So much content and creative way of gameplay!!
12852,very fun when playing with friends as it makes the game hilarous i would suggest using discord to talk to your friends though
12853,spooky ooga booga game
12854,this game is super fun
12855,"This is in my opinion, the BEST multiplayer horror game, and I say this because it is a great game for messing around, roleplaying, and even just playing just getting good at the game with friends and figuring out the ghost's special abilities together. Greatly recommend! It's also always updating so there's frequently new content. Definitely worth the price!"
12856,"This game is very well designed, and great to play with friends. It has a few bugs and a bit of jank, but that is to be expected from such a small company making such a big game and generally doesn't interfere with the experience. Judging from the roadmap, it is on the track to improve even more in the coming years and is definitely worth the price."
12857,dfg
12858,its scary but really nice
12859,buy it while you can
12860,very fun and also not that scary for people that dont like scary games. i probably jumped a little bit when  i first started playing but its not that scary now lol

12871,great game to play with friends! drag along at least one that you can sacrifice to the ghost in the name of evidence
12872,have a great fun to play this game
12873,"Love the scary atmosphere of the game and the teamwork involved to complete each investigation. it can be a 
little difficult in finding a multiplayer server with people that suit your play style. Single player investigations are doable depending on which ghost is at the location and how fast you can gather evidence. Overall great game and would definitely recommend to other players."

12888,"I said would get the game to play with my mate.

best choice i have made.

go ghost  hunting with friends or on you're own.

run around different locations with friends and says stupid thing to anger the ghost, start charting around the living room.

find you're friends corpse without releasing it hunted and stay outside the door to yell at to come out, use a cross to ward of a demon, but only to get ghost wrong and get dragged off into dark.

find ghosts with funny names , some with names of celebs like getting a ghost called Emilia Clarke and then start yelling about how game of thorns is bad just can get a quick reaction from the ghost.

this game can is likely a horror comedy with you're mates and quite scary on you're own.

10/10 would make it anger the ghost again."

Also, Deogen is bae."

Might get boring after you have played a lot.

12927,"There is not a single person who can speak English, well there is but the lobbies are mixed, make a language filter for a start, also if you do find one, you get kicked because they're waiting for a ""friend"" when they're actually suppose to be hosting a private server, and the other servers just make up Russian schmucks, Germans, and a bunch of other Europeans.

The gameplay is actually pretty good, if you like the movie Insidious, you will probably like this one.

This game is perfect for friends, not very fun by yourself or with strangers in my opinion."
12928,Extremely high quality game while still being in Early Access. Developers are well knit with the community and actually considers players' opinions and wants. 10/10 would sell my legs to play this game.

12940,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

12942,👍

12955,"I feel like this game was made popular by people screaming on the internet who had no idea how to play it. The tutorial was bad. I mean real bad. I played this in VR specifically to get scared with a friend of mine (for 42 mins). The ambiance is lost when you find out the game is ""overly complicated"". Or maybe I mean convoluted. It just seems like all the things you have to do distract you from the scary aspect of the game. We felt really scared before the tutorial. During the tutorial we were so bored. Then when we started playing it and just remembered how annoying it was... Ruined it. Oh well. Maybe we should've stayed ignorant. Or watched a YouTube tutorial because the base tutorial for this game caused frustration and a bad experience. A tutorial is suppose to instruct and excite the player into wanting more. This one did not."

12957,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13029,"If you have always wanted to be a real life ghost hunter, this game will probably be the best thing you've ever played.  If not, then it is a frustratingly tedious puzzle game.  I was definitely in the second camp."
13030,"Rating: Scary game and cool concept but very empty 6/10

I'm writing this review to people like myself who saw the user reviews and thought ""Wow, this game must be amazing"". I think it gets good reviews because people like the concept, that it's scary, that they can play with friends and that it's supposedly developed by 1 person (props to him/her). I also really like the concept, and I enjoyed the first hours of playing the game, but it didn't take long before I realized I had already experienced all that the game had to offer, or that I saw through the mechanics and learned how to exploit them. 

After playing 1 level you have basically played all the levels. The maps gets bigger, but they are all extremely empty and there's very few things you can interact with. Your character walks extremely slow, and there's almost no difference in speed between walking and sprinting. It feels like 90% of the action happening are the lights going out, and you having to find the power generator to turn it back on. 

I've played the game with different groups of people, and most of them have struggled with the interface and controls which feels weird and clunky. Two of them didn't even get to play the game because of a bug that wouldn't let the game accept their mic input.

However I think 10$ for a couple of hours of fun is worth it, so I would encourage people to buy it and try it out, but I wouldn't really recommend it after that."
13031,This game is absolutely incredible! It's very well made and you can definitely get a scare from these ghosts! I definitely recommend that you play with friends because it's more fun and you have less chances of dying.
13032,its very very pro
13033,great game love it
13034,"None to very little activity for 15 minutes, even after calling the ghosts name. Friend asks ghost if she wants to talk about sex. Activity goes from 0 to 10 and he is instantly killed.  10/10 would ask Carol if she wants to talk about sex again."
13035,Very cool game. I have shit my pants many times.
13036,Badass game also fun to mess with your teammates during the ghost hunting

13068,They keep adding more content that is shallow and meaningless while the base content languishes. In a year it's not meaningfully changed and still remains the worst optimized game I've ever played while looking like one of the worst at the same time.

13070,"This game genuinely improved my life. I met a group of people who became my friends. I started using snapchat because of those friends, which allowed to start talking to old friends. An old friend is the reason why I saw a doctor, which got me diagnosed with anxiety. Because of this game my anxiety is being treated, I am willing to talk to people, I have friends."

13084,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

13101,My buddy & I have been hearing about this game for a while but we put it off. We finally decided to give it a shot and so glad we did. This game was not what I imagined it would be. I am so glad it is far better than expected. There's no game out there right now that compares to this. I can see myself playing this for a very long time. The Dev's have been doing a great job from what I hear and the community is happy.

13122,scared out of my mind good game with the boys
13123,The game is not scary. It is a horror game that is not scary (Fairly common unfortunately). On pc it was only scary the first time until I saw the ghosts and saw how underwhelming they are in every way including when they jumpscare. In Vr the environment is always scary which makes it more playable but still man the stupid ghosts are just so lame man like this game ain’t a horror game. The randoms I have played play the game with play it like if it were a speedrun or just try hard so much and completely ruin the immersion. Bro this is supposed to be a horror game not call of duty. Anyways I wish I could get my money back but I have come back so many times hoping they would make the ghosts actually at least somewhat of a thrill but to no avail.
13124,yes
13125,Mom pick me up im scared
13126,"This game goes to this scenario

1: Play with your friends
2: Absolutely dominate your pants from ghost events

5: Troll yoru friends to death!!!

This game has changed so much and im loving the state of it now so I cant even imagine how its gonna be in the future. Im telling u this game will inspire people to ghost hunt its that good. Worth every penny honestly. Its such a good time with friends especially friends that are scaredy cats. And if  you dont have friends this game is a weird but probably good way to make some. I can go on for a while about everything I like but no just know this game is good. overall 9/10"

edit: I am no longer sprinting to the front door, I now have the courage to try to take a picture of the ghost and die. The people on this game are genuinely some of the nicest I've found in a video game and have always helped me out. I learn something every time I join a new lobby, and playing with randoms is an equally enjoyable experience as playing with friends. Even if you have nobody to play with, there will likely be some rooms you can join (which tend to be higher difficulty, which is usually fine after you have some hours under your belt). I wholeheartedly would recommend this game, it is likely the best co-op game I have ever played."

There is alot of hidden stuff and items you can find to help you like the cursed mirror and the voodoo doll. i would definitely recommend playing with a friend the proxy chat and the muffled screaming you can hear from the other side of the house is hilarious. All in all its a very good game and would recommend to everyone who likes scary games.

Just don’t play it before you go to take a shit or you’ll never be able to return that chair"
13281,I love the replay-ability of the game. No two rounds are the same and it makes it enjoyable.
13282,"I frickin love this game. This game actually got me hooked on researching all the different ghosts in phasmophobia since there’s so many I haven’t heard of. Multiplayer is a blast in this game since my friends are all crackheads playing this. Now I don’t really have much to complain about this game because I’ve been playing it since like January of 2021, but I have some ideas that I hope you could take into consideration. Now I won’t be surprised if the twins, mimic, onryo, and raiju will be the last new ghosts, but if they aren’t, I have one that I would like to consider adding to the game. And that is a gwisin, which means spirit/ghost in Korean. Gwinsin’s in Korean culture have already been known to drain peoples sanity and posses the living, so that can already be an advantage with the gwisin being able to drain sanity in the game. And for evidence, maybe like spirit box, fingerprints, and dots if that’s a possible combination of evidence, but I think you should at least have spirit box. BUT gwinsin’s are unable to see, BUT it can move even faster than revenant’s and raiju’s and can also hear incredibly well, like can even hear your footsteps from really far away and can hear you close doors. And they can also sense if you’re near too, so standing still won’t work because then the ghost will be essentially useless if it was unable to do that. Now for maps, I had like 2 or 3 ideas. I think for one you should do an elementary or middle school, now I know you guys have brownstone, but I think another medium size map would be nice with like an elementary school, and even something like a playground could count as a ghost room. Another idea for a map and I know it sounds stupid, but a restaurant or diner. There wouldn’t be a lot of possible ghosts rooms other than the kitchen, storage closet, bathroom, and dining area, but maybe. Another idea for me would be an amusement park. I know all these ideas sound crazy and it would be too much to explore, but I was thinking it could be big like maple lodge and have a Ferris wheel and carousel and games and stuff. These are all just suggestions though. You don’t have to take any of these ideas, but if you see this review, could you please maybe take consideration for any of these ideas? But anyways, love this game, love everything about it. 5 stars"

13300,"Phasmophobia definitely has a suspenseful vibe, it constantly keeps you on your toes every time you enter the house of the supernatural being your hunting. Very solid game with many good aspects to it, the quality of life changes that were recently added have definitely improved not only game play but also the structure of this early access game, i am excited to keep grinding this game by myself or with friends."

In a house where a ghost..."
13310,"I am a 46 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 32 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

13390,"

i like Phasmophobia great game 10/10 would get again but if you getting it for VR i have a few problems the biggest problem i want to talk about for VR. The game some times freezes/crashes when you die. If it doesn't load in a few minutes you have to exit the whole game this sucks when playing public lobbies with fun players. Minor issue the video camera when you place the video camera (tripod or not) the camera will be/look closed even if a PC player puts it down for you. The last don't need much explaining the van loading screen for when you end the game with just shake your screen rapidly and some times ( i only had this happen once) some tools won't load in unless a player drops it down for you.I would love to see these fixed!"
13391,Play
13392,"ghost called me mommy i got horny 
"
13393,I frequently jerk off to the ghosts
13394,Holy Smokes! Wow! Phasmophobia. Let me tell you a little bit about it. Never mind. I forgot.

13401,"Phasmophobia is an incredible game, and I play it all the time with friends. It took some time to learn the basics, but with some help from youtube videos, it opened up a world of possibilites!"
13402,i feel like buzfeed unsolve
13403,"its a fun game to play with frends and have a ghostly time lol
"
13404,"This game creates fun memories through funny and scary moments. Calling the ghost's name and immediately the lights turn red. Or that time when I was trapped in the bathroom with my friend whispering as the ghost hunted. Ah yes good times. 

The game is a little janky, but that's to be expected with indie games. It has come FAR from it's humble beginnings. I always looked forward to the new updates."

13447,"This is an awesome game, especially playing with others. It has a lot of parallels with real ghost hunting, especially the equipment. I like how it doesn't have a large convoluted story like other horror games I have played. It has a bunch of smaller frights instead of one large jumpscare too, so I feel less hesitant to play the game, as I don't worry about being completely terrified when I die to the point of turning the game off. There is also evidence and deduction gameplay to figure out the type of ghost that round. 9/10 if you are by yourself, 10/10 with others."

13452,Great game. I'm still pretty scared of everything and I try to stay in the van as much as possible. It's a very spooky game. I definitely enjoy playing it with a few close friends. We have a blast. I'm not really a fan of horror games or jump scares but playing with friends makes it fun.

Tried it in the past and didn't like it but, that was more the group I was in, so having the right people is key.

Also, I don't suggest playing for more than 3 hours as it does become repetitive after a while and isn't as scary as the first hour or so."

I really enjoy this game, really fun to play whit friends and not to scary, you will probably poop your pants the first couple of times you play it, but you will get used to all the ghost events, creepy sounds in the spirit box and parabolic microphone and all the other fun things the ghost will do.

13534,ed caluag simulator pero naka nightmare
13535,"Сделать страшную игру очень сложно, а сделать страшную совместную игру практически невозможно. Но ""Phasmophobia"", разработанная всего одним человеком, находится на пути к тому, чтобы стать одним из лучших страшных многопользовательских игр всех времен. Как это уже не раз случалось в последние годы, независимая разработка игр показала, что вам не нужны бесконечные деньги и сотни людей, чтобы сделать запоминающийся титул. С хорошей идеей, большим творчеством и большим упорством, все еще можно создать отличную игру.
Phasmophobia - это игра ужасов с совместным режимом до четырех игроков, в которой цель состоит в том, чтобы исследовать место с привидениями. Эта игра использует гораздо более сдержанный и мрачный подход. Как только вы прибудете на место своей миссии в своем грузовике, который удваивается как командный мост, вам скоро будет дана ваша миссия: ваша основная миссия всегда состоит в том, чтобы определить, с каким призраком вы имеете дело, и вам также будут даны три случайно сгенерированные цели для выполнения.
И без того подавляющая атмосфера в первые несколько часов хождения только усиливается тем фактом, что мы действительно не знаем, что, черт возьми, мы должны делать. Мы получим и позже используем деньги, которые зарабатываем на выполнении миссий, чтобы купить оборудование, которые мы можем использовать, чтобы предположительно связаться с потусторонним существом, а также большое количество вспомогательных и домашних практик (соль!) для отслеживания его перемещений. Однако нам придется выяснить, как они работают, с некоторой помощью из наших заметок, которые могут быть вызваны в любое время. В противном случае мы сможем узнать о различных типах призраков и их поведении, а также выполнить нашу главную задачу здесь.
В первые несколько часов вам следует ожидать высокого сердечного ритма и нескольких страшных моментов, так как вы будете чувствовать себя потерянным среди случайных призраков, неизвестных путей и средств, а миссии не раз заканчиваются смертью. Тем не менее, Я бы определенно рекомендовал попытаться разобраться в игре самостоятельно, и только в крайнем случае за помощью извне. Одной из основных сущностей игры является знакомство с особенностями и картами, и даже самые страшные моменты связаны с ними, поэтому это может нанести ущерб опыту, если вы отправитесь в приключение полностью подготовленным.
Phasmophobia - это в основном приключенческая детективная игра на тему ужасов, где вам предстоит разгадать ту же загадку о том, с каким призраком вы имеете дело, основываясь на собранных вами уликах. Поскольку это довольно случайно, и существует довольно много типов призраков, поскольку обстоятельства всегда меняются. Искусственный интеллект призраков хорошо написан, так как они действительно ведут себя беспорядочно и имеют в своем репертуаре немало страшных сюрпризов. Помимо глушения света и вмешательства в объекты, они могут напугать людей с более слабыми нервами, просто случайно появляясь, но они также могут вызвать некоторые отчетливо запоминающиеся моменты с использованием объектов взаимодействия.
Я определенно должен упомянуть распознавание голоса в качестве основной функции игры. Phasmophobia слушает вас все время, пока вы играете, и вам, безусловно, нужно будет общаться с загробной жизнью, чтобы вызвать некоторых призраков. Вы даже можете получить ответы на свои вопросы, поговорив по радио, что может создать несколько удивительно захватывающих ситуаций. Это может быть довольно парализующим, когда, после долгой попытки ответить на вопрос ""Где ты?"", монотонный мужской голос по радио отвечает ""За тобой!"", сидя на корточках в темной детской комнате (с пугающем до ужаса медведем). Именно такие моменты делают атмосферу по-настоящему потрясающим, а ее уникальные особенности надолго запомнят эти моменты. Темперамент потусторонних персонажей в игре сильно варьируется, поэтому вы можете столкнуться с атакующим призраком почти сразу, но вы также можете завершить миссию без каких-либо серьезных упырей. Поскольку оружия нет, то от ужаса стоит спрятаться
Phasmophobia в настоящее время доступна в раннем доступе, но если вы немного поклонник ужасов и у вас есть несколько храбрых друзей, это определенно стоит попробовать. Как я уже писал выше, первоначальный хаос многое добавляет к опыту, поэтому после 15-20 часов игры, как только вы отработаете уникальные фишки, название становится менее пугающим."
13536,so cool

13568,"An Average Phasmophobia round:

P1: ""Where is the Ghost Room?""
P2: ""I dunno. Did we check the basement yet?""
P3: ""Found it! It's the Kid's Bedroom, we got negative temps. Drop the book""
P1: ""I don't have the book, P4 does""
P4: *standing there with the Spirit Box in hand* ""Are you there? What's your name? I don't have the book, P2 does, he grabbed it right before round start""
P2: ""Oh I do"" *drops book*
P4: ""Can you show us a sign? *light turns off and book has writing* Well, let's get the fuck out of here-""

THE HUNT HAS BEGUN

P1 Dies, everyone else runs, trying not to curse so they don't start another hunt.

10/10 - You'll kill your friends because you forget that the ghost doesn't like you cursing."
13569,"I recommend this game! it is extremely fun to play, especially with friends!
it can be intense; hiding, running and cowering in the corner as you're being hunted- but finding evidence and the ghosts' room is extremely satisfying!
There are, however, moments where the player can get frustrated- such as low stamina and a fast ghost or a player with low sanity and a ghost that constantly goes on the hunt the moment the player walks in.
To me, there are alot more pros than cons with this game!
but of course YOU will have to play to decide!"
13570,scarwy
13571,would be better if each ghost had its own jump scare but other than that its good and worth the money especially if you have three other idiots playin wit you

I bought the Vive a year ago and put 35 hundred hours on it. I love it. But if steam has made a better headset that works with Vive Parts please let me know OK? i really love playing vr. in Phasmophobia. i have so many friends. I am blessed to have them. God I miss my wife💔. I wish more of us old people would use to learn to use the vive.
Cheers.

13596,"This concept has so much potential but this game just misses the mark. It's just another Lunch Lady, In Silence, BigFoot, Pacify, etc. Mid to low-tier horror game that is overrated. It's best to make jokes and wait until all your friends die. And if you die first, enjoy watching your friend wander around for 20 minutes and end up not solving jack. Vr tape on just for extra measure."

13611,Good
13612,"This game is less scary than YouTubers and Twitch streamers make it seem, but it's still really fun to play with friends. I recommend playing with 3-4 people, and not taking the game too seriously. Glhf!"
13613,The game isn't too scary once you get used to it but it's still really fun to play with your friends. If only the deaths were more scary.

13644,"Jogo muito engraçado e da medinho as vezes. em questão de mecânicas e gameplay é muito bom e ainda não encontrei um bug muito ruim. rodou liso e tenho certeza que em um grupo de mais pessoas seria muito mais divertido, com tudo, recomendo fortemente testarem a experiência ;)"

13648,great game
13649,"10/10 the game ever.
been playing it non stop with my mates and it gave all of us a severe fear of that godforsaken cursed mirror due to my friend having an obsession with it and breaking the thing. same goes for the summoning circle that made the poltergeist so mad that it flipped a table.
also dont ask the ghost if its french or a minor it will tell you to kill yourself instantly."

13663,AWESOME GAME
13664,Very fun
13665,l
13666,it is very scary when you have just started playing it but you will get the hang of it. Once you know what you are doing it is less scary as you understand what is happening. I highly recommend this game. I really enjoyed playing it and it is very satisfying when you figure out what the ghost is. For beginners I highly recommend you to check out the wikis first or have a veteran to play with you as it can be very confusing. It is a very cool game and I loved playing it!
13667,It gives you a rush of energy and tests your fight or flight refleces.
13668,Amazing game. I shit myself all the time.
13669,me no understand. Edit. i know understand game
13670,so leg
13671,i get jumpscared easily but this game is fun
13672,i shit my pants everytime the lights go off 10 out of 10 not NOT scary but no to scary
13673,very funny
13674,"I hate horror games. Truly detest them. However, this game provided not only some jump scares (which was great content for a VOD a friend was working on), but it also allotted a bit of humor in our ways of trying to sacrifice each other to the ghost. I know...not how the game is intended, but what fun is there in always sticking to the rules? If you have friends to play with, it's recommended even for those who (like me) do not enjoy horror/scary games."
13675,serem bgt ajg
13676,"hahhah scary

13677,"it so much fun, better with friends then doing solos.

13690,ok
13691,good
13692,to start it off I am somewhat new to pc granted it does scare you a good amount it is also really fun to play especially if you got friends to hunt ghosts with you. normally i do not play games like this by myself but all in all i would recommend it if your group needs something new to play
13693,very good
13694,game is so spooky my buddy brayden turned gay!

13727,"[b] TLDR: Great Game, mediocre Community [/b]

Highly recommend to either play with friends or Look for a group in discord
Just came back from 2 years not gaming and my first interactions were

1. join Lobby > get kicked
2. ppl begging for money or games or being intentional weird upon hearing my voice
3. racism (i joined a english lobby and said hello guys and my name showed GER > called me the N*** word and kicked me)
4. Sweaty players (like actually tryharding, screaming at me for no reason other than me trying to have some fun)

This was a real bummer. Once i joined the Discord tough and looked for a Group, the ppl were normal Humans and i had a blast with two 14 year old kids and their mom. Something u can only experience in these kind of games i think.

Just to clarify these were interactions i had over a timespan of a 2 hour season.

Maybe i was just unlucky but 2 friends of mine had similar experiences specially regarding racism - mostly from spanish, russin and france ppl and from occasion some English speaking Player"

The ghosts heve been sceering me in vearius degrees but the Banchees seems to hate me the most.

with regular uppdates, weard bugs that can help or murder you. I have found this game to be a happy horror medium to play with friends. Would not play by my self.

Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)

13749,"Super fun, spooky and entertaining! Can be very buggy and it can crash which is one of the reasons I don't play as much anymore... This game is better with friends and the community isn't as bad as most games!"
13750,zzzzzz
13751,SPOOKY.
13752,this game is awesome
13753,big fun to grind out. Would recommend using a gamer girl name to attract people into your lobbies on public if you do not want to wait.
13754,seru
13755,best game ever
13756,its fucking horror!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

13759,Phasmophobia really gave me Phasmophobia.
13760,Great game. Friends needed to play :(
13761,"This game is so damn fun.

Way more complicated and deeper than I thought. Amazing. I reached level 100+ after just a few days of playing. The only thing I dislike is how public lobbies are designed. It's such a tedious process to have to look for a lobby or create it yourself, there should be just an instant button that queues you into a random game. That's a better system IMO!
"
13762,"great game, keeps me entertained, and cant wait for the new map and design"
13763,"I like this game a lot, it's more funny if you play with your friends but even single is nice!
I recommend this game!"
13764,good
13765,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

13778,"You definitely need friends for this, makes the game way more fun"
13779,"PROS:
Excellent game with tons of replayability
Top tier Co-op horror game (Team of 4)
Lots of ghost diversity, Lots of Items
Fun for casuals with massive skill ceiling
Excellent Ghost AI 
Great Dev team with regular updates
9.5/10 horror strategy game, highly recommend 

CONS:
Takes time to learn ghosts, items, objectives. SLOW TO START
You never exorcise the ghosts, the entire game is about Identifying them
Map pool can get old (about 10 maps)
Needs more jump scares and death animations
Should be a difficult easter egg to exorcise the ghost (similar to killing Jason in Friday the 13th)

OVERALL:
Excellent game, highly recommend.
Horror Co-op game fans will love this game, comparable to Friday the 13th and Dead by Daylight
Updated regularly with a competent Dev team
Greatly programmed AI playing the ghost
Horror Mystery Strategy game
Please add a way to exorcise the ghost for experienced players, also a double barrel shotgun that shoots salt to stun the ghost or reset it would be sweet, food for thought !
Buy this game."

13781,I really love this game I play it alot with friends and on my own. Fresh content and changes come and makes the game feel like new. Totally worth
13782,"I've been playing this game for a few years now, and the devs keep on developing the game to be more challenging and engaging. The addition of cursed objects and nightmare mode has made the game much more creepier and fun as well."
13783,fun game
13784,"I hardly ever review games, but this game is really fun.
For an early access game, I am blown away by their attention to detail. I am looking forward to what this game will become as it becomes more stable. Good work!"
13785,yes
13786,I love this game you can meet nice people but there are some mean people just because you're a new player and they only care what level your but overall it's  really fun game definitely recommend
13787,"I told the ghost I sh!t myself, he told me to leave and never come back 11/10 scared the ghost with my explosive diarrhea."
13788,Great game. lots of fun with groups of friends or randos.
13789,A good horror game doesn't need jump scares.

13792,scary game
13793,"I was having fun playing this game until i came across a lobby hackers. One person was even level 4,263. one guy keep dying on purpose so he could control the ghost. i think his name was like TREXARMYOWENS. At one he looked me and my face and said yep jonny imma kill you first. 2/10"
13794,NIG
13795,Was standing in the baby room in Tanglewood Street House and a little kid laughed in my ear and scared me more than when the ghosts breathes in my ear. 10/10 for the ghost and her little giggle and 9/10 for the game. There are things I still find frustrating with the game but overall a great game especially with the new ghosts and their idiosyncrasies.
13796,spoopy
13797,scary and fun.

13801,ooOOooOOOoOooOo
13802,scares the shit out of me! i'm always down to play some phasmophobia the thing is will you have someone else that wants to play? that's always the question the more people the better and if youre playing alone forget it because there's nothing better than hearing ur friend scared shitless of slight creeks of wood but seriously if you want the game make sure u have someone to play with because if you don't its REALLY BORING like bad i still think its a must have on steam everyone needs at least one horror game and this is a really good one ill give it a 7/10
13803,This game is a great interactive experience and it can really spook you if you play it right.
13804,scary and fun

13809,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
13810,"The community has something against new players who are just looking for fun and/or want to grow with the community. As much as I wanted to have this game in my library, I doubt I'll use it that much after experiencing the first 5 hours more on getting kicked out. Single-player isn't as fun as playing with other people, but wasting hours of waiting just to get kicked out of the public lobby every time just because I'm new is not really fun.

Game is great, not gonna lie. If you have friends who have access with the game, play on private and have fun. You might meet some awesome players in the public lobbies, but you are more likely to meet screeching microphone trolls, and people who have prejudice against new players in there (if you are new). 

TLDR: Game is a 10! Don't expect anything from public lobbies though. Go private and play with friends."

13823,"As a person who has lots of  sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 4 hours in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me beacuse i have lots of sex with women alot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also am very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and beinbg handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex."

10/10 will play again."
13893,"I like everything about this game and I almost missed out on all it's glory due to me being stubborn and not listening to the many recommendations to play from my friends. Seriously play Phasmaphobia and explore every nook and cranny you can. The huge variety of Ghosts, Spirits and Entities in this game alone are impressive but the teamwork and investigation aspect are so strong and enjoyable that you will be hooked instantly. Terrific scares, objectives to complete and impressive equipment to utilize. Every game is different and every challenge is unique & fun. Play this game if you like horror thriller environments, teamwork and jump scares. HUGE RECOMMEND!!"
13894,"It's one of the better games on steam. It's well designed and can be a lot of fun when you can get into it. the only issue I have is the lack of maps. There are 10 maps, the 6 small ones are a ton of fun and don't ever get boring. the school and the prison sometimes can be pretty boring if the ghost isn't all that active. And my friends and I refuse to play on asylum, it's just too big. Campgrounds is a map that I don't really play all that often so I can't really have a valid opinion on it. The ghost themselves are a ton of fun and My group tries to play Phasmophobia at least once a week fore a few hours."
13895,very fun and gets less scary but still is enjoyable

13932,I've played this game for 7 hours and there is nothing more to do. There is only 10 maps and 3 of those maps are big and you really can't play it with 3 people. So there is only 7 playable maps that you can play with 3 people.Also there is only 2 difficulties (easy and normal) so you can't even replay those other maps with higher difficulty. In my opinion the game is not worth buying right now.

13984,"Honestly one of, if not, the best multiplayer horror games I've ever played. It's come such an incredibly long way since they've released it.

The gameplay is wonderful. The first time I heard the ambiance of inside the building I was terrified. It just creates such a unsettling, anxious atmosphere. Learning each of the ghosts and the unique traits is so fun. The game itself is a good challenge too.

I love this game!"

Send shivers down your spine
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
Seal your doom tonight
Spooky, scary skeletons
Speak with such a screech
You'll shake and shudder in surprise
When you hear these zombies shriek
We're sorry skeletons, you're so misunderstood
You only want to socialize, but I don't think we should
'Cause spooky, scary skeletons
Shout startling, shrilly screams
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won't leave you be
Spirits supernatural are shy what's all the fuss?
But bags of bones seem so unsafe, it's semi-serious
Spooky, scary skeletons
Are silly all the same
They'll smile and scrabble slowly by
And drive you so insane
Sticks and stones will break your bones
They seldom let you snooze
Spooky, scary skeletons
Will wake you with a boo!"

14039,"If you liked Paranormal Activity cuz it made you shit your pants, you will absolutely love this game. You have to detect the type of ghost, not hunt it, trap it or kill it. Your only mission is to find that out using tools like motion sensors, books the ghosts can write in, radio boxes you have to -actually talk into- (yes the game has a voice recognition program) and leave. Meantime, the ghost can fuck with you, and even go as far as to kill you if you're not careful. Amazing game bound to make you shit yourself or close enough to do so! Best played with friends (up to 4 can play together)."

Being able to solve and survive is a puzzle and this just makes you have to think on your feet with how to find, figure and run.  
This will be in my games to play forever!!!!"

14099,Nice game.
14100,I loved how life-like the graphics are and the game mechanics. I have had no problems with running the software for the game. This game gives me such an adreline rush
14101,Ghost game scary...
14102,if youre a new player youll enjoy this game a lot however it really gets boring after a while
14103,Love the Game. Spookyyy
14104,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

other than that this game is amazing."
14111,us server are the cause when using eu servers i no longer get kicked!
14112,Please play with a friend(s) because this game is h£ll by yourself. And I also don't recommend playing it at 2am and when you hear footsteps irl along with your phone buzzing because your friend is sending you memes it could give you a heart attack. Not speaking from experience.
14113,Good game. It's better to watch vids on youtube to better learn than the tutorial.

14117,This is really  fun to  play in multiplayer! We have a right laugh when  the  ghost  hunts! Its such a fun game even if you stay in the van!

No busques mas juegos que tiene la etiqueta de ""terror"" y cuando lo juegas ves que las cuevas de terraria o stardew dan mas miedo, no jodas esta vaina es buenisima, con amigos? si, de 4 personas, sin amigos? si, tambien es de singleplayer, y lo mejor es que en el tiempo que escribo esto ( 6/30/2022 ) aun no se ha terminado de desarrollar por lo que se vienen muchas cositas si que si, recomendable para los amantes del terror y de la adrenalina"

14124,It's so much fun. Easily addictive. Just started playing lastnight and I couldn't get off. All I wanted to do was keep playing. So much fun playing with others. I would 100% play this game if you have the chance.
14125,"Cool game to play with friends
"
14126,i didn't understand the basics at first and died everytime but when i started learing the basics it was really fun
14127,"absolutely amazing and terrifying game, either alone, with friends, or with randos. the ambience in the game is horrifying, and ghost events/hunts are some of the scariest shit i've experienced. the investigation aspect of the game is amazing, and trying to deduce what kind of ghost you're dealing with is extremely fun, especially when evidence is hard to come by so you try to identify ghosts based on their special/hidden abilities or strengths/weaknesses.

the devs do a FANTASTIC job at updating the game and keeping it interesting with new content and overhauls, as well. literally can't wait for the game to get out of early access. this game deserves all the love and praise it gets, and i hope it pops off like crazy again whenever it does come out of early access.

i brought this game to play with a friend on occasions and must admit i play everyday now.. phasmophobia is a great game for those who like working out information and piecing things together. i gotta say, even though ive played for quite a few hours now, the ghosts still scare you every now and then!! and with all the new updates, the game always keeps you on your feet. great game!"

Its great if you wanna scare the sh!t out of yourself, only works well in Singleplayer mode, I love this game so much xD"
14153,"I love this game so much! It is so much fun, and it will get your heart pounding lots of times. I love playing with other people but I have that there is one problem (other than a couple bugs here and there) with playing with others and it's not even the game devs fault.
If your a new player, and you join a random public lobby, 9 times out of 10 you will end up kicked for the simple fact your new. I'd love it if the game devs could do something about this, like maybe putting something where you can but tags on your public lobby and one of them be like noobs welcomed, plus adding tags will allow you to know what kind of lobby your getting into like if there doing easy or hard mod and so forth. (Just a little suggestion to make the game even better)
Even without this added to the game I would still give the game a 9/10"
14154,"One of the best in the horror game category. But the level of fear is not so much. You can have a great time with your friends. It can be played alone, but when you die, the items you get are gone. So it makes more sense to play with friends. It would be more logical to play with one or two people buying a lot of items and the other two people risking more. Even if two people in the stake die, the total property damage will be less and they can help you finish the game even when dead. Having different maps is very nice and increases the playing quality. It looks like there is some optimization issue. Still not much of a problem. It's just that the mechanics seem simple and unrealistic to me. Especially the feeling and voice of walking is very fake. Fatigue time feels very short and a bit frustrating. Other than that, it's a really great game, I would recommend it to anyone."
14155,"in playing a round with a couple friends, one of them and i were hiding in a pantry while another was outside. the friend next to me started blasting german polka through his in-game chat and the friend outside he door was heard screaming a few minutes later as he died because of it. anyways 10/10 fun game"

14208,"I love the idea of this realtor game. My friends and I have a great time showing each other around properties deciding weather or not we want to buy them. However it's a little bugged because sometimes people will just die? And like, the bodies theoretically decrease the value of the property so I don't know if that's a feature or not. The automatic doors are cool, but sometimes they don't work or they'll stay shut? The candles are a fantastic feature as well. I'm hoping they add more decorations in the future (like your own furniture) as well as allow you to replace the photos in the house. 10/10 house game"
14209,"I very much recommend this game to anyone will to play a horror game that isn't that scary, but i do have to say that my friends convinced me to get this. Phasmophobia is also the type of game where on the easiest mode you really almost never die (coming from the fact that me and my friend never die except for that 1 time where almost both of them died). this game doesn't have any issues i'm mad with which is awesome."
14210,love the game and all the ghost but it needs to have a secondary map with more places  like a second map with more places i know some of them can get boring after time with the same maps but all in all love the game

14231,"its very laggy on my computer since im only on a laptop, but i love this game! i just wish it was a little easier or to at least have practice rounds where u can play normally, except the ghost doesn't kill u or seem as scary. for me personally, its a little hard to play bc i freak out when i hear any footstep or see any ghost, so i think a practice mode would be highly appreciated!"

14246,This game is great with friends! It's really fun especially when playing in VR. I have played this game for 20 hours now and I would say it's 1000% worth your time and money. *quick note; sometimes the public lobbies can be a little toxic and or rude so just be careful.

14277,"Fun to play with friends or alone.  The ghosts are all unique which gives more replay-ability each contract.  The cursed possessions are fun and add chaos to any multiplayer game, which is great.  They can also be used in a helpful way too.  Playing alone to me seems a bit boring compared to playing with others, but that is kinda expected.  Great game would definitely recommend."

14292,"Spooky ghost sim is a great way to get online and meet more freaks like yourself, although you may just meet a bunch of 9 year old kids that flocked to this game cause they saw h20 delirious playing it on his channel. Aside from that, the devs seem to really care about making the game better so you can probably expect fresh content and bug fixes rather often. Also, if you just got the game, you should check out that cracked open door in the starting lobby"

14313,"Old Fashioned Pumpkin Pie

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

Baked Pumpkin Pie From Scratch
Cool the pie on a rack, then serve:
Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours.
Serve with whipped cream."

14541,"i never write reviews, mostly because i feel stupid doing so, but after over 2,000 levels and 400 hours i feel almost obligated to write one for phasmophobia.

this game was bought for me as a gift, and even after receiving it i had to be nudged and forced to play it. for the first hundred levels at LEAST i was a ""van andy"" and when i did happen to venture out of the van, i got in and out of the house as fast as humanly possible because everything scared the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of me. like ""drop dead in the middle of the kitchen because the ghost started hunting, even though the ghost is right on top of me"" kind of scared. as if it was a t-rex and wouldn't see me as long as i didn't move.
i admittedly still refuse to play it alone, but playing it with friends is one of my favorite past-times now. it's a GREAT coo-op game. i can wholeheartedly say that i love this game and would recommend it to someone wanting a cheap horror game that isn't too overwhelming in terms of the elements of horror it has in it. mechanically it will take a bit to get used to (especially when it comes to how certain pieces of equipment work) but it doesn't take too long to get the hang of it.

without being 'that guy', i suffer from some pretty severe depression and really awful apathy as a result - i look at my library of games and want to play nothing on most days. except phasmophobia.
phasmo is the right balance of predictable (the map layouts in particular, including where cursed possessions and power generators could be, and a defined list of ghosts that once you learn ghost personalities you can start to narrow down ghosts by what they do pretty quickly - most of the time) so that i can mostly turn my brain off, thrown down my equipment and relax but it's *just* unpredictable enough (you don't know what ghost it is right off the bat or where it could possibly be or when it could hunt, and events are at the whim of how that particular ghost is feeling that day, not to mention how spicy early demon or raiju hunts can be) to keep you on your toes and have you on edge when stuff starts to happen or you suddenly need to run for your life.
phasmo also doesn't really utilize jumpscares outside of sudden ghost events, which is an automatic win in my book and makes it better than most of the other horror games out there.

it's evident the devs are putting their heart into this game and are very good about listening to community feedback, and have been giving us more and more updates as of late, along with adding more staff to their relatively small team which i feel has slowed them down up until this point.
of course i would ""love more maps/updates more frequently"" but i can't complain about the amount of stuff we've gotten in a cheap game made by so few people. i know they're trying their hardest and that's all that matters to me.

as for criticism, i can't say i have many, except some pretty minor ones (most of which are goofy and very personal opinions), which are:
- get rid of shades.
- fine tune ghost personalities a *little* more, because having an oni that acts like a shade just isn't fun!
- consider adjusting some of the cursed possessions (honestly the only ones i care for are tarot cards, mirror and ouija) to make them more in line with each other (or potentially pair some up with others, especially ones LIKE tarot), because while i understand they all have their purpose, some are just downright boring to get (looking at you, music box). summoning circle on prison or asylum isn't great because it doesn't actually aid you in finding where the ghost is on such a large map, just in narrowing down ghost types by how fast it is or what evidence it leaves in its wake.
- the sound design has become kind of unbearable as of the most recent patch (imo) and pinpointing where something was touched or thrown from is fairly difficult at the moment on some maps (namely campsite). i can hear something *right* next to me but it winds up being in narnia instead, which is frustrating.
- ""large"" ghost rooms are painful to get, such as central path on campsite or the cellblocks on prison. i *think* that cellblock ghosts already have a right/left side classification to their room, but central path is way, way too big to make finding evidence any sort of manageable with how much ghosts wander around. from the bathrooms to the campfire shouldn't be one room. making it northern/southern central path would be better.
- i would also really, *REALLY* love a separate item slot for flashlights, which people can choose to utilize or not. i hate having a ghost in the back end of infirmary on prison and having to fumble around in the dark because i don't want to just bring *two* evidence items with me. i understand that i can make use of the lights inside the building more, which i admittedly don't do as often as i should, and that we don't want to bloat the amount of items you can carry in at one time, but this would be the biggest plus i can think of to the current game.

the long and short of it: good game. would recommend, especially with friends."
14542,"It is a fun game with friends to figure out where and what type the ghost is. Also creates funny moments while playing! As many have said before though the game lacks content. You can play it once every 3 weeks because the maps are easy to figure out after a while and new content is being pushed out slowly. If it is on sale for maybe 5 or 10 euros I would grab it, condition being you have friends to play it with. 

TL:DR: Fun to play with friends, has more potential if given more content. Wait for a sale."

14693,"In VR mode, you can use up to 3 gadgets at once, but it triples the chance of the ghost hunting you.

That's why i am always the dead one among my friends.

It would be great if they added items that we could purchase with in-game money to decorate our base or clothes since there isn't any options to spend our money except on gadgets."

Other than that its a decent OK game, but nothing special"
14703,yay
14704,spooky scary lots of fun
14705,"Surely a great game for one whose afraid of the dark, right?
Honestly though, this is one of my favorite games to play with friends! Love the modeling of the ghosts and the environments in general. As well as the unique ghosts and their behaviors are great.

Would really like to see something like subtitles added, even if it's just for Spirit box and EMF. As well as a way to use the Spirit box and Ouija board if you can't use a mic for one reason or another! 
While I would use these due to my poor auditory processing, and lack of mic. It would definitely give the game more accessibility ^^

14752,Kinda scared me when playing for first time.
14753,its very nice
14754,Are u French?
14755,It's a lot of fun to play with friends when you're just shitting around and not taking it too seriously. Singleplayer can get actually scary when left on your own.
14756,"A fun game for a group, but the community is fantastic at teaching and playing with."
14757,literally the best horror game on steam.
14758,Scary af but fun af when u got friends like I havent:)
14759,"If you're thinking if this game is worth it, it is. It's worth a thousand times its weight (when put on a thumbdrive, I don't know if this game has any physical releases).
I've played enough of this game that the usual gameplay doesn't phase me anymore, however, the game still [i]will[/i] scare the heck out of you. The design is amazing, the balance is amazing, the ambience is amazing, the maps are fun to play with, multiplayer works pretty much flawlessly, even in early access. 
The devs are super active and engage with the community a lot. I've honestly rarely seen feedback taken this well and this effectively (also CK if you're reading this, you are hilarious, love your streams <3). Yes, there are a few rough corners (emphasis on few), but this is something you [i]should[/i] experience. 11/10 would recommend to everyone.

[PS I hate horror movies, can't stand ghost stories. If I hadta watch one, I'd probably sleep with the lights on. But this game is somehow different. Even if you hate horror, give it a try, this is the good sort of horror :D]

[PS The High Priestess is Amazing and Lovely and Perfect and I love it]"
14760,"It can be really fun, and really scary. You can torture your friends by feeding em to the ghost on a silver plate, or you can argue about who's gonna talk to the ghost with the Spirit Box, Anyways, It's fun.. Unless you have no friends."
14761,"Good game to play with friends, not sure when you're playing alone"
14762,"awesome
"
14763,The added VR support makes this game a must play in VR titles. It is so immersive and even after quite a bit of playing you can start to get used to the scary feeling but its always going to be scary if you play it in VR alone. The Multiplayer is the most fun I've played in mostly any game. i highly recommend.

For the most part this is a fun game to play  with friends, and laugh about in game ghost experiences, scare your friends etc. It's got that scare factor to it but its also very light-hearted to those who are easily scared, no big jump scares  besides ghost hunts or active ghosts hunting you being the biggest thing of being a jump-scare, besides that it still give the ere spooky vibe you are looking for in a game such as Phasmophobia. Really recommend people to get this game, my only somewhat neutral thoughts is, I hope to see more changes in the future for future updates, more maps, ghosts, and possible customization for players :)"
14822,this game is very good and very realistic
14823,It's ok when your team is polite and they communicate on the radio by holding B. Otherwise it can be lonely or just plain painful.

14853,"after over 100 hours on phasmophobia i'll finally write a review. enjoy this poem basically summing up the entire game.

ahem

although the ghosts are anything but tame
phasmophobia is a beautiful game

at first you will probably be scared
only because you are unprepared
once you learn the game
(and to not say the ghost's name)
you'll discover each ghost with ease
every round will be a breeze

it helps if you learn each ghost's ability
in order to escape with more stability
for example yureis can fully close doors
sprit box + moroi drops that sanity of yours
phantoms really aren't photogenic
shades won't do squat if in the room with it

soon enough ghosts won't be the problem
your ""teammates"" will start to cause them
they will become the true threat
they'll start a hunt any chance they get
your goal won't be to escape in the end
but to get revenge on your ""friend""

so go gather up your lads
and force them to hop on phas"
14854,Great thrilling game to play by yourself or with friends. With updates coming the game just seems to get better and better. The developers listen to the fans and care on what fans think compared to CoD where its only about money. Definitely recommend this game to whoever wants to discover the paranormal or quick jump scares.
14855,suck game
14856,good game if you want a heart attack
14857,gud:)
14858,"Playable in both Desktop and VR, this game will give you a good scare, especially in Singleplayer. There's a bit of strategy and a ton of replay-ability."
14859,big scares
14860,"""where are you?"" ..."
14861,Amazing game. Love the voice chat system. Much love and hope to see many more updates to come.
14862,scary
14863,Ok
14864,g
14865,"Great game, super scary in VR! The better the VR headset you got, the better the experience will be!!!

But one little annoying thing I've noticed is, you don't run long enough during a hunt, 3 seconds of total running, you are out of breath and the ghost catches you creating a unfair moment.. If the dev could make it 5 seconds of running and 3 second cool down, that would be amazing for VR."
14866,"This game is fun. It makes for a good social game, as you have to talk in order to find out what ghost you're dealing with. There are many ghosts and equipment that allows for multiple ways to find the ghost. You can also summon the ghost through cursed objects, which in return it will hunt you down. The game is repetitive, but some how I don't get bored of it personally. There are -different difficulties allowing for harder or easier hunts. There are even ghost events, where the ghost ""appears"" and this sort of tricks you into thinking it's hunting making for some scary moments.  I give this game a 7-8/10. I feel this game is a lot better with friends, but if you have none, you can join lobbies where people actually talk. This game I feel won't be for everyone, but I think if you watch gameplay and think it's fun/funny, it's worth it."
14867,"10/10, best game to play with friends, the proximity chat is perfect."
14868,10/10 best game with friends.
14869,"A game that actually requires skill, I'm all in.

"
14884,This is best played with more than one person because you have to go back and forth between the van and whatever location you're at multiple multiple times so it gets annoying but it's very creepy to play alone. It's a great game to play with friends and get your scare on.
14885,i <3 the jumpscares and hearing the blood curdling screams of those i love !!
14886,"Very good game, very fun to play with friends. The game is very interesting and each mission I might say feels never the same. The concept of the game is very interesting."
14887,good
14888,"has a good spooky vibe, very few horror games scare me but this does"
14889,"During my first multiplayer game getting used to the controls, me and a friend found a Demon in a laundry room. I died almost immediately after the hunting started. And during my first solo run, I ended up encountering a figure, heard a cackle, and the lights shattered. I freaked so hard that I noped out of the place without documenting the ghost. Scary game, fun game."
14890,"Such a bone chilling game with so many things to see and do. You aren't just hunting a ghost, you can find the bone of the ghost, a cursed object, unlock new places and difficulties, and buy new things in the in-game store to make the hunting more thrilling! Pretty scary! For my besties who love the paranormal! <3"
14891,"pretty spooky until you actually die, other than that anticlimactic stuff it's fun."
14892,This game had me side-eyeing my basement for two weeks.

14914,"This game knows what direction it would like to go in, and it feels whole in and of itself. It's fun, especially with friends and it's easy to form a good rhythm for when you're playing.
However, there are some major flaws and issues that come into play in terms of inefficiencies. A lot of small details, bugs, features, and mechanics that chafe when it all comes down to it. Making it exhausting to play it if you're not specifically looking for what it offers at the moment.

It's passable in VR, and it suffers from what I would assume is a lack of consideration. Overall, it would be a ""Get it if you've got some money, and are looking for a VR game."" Otherwise, to me, it feels like it would fall flat of a good valued purchase."
14915,"getting to call the ghost the n word while waking up your family at 3 am is the best

14943,"As fun as this game is, the mechanics and interactions with the ghosts make zero sense, other than just looking for the clues there is no way to really tell what the ghost is. with that in mind, having the mimic in the game makes it pretty much impossible to get the correct ghost. a fun game to just get some jump scares in with friends, but if you want to try and figure out how each ghost works don't bother."
14944,IN THIS GAME 3 OF US SAT IN THE SAME CLOSET FOR 15 MINUTES THROUGH 8 GHOST HUNTS. I DID NOT WANT TO GET OUT OF THAT CLOSET AND NEITHER DID MY TEAM. EACH GHOST HUNT HAD US SHITTING OUR PANTS AND MADE US CREAM TO EACH OTHER I WAS SCARED MAN. THAT GAME I DID NOT WANT TO COME OUT THE CLOSET BUT AFTER THE 8TH HUNT WE BOOKED IT TO THE VAN AND JUST GUESSED
14945,"It is a fun game :D

I haven't played it for too long but I did enjoy it a lot. The game can be very scary at times, especially when you're playing on a larger map. But this amazing scariness isn't present the entire time, though the atmosphere does give me the chills. Phasmophobia is often more funny than horrifying, especially when you're playing with fun friends.

Overall, it is an enjoyable game that can give you some great scares!"
14946,Me el crappo my pantso
14947,great
14948,scary but fun
14949,Omg this game is so funnnnnnnnnnnn

14957,this game made me shit seven shades of brown
14958,"Phasmo is one of the games that saved my life as Covid dominated the world and we had the first lockdowns. I started it with friends and fast fell in love. It was cool and some kind of creepy. So many hours I put in and enjoyed.

Lately it got a bit boring as nothing really new was added to the game, mostly just skins and new ghosts where you have just to find new combinations of hints and what didn't really change the game itself.

Nevertheless I had so many fun with it and don't want to talk away the good hours we had. And I'm sure I will be back at this game when I had a bit of a break and maybe some new updates happend."
14959,great game to play with friends but if your mic is too high quality the voice chat doesn't work
14960,"My friends are wimps and always chicken out of the house at the slightest noise, leaving me to get murdered by ghosts with daddy issues.

Gameplay: 7/10
Camaraderie: -10/10"
14961,"New updates are coming in fast. You can wait for a sale if you want to,,,,but I am warning you, get it before 50 ghosts are in the book"

14973,spooky game especially when u have dumb friends
14974,booo booo ghost go brr
14975,Nothing quite bonds a team of virtual friends like the collective terror of running away from a naked man chanting sweet demonic nothings in your ear in a barely lit asylum. 10/10.
14976,spoopy
14977,Just a solidly good game. Worth the money
14978,Don't buy its too scary.
14979,terrifying but fun. a great game to play with friends
14980,Spooky Ghost woooo
14981,can fight ghosts really cool

14984,Its either a demon or a shade. That all i know. I'm always wrong. But when i'm right. I just knew it.
14985,yes

14994,Good game
14995,very fun not that scary
14996,"My first game me and my friends who arguing who was more scared to enter the house, and after awhile one of us stepped foot in only to die within 2 mins maybe. Good Game Good Scare, Can Be Tough to get money for all required equipment early in game"
14997,"Hi there ghost investigators !!
with 236 hours under my belt with this game in VR and not at level near 500 now in game im ready for a review (my first ever intact on steam)
anyway, this game was strong still is and properly always will be well well well worth the money to get.......
but wait for it there is a BUT coming (sorry dev's)
with the hours and level i'm on i think its safe to say i'm not a newbie to this game, hell i even post on youtube on this game, things are starting to slow down on this front for only 1 reason.
HIDING DOES NEXT TO NOTHING NOW (and im not talking about the deogen with you cant hide from anyway)
no im talking about running away in a hunt... torch off camera away in proper hiding spot out of line of sight doing EVERYTHING right only for all ghosts now to 80% of the time just walk right up to you with ease and kill you.
It never was like this it was possible to hide it worked well but since the truck overhaul update the game is still a masterpiece but DAM not very rewarding anymore with getting hunted down with COMPLETE ease from all types of ghost.
like the A.I is way to high!
The good points of this game is endless its amazing in VR and i adore it, but my game play has less then halved since the ghosts have Xray vision or something.
AGAIN GAME IS AMAZING.....BUT
thankyou for reading"

15002,"Every time I play this game I feel a chill in the back of my neck.
10/10 will play again!"
15003,SUPER COOL GAME little scary but not too much
15004,"Good horror game. In any aspect it's very complex, lots of ghost types, lots of creepy moments and tons of items you can use to find what type of ghost you are dealing with, there also are some cursed items that have a chance of giving you some nice advantages like seeing through the ghosts eyes or reviving a teammate BUT these items can easely kill you and your whole team. All this game needs are some jumpscares and it will be horror as f. There is only a simple animation when the ghost actualy kills you-it grabs your head with his/her hands and you're dead... Don't think it's not creepy, the game is full of paranormal activities that scare the sh!t out of you! Great game to play with friends!"
15005,Snowflake
15006,I pee'd my pants
15007,It's the best horror game to play with friends.

15016,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
15017,It's a really fun game to play with friends and is also fun to play alone. The vibes are great in this game. It's spooky but looks amazing.
15018,pissed myself countless times
15019,ITS A DEMON RUN

15029,Good
15030,.
15031,it is really fun with friends. not so good on your own but i still recommend it
15032,fun game to play with friends
15033,"What I like about this game is the replay-ability of it. The potential for different things means that the same levels don't get boring and it is positive that the developers are constantly trying to improve the game for players and listen to their opinions. I would argue this game is much more fun when played with other people, solo is ok, but with others it is much more enjoyable."
15034,"Scary the first 2 times u play it, after that its mostly just good with friends. 
Would highly recommend."

He answered shower
11/10 very appropriate
a few seconds later he killed me, near the showers"
15044,Why didn't the ghost eat his candy? He didn't have the stomach for it.
15045,very good
15046,Super scary and fun to play with your friends. Most immersive ghost hunting game (super innovative) I've ever played
15047,"Very good game to play with your friends. If u dont get scared very easy, the you should try singleplayer too. Or you can try it if you dont have friends :). AND if you dont have friends that have phasmophobia, then you can join a public server and you can talk without discord. Just hold or press v. i dont really know if u need to hold or press, but u get the idea"

15059,this games give u horrifying experience
15060,"In my short experience I do believe that this is a fun game to play with friends. It's fun to figure out what kind of ghosts are haunting each round even though some or all of us my die. I do recommend reading up on what certain items do and how they work, because it will help narrow down your choices in your journal. It's best to play with friends and the more serious you play it, the more rewarding it feels when you choose the right ghost in the end."

15100,"Intense, but entertaining AF. I'm not the type to enjoy horror games as I get scared surprisingly easy with them but I am somehow hooked on Phasmo and always bugging friends to join me for a round or two. Easy enough to pick up and not overwhelming like some other games tend to be. Despite being a bit buggy here and there, I highly recommend giving it a go as the bugs just add to the charm, IMO!"
15101,Hid in a closet with a friend and left my flashlight on and killed him. Would recommend.
15102,ghost game
15103,a good game but dont play if you frightend on ghosts there are many jumpscares
15104,Poggered
15105,"Enjoyable game, glad to see how hard the dev(s) are working on it. The ghost AI can still be a little broken at times, but I'e seen a significant improvement. I will say that this game is much more fun with friends than alone/with strangers.

VR wise, I've noticed it definitely chugs a bit which is to be expected, but there are also still some glitches I've found with audio that make it impossible to play with any other audio input than the VR headset, no matter what you choose in the settings. This is fairly specific though, and doesn't really represent the state of the game as a whole. 

8.5/10 Play with friends and you'll enjoy yourself"

it made me drop a turd in pants
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
15116,"For a game that's technically still in early access it's really well made. Very scary, visuals are good and it is compatible with even the lowest quality graphics card you can think of, you just have to turn the graphics down (for example I have a workstation with an Intel Core i7 3770 and integrated intel hd 4000 graphics and on lowest settings I average about 40-50 FPS and sometimes it even gets as high as 80). So overall, very good game, scary, well made, and the element about actually having to learn about the ghost rather than it just chasing after you constantly and you being scared is well done and adds a nice dimension of puzzle solving to what is essentially a horror game."
15117,Straight Fire
15118,"Spooky ahh game, dont let whoever is being passionate in the locker with u during a hunt after playing with the funny letter board keep their flashlight on or the hands will get you like you're Kira turning around in the alleyway"
15119,ah
15120,"This game is so fun and scary. I play it a lot with my Fiancee, we love it. The recent updates on the game have made it so much more fun, the graphics have definitely improved so much and they have added more ghosts and details, the equipment helps you solve the mystery of what phantom you are dealing with much better. I love it I have so much fun screaming at the microphone."

15126,scary meow

15128,noice

15137,game
15138,Game Good
15139,"I scream at ghost and throw a burning stick at it, only to watch it flee in terror. 10/10 would remind the dead that death doesn't make you safe from me"
15140,"nice

15141,valid
15142,It is fun when you play with your friend instead of solo :))
15143,Its good and scary
15144,yes
15145,Ghost huntin fun
15146,honestly it would be an ok game but it runs like ass and look like your moms herpes motion blur is horrible looks even worse with it turned off idc if this game is made by one person i 10/10 do not recommend just dont buy unless your cool with being sick every 10 min
15147,Funny twerk glitch ha ha
15148,spooky
15149,"I got killed by a ghost and my friend pissed himself, 10/10"
15150,This game is terrifying and makes you shit your pants and jump in fear. But is so fun to play with friends you will have a fun and funny time with this game. In my opinion it's a great game and it 10/10 but i don't have have the guts to try vr.
15151,scary ヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉヽ(ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ
15152,You know when you are swimming in a pool and you feel something warm and a big fat dude is next to you. Then you think zo  van colere is that him.  That is what I feel and think when I played this game. But what i also feel is something else. Look when you are swimming in a pool and you go under water. You think nobody sees you so you steek je middelvinger uit to someone. One time i did just that but someone cought me. The game is not that scary I would reccomend it to anyone.
15153,"I wouldn't recommend this game sole reason being the toxic community. All of the multiplayer lobbies are full of RUS players that love to scream N-word or players that sit in none private lobbies waiting for ""Friends""so when you join they instantly kick you meaning none of the available lobbies are playable, no hate to the devs, the game is amazing except the fact that ghosts constantly move around the house so when you have placed you equipment it time to pack up and move to the other side of the house. We played Bleasdale farm house and the ghost switched rooms 15 time and even hunted from different rooms even different floors as it was moving around. i get this is still Early access so i accept the bugs but please fix the multiplayer and hackers."
15154,"such a fun game! had such a good time!
"
15155,"I love this game very much, although I have noticed something wrong. I play and log off, a few hours pass and I get back online. All my stats and equipment has vanished. I don't know what happened."
15156,nice
15157,"so where do i start, i love this game the concept and the way it works is amazing. BUT and this is a huge but the community is a joke don't even try to play multiplayer because you will get kicked almost instantly. and the ones that let you stay are either hackers or toxic most people i have come across have been racist, which if that's how you want to be fine but dont shout racial slurs at the ghost ruining the immersion 

this game deserves so much better the devs have done a great job building this game on providing us with great updates but the player base just completly lets them down"
15158,goofy ahh ghost tried to kill me
15159,good. fun. play it.
15160,"Good, scary game"
15161,"I love this game so much, it always gives me a good scare and the graphics, game play are amazing. It's always fun to play, and even more fun to play with friends. I recommend this game:)"
15162,aaaaaaaa very scary man also a ghost

15171,Very heart pounding fun game
15172,i lov ghosts
15173,scary
15174,No matter how hard I try the ghosts don't seem into me so sad still would play again 8/10 would be 9/10 but not a dating sim
15175,ghost was hot 10/10 would play again
15176,"I would leave a positive review if the updates weren't just a new ghost type here and there, after 416 hours and being level 1600+, this game is just plain boring now, there are way better games out there now, I don't even think the next update with account wiping is even going to refresh this game."
15177,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
15178,"fave game. scary, funny, freaky."
15179,"very gud. you can watch your friends get hunted by ghosts and die while you hide.

15181,"Good
"
15182,ghost
15183,yes
15184,"great game, although it find it... not really scary enough, well at least in co-op. what the devs should do is add more jumpscares and a lot more quiet and very creepy sounds. Also i wish there were more maps cuz there really aren't enough. But even with that this game is still hella fun and i really recommend it!"
15185,Spookey
15186,jake got raped in prison canteen
15187,"Pretty cool, but my dad would abandone me if I think one of the ghosts looks hot, so 70/404040."
15188,"Greatest ghost hunting game ever you should really try it especially with friends. and also for a great game like this it is really cheap. if you like ghost hunting,videos about ghosts,stories about ghosts etc and you also play games this is the game for you then. give it a try you won't be dissapointed :)"

15198,"Phasmophobia is a great game to play with friends. The only bad thing is that the developers keep adding more and more features without optimizing it. I remember when it used to be fairly easy to run on most PCs, but now I struggle to play the game with an RTX 3060.
Almost no games recommend an RTX card for a decent experience. Not even Microsoft Flight Simulator recommends an RTX 2060. This game needs more optimization."

15202,"Could have had more ghost events/jumpscares, but it's still a fun game"
15203,A nice ghost hunting game with PROXIMITY CHAT 100% Recommended
15204,"Properly spooky, super fun in VR and also not in VR. Always some room for improvement but the devs seem to listen and continue working on it. I would suggest revising the UI for the menu in the lobby, it's unique but it's better to go with something more traditional."
15205,ghost scary. I die

It was a demon.
I ran.
Realised, it's just a game.
Started running towards demon.
Demon turned around and ran away.

15240,"extremely fun and engaging game, just wish it would come out with more maps faster as when you get decent at the game you can finish levels fairly quickly leaving you with nothing but playing the same maps repeatedly."
15241,"this game is just awesome. its the best with friends and you cant beat the price! the more you play the more fun the content is. the developer dedication is amazing and they continue to prove to me that they really care about their fanbase as they continue to expand. So props to Kinetic Games for providing us with a superb horror title game!





"
15242,"this game gave me PTSD.
10/10"
15243,This game holds a special place. It is a fantastic ghost hunting game. It channels my inner child who dreamed of doing this kind of thing in real life haha. I love that it keeps you on your toes and no matter how long you have been playing it for you will always still manage to get spooked. The developers really pour their all into this game and it shows. It is absolutely a must buy.
15244,"OMG great and spooky game, maybe skin customising would be great and you unlock more as you progress???...But over all lover it so much!"

pros: eats your ass, fuckes you over 
cons: eats your ass, fuckes you and puts your heart in your ass
ghosts are mad ugly, maybe have a good personality, would smash."
15251,"Very scary, mini heart attacks, would recommend if you want to have fun but still want to be scared with ya boys/squad. :D"
15252,"is very good game friend, i recommend, real."
15253,sexing the ghosts is funny
15254,"Just play the new Ghost Exile if you want something that does not get repetitive, unscary and downright boring after the first 2 missions like this. it has way more interaction and has a more in depth and unique gameplay system and has a much more unsettling ambiance overall than this. i can't recommend this game when ghost exile exists."
15255,"Having sex with ghosts are fun and rocks hard, buy the game."

15267,Very good game. Spooky.
15268,nice
15269,"Me and my friend both got this game and she got a microphone to go with it which you need to communicate with the players and the ghost, we hooked it up to the computer and all seemed to be good, the microphone worked well with other stuff, but not the game, which was why she bought it. It is also just really slow and laggy. Takes like half an hour to load you into a server, then I usually just get disconnected five minutes into the round. Would not recommend this game."
15270,Spooky <3
15271,Awesome
15272,"So much fun. just amazing, my new fav game"
15273,Fun spooky game to play with the boys.

15288,"The best basketball game i have played in a long time.
The physics are very well done"
15289,I didn't really know what to expect when I started to play this game. But its honestly one of the most fun I've had playing a game in a few years! A few of us bought the game and now we have a discord full of people playing and having a great time. It keeps you on edge and working together for a great time.
15290,A very fun game with friends or alone
15291,fun and easy game. get a good thrill and go back to APEX

I hear scream, I see body, I laugh, I take photo, I leave.

I give it 12 screams out of 3 bodies"

15298,Good
15299,Anjeng bikin kejut setan e tapi mantap sih 10/10 would like to play it over and over with friends and family

15369,"I just started playing this game at almost midnight.... NOT a good idea.  I don't have a lot of time in the game but so far.....  This game gave me the chills, the idea is great and it's exactly what I was looking for in a game of this type. Entering haunted homes ALONE armed with your equipment, if you don't keep dropping them like I do. 
 If your into the Paranormal and have always wanted to try Ghost Hunting this is your game.  Wearing your headset increases the intensity....I would definitely recommend getting this!"
15370,no
15371,its just so boring
15372,"1st - Recommended for Group Play. I cannot speak for playing with strangers but playing with friends it's undeniably fun.

This game is scary but it's in the old movie horror kind of way. Yes the updates are working on difficulty and new ways to get your blood pumping. All of which add something new to explore and enjoy. I have very few games that I have played multiplayer in that I keep on enjoying it to it's fullest. This is one of the first of it's kind for ghost hunting experience. It may be the best."
15373,its pretty pog
15374,"My family and I have had lots of fun and thrills playing this game so far.  It really makes you think strategically and the risks are worth the rewards!  If you are looking for a game that can challenge your reasoning skills and make chills run down your spine when you are playing with the room lights off..  Well this game will do it!  I cannot say enough good about it to do it justice.  Looking forward to custom difficulty, new maps, and new ghosts.  Two thumbs way up!"
15375,yes game
15376,"The game was super fun I played the early version of the game and me and my friends loved it, but after I stopped playing it for awhile the new updates kinda ruined it for me but that's how every game works to keep the game growing, the game is super fun to play I recommend it if your tryna find a new game with friends but be ready to learn a lot of stuff while being scared. (great game 10/10)"
15377,spooky ghost made me have to change pants
15378,Crazy game full of fun for the ghost-hunting family.

15389,yes

15391,"great co-op for people who like things that are more Spooky than Horrifying

ok sometimes it gets a little horrifying"
15392,"I'm a goddamn coward, but playing this game with friends makes it slightly less terrifying.

Up until you bastards lock me in a room with the ghosts, then it's on sight."
15393,before i played phasmophobia i was severly constipated but after being jumpscared by a ghost i got scared and it all came out. sadly i havent cleaned up the mess yet. i put the shorts i was wearing on the wall as a trophy.
15394,Phas is good game
15395,to scary jk very good
15396,good
15397,"Ehem a poem:
I love this game,
Oh its so fun 
Oh its a spirit no need to run!

Oh what a time, 
What a .. this  
Jhin is a  jerk i hate this game , im never playing again 
oh i made 100 dollars still. okay cool./ 
Lets go again !"
15398,skary
15399,"Fantastic horror experiece, really fun and satisfying gameplay."
15400,"While, this game is great in single player mod. There is some serious issues for the online co-op.
1) When, you become a ghost. There is almost nothing you can really do. Having some features such as moving chairs / objects to help project your team-mates from wrathful sprites. Would go along way. In making dead players feel like they can do more than just wait for there team mates to finish the game .

2.) Every time your in a game lobby. If a person leaves / joins everyone has to re join the waiting list so the host player can start the game . The multiplayer matches needs to remove the constant reset statues . Just because, someone leaves / joins a host lobby . 

3). The sprint system is way to limited.  As you get better and things become, crazy . You will notice your sprint meter is painful to deal with . Generally you can only run 3 seconds before, your character gets tired . This is extremly unrealistic. An should be adjusted to make balance how long you can run. With how much gear your carrying, and how much weight they add up to . 

 Because, you will be running in big areas that have ghosts that can progressively get faster during a hunt. The speed of the character vs the ghosts is a bit unbalanced. An should be re-tweaked in a future update.

4) Xbox one controlls and vr controlls suffer drift . That makes Nintendo switch joy con swift look tame . With a xbox one controller. The player will constantly move in the wrong direction, go backwards , and move when you didnt want to . This could be a game config related issue. But, using non keyboard and mouse. Is the worst way to play phasmaphobia. 

 Overall, the game is great. But , the flaws do hurt the game from being great ."

15413,"Genuinely the most fun I've had with friends playing a video game in a very long time. Spooky when it needs to be and just hilarious when we want it to be. The devs are super active and their roadmap is always interesting. Although it seems every update they make brings with it its share of bugs, their fixes are (mostly) quick and alleviate a lot of the problems. Late-game Phasmophobia morphs from an investigative role-playing ghost hunting experience into a real gamey game. Ghosts are predictable, the scares seem cookie-cutter, and each run gets less and less mysterious, so I really hope their updates leading to the ultimate release can bring a lot of that magic back. But as it stands, it's still a great game to experience with friends."
15414,Game is fun on pc and even better (scarier?) on VR. Be wary of the bigger maps like asylum. My friends and i thought we were ready. We were not.
15415,Mr. Skelly Bones
15416,Absolutely terrifying...Mannequins can move places thanks to the ghosts. Thanks to that and making my girlfriend play it with me I am now single. Still a 9.5/10!
15417,"good game
"
15418,found the ghost nuts
15419,very fun but recent updates make it rly hard. also nearly impossible to play with 2 or less players
15420,Really fun horror game to play with friends. Its very scary for your first few games but you get kinda into the rhythm of the game play but that doesn't make the game worse as with every new update that fear factor comes right back. And I have friends that cant get over the fears no matter how long they played so if you are especially scared of horror games this will not get boring at all
15421,its very nice game i recommend it scary and its fun when you play with friends
15422,Everyone else rated it good so I gotta even the scales :[
15423,"Used to play this game back in February 2021. Where you could out walk ghosts, they weren't smart enough to go around corners if you lost LOS and if you weren't being hunted you could go right up to them with no consequences. Also sightings were far less common and they were far less aggressive. I was a champion, fearlessly going in, marching around and even going up to touch ghosts regularly. In the 40+ Missions we completed successfully (on max difficulty) I died once. And I wasn't scared either. Never even a single jump-scare; even when talking to ghosts alone in the dark.

Then they added an update ~March 2021. And everything changed. They could follow you around corners without line of sight. They were now faster. And gone were the days of running up to a ghost without consequence. On one of my first missions back we were progressing as normal. We saw no EMF and had some cold temperatures and were heading back to the truck to switch equipment when my light began to flash. No biggie. Had it a million times before. I was at the doorway to the house. Safe. looking inward with my torch flashing intermittently; awaiting the last of our group to come through. And then; as my torch flicked from dark to light, front and centre about 2m from me, a ghost appeared. 

I have never jumped so hard at anything in a game or otherwise. I recoiled from my computer; my hands retreating from mouse and keyboard alike. Even an audible gasp left my mouth. From that moment on I was a broken man.

Petrified to even do the simplest of ghost hunts. Every minute I was in a mission from then on I was counting down the time till we got out. Waiting for the real world clock to reach 'too late for another game' time. 

It broke me. If the idea of actually being scared, having cold sweaty palms, an undermining sense of anxiety just waiting for the mission to end appeals to you; then yes I recommend this game."
15424,Awesome and pretty fun!

15464,I have a crippling fear of all things supernatural and literally this game has helped me through so much of my irrational fear. It's really good immersive therapy. I recommend it to people who are terrified of anything related to ghosts. It def helps to play with friends.
15465,"I can't get enough of Phasmophobia. The ""random ghost"" changes the dynamic of every game, making them fun. Even if you play against the same ghost, the map changes how you deal with them and your strategy.

I also noticed a healthy and nice community of players due to the fact that people have to talk to play. This seems to encourage social players to join, making it more interesting."

Ghost have been buffed to the point that it's now ""HARD"" to find in amateur levels lol
Ghost can hunt faster and they have a ""Sixth Sense"" knowing where you are for 5 seconds whenever they hunt.....cool bro
Ghosts are harder to find as they do nothing to indicate where they could be except hunt
You loose over $2500 worth of stuff per death as you make maybe £300 each game (That means you would need to play 15+ games per death F THAT!!)

How dose a game go from being actually a good game with great ambitions to a HUGE mess with no real effort to make fun?

Most people will look at this and tell me ""to get good"" I had $10,000 2 months ago at LVL 100 I have less then £500 at 115 coz this game is so Fedup.
Until this game gets fixed ill tell people to stay away from it...."

Review
Summary - Phasmophobia is an investigative horror game developed and published by British indie game studio, Kinetic Games. The game became available in early access through Steam for Microsoft Windows with virtual reality support in September 2020. The game received a large influx of popularity the following month due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it, mainly for the Halloween season. As of October 15, 2020, the game was the sixth-most popular game on Twitch. It was the best selling game on Steam globally for several weeks in October to November 2020.

Gameplay - Phasmophobia is such a unique game to me. You go into a house or any environment this game has to offer (won’t give any spoilers) and your main goal is to figure out what ghost you are dealing with and get out. Sounds simple? Well not quite. You can buy many types of equipment to help you make your task easier and can use some of the equipment to do challenges. You want to make more money in a ghost haunt? You have to do the objectives on the white board and take pictures of the ghost, and any ghostly events that happen throughout your playthrough. You can have a total of four players into a game but the best and most scary experience is probably just two people total in my opinion. This game does get many bug fixes and some content updates which adds to the game’s replayability. You have many kinds of spirits and they all give different clues, and you can find these “possessed” items that make it easier for you to find the spirit or can make the game a bit more “interesting” but I will not spoil what they are. You do have progression, but nothing crazy yet, just levels. I want to unlock clothing, customization, something in that area to keep me playing for the long term.

Graphics - The graphics are okay in this game. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Well I guess I can say the lighting effects are really good and adds to the atmosphere but besides that nothing that will blow your mind. The game looks good and you won’t be disappointed with it. The animations are pretty solid for an early access game. The character and ghost models could use some work though in my opinion.

Sounds Design - The sound design is really good. You can hear objects turn off or on from the spirit. The spirit can also give you some minor jump scares which are pretty fun, like make a creepy noise in your ear. Spirit boxes do use your voice in this game and the spirit can hear you if you are being hunted so be quiet if you are in the hunting stage. You can hear your friends in the game and it sounds really good I have to say. I do wish they added more spooks in the sound design. For example how about some screaming or weird noises from the spirit or whispers in the dark. Scratching on the walls or doors slamming would be amazing in this game.

Pros:
Amazing atmosphere
Tons of ghost variety
Unique gameplay
Lots of maps
Frequent updates
Great optimization
Hunts are pretty scary
Amazing sound design
A ton of potential in the future

Cons:
Graphics could use some work
Animations need rework in some areas
Could add more spooks like doors slamming, scratches on the wall, etc
Needs to add more reason to play long term (progression for example)
Needs a steam workshop for longer replayability

15497,scary fun
15498,Actually so much fun
15499,"The atmosphere makes the game. A lot of fun playing with friends. If you lack the constitution to play solo, it can be difficult because then it's a multiplayer only game, but if you've got the guts, the solo hunts really play into the overall experience. Highly recommend watching some gameplay footage on Youtube or Twitch so you can learn what the different ghost evidence looks like. New ghosts and maps being added act as a sort of difficulty curve. If you enjoy detective style games and testing your nerves under pressure, get the game and happy ghost hunting!"
15500,Scare
15501,i really really recomend it its so much fun but make sure u have friends cause you gonna need some

15515,"TL;DR - Great game, a few glitches, some more game breaking than others, playable on bad PCs but still looks great on higher end PCs.
I usually don't do reviews and stuff like that, but I honestly love this game a lot. Obviously, there's some glitches and stuff like that, but to me that just kinda adds to the fun. The one time so far that I've encountered a really bad bug, I was playing with a friend and a couple of random people and we found the Tarot cards, someone pulled the one that starts a hunt and I died, someone else pulled the priest and revived me so then they stopped with the cards. Later that game someone died and got revived even though no one used the cards at all in the past like 5 minutes. Everyone took turns dying to be revived to laugh about it. We probably could've exploited it and gotten massive amounts of money by just dying and having people take pictures of the bodies, but we decided not to because that would just have been unfair. Other than that glitch, the game definitely doesn't look the greatest, but that's a good thing, at least to me, because my PC is horrible. I also can't even run Asylum, and if there are more than like 1 or 2 lights on in the house, the fps gets tanked, I can just tell people to not use the lights as much though. Whenever I load into a map the resolution switches to 1080p but my PC is bad so I have to run on 600x800 so that's a pain."
15516,Great

15529,"Great to play with friends. We're always too scared to leave discord because this game does that to you. Eerie soundtrack and the environment makes the immersive gameplay feel all too real. It's also fun to randomly jumpscare friends and make them almost piss themselves. Devs are doing a nice job with constant updates to keep the game feel interesting. Ghost patterns/types can get predictable after playing for some time, so it becomes easier to identify what you're dealing with, but when the hunt starts, you better run and hide!"

15537,boo
15538,"1: You do not need the required graphics it says you need, I am playing this on Irisxe Graphics and it works flawless however that might be different for VR. 2: You need a diaper and you mom to hold your hand while playing this becuase the ghost will get you when you least expect it. 3: Playing online is extremely fun and challenging bcuase working with a team has its ups and downs, but you can also go solo if you have balls of steel. This game has such a wide variety of options and upgrades to the point where you wonder ""Am I even going to be able to do all of this?"" Overall I love this game and there is no other ghost game that can compete and the developers are absolutely brilliant. Even when you die in game you still have a purpose which is to alert your team by throwing objects near them to try to inform them of their fate or perhaps evidence nearby. So for those who get mad upon death remember you still have a purpose in the game. Its worth the 20 dollars and probably the 50 too. (Warning dont play in a dark room.)"

15593,"Played this game for only 8 hours and somehow became the most repetitive game I have ever played, which is crazy to me. I believe the developers put in hard work to create this game, but if you dare to play this game daily you will find yourself in an insane state of mind and stuck in deja-vu, with being stuck doing the same thing every time you play the game. If you are to play this game, you should play it once every blue moon so then you don't attain the feeling of repetitiveness that this game definitely offers. Game should be called OCD not Phasmophobia, thank you."
15594,Makes me wish ghosts were real
15595,Very nice
15596,Cool game. I love constantly shitting bricks.

This game changed me. It made me a better man. I have played for just six hours and i am incredibly fulfilled. I shall spend hours of my short life on this game about ghosts. The character development of the (Unnamed white man) is impeccable. The game is perfection. Per.fect.ion."
15701,"Super fun to collaborate with my friends, very spooky (or maybe I'm just bad at not being too scared to leave the van after the ghost becomes active). The ghosts always keep you on your toes and it's fun trying to figure out what clues you've actually seen!"

15724,"good game, but its most fun when you have full equipment and grinding for items is or can be annoying. I think making the store cheaper or give a larger bonus when all objectives are complete could help. when one person buys all the equipment give them the largest amount of money, because they are arguably contributing more then anyone else, and if they die which can happen to anyone they will lose the most. I die and buy nothing then i lose nothing if they die they can lose almost everything that they spent on the mission. a larger bonus would also encourage more people to spend their own money and supply the team."

15757,"Lets talk Phasmophobia, i'm telling you this is one the greatest games on steam to play with friends there is so much exploring to be done around a creepy abandon house with cursed objects and random bones, alone you will probably pee every pair of pants you own so bring extras, but with friends you can see right though there skin and see the scaredy cats they are, i promise you will have a great time hunting for ghosts in creepy prisons like some kind of ghostbuster and even when you die you can have fun throwing things at your friends when they least expect it and them screaming till your ears bleed, honestly i cannot get enough of this game and if you are hesitating, take it from a random stranger you will never see again, THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!"

15762,"Fun game with friends and sometimes very spooky. Only criticism is once you learn the ghost mechanics and how to identify them easily, the game feels too easy at times. Sometimes the ghost is super boring and will make you wait forever for evidence and sometimes the ghost will just destroy your entire career in 3 seconds. If you have friends to play with its not that scary and lots of fun. If you want to be scared just play solo."

15839,"After watching playthroughs from youtube channels such as Markiplier & IGP, I was sold on playing this game and watching them doesn't even begin to express how scary this game can get when starting. Eventually you will get used to the scares and start to develop a more keen awareness of the ghosts but when you get to that point, its time to start getting braver and venture to bigger zones like the school and prison, I highly recommend playing with friends."
15840,its not that scary it should be 2+ but yea its fun
15841,"The best part of this game has got to be hiding at the same spot with your friend, then starting to make noise to attract the ghost during a hunt and getting your friend killed...

15845,VERY GOOD GAME
15846,This game is very fun to play with friends or alone. If you enjoy horror games you will like this. The game is based off  tension rather than the common  jump scares. The objective of the game is to find evidence that show ghost activity  (using starter equipment will help you find the ghost type. Also the developers put lots of work into the game and usually update the game weekly. their are  also a good amount of maps to chose from; that you or your friends will enjoy!

15884,"[h1] Awesome game [/h1]
Phasmophobia uses your microphone when playing, so you have to actually talk to the ghost and be quiet when it is hunting to not be found, which is a really cool feature.
In general, the game mechanics are easy to understand and fun, and it is for you to figure out which equipment you prefer and which you find unnecessary.
The graphics are also pretty nice, although sometimes bugs can occur. I for my part had to turn the graphic settings way down because my poor little laptop couldn't handle it, which was a little annoying at first, but now at least nothing lags anymore.
You can of course play the game alone, but I would recommend to play it with friends, as it is way more fun and can sometimes get pretty creepy when playing alone.
I'd definitely recommend you get the game and give it a try (if you like these kinds of games of course)!"
15885,good game
15886,i loved when the big booty ghost came very close to me and it was very attractive and i kinda nutted lowkey
15887,"fun
"
15888,"My psychiatrist told me that ghosts aren't real, so to prove her wrong I did exactly what you would do in Phasmophobia to catch a ghost, I got my flashlight, my EMF, a camera, and a 17 year old girl tied to a chair. After filming the 17 year old girl next to the EMF for a while, I was kind of hungry so I left for a minute to get a snack, but when I got back my EMF had exploded and now all I had was a few black ropes, some red walls and a charred box. Not sure what to do now but I'm sure I'll find another way to convince my psychiatrist that ghosts are real. Thanks for inspiring me Phasmo."

15937,one of the funnest multiplayer thriller games that have been out in a while
15938,"My one negative I have to give this game, is that I have played it so much its no longer scary. Even on higher difficulties. Hunts are usually investigated fairly quickly early on, and we tend to drag them out just for photos or mission objectives. 
Not knocking the game however, its still an absolute blast."

16022,"Love the suspense and atmosphere the game creates when hunting, im always scared out of mind"
16023,"i do not normally like to play horror games, I am a huge chicken, but this game is genuinely fun to play with friends. I would never play it  alone, and sometimes i will hang out in the truck to long, but this game makes it really fun for a team of chickens to hype each other up and rush the house till something small happens. Then we're either A.running out the house for our lives while screaming, or B. call the ghost out and then getting sad when one of us dies.

 I also love the name banks and I can tell you Michael Jackson is by far the funnest play-through I've ever done. Even if a lost of us died. I feel like the game is just a really good vessel for having a good time with your friends.

One thing of note, I specifically played this game during my last month of pregnancy to try to fear induce my labor, and during the winter update fell for the jump scare. I kid you not a couple days later my beautiful son was born...coincidence? Maybe, but I will always believe in my heart this game gave me what i wanted to Christmas  lol."
16024,"Fun game, love the scare factor, love the haunted items but the deaths are FUCKING SHITE!! So boring, same death everytime, not scary considering it is a horror game however still fun to play with friends :)

"
16153,"I like the fact that this game can make you scared without needing cheapass jumpscares.

Im level 400 and I've spent at least 90% of my playtime in VR mode and it is absolutely FANTASTIC.

The game is a bit janky but it has a weird charm. The only thing that I dont like is that a lot of the levels, ESPECIALLY the main menu area are just Unity asset flips but the devs appear to be hard at work with creating their own assets so this point may be moot in the future.

Totally recommend. Its only $15"

16166,ez
16167,"Would definitely recommend to any horror enthusiast. Wish there was more to do when you're ""dead"" to troll your friends, possibly interacting with objects more? Nice to see the game being constantly updated compared to other games. A really good game for streamers. 7/10 <3 !"
16168,"The ghost turns out pretty chill and cool, then killed me right afterward"
16169,"Go to main menu, look for gam with fren. join gam, host AFK, leave, join another gam, cool host with VR, milly rock with host, spawn in, look for gost room, taunt ghost, insult gosts mother, piss off gost, gost whoop my ass, frens take picture of rotting corpse, frens leave, rinse and repeat"
16170,yes
16171,Its fun but if you have phasmophobia dont play it
16172,11 hours in and i'm already hooked. Most horror games follow the same slender gameplay but this is quite the ride. Instead of collecting things to escape or useless pages. You are collecting evidence on ghosts and using those findings to determine what the ghost is. There is more to it than that but it's definitely a must have!
16173,"Really great game 10/10, I play it with a few different groups of people and we have a blast."
16174,Early Access Game but Overwhelmingly Positive ^^

16180,"Fun game with very interesting ways to identify ghosts. The In-game voice chat is a blast with the ghosts being able to hear and respond to certain things you say. 

the only bad part I can think of is the public matchmaking system due to the fact of alot of modders and griefers with no way to report at the time of this review.

Overall the game is a ton of fun to play with a group and I look forward to clocking more hours on this game!"

16202,its morbin time
16203,"This game sucks. Evidence never adds up, this game is full of bugs that make it unplayable if you're trying to be successful. 

Fun with your friends for 2 games while you spend those 2 games learning that the game is actually awful and unfinished. It sucks cuz the concept is really cool but the delivery is just so god awful. Maybe in a couple years."
16204,its a good game 10/10
16205,N/A
16206,"A very fun and replayable ghost hunting game.

In this game, playing solo or in a group of up to four people, your goal is to collect as much evidence of the paranormal as you can without dying tragically. In the process, you will learn more about the different ghost types, including their behavior, sanity thresholds at which they can hunt a player, ghost speed during a hunt, unique hidden abilities, along with many other things.

For new players, I recommend joining the official Discord to find private lobbies to join, as public lobbies can be very toxic sometimes. Don't forget to do these things as well:

- Keep an eye on your sanity, especially if you're playing alone and are scared of being hunted.

- Remember to turn off your flashlights and stay quiet during hunts.

- Mic sensitivity in this game can be very touchy, so ultimately the best thing to do is apply ""Push To Talk"" to your mic settings, whether you're playing alone or in a group.

- Take lots of photos! It might not seem like an important task at first, but the money you can make from taking photos (and picking up the bones, if you can find them) can really add up.

- Play in whatever way you feel comfortable. Don't let toxic people tell you that you're playing the game wrong just because you're scared. Hell, as of now I have 300+ hours in this game and I'm around level 770, and yet I'm still too scared to get hunted in singleplayer unless I'm hiding beforehand and I'm using the Tarot Cards.

- Just have fun with it. Some people take this game very seriously, and that's fine. Other people might just play it as a way to have fun with others, and that's fine too. As someone who switches between both playstyles, I'm a firm believer that there isn't really a wrong way to play this game, as long as you're having fun and not being toxic.

I hope this review and mini guide was helpful; happy ghost hunting!"
16207,good
16208,I love this game so much. I actually creamed twice while playing. I was running away from a thaye in the shape of a hillbilly chainsaw wielding republican and i creamed because of how scary that was for me to experience.

16215,"ONE OF THE BEST SCARY GAMES

"
16216,"don't have a ton of hours in this game but pretty solid. graphics look decent, game play is good. Multiplayer is the best way to play this game by far. i would say if your into ghosts Etc give the game a shot.

"
16217,Very Fun! a scary and fun ghost hunting game this is.
16218,"Fun game, keeps you on your toes. I have only played solo and it is quite scary. Still love the experience and enjoy being scared by the ghosts. Haven't yet played multiplayer but the game is still fun as it is."
16219,I love spooky ghosts/ horror games and this game is perfect.
16220,very cool with my friends
16221,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (neck snaps)
16222,The game is really fun and has a lot of potential to get a lot of hours in. I do wish it didn't take so long to get more maps and ranks but once you get the hang of it it becomes easier. Overall really fun game and for the price you could get hours of game play in before getting bored.
16223,"Very creative and fun. As someone who doesn't play many horror related games, this is one I would highly recommend. It's more mysterious, but it does have the spooky side to it too, yet it makes it very enjoyable. It's best playing with friends and/or family."
16224,good horor game with friends
16225,"This is an extremely fun and different horror game. It is more focussed on co-op with your friends which is very fun to do. Essentially your goal is to complete the objectives and use clues and evidence to find out what kind of ghost you are dealing with. The models are great, sounds are amazing and game functions are very good too."
16226,ghost
16227,it scarwy but thats the point
16228,need more work to it
16229,ghost
16230,Great game to play with some friends every once and a while. Super scary and just a overall well put together game. VR is super awesome had some friends playing with me on VR and it was some of the most fun Ive had in a while!
16231,"Fun game to play with friends, either go full tryhard or just try to mess with eachother ."
16232,"i love this game, it's so much fun to play with friends!"
16233,very scary reccomend
16234,"It's good to see my grandma again, I missed hearing her hiss at me while throwing shit across the room frfr"
16235,"I told my friend about a game that I wished existed, and he said that is Phasmophobia. Then we both bought it and played it, and it scared the gunk out of us. After we went through a pretty gnarly jump scare, we took a break. During that break, my Ouija board fell off my mantle in real life for no particular reason. So yea, I love this game. Best with friends."
16236,"very good i like insym
"
16237,yesn't
16238,"A ghost told me it was gay







I died."
16239,maybe?
16240,"Fun if you like ghost type games, can be hard to find ghost types. Also their is NO in-game purchases"
16241,"I think it would be cool for this game to have some achievements added, here are some basic ones I thought of 
Ghosted: Hide from a ghost during a hunt and survive
This Isn't Uno...: Use the tarot cards
Friday 13th: Find the mask in the lake

16250,If you like being scared with your friends. I'd definitely play this game. I 100% would recommend this game in general especially recommend this game if you get scared.
16251,This is amazing and so much fun!
16252,"Super fun game, i can not wait to see what they pull off for the future with a team now. Really good job my only ""complaint"" would be that we need more maps or maybe a rework of all the current ones even would be cool. Hope they keep up the good work and do lots more updates!"

16271,"I went in to capture of a picture of the ghost.

I said her name a few times, but nothing happened.

Then, my flashlight started to flicker and I busted out my crusifix but I did not know how to use it.  I crouched, and tried to get away.

She got me.

10/10 would play again."
16272,I have enjoyed playing this game
16273,It is still in beta so there are a few weird things but overall its super fund and very spooky. I have a group of friends i play with and it gives us the perfect combo of comedy and horror.
16274,epico
16275,"As someone who is a real-life chicken, this game is perfect. I hate jumpscares and finding a good horror or suspense game that doesn't cash in on them is next to impossible. Then this game exists. It hits every single one of my preferences: 
1. A scary game 
2. No jumpscares (the one in the lobby doesn't count as it's easily avoidable and just a gag). 
3. Coop available 
4. Can play alone (though it's much more difficult, but not impossible).
5. You get kind of a story but tons of freedom (I like having fun with friends imagining why they died and ended up in that area).
6. Your actions do affect the game, it's not a cookie cutter level each time. Your voice affects interactions with the ghost, where you are, what you use, all of it affects the game. I love it.
7. Your investigation matters- it literally is the point of the game.

If you're in that sweet spot of loving scary stuff but being afraid of approaching it unless your friends are there (to mock you every step of the way as friends do), this is the game for you. The events they do are fun, the game itself is fun, I literally could spend hours and hours on it and I looked forward to playing it after a stressful isolated workday. 

To be fair in this review, there are some downsides. I'd love an option where, if I die to the ghost, we could also whisper or do scary ghost howls or something similar to the players still alive. I would also love if there were more items to interact with in the lobby, sometimes friends take forever to load in. It's a little annoying to have other players in the way when I'm trying to choose items or a map in the lobby when the whiteboard is selected- if i'm clicking on the whiteboard to select options, players should not be able to get in the way when I do so. There's some clipping that happens in the game with the models which can make for hilarious jokes, but it gets old fast. 

However, these downsides are me really reaching for them. Overall it's a great game, great experience, and most definitely a fair price for the game as well. I'd love to see a single player story-mode available sometime in the future, but so far this game is phenomenal and tons of fun."

16281,I love this game its so much fun its scary its funny it has such good people but I DONT recommend for people to play this in VR with a bad graphics card like me 970 hrtz or above is good for phasmophobia but overall this is a great game and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this awesome game!

16330,It was a nap
16331,"I would 100% Recommend this game to people. 
It's easy to hop into a match and it's really fun with friends. 

That being said there are things I would improve upon. 

1) When you change the volume of a person because they're too loud, it does not persist, so if you restart the game, you have to re-adjust which sucks. 

2) There are quite a few bugs with voice chat. Voice sounding muffled so you have to step out the house for it to clear up. Voice chat simply not working in some matches. 

Even with those occasional bugs it's still really good! Money well spent."

Why can't I just bring a rucksack for all the tools? Can't we order crucifixes in bulge somewhere? I've got so many questions."

16382,i hate this game it scuks
16383,"This game is addicting to play with friends or even certain randoms you run across. Phas only has a small team working on it yet bug fixes and patches come quite regularly. The developers are consistent with their content and they have a good community backing them with people such as Insym and Psycho for example. The game can also be quite complex but simple once you have figured everything out, and you're always one moment away from something funny happening. I have had some great moments with great people. Phas has great value for its price and I recommend buying it and playing with friends. 

Pros: 
-Great, complex gameplay but easy to learn once you understand it.
-Playing by yourself is cool, but more fun with friends
-Quite addicting
-Great community
-Quality content creators (Youtube and Twitch)
-Frequent bug fixes and content updates
-Developers and moderators engage with the community
-Can still find ways to scare you hundreds of hours in
-VR gameplay is good and consistently gets updates to make it better
-Price of the game is very good for the amount of content provided

Cons:
-Can get extremely repetitive after some time. Burnout can sometimes occur.
-VR can still be buggy on occasion
-Every game has trolls, and this is no exception. Use your best judgement when playing with randoms"

16402,"I really want to like it. The investigations are a blast. Managing sanity is a nice mechanic.

But as long as ghosts can insta-kill you once they start chasing you, without any way to stop it or prevent it, it's just not fun.

If the game ever gets ways to extend the investigations or defend yourself, it'll be great."

Best way to get it right and get a hang of everything is with friends. at least 3.
so one person goes in early to help set up small items like salt, and dots. then does back to the van and watch the cams and dots.
have one person move the cams and fix dots and place things like the book, candle or smudge 
then have a taunter, someone with a spirit box,emf and ghost finding shit.this person needs the crusifix as well. 

been doing it for 4 hours and this combo has worked every single time. it also makes sure someone is alive so you dont loose as much stuff.

its great and i love it"

16448,"I think this game needs a lot more polishing before I will like it. I would also like for running to feel like running, and last light I am young and healthy instead of like a 90 year old on oxygen. I also dislike how often when I get hunted they appear right on top of me or just 5 steps away from me. I should have a chance to live, not just insta die so often. Heck, I was even on the other side of the camp crouched, all lights off, and the ghost still went from the house (where a co player saw it as a ghost) to kill me over by the entry gate, that shut in front of me just as I was about to exit. Not a fun game when you get killed so quickly and easily."

16470,"fun
"
16471,worth the 12 euros when you die instantly after going in the house lmao
16472,"amazing
"
16473,"Very fun game to play with friends. Way more fun with voice chat though, kinda boring without it. 
Play at night with the lights off really heightens the experience"
16474,10/10 never felt more joy then yelling at a ghost or two for hours on end!
16475,a lot of screaming
16476,"The game is amazing, although. Be careful of acting like content creators, cause it's gotten my group and I a few times..."
16477,its good game.
16478,i like it
16479,a ghost raped me in the garage
16480,gud gameZ
16481,"minecraft is more scarier than this, game is rlly bad and made for like monkeys go buy forest instead or hello kiity online adventure"
16482,Its fun to play with friends. different ghosts are fun to investigate and the way that cursed objects adds more thrill when everyone is inside the building and is activated. Never tried it with randoms but hoping to see more maps created. I like how there are different ghosts such as Jinn or Yokai from different countries. Looking forward to see more ghosts from around the world

16487,its so good
16488,yes but this shit is the scariest thing solo I stayed at the front door for 30 minutes yelling at the ghost to write in the book
16489,i shit my pants very good!
16490,"If you want to have a heart attack and die, this is your game."
16491,Its a great horror game. I don't play a whole lot of horror games but this is one of my favorites with friends. It can be hard to understand at first but once you do a few investigations you'll manage to learn the basics of the game.  I sometimes roleplay with my friends in the game to make it more immersive the real fun and challenging part of phasmophobia has to be solo running a investigation its more creepier when you're alone but you'll get used to the jumpscares once you die a lot
16492,"Nice game, it has a really good graphic and is very fun with more people but still sometimes scary. I recommend the game! 

Graphic: 9/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Ghosts: 9/10

16523,good
16524,"The game stores the photographs you take with the camera, so I checked the games files and I found a png named ""SavedScreen2.png"". I open it and not only do I not recollect making such a photo, It looks like a fetus rearing its head into lens. 
Now I know it's a ghost game, but this genuinely looks like a real human fetus. Again I have no memory of taking such a shaky photograph and I don't even know how this could be inside the game. 
I am genuinely terrified to sleep at night knowing a haunted fetus png is on my hard drive."
16525,"This game has been my favourite for over a year now. I love being able to spend time with my friends remotely but also play a game that allows us to collaborate. I am excited for the new updates, though there are a few things that I wish could be improved. I will most likely continue playing every day for the forseeable future either way because it is fun and spooky!"

It has creepy vibes and is really scary from time to time. Can´t wait to try it on VR (gonna piss myself)
Very nice to play with your friends. This game is also very often updated and has lately had an update with 3 new ghosts. Never gets old ;)"
16537,"The game, irrespective of the mode you play, keeps you on the edge of your seats. Using your brain while being absolutely terrified is a dope concept, and all the jumpscares are time perfectly to suck away your worthless life."
16538,spooky
16539,"Overall, this game is amazing! The quality and graphics are insane, one thing I think this game should have is scarier jump scares when you die! Another thing I think this game should have is harder levels and instead of 4 people there should be like 6 or 5 at least! Overall, this game is amazing! But maybe they should have these changes."

I enjoy it a lot with friends or randoms... The new updates have made it a lot more exciting, however one thing i'd love to see is more fear-factor and jumpscares. I feel like we don't get to see the ghosts properly and adding more scare factors would make it a blast.

love the game though, my team are fun to play with."

16580,"Phasmophobia is quite easily a work of art. If you've ever wanted to be a Ghostbuster, this game will make you bust from all the ghosts.

There's nothing better than watching your friends die around you while you scream in the corner of the room. I also appreciate how we get paid $90 for putting our lives on the line, seems like a worthwhile career choice. 

10/10 would recommend. Worth every penny."

"
16586,Super fun!!!!!
16587,Awsome multiplayer horror games with friends or solo
16588,Pretty scary
16589,"Incredible potential but still a work in progress. The game is something completely new unlike anything I've played before. It is one of the few horror games to genuinely build tension and deliver scares and the mechanics can force players into tense decisions about whether it is worth the risk to return to the house to find that last piece of evidence or if your sanity is so low you might be attacked the second you set foot in the door.

The evidence gathering manages to be fun while still being similar from round to round and each mechanic does a good job of immersing the player in the game. At first nothing is creepier than getting a ghost to respond to you on spirit box saying he is right behind you.

 However the imersion of the gameplay begins to wane after the first few levels acheived and the once imposing ghosts become more of a nuisance than a threat barring RNG giving you the 1 in 12 chance of picking the most dangerous ghost type. I hope more work can be done on this game to preserve the experience I had on my first hunt as a greenhorn ghost hunter unsure if any second an otherworldly being could end my existence. Perhaps more varied goals or unpredictable hunting behavior would force methodical veteran hunters to take risks or face the uncertainty that terrifies you when first playing this game."

16599,nice
16600,"I love this game! This game is awesome. Well made. The devs are very active and listens to the community. This game is a Horror Puzzle game, which you must figure which type of ghost. 

I wish we would be able to cleanse the ghost, or some type of Exorcism."
16601,very cheap but fun scary game there is some good fun and scares you can get out of it and with the its even better
16602,"good game, but here are my grievances. fix asap, devs.

i need to be able to take more than 10 photos. i am a god and i just want more money. thanks, devs. 

i don't like it when during a hunt, the ghost will disappear and the perfect photo i just took won't count. not only are you limiting my photo count, but you make me miss photos on purpose. what kind of a shitty gimmick. 

also, i played a game on willow st. and during a hunt, which i thought was a ghost event, the door refused to shut. i then took my dumbass to the garage, thinking it was ghost event mind you, only to be met with death. fix this bug because a skillful player like me shouldn't be dying to crap like that. 

i reiterate, the game is good and fun, but you devs need to up your game if you don't want to lose your player base, aka myself."

16609,"a game worth 12 euros, great to play with a friend and more, I like it."
16610,This game has taught me how to glitch through walls and how to kill my teammates.
16611,This game freaks me out all the time - I have so much fun playing with friends and random people - random people its like a hit or miss because sometimes they are SUPER COOL PEEPS and sometimes they are really hard to deal with people that set stuff up and kill you or just afk and you're like welp. Sometimes it glitches a lot and its a bit annoying - like seeing finger prints that are actually not there? Or cameras not working sometimes... But I love that sometimes amature plays can be the hardest ones for me! Hah!

16632,"This game is good, but it is a little laggy at times."
16633,i like discovering the easter eggs in the game and playing with other people although some were unpolite to others most of the people i played with were really nice and helping me understand the game better when i started and when i got vr i liked the game even more. and i think that its cool that even though the games been out for a couple of years that there still updating it. so in conclusion i think this game would be good in vr for peaple that like horror stories and movies and would like to experiance it in well what fells like real life but i still would recommend it without vr too
16634,its fun and i like ghosts!!! (the nice ones ofc)
16635,The first hour of playing Phasmophobia was fun and scary but afterwards it's just boring and the same thing over and over again.
16636,"10/10 very fun

9/10 would ask if the ghost is French and get murdered again."
16657,"Changing my review until I stop dying every single game. It's impossible to make any money. I keep meeting lvl 500 people that claim that don't have any gear or money and I keep asking myself questions that would be inappropriate to post here. Yesterday I had around a grand and a truck full of gear. As of writing this I have virtually nothing. The game WAS amazing when it first came out, and all the good stuff is still there, but the difficulty is just too high now and the rewards are just too low."
16658,gud game
16659,I really enjoy this game a lot. For me it's only fun playing with friends tho. Worth the price :)

16688,"A good game if you want to take pictures of ghost booty and lose all your items to ghost fingies. Otherwise it's fun to play and spook your friends! The game can get a bit annoying when the ghost didn't respond to spirit box but is suppose to, otherwise the graphics are not bad and it doesn't rely on jumpscares only suspense."
16689,"This game took me ages to get passed the jump scares.  They are very well done.  The continuous updates to the gameplay and ghost give the game loads of replayability.

"
16690,"This game has really good sound design and has some really great puzzles. Multiplayer is fun, while singleplayer is really scary. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good fright. A great passtime and one of my new favorite games. I'm excited to see where the developers go from here."

16742,i like game very fun with people
16743,"So look, I know there are some really amazing game players out there, and I love watching them play games like these. But us amateurs like to play games, too. When this game first came out, it was amazing, fun and easy to understand, easy to follow, but since all the updates that have been released making this game harder, me and my kids can't even get past intermediate level. And it's killed the experience for us. Not being able to tell the ghost is hunting until it's right up your ass? Is entirely unfair. This game has become, just like so many others of my favorites, made for youtubers only or for people who are badass at video games. You take away the fun for those of us who are casual players who just want to get on here and there and have a good time. I paid money for this game, but I refuse to play until something is implemented that allows us to bring back the ability to tell when the ghost is hunting, and an actual way to run away from the ghost. Run away, Hah.. What a freaking joke. This has really come down hill since the updates started coming out more frequently, and I am not a happy customer."
16744,yup pants filled with feces
16745,it is very fun trying to find the ghost and it is funny to lock people in with the ghost

16748,"very fun game to play alone, with friends, and online. most of the players ive played with online were very nice and werent jerks while playing. i highly recommend this game if youre looking for a fun spook."
16749,Me and My Husband JaffaCakes118 always play this game and he always get's turned on .///. (its kinda cute) UWU
16750,"Get this game, you have no reason not to.

No mic? The game will pretend you have one and will interact with the ghosts for you! (The spirit box will randomly answer if it doesnt detect you speaking)

No friends? Join the public discord! Theres always people looking to play, myself included, but if it isnt your cup of tea, you can always play solo! I do and its way more spookier when its just you and the spooks.

Scared of ghosts? Join the club, I brought cookies.

I recommend it at full price, as it has a ton of replay value, and i can easily sink a good few hours into a play session, but if its ever on sale? Its a steal. Devs are active with the community and are always taking feedback and suggestions."
16751,gets really boring
16752,yes
16753,its ok
16754,"Really fun multiplayer experience. Super creepy on single player as well. Large variety of ghosts, and a large series of maps. Public lobbies are pretty fun as well, plenty of people are willing to walk you through the strategies they've developed. That being said, people are people, and not everyone is here to be inclusive and chill. Welcome to the internet.

The early time can be rough as you try to grind for money to purchase the items you need, but once you establish your bank, it becomes a lot more relaxing from that aspect.

This is one of my go-to games for just popping on my computer for a quick game if I have a few minutes free during the day. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

16769,"hi hello, 
i want to say this game is nice but they are not respecting other religions, us as a muslim community we demand the holy book of Quran as we cannot hold the cross so we always end up dying, pls make exceptions for other religions too and not just christianity, this is disrespectful and islamophobic, you may also bring Zoroastrianism.
also i may make suggestion, it would be nice if ghost can possess a team member and we do ruqiya or in other words that you infidels may say, an exorcist to get rid of the possession, now i give u too much ideas bye"

16786,"I have a love/hate relationship with this game, the premise of the game seems interesting but the actual gameplay is extremely repetitive & boring. Also, getting kicked for being a low level is about 9/10 times going to happen, The most fun I had with my experience of this game was earraping and scaring the shit out of people in the lobby without them having the ability to mute/kick me. Which is apparently bannable? Apparently the dev's are too retarded to figure out there is a flaw in their game so they just outright permanently ban you for ""using a hack menu"" 
In conclusion, You can only have fun in this game if it's done their way. 

""hack menu"" btw lol - https://prnt.sc/OwEDFUxHLr1F

16904,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

16974,"[b]A fantastic mix of fun and scary![/b] Still early access, but don't let that fool you, the game still has massive amount of things to do and explore. Fun alone, more fun with friends, but fear not, for the game is filled with lobbies with ghost hunters from all around the world to play with.

With 6 Small maps, 3 Medium maps, and 1 Large map, you'll have hours of places to search for the current 24 ghosts that are in the game

For the low price of [Spoiler] $9.99USD	[/spoiler], you don't need to wait for a sale to pick this up.

[u] Highly recommended! [/u]"
16975,"nice and fun game, But can someone tell me why there is litterly only 1 of my friends who can use the spirit box to talk to the ghost? like we others can talk ingame and everything but cant communicate with the ghost,,, we all have the same settings and everything, but there is only one who can talk to it so we know we can check the spirit box investigation"

16994,"I had a couple of good times with friends, but it's a buggy mess and by the time you play every map once there's really not much else to do. Perhaps in the future I'll check out the game again and update my review, but to be honest the current state the game is very unpolished to be enjoyable."

17002,Very fun way to get friends killed
17003,GOOD
17004,An incredibly fun game to play with friends. Every ghost hunting experience is completely different from the other one so you never know what may happen! Talking to the ghost is also quite unique so there are some nice gameplay mechanics here. Graphics are quite Unity-ey but for me that's not an issue. Overall a quite creepy but still a really fun game with a lot of replay value!
17005,great game
17006,The best game I've played with recently. Absolutely would reccommend!

17027,the ghost are scary
17028,"pretty nice, surprisingly replayable, though it does have room for improvement, such as maybe making it somewhat spookier, maybe tweak ghost identities (such as making ghosts actually accurate to their folklore counterpart, such as banshees always being female), and the game does tend to be somewhat weak if soloing, but for the rest i would recommend it."

17038,GREAT
17039,"Phasmophobia is truly a gem in the horror community because it defies everything the genre has become in recent years. Instead of aiming for grotesque ""shock-value"" horror riddled with bland and predictable jumpscares, the game offers you a grounded horror setting that doesn't feel alien beyond belief. It's a breath of fresh air in the gaming industry, and I'm excited to see the direction it takes. With devs capable of providing consistency in both the frequency and quality of the updates, this game truly is a wonderful experience, and one I wish I could sink more time into."

17074,this game is really scary but so much fun
17075,"Good game if you have friends to play with. The online community is toxic as hell. I honestly didnt realize how horrible people could be till i joined a couple public games. Wouldn't surprise me if some future study directly linked this game with suicides. If you care about your children at all, i suggest you find them a different game. I baught this game with my daughter, it was fun when we played together. Then we joined a couple public games to share the experience with other people and play some bigger games. Moral of the story is, she will never be allowed to play this game on a public server ever again. She heard things that she will never unhear, i couldnt stop it fast enough. Between the racial, sexual obscurities and insults. I was on damage control for several hours after. There were things said that would leave you in a courtroom had you uttered it to someone in public. The game itself is good, its fun, but Stay off the public servers. Dont let your children play this game online unsupervised. It will be devastating to there mental health."

17079,"If I had one recommendation for playing this game, it would be BRING LUIGI. Man's can clear a haunted mansion in no time, a small 3 floor, 16 room house should be no problem for that Italian mastermind."
17080,I shit my pants
17081,amazing game to be honest. almost everytime i play i never fail to almost pee myself. scary yet exciting!! only thing more i could ask for would be to be able to get cooler and more interesting skins to investigate as. like shaggy from scooby doo or sherlock holmes. ect. anyways. great game! keep up the good work
17082,Played a gay as fuck song. Ghost killed me. 10/10 would do again
17083,great
17084, Really Good Game.. Would Play With Friends For Better Experience..
17085,"I've put a few hours into this game and I just don't enjoy it. It's like playing a normal video game but you can only see through a toilet paper roll. Some people seem to enjoy it but it's just so technically unpolished that I can't get to enjoy the mystery aspects of the game. I've been playing mostly with experienced people which has it's own drawbacks but most of the time I don't have any idea what's going on  if they don't tell me.

I've tried to play by myself but I get less than a minute in and I'm having so much [Anti-Fun] fighting the game design I can't bring myself to continue. I do not see the appeal of this game. I want to love it. Conceptually there's a lot I'd like to try and it's why I keep booting it up but every time it's like shocking again how badly the gameplay hates me. ""Oh it wasn't that bad"" I say to myself, ""Surely if I give it another chance it might be better than I remember"". Nope. It's worse.

This isn't a slight against the developers. Clearly a lot of people love the game, my friends included, and while there is *some* ugly design in there I don't think the game is broken per se. But I play games to have some sort of fun or enjoyment and I can't possibly bring myself to enjoy this game no matter how hard I try. The idea that gamers complain about games like Resident Evil's ""tank"" controls and then play games like this gleefully just baffles me.

I'm playing this game in Early Access and to be completely frank I've barely touched the content.. I think. But I've played a lot of games I suck at and a lot of games I don't get and nothing has quite given me a ""turn it off"" vibe like this. I'll play with people if they ask me and I'm bored but for the moment I'm not seeing myself into this game ever."

17087,Good game
17088,good
17089,"Ghostbusters: the survival game. They aint friendly, they aint pretty, and theyre all ready to grab dat ass.

The game is fun, and but it takes a while to get used to learning what you need to survive the night. Watch some tutorials, have a friend teach you, and then bust down those spooky doors and smudge up all the ghastly hideouts. Its possible to play alone, but it gets incredibly difficult since you earn so little and the equipment costs can go so high. So go out there and make yourself some friends so you can get scared shitless together."
17090,i love that in the lobby there is games to play i've played games like this and this doesn't even compete with then its amazing i have 198.3 hours of play time on here its so fun you should get it. other reason is that its super realistic and when you talk the ghost can hear you and other cool things ect.
17091,needs more micro transactions.

17130,"This game is incredibly fun and is updated regularly. The game is about 2 years old and I have owned it for a couple months but through consistent updating and polishing it looks so much better than it did. The game also doesn't rely on jumpscares to induce fear on the player which is good because jumpscares have become cheap and un-creative. This game is one of many games that are easy to learn but hard to master. Also, practically every game is different due to the range of ghost types and differences between each map. Overall I would give this game a try and do not regret getting this game."
17131,they're constantly working on the game and updating it. Its come a long way and I am happy to have been a part of the journey so far.

17153,"Easily one of the best ways to get out of your own head for a while. You ever seen the show supernatural? Yeah, it's kinda like that. 
Go in, Figure out what kind of ghost you're dealing with. Try not to die.
The developers are always updating, fixing bugs, adding features. It's just a great game, by some great developers, and a great time. Whether you're playing with friends, or alone, it's one of those rare games I could probably play for a few hours every day and never get bored with. 
Chef's kiss."
17154,"this game can be really fun! i like the investigating aspect of it and the fact that sometimes u can get jumpscared by random hunts; however, it's really hard to find nice people sometimes, so i recommend playing with a group you already know. also kinda wish the avatars were nicer/customizable but it's cool! really fun and i like the risk :D+"

17166,Spooky but not too spooky. I really just enjoy the mystery solving aspect of the game
17167,"very scary and good quality, totally worth 14.00$"
17168,"Over level 300 nearly 80 hours boy is this game still fun

When I first started playing this game I was scared out of mind. To the point I took my headset off during a hunt. But with more and more hours I've found plenty of ways to play this game and enjoy it.
(To be fair I've rarely play this game alone, and rarely without 4 people, and never anything put professional)

Learning this game will be the deciding factor if you have fun or not. Simply being able to know the weaknesses of the ghost and how to play around them (Aka getting friends killed for fun). Is honestly fun. Once you hit around 20 hours it will be incredibly easy to drop into a professional find the ghost get all pictures and obj's and leave with no deaths.

But as a tip to the newer players. Don't sit in the van. Get in as soon as u can and identify the hiding spots (closets, places with obv corners covered with boxes. (Aka Super spots). and just run to that spot 24/7. Get to know the game. And start having fun. 

Once you know the ghost and aren't as scared Start moving into professional difficulty. (for more moneyz). Professional gets boring? Fuck flashlights starting using video cameras (actually really good. Lets u find rooms based on dots).

Game to easy now? starting doing the obj's. Get them feet picks (give them a sniff). AND MURDER YOUR FRIENDS. Get the boogie bomb (music box) and drop that shit at their feet. Use summoning circle when they don't know. Walk past their closet getting chased and open it. Break the mirror for fun. Idk just make sure you get the items. and have at least helped get one-two evidence.

Over all New ghost are a W. Enjoy the game. Don't think its a hard game. (P.S. fuck the big maps, They take super long to find the room. For those make sure u bring everything. Smaller maps. bring only what u need)."

17202,"so this game is pretty good all in all, I'd recommend not playing in vr because the ghosts like to moan in your ears {non sexually of course} it's very encouraging and gives me the confidence to ask the ghost out for dinner and possibly have dinner. the only times its not fun is when they eat everything that you have to offer and beat you over the head."
17203,"Very sppoky but hilarious with friends, highly recommend"

17222,"My experience with this game is positive but if you are buying this game to get scared, you shouldn't play with other people as it may ruin the experience."
17223,"At the time of writing, I have over 630 hours in this game -- the most hours I have put into ANY game in a very long time!

This is hands-down one of my all-time faves. I love anything spooky but most horror games tend to go too far with it, consisting of too many jumpscares and truly unnecessary violent or gory visuals. But Phasmophobia is a wonderful mix of suspense and intrigue that I am all for. No round ever feels the same way twice, especially when you play multiplayer!

I LOVE multiplayer. It's pure chaos that often leads to a lot of laughs. I love the party game vibes it gives, especially on smaller maps where the rounds are shorter.

It helps, too, that the devs are always tinkering with the game and giving us something to look forward to. My only critique here is that I do wish a little less time was spent on giving us more ghosts as opposed to new maps. This far along in the game, I'd much rather have new maps to explore than even more ghosts, especially since there are already so many ghosts that you're unlikely to experience even the same ghost twice in a good few hours of playing."

Reasons why its not a 10:
-Cant be ghost
-Cant capture the ghosts.
-Cant do standup comedy with the ghost.
-My friends computer crashes on big maps.

17335,VERY FUN. I though it would be boring but worth the money if u can play
17336,"i am 14 and easily scared, the only reason i bought this game is because all my friends had it. I never really ever played it unless I was with friends. But i am starting to get the game down and am becoming more resilient to the jump scares and whatnot that come along with the game. i have been playing almost every day now, for i find so fun to play a little guessing game with some ghosts. I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy playing with friends and that like to play high risk scary games. I Also recommend this to those who neither them or their friends don't have it, for it is so funny to sit around and everybody is screaming."

17412,Scary but really FUN
17413,"I've been playing this game for a year, and if anyone were to ask me if I recommend this game, I do. I totally recommend this game, it's one of the best, if not the best horror game I've played in a long time. There's a lot of different varieties of houses and ghosts in the game and not just one objective, so the games different year time. Honestly, I love Phasmophobia as a multiplayer horror game. It's so fun to play with other people, if not alone, the game is terrifying in the best way. Overall, I would completely recommend Phasmophobia to anyone who likes horror games. (I received this a gift from one of my friends, but still I think the for the price it's an amazing game.)"

17423,"Honestly great game but I do have an issue with a few things.. Why the F8ck do you have Yokai but have Oni and Yurai.. Oni and Yurais are in fact Yokai! Developers either did not know what the term Yokai means or they just said screw put them in. Yokai is a term that means ghost or types of ghosts: Kappa, Oni, Yurai are types of Yokai. It just doesn't make sense to have a word that means types of ghosts then proceed to have the very types. Yokai isn't a specific type of ghost. The word itself covers a larger group of ghosts. At least fix that. It doesn't make any sense since my Japanese friend of mine called it out when we were playing and got pretty mad about that discrepancy. Which I can see why he got upsete after looking it up myself, didn't make much sense."

17488,needs a lot of work.
17489,Dude i can't even describe how amazing this game is and how fun the community is. My best friend purchased this game for me and I am so happy and grateful he did. anyways this game is perfectly scary and adventure like and you have to do a bit of detective work to find that ghost! One recommendation i have is changing/adding more death animations(like when you're being killed) i would love to see a choking one or maybe even the ghost lifts you up and strangles you.
17490,Fun to play with friends! Love to hear them scream or being a dick to the ghost.
17491,This game is racist. My character is black and I keep dying first. It has been 5 games and I've died first in every single one of them.
17492,"I got this game for me and around 5 or 6 friends. I spent probably over a hundred dollars on buying this game for people and I dont regret a penny of it.
This is one of the best games I've ever played, and its so easy and simple to pick up too.
You go into a house either alone or with up to 3 friends and you attempt to find evidence to identify the ghost type, and all of the constantly growing amount of ghosts have different special abilities that make them unique. A lot of people have complained that the game has too many ghosts, as far back as when the Hantu and Yokai were added, however I say it gives the game more replayability personally. 
I must admit, after some time, the game becomes quite easy even on nightmare, but maybe this is because my crew has a hatred for anything larger than a streethouse, so 99% of the time I'm playing Tanglewood. 
Another thing is that Kinetic Games isn't exactly a big studio from my understanding so major updates (like the horror update and upgrade system and such) take a long time to come out, however they do seem to be able to pump out new ghosts pretty frequently. 
The game has definitely become a little more scary than on release with better looking ghost models and on larger maps not even knowing if its hunting at times (especially with Mylings, since they are typically very hard to hear from a distance, yes I've died this way) which is a good thing, I recommend VR, sadly my Meta Quest 2 won't work with PCVR anymore so I don't know how stable VR is, but its a lot more terrifying at times. I recommend once you get a feel for the game (level 40 or so) to play nightmare, as trying to discover a ghost based off behavior is a lot more entertaining than sitting and waiting for a third piece of evidence.
My favorite ghost has to be a Deagon, as it forces you out of hiding and gives that old Phasmophobia feel where you could just loop any ghost around a table if your caught.
This review is kind of drawn out by now so I'll just put it to this, the game is insanely good, especially if you have some good friends to joke around with during the games, but it is easy."
17493,very epic game and creepy at times
17494,caught my wife with the ghost got freaky UwU
17495,"GRAPE GAME SO GOOD! SKARY

17496,not even scary bruh. its a fun concept and shit but like it looks like shit. work on making half ft the game before remaking the already fine truck. don't get me wrong I like the design but focus on more aspects like how the player models look or how they bend weirdly. it pretty fun tho
17497,fun with friends

I have an excellent group of friends to play it with (which is my recommended way to play - the public lobbies leave, uh, a lot to be desired currently) and the scares are delightful and watching my friends lose their cool is even better. The development team is currently working very closely with the community on bug fixes and feature implementation, and for such a small team I think they're doing an excellent job. I can't wait to see the future of the game!"

17643,"I gotta say, this game always makes me come back to it. Everytime I play it not just in game, but something horrifying happens in my life as well. Call it a curse. I'm so happy to have this curse though because DAMN this game is good. 

I asked the ouiji board if the ghost liked little boys and it went to yes and started hunting so bonus points

17801,scary but so good
17802,VR is awesome with this!
17803,
17804,.
17805,"When the game first came out it was a fun interesting concept for a game, now with a drip feed of content updates and better alternatives (Forewarned, its like Phasmophobia with mummies and stuff actually happens) it is extremely boring. Every single time I boot up this game thinking it might be fun, it's the same thing.

DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE VR. The controls for index are putrid. The index controllers have grip functionality so you would think to hold an item you just hold the grip, but no you have to tap the grip then let go of the controller and when you want to holster or drop you grip again. There is an alternate control scheme, but instead you have to squeeze the shit out of your controllers and it still randomly drops things. For the cherry on top, the only way to sprint is to click in the sticks which with the bad build quality on the index controllers can cause drift.

Overall fun for the first couple times you play it, but by the time you think its getting started, you've seen everything."

I think it's great that they're constantly working on new things, improving game quality so that you don't ever really get bored of playing. I'm a very social person so it's really cool that you can play with other people from around the world. I've even met some people who I've even befriended while playing this game. I watch Insym and the developers play so I can definitely tell that they're cool people who love their game as well. Highly recommend."

17844,Amazing game
17845,"I've always been fascinated by ghost hunting shows & movies; I had no idea I was waiting for this game to be made. I bought it as soon as I saw some of my favorite youtubers playing it. I wanted to experience what they were experiencing but with my own friends. I don't have VR (yet) but playing desktop is just as rewarding. 

With that said (I am a bit biased) but I will review it as a game below:
PC performance:
-runs hot on any of the PCs I've played on (2016 laptop & beefcake 2022 PC)
-the speech recognition can bug out sometimes
Graphics:
-realistic, a bit wonky models (for the time being)
-audio within the game is terrifying (in a good way)
Replayability:
-endless. I really do mean this; each mission is it's own experience. However, some missions take FOREVER (like 40mins+) because the AI of the ghosts choose to do nothing to give you evidence. Majority of missions take 10-20 mins on the small/medium maps.
-maps: can become boring and repetitive (the dev team is constantly adding content so this might be outdated review when out of early access)
Multiplayer:
-whole reason I bought the game(I'm not brave enough to play alone), rarely have connection issues. Audio bugs do happen, though, of other players cutting out or robotizing
Dev responsiveness:
-incredible. The team behind this really do love what they're making and it shows. Worth every penny; they update the game consistently and don't charge more from the players and that might be overlooked."
