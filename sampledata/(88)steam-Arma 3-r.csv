0,Gave me a reason to use that college Calc 3 knowledge. Thanks for making a game that lets me use vector calculus and Runge-Kutta to shoot Russians with a virtual howitzer from 15km away.
1,"Years later ai is still broken beyond belief and physics are still wack but hey we got a overpriced dlc in the cold war thats lower quality than most overhaul mods!!!

Oh and dont forget to take up 90 percent of the disks hard drive"
2,AHHHH AHHHHH.
3,"Great Game, Probably my favorite way to kill time. Learning curve isn't honestly that steep at all to start having fun. Voice chat makes the game feel even more interactive and realistic, can have updates on a firefight happening a Kilo plus away while also being in one yourself. Or clearing houses on street level when taking a town. I mean honestly, the game surprised me, it genuinely has everything your looking for, I promise."
4,Tons of fun highly recommend. Takes patience though so be willing to learn

13,Fun Game
14,gud game
15,"A great game. The graphics are magnificent. I think an AI fix to enemy aiming accuracy is advisable. Apart from this, a superior game. The editor is extremely powerful and offers hours of enjoyment."
16,Very good
17,"free gear with out the dlc symble but i still got the dlc popping up on my screen super aggervating, its bugged 10 ooutta 10 not recommend"
18,I love this game
19,I would write a more in depth review but I'm playing arma 3
20,meh
21,"Good realism for public military simulation game, looking forward to ARMA IV."
22,you're not really a PC gamer if you've never played this
23,"I love everything about this game, SUPER tactical shooter simulator, first or third person playability. Amazing time with the boys."
24,"Nothing like playing altis life at 2am wile American children scream at you for murdering there family.
Has its moments/"
25,
26,"Bugs, idiotic friendly AI, enemy AI that are perfect snipers with guided ammo, triggers failing to trigger, the list goes on.

This is the type of stuff I expect to see in beta, not almost 10 years after release.  I can accept that this is a hard game/sim, but when the enemy AI is effectively an aimbot in a game where you die in one hit, its broken."
27,fun
28,"Most realistic FPS I've come across, playable, editable, SP & Coop, in a big world. good value for money."
29,the tanks man
30,Fantastic game. Some bugs. Intense battles.

35,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."
36,good
37,its a good game but the amount of 12 yearolds who act like they're war veterans is outstanding
38,"It's not just a simple game, it's a real war simulation."
39,You can rarely join a game and if you do you get kicked instantly.
40,"- [i]Noooooooooo! You can't just destroy my super expensive tank with a single soldier!!![/i]

55,Superb military simulator/sandbox with endless modding possibilities.
56,I fInd more enjoyment in doing a poo
57,Keep your money.
58,Still learning but fun af do recommend if it's on your wishlist! And of course always get those mods! 10/10
59,10/10 would still recommend in 2022
60,"needs a graphics update and a model update but i love the game anyway its so good i defo recommend, however if you dont like slow pace games then this isnt a game you should buy."

67,No game like it.
68,Good MILSIM
69,"seems pointless. cant play with friends, mission are bugged"
70,"I enjoyed the combat a player can engage in especially in public games, And how immersive the game can be. I especially love the AI battles you can set up, You can literally do anything from doing your own made up campaign to real scenarios that have happened if I could I'd give it 10/10 stars."
71,10
72,funnni
73,Pretty Good.
74,shoot stuff pretty cool
75,"One of the most real war games I ever played.
"
76,"the ""perfect"" milsim game, an endess sandbx, a stupidly large map, fully moddble. its the best"
77,fun and i just wanna play
78,BADASZ
79,was unsure whether or not to get this game for the longest time and finally bought this and I did not regret it.  Surprisingly immersive which each story/scenarios despite the visuals lacking  but a lot of mods make up for all the downfalls
80,I played this for countless hours in the editor and story. It Is definitely worth checking out if you like realism.
81,good
82,"
gud"
83,My first time playing Arma 3. it's more than what i expected from nearly a decade old game :) I already like it
84,this game still hype asf!!!!!
85,love it
86,when you play this game you will realize that 15 FPS isn't that bad
87,Realism/10
88,100% gonna put down thousands of hours in this game :3
89,"Brilliant game, Awesome for simulations, timeless"
90,its alright
91,This is as close as you will probably get to realism in a PC environment.
92,"Tired of all the children and crybabies on COD/BF?
Then you should try ARMA, so be a man and buy this game:*"
93,funni milsim
94,nnice
95,yes
96,"This is by far the most fun i have had in any online game great fun and very immersive would recommend to anyone who are looking for a military sim.

 full of anxiety and many heart pumping moments only con is that there is a lot to learn and you will be asking for help from other players on how to play very often however the community is very nice and are always willing on lending you a hand."
97,gr8
98,1200 hours tells you all you need to know. Quality.
99,iz sexy game
100,Great Game
101,Slava Ukraine
102,Great game
103,fun
104,"mmm
Mortars."
105,Best game ever.
106,metro boom and make it boom
107,"There really is no more of an immersive experience than ARMA III. I cn't count the times that I have totally wasted 6-8 hours in one sitting, just in a MP lobby doing special missions, with 4 or 5 other guys that are fully embracing each other while the rest of a 60+ player server were grinding it out on a primary objective. 
This game has one of the steepest learning curves in FPS genre, only because the incredible amount of content and ability, So if you are new to ARMA, just find a good servier with a clan presence and learn your way, people generally are helpful , because most people enjoy ARMA as a COOP expierence and fe servers stray from that. 
My steam only shows 231 hrs in game, but I'm almost sure that I have quadruple that if you could the hours outside of steam, and then double that number again for the hours I spent in Arma II before. 

There is a ton to do and learn, and no one truly knows everything there is except maybe Dslexi, but once you find a good group to game with it's truly a unique experience."
108,"has taken 1,000 hours of my life. 

















good game, would reccomend."
109,pew pew OH NO I DED
110,"good game, runs  on my shit laptop, so good game."
111,"The ultimate milsim!
There is nothing like this game + mods. 
Some issues would require a bit more attention like super dumb AI but all in all this game is the best of its kind, fully customisable to your liking with lots of active players and servers. Devs producing new content and quality improvements very often... thanks !"
112,i like it
113,"fun as hell, i can play the original campaign for hours over and over at a time"
114,Yes
115,I liked it but It got really complicated but for me it just got too stressful might buy it again later but for now I am sticking to simpler games
116,"300 hours and i still dont know how planes work, excellent game"
117,This Game is Shit....................10 OUT OF 10
118,good game
119,Too dependant on DLC and very aggressive marketing of such. Intrusive to gameplay. sad to see.
120,.
121,not immersive enough.
122,"Funny, annoying, interesting. I like the realism and I like the funny people I meet on servers.
Don't listen to the min or recommended spec requirements tho, they are way under what you're actually gonna need."
123,You need friends and time so you prolly wont have fun
124,best game
125,
126,"Good game, I'll probably be here for a few more thousand hours or the next more refined and optimized Arma, whichever comes first."
127,30-60 frames per second on high end pc
128,Very good Russian invasion of Ukraine simulator.
129,Good game
130,"After 8 years, a 3070, a i7, m2, I can finally play singleplayer with 60 fps."
131,good
132,i have spent all 90 hours in eden editor and i regret nothing
133,"good game
"
134,haha guns go brrrr
135,It's one of those games where there's not really any other title quite like it - the definitive MILSIM experience!!
136,good game good experiences in multi
137,This is one of the games ever made
138,"game good, big game"
139,i am now a war criminal
140,Hard to get far into missions at first but overall a good game.
141,Funny sandbox shooter.
142,its worth modding. heavy PC required tho.
143,"Not bad, could be better."
144,game = good
145,"In Arma 3, you will either be on a Furry RP altis life server and get harassed by some weirdo in a basement or you will hear some 13 year old say that annoying ass ""geneva suggestions"" joke 6 times in an hour, who is also sitting in a basement. 

Some communities are cool, others should have all their members be put on several lists. If you know you know."
146,this is just for numbers
147,Played it for 1 day trash
148,bang
149,Best milsim on the market.
150,Nothing beats Arma 3 for squad based war simulation.
151,yes
152,innit
153,Where has this game been my entire life and why am I discovering it now?
154,good

161,very nice game!!!
162,ar3
163,the game I always return to when I wanna play a tactical shooter
164,I love the game. Will need more future work on more campaing.
165,"Great game to play with on servers and by yourself on missions. Bummed out because I mainly got it for the editor, but the editor is complicated and actually needs a lot of effort to learn the basics. I returned it for that, but the missions ARMA has made for it and the community in servers are great."
166,"SHIT FRAMES BUT GOOD
"
167,"i love this game, one of the best military sims ever, i have about 20 different playsets with around a hundred different mods. 
Recommend imperial conquest (warhammer 40) and star wars opposition. Love the third first person. Loads of good maps. Base game is great even better with mods. Infinite replayability. 

Combat physics are amazing explosions real, proper recoil, bullet and blood affects. Great vehicle support not just an infantry game. Been out for ages but looks great runs easy on my pc.

Just overall great game"
168,im still learning but its real in-depth and fun though getting around can be a hassle
169,army man arma 3 plz add ukraine war dlc
170,"e
"
171,stop bugging me steam
172,good
173,"Great fucking game
"
174,"If you know, you know."
175,"worth the price: no

worth your time: meh

My advice: Just Get Dayz"
176,"e
"
177,"Still the best sim shooter on the market I don't know how many years after release. Way better than Squad, in my opinion. Higher learning curve, however."
178,"shoot stuff, get yelled at, die a lot, 10/10"
179,"very cool indeed, I think Arma 4 would be a great sequel."
180,"ŸàŸÑÿß ÿßÿ≠ŸÑŸâ
"
181,"Great military sim, but the fact that there are very common launcher bugs years after launch, forcing lots of people to avoid the Arma III launcher and having to run arma manually, means that there is an alarming lack of due diligence.  But look at all the expensive DLC they put out!  /s"
182,.........
183,is alright
184,this is a good game
185,very epic
186,"Probably the best game the is if you like shooters, and are tired of juiced up fake soldiers running around jumping on walls and sliding-360noscopeintheair-ing all the time in 3-A shooters. VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD. D'ont hesitate, just buy. Play KOTH if you want some quick fun. Join a DC if you want more organised stuff with passionate people who want to have fun. I have 990 hours into this game, and still havent seen the botom of the iceberg"
187,"One of my most favorite games ever. Especially the sandbox mode (3DEN Editor) is amazing. Creating my own military world is what I've always wanted. I've spend hundreds of hours in this game and never regretted buying. Mod support is also a big reason I, and many others, keep playing. It's a truly amazing community. 

Only downside is the bad performance. Once you fill your world with too many assets or play multiplayer, your frames will drop quite low even with good specs. 

All in all it's one of the best games (and probably the best military one) and I can only recommend it."
188,It's most realistic army game that i played you should buy it too :D
189,Professional war simulator
190,Game loos good. WEaponms arent as good. The helicopters are fun as poop. And the tanks are too slow.
191,"I dont recommend ARMA simply because of their shitty AI, its so bad, AI is like muppets. Physics are shitty too. You litterally have to headshot ground units with missiles and rockets or they wouldnt even get damaged. So much for Mil-sim!"
192,My pain should be your pain.
193,Â•ΩÁé©
194,this game is fucking trash
195,"This is not a game, this is not Call of Duty or PUBG. This is a Very realistic military simulation, it takes hours to develop tactics and unlike COD or PUBG, this simulation game is the closest you can get to the real thing. 

Other than that, this game is really fun to play with friends in your squad, 
(I also recommend ""Squad""as it is very similar.

PS: Search ""Operator drewski Arma3"" on you tube to see what this simulator has in store before you buy."
196, the beast and most fun game i love it so much and i also love bng drive lol
197,funny boom stuff
198,BEST MILITARY GAME EVER
199,Play if you like war
200,GREAT GAME IF YOU HAVE TIME
201,IT GOOD GAME U BUY IT NOW!!!!!
202,funnn
203,The admins will ban on a whim. I wouldn't recommend this game.
204,"yes
"
205,most realistic military shooter ive ever played
206,"Best game out there for hardcore milsim players. The Operations I've seen on youtube and such are amazing, but it takes an unholy dedication to learn everything if you are new to the genre"
207,is good fun with mods and friends
208,ukraine simulator
209,"pretty neat
"
210,Suprisingly simalar to DND. 10/10
211,"Great game. I've tried many other shooters related to this one, I just keep coming right back to Arma. slowly buying DLC makes it fun also and great servers."
212,I peed really hard this morning
213,yes
214,"the game is good, but only if you are bill gates. everything you touch is from a different dlc and the worst thing is, if you dont own the dlc you will get a massive watermark in your screen. would not reccomend to buy"
215,"It's arma, what else can I say?"
216,pretty good
217,Very good game
218,its very sex
219,best military sim out there would like to see native vr support added though if possible .
220,runs like piece of shit.
221,it's a cool game in its own world
222,"So realistic, the facebook boomers thought it was real"
223,najs
224,SUCKS
225,"Why should you get this game after 9 years you ask? Because this thing is an addictive piece of anger and broken engine parts with an modding community that only god can overcome. The biggest part of the community is amazing. The experience on the public servers is a lucky punch most of the time, so if you get a great server for the evening you'll finally check your glock and it's already 3am. If you feel like a more tactical approach try joining a Unit and maybe you'll find a place to be with some dang good mods that let you experience modern warfare like no game before. So try it out when it is on a free weekend or get it on sale and I'll promise if you're into milsim then this game is your new addiction."
226,Get arma'd.
227,
228,"Yeh, it's alright."
229,"game by myself :(
game with friends: tank go boom haha"
230,really fun game
231,good
232,"It's still a game made in 2013, so there are still some bugs and technical limitations. It's also very taxing on your computer, and doesn't output many frames. However, once you figure how to play the game, it is a blast, and I would highly recommend it."
233,Amazing game
234,l
235,it good
236,amoungus
237,"big gun, very pog"
238,"Simply hours of fun, solo, coop multiplayer vs, missions and mods. If you haven't downloaded this and spent countless hours playing this game your basically cheating yourself on money well spent ! Sure there are ""issues"" but all in all its just a game worth playing. Also, the modding community really dose make this game amazing and always fresh, just as its predecessor Arma 2. I spent 3-5k hours on arma 2, across three accounts hahah"
239,"Best game i have ever played, there is so much to do, so many mods, aswell if you want there is a large amount of milsims to join a good one is [TFS], game may ave ""Arma Physics"" But still the best game at this Post ive played 5100 hours, Love it 100%
"
240,"Good game, very realistic"
241,very fun gun go pew pew and tank go boom
242,This game gets 8 viagras out of 7 vitamin gummies
243,So realistic that fake news will use footage from it!
244,can shoot civilians
245,hehe pewpewpew
246,good game
247,Its pretty cool man.
248,"its eh the controls are a little wacky

252,Good Game
253,cool game if you like war and shooting
254,very yes emu war yes
255,Good for those into the combat stratagem genre of games. Very fun
256,very fun but hard.
257,"good game
"
258,Great military simulator to play along or with friends. You will loose track of time while playing and capturing enemy bases & equipment. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in realistic military simulators.
259,10/10
260,"the community in this game is absoloute doodoofart bro , comms dont work half the time and singleplayer is pretty boring"
261,"DAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDY MOANS UH
"
262,Fantastic game! Let your war creativity loose and enjoy yourself.
263,just buy it alreadey so we can play
264,Yes
265,"its fun with other players
"
266,.
267,"The greatest game ever in my opinion. That's from over 1000 hrs gameplay. 
The mod support and diversity makes it the best military simulator there is. I've created missions from full scale warfare to a realistic Special forces raid on a compound. That's not to mention the Specialist mods like WH40K, HALO, etc.
Buy it, edit & mod it, you won't be disappointed. üëç"
268,"[i]The best death simulator in the world,420/69[/i]"
269,"Sat in bush for half an hour, died. Wouldn't have it any other way."
270,gud
271,i paid $17 just for this game to tell me ''my cloud file provider is not running'' -_-
272,"unlimited possibilities for game modes and builds if you can find that server for you which is the hard bit, it will become your favourite game as it is mine!"
273,GG
274,"One of the best military simulators, still reigning!"

289,This game has been my shit for as long as i can remember ;}
290,great game with a lot of mods
291,The pinnacle of publicly available military simulators with a wide open workshop to expand upon the content even further. Doesn't get better than this... until ArmA 4 maybe.
292,omg WW3 pog
293,best fps ever
294,"The best yet worst game you can play. You can have a 3090 + I9 12900K and you will still get no more than 60fps at whatever settings. It WILL lag, it WILL freeze you WILL want to kill yourself over this game but even after all of this you will still return to it until it reminds you of how shit it is."
295,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
296,DONT DO IT. YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.
297,"What a great game, cant even play with my friend. Amazing"
298,great
299,"runs like trash on every machine i have ever owned and tried to run it own, developers need to get a grip and instead of making dlc fix the damn game."

316,i just use the editor lol but i still have had a blast cant wait until the next one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5fy3vaV62A
317,Top tier gameplay
318,good game indeed
319,"I strongly recommend not playing this if you wish to keep your sanity. Many of the communities can be extremely toxic, and being sucked into this can lead to many issues.

That being said, the game itself is half decent.There are many communities dedicated to this game that came from Arma 2 and the first iteration of the game. There are many communities to get involved in, Halosim (OPTRE), Star Wars (SWOP or Legion Studios), Vietnam (Unsung), and many more. The communities are hit and miss, and the mods make more problems then they sometimes try to resolve. After 5 years of time being sucked away from this game, I've made many friends, and several enemies in the community. 

The unique aspect of this game that I enjoy the most is Zeusing. An RTS Gamemaster against many players was really fun, though stressing. Trying to entertain 70+ ppl on a half working server can be detrimental to your PC, so play at your own risk."
320,Is gud.
321,good
322,amazing game with friends
323,Great GAME
324,"Played with a group around when Arma 3 first dropped. Made fun times and memories, racked up thousands of hours. I won't say Arma 3 is best when played with a group but one has to try it. Since I played so much with a group I feel like I no longer have that itch to scratch; I've been a platoon lead, squad lead, team lead, pilot, regular grunt, etc., Also there's the normal multiplayer vanilla modes that are okay. Played a few DayZ clones that were fun for awhile in the early days too. Single player can be just as fun. Knowing how to use the editor or a mission building mod you can get whatever you want out of it. Also mods add tons of content. Some mods make the game better or worse depending on who you ask.

-Cons 
The AI. There are tons of mods that change the behavior. Can range from too hard to fair depending on settings, very hard to get right.
Stiff movement and general Arma physics clumsiness.
Some mods are essential like ACRE for the best group play. But it needs the 3rd party app teamspeak to work. If they make Arma 4 they should integrate radios right.
Buildings boring and bare. There are mods that can make them better without spending hours in the editor though.
Very hard to stealth or stealth in close quarters without getting detected. 
Cant knock someone out from behind (theres a mod that does it but it doesn't work good due to the engine).
Flying jets is awful but the helicopters are really good.

Before writing this review, I played a workshop sniper assassin mission that took three hours to beat (once again the AI will laser you at times). Arma will drain hours out of your day no matter what. And you'll have serious fun (lol)."

357,"The game itself is absolutely amazing.. nothing I can say that hasnt been said a thousand times over. Only thing that sucks are the physics and the Larpers who think they are actually some type of soldier and take everything wayyyyy too serious. That is a cringefest but most of the community is awesome , the game itself is awesome and YES single-player is awesome. I have about 600 of my 700 hrs in SP. Been playing since about 2015 on and off so I've gotten way more than my moneys worth from this game. A+"

381,Apparently I played this??
382,arma run bad
383,Game way better than Battlefield 2042
384,"ARMA 3 is an outstanding game for anyone who likes combined arms, large scale mil-sims. The singleplayer campain is a good introduction to the core systems of infantry gameplay and serves as a gateway to the rest ARMA has to offer. The multiplayer is certainly group/clan oriented and joining a server by yourself is a much different experience from joining a private group with a dedicated server. I highly recomend finding a group or some friends to play the game with however playing ""by yourself"" is still viable, just nearly not as fun. Overall, the game has some bugs and has performance issues but nothing game breaking but the shear amount of things you can do and experience in this game is certainly worth the drawbacks"

400,So I wouldn't have a problem with this game if starting and playing with a couple of brothers wasn't so damn hard to do...portforwarding is bullshit!  You should have that already figured out after nearly a DECADE!  Oh and in campaign mode you just die for now reason even when you are in a building just chillin away from all the bullets....Terrible way to have to restart after game progress was so hard....Difficulty is fine the insta death for no reason is not and random headshots from ai that are 0 and 0 skill is what i like to call bullshit!  3/10 stars for lack of public relations with glitches.

410,"the most in-depth Milsim game in the world period, there is no other game more complicated and in-depth than this one. but the thing keeping this old gem of a game alive is the mods. if this game had no mod support I'm sure it would've failed miserably. This games graphics arent That bad, the models are well made and the textures arent bad either, the issue stands with optimization, this game was not meant to run on modern computers, it was built for old computers and it was built to be ran in vanilla. Unfortunately this game lacks extreme content without mods, if you are willing to play without mods, then don't bother buying this. even my computer with the highest specs money can buy with a 3090 and an extremely powerful cpu, my FPS hovers around 40 - 70 mostly 50. lowering graphics do not help. the fps drops are caused from scripts from mods, and too many entities at once. this game cannot handle full out warfare, well it can but be prepared for a slideshow. the reason why we play this and not newer games is not even the newest games have as much content as this game (with mods). also this game is not for singleplayer, yes there are alot of singleplayer missions, but they are mediocre and not fun, to get the most out of this game you should join a unit, usually its a community of players on discord that play arma with custom made missions made by a dedicated zeus, a zeus is a mission maker, thats what i am. this game has something called zeus mode which allows a player to make a mission in real-time while hte players are playing it, your job as zeus is to make stories, spawn enemies, and etc all for the fun of the players. though it is complicated and requires maybe at least 200 hours to get good at zeusing as its a lot of scripting and stuff. bottom line is, if youre looking for a an extremely realistic and in-depth military simulater and you dont care about performance and graphics this game is for you. the fps is low but not low enough for it to be unplayable. The graphics themselves are good enough to simulate real world scenarios. but if youre looking for beautiful landscapes, physics, textures, effects. this game doesnt have it, its strong point is simply is complicated milsim nature. if you are not familiar with Military simulaters this game is not for you... yet, its complicated and requires experience, i suggest a game called Squad to get into Military simulaters, Arma 3 is on the very last game you get, its the most complicated of all military simulaters but once you get the hand of it, its extremely fun, you buy this game once you know you enjoy milsims, and are extremely familiar with them. Many IRL veterans play this game. Remember, mods are the fun of this game, no mods no fun."
411,"Simply put, the best military simulation game ever. This is not a FPS, is a battlefiel simulator, with all the ups and downs that conveys. do not spect to be invulnerable, or to notice enemies a mile away. they are at least as skilled as you are, and they are clevcer, they have realistic armament and vehicles and everyting is simulated, fatigue, blood loss, and broken bones. You will have to deal with all that"

419,"its incredibly buggy. the only reason i was even able to play was because i bought a dlc that wasnt made by bohemia interactive. its incredibly frustrating to even attempt to play the main game because theres bugs that make it almost impossible to complete an objective because the game just doesnt trigger things when its supposed to. the main campaign had become unplayable very quickly. the ai is so incredibly stupid and broken that its near impossible to command a team unless im incredibly far away and i just command them to be in certain positions and just never move them. as soon as i take them into a heavy fire fight they all die within the first two minutes. ive even intentionally had them 600 meters away from the fight but one of them decided it would be a good idea to assume command and all of them died within 2 minutes. at one point one decided it would be a good idea to shoot at a technical, so the technical immediately killed me and i had to spend a couple minutes in a loading screen, or if its not that then my team gets stuck in a town somewhere just walking into a wall forever, or i can command them to do something and they just stand and do nothing. ive even watched enemies walk through doors and walls. bullets had even acted weird and would shoot low and shoot the exact same spot after aiming significantly higher. i hated the lag spikes in some situations so i lowered all graphics settings to be the absolute lowest, but the lowest settings had actually cut my frame rates in half. the only reason it makes even a little sense to play this game is to play online or play a dlc such as the western sahara, which is made better than the main game. this is the most frustrating game i had played since 2015"

425,"Arma 3 is not for the shoot first, think later player. It is designed to simulate real life combat and requires you to think, behave and act like real life. The minute you start acting stupid, the minute you will put yourself and your team at risk. The game comes highly recommended for for anyone that enjoys military simulation with major realism factor"

427,"Decent co-op game, will add more to review once I get a better hang of it"
428,good army game
429,Bad game
430,"A hardcore military sim with a steep learning curve. To this day, Arma 3 is probably the most realistic and unique shooter in the market, but is definitely not recommended for casual gamers. It features complex controls, and because it is a sandbox game, the player must consider several variables in order to succeed and have patience. Thus, experience is important in this game, and you must be dedicated to it in order to succeed.

This game's graphics are outstanding for its time, and it runs smoothly without issues. The UI and HUD feel kinda outdated, but Bohemia keeps updating the game and adding DLCs. It's also great to see that games like this still have a very active community that pushes Bohemia to keep improving it."

436,"Playing this game is like being in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend. It has a high barrier for entry for the maximum amount of enjoyment, it takes many hours to mod the game, make a mission, and hell even hours to play the damn thing. After all that for 90% of the time you're not even having fun, and can even despise the game. During that 10% of the time though you will have the most fun you've ever had with a game in your life, you will find yourself wanting to play more and more to the point where if you join 3 different groups it might not be enough. The game will try your patience at every turn with general Arma jankery, Mod issues, resetting profiles, and real life obligations. After all that you still play the game, even when you hate it with every ounce of your being, because its the only thing that comes close to what it sets out to do. I recommend people to play it if they like grounded military shooters so they can join me in my misery."

447,Game goes pew pew
448,"damn dude, this game goes deep for me. i first found this game through operatordrewski, and for the first 20 hours of its playing time, i had no one to play it with. i think i got this awhile back in like 2018, but it wasn't until mid-2020 that i found a ""milsim"" group to play with. god dude, the times i had with those guys. most of em live in europe, some live in the us, but i honestly think of some of them as my closest buddies. there was one guy i had known through playing arma, different group, we had gotten especially close, even after the group split up, but uh, i found out that after years of fighting depression, he died by suicide in fall of 2021. but man this game. it took me places, it peaked my interests in movies, music, writing, and my future. honestly taught me teamwork more than most games. i would really recommend this game, the regular game with no mods is kind of like ghost recon wildlands but more realistic which is why i think other people would enjoy it, as its not overly complicated, but almost more fun because of it. if you really enjoy airsoft or milsim stuff, then i would recommend looking for a group and getting some mods for it, its way more fun when you customize it."
449,lol

452,Good
453,"Stunning game, great immersion and realism. However, not beginner friendly at all very hard to get adjusted to the many many different controls and very hard to get into good communities as a new player. In my experience communities are not very helpful or patient with newer players (will just kick you). If you already have friends in a community who you can play with and are willing to help you along the very steep learning curve, it could be a very fun and enjoyable game."

468,"Highly recommend it. Although graphics and realism are lacking compared to newer games, still the game-play itself is challenging/difficult. However, if you wish to take it easy and slow, the option for a free open-world roam is avaliable."
469,"Best game if you're tactical and creative. And if you wanna play tailor made missions for the most simulator game for war stuff, man, what a good game. Also warcrimes."
470,"jl
"
471,war crimes go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
472,"Very realistic, cars have a very low chance of flying through the air (only 98% of the time), but yeah there's a very low chance for that to happen (98%)"
473,gaem
474,Its the Most Releastic Military First Person Shooter can it get other than Squad
475,"best game i have 
the tutorial suck a bit but youtube can help a lot"
476,Yes.
477,.
478,fun
479,"very complex amazing game, i have over 400 hours in this beautiful military sandbox game,you can fly jets, ride in attack boats, drive tanks, command a team and so much more! I have plenty of positives to say about this game."
480,ok
481,one of the best Shooters ive ever played
482,gut game
483,"Writing review for new people, (i'm still new compared to others tbh) if you want to hop into combat online ASAP, hit server browser/ internet/ hit players tab to make most full games appear first/ enter into a KOTH server, so much fun and you'll forget that you started playing at 3pm as you look at the time and its 9pm.
PLEASE look at controls before playing online, get a nice feel to the game and situate yourself.

Overall amazing game, nothing else is like it. You can play however YOU want. 
1000/10 will glitch through floors and nearly die again and again :)"
484,DY
485,"Yoooo, i like it."
486,ÿ≥ÿ¥Ÿä
487,Good game
488,"Good sandbox, could use more user friendly/QoL features but once you get used to the games mechanics it can be really fun."

494,"gam
"
495,"shoot those Russians, I know u want to"
496,10/10 Will crashland a fighter plane from not pressing left Alt button twice again
497,after you play this game for a while the scenarios stop working and when you get to a certan point in it it wont continue or give you the next task so they realy need to fix that so people can actualy play he game
498,"Look, I'm going to be real with you. If you want to be Mr. Lonewolf bang-bang-shoot-man who effortlessly takes out enemies and win a war with barely any tactics, Then I don't know how you got here but this game is NOT for you.

This is a game for those that like Logistics and Strategy, The people who relish the ideas of supply chains and ""Big Picture"" strategy. 

It's a game for people who appreciate teamwork with other people on a large scale, As there are full units dedicated to playing the game with each other in PvP or PvE operations.

It is a game for people who enjoy being a ""Game Master"" for others, Creating and running missions for Units.

If you like any of that, You can find your place in this game easily."
499,halo funner
500,I wish I had friend to play with. game is sick. Very cool.
501,Yes
502,Poor performance for an older game.
503,Amazing game. A bit of a learning curve but not to much super fun to play.
504,l recommend this game to people who like Milsims or very realistic games even tho this game is about 7 years old l love it allot it is allot of fun

Imagine those 460 hours into something productive.



I am so mad that I have wasted this much time I think I am going to go play some Arma."
513,nothing like having to pay for useless dlcs since everyone uses mods
514,I like to mess around in the Eden Editor
515,yeah it good
516,"hell yeah
"
517,Best Damn Combat game i have ever played
518,its a fun interactive game
519,"A powerhouse military simulation that has significantly grown from the previous mistakes and successes of its predecessor games and simulations, including the military version, VBS3. Already bringing a lot to the table in the base game, the DLCs and modding community give you limitless options bounded only by the hardware of your computer. Futuristic scenario building, historically accurate weapons, doctrinally correct formations and operational graphics...the list goes on with what you can do. The only word of warning is the learning curve that is the mighty ED3N Editor, which with enough practice, patience, and skill, is a phenomenal tool, especially paired with Zeus. As gaming AI continues to advance and improve, one can only speculate the vast potential future Arma games possess. 10/10 would recommend."
520,"Dear life,

please come back to me, I miss you.

Regards,
TCS"
521,it good
522,Very fun if your into war games
523,Great game LOVE IT
524,game sucks DO NOT BUY
525,Great game
526,Yes - just yes - this game is massive and beautiful - the community has created so much diversity in how it can be played and therefore has a replay-ability like no other game!
527,slave to the game you monke
528,"I got a video recommended from OperatorDrewski where he flew the 2035 A-10 WArthog. Wanted to buy the game since then. It's a fun and tactical game in it's download and play state with some dlc's or even without but mods make this game perfect. Don't expect High Framerates if ur system is above recommended specs. u'll mostly be at 40 FPS or Lower in action. It will take alot of time to get good in this game and im far far away from that with my 10h of playtime but it still is enjoyable, as alr said. it probably is more fun with friends but i don't have many friends to play with/that have arma 3. 10/10 game and i would've paid full price if it wasn't on sale when i wanted to buy it. 

<3"
529,i just keep coming back year after year please come out with arma 4
530,"This game is quite unique indeed. Truly multipurpose stuff!

P.S.: They should finally finish the Old Man campaign..."
531,"This game is insane, I have been playing it for over 6 years now and the mods that it has is amazing. still one of the best games in the universe."
532,I've played 33 hours in 2 days. That's it.
533,yes but okayit takre szup alot of space and do i need to buy taht expansions dlc
534,"Personally the best way to play this is find a group or 2 that do regular games, whether intensely realistic or very chilled out you'll find one that's best for you. Although there is other gamemodes and servers, which I've not tried out myself. If you find a good group you will have great fun and be emotionally scarred with the horrors you will witness.

You need at least a decent PC to run this, with a 1060 TI, I7-7770 and 16 gigs of RAM i get generally around 20-25 frames with 60-70 people, which might sound bad but it honestly isn't for arma, still very playable and very enjoyable

If you hear people say the controls are complex and that there's a lot of them, 1. 90% you don't use at least regularly 2. the ones you do use regularly are simple and easy to learn, just takes a quick look in the options. 

However if your moral code is completely and utterly against a bit of game bullshit, then you won't like it, as Arma's physics can be cruel and desyncs can be disastrous but it's easy to ignore them as 9 times out of 10 you'll just get right back to having fun. 

Overall 8.8/10, will go flying into the air after walking over a destroyed wall again"

536,"Rifleman, 100 Meters, Front!"
537,"Long story short, this is a great game that has a unique experience in military sim shooters.

Now for the catches:
- It has singleplayer capabilities, but you'll find the best content and quality by playing multiplayer, with mods, or in units with other players
- This game can still be hard to work with. It hasn't aged well for optimization.
- This game has a steep learning curve, and will require a time investment to get back out of it what you put into it. It took me a month to learn, but nonetheless led to over 2500+ hours for me, and still does to this day.
- Wait for it to go on sale. 
- The only dlc worth something is the Apex dlc, I recommend getting it with that.

Cheers while we all wait for ARMA 4."
538,good
539,Beep Boop
540,its a great game very good military simulator but one down side is the optimalization its pretty bad and the physics
541,i love revive my iraquis ptds in a video game
542,a-10 goes brrrrrrrrr
543,"This game sucks, I have no idea how it has such good reviews. The tutorial takes way longer than 2 hours, so by the time you realize the game sucks, Steam wont give you a refund. Great policy Steam. Way to go."

553,good game
554,Oh heck yes
555,Fun game has enough content for the 2 or so hours you'll play.
556,pew pew middle aged men being serious while going pew pew
557,Beside getting one tapped or getting pinned by angry MRAPs with grenade launcher people and using what inventory space you have dedicated to both medical supplies and grenades to kill those inside. its great.
558,I hate this game
559,pretty cool
560,amazing game. better with friends and with a unit. Hard to learn and hard to master but ig thats the point of the game. the learning curve is quite steep but not completly impossible. very fun to play and learn.
561,yes
562,it so good for shooting combyarm
563,"Really great game with tons of replayablity with tons of content with all the campaigns, showcases, challenges, dlcs, mods as well as the ingame editor (which u will be in for hours if not MP). The ads for dlcs you don't own can get annoying at times as well as not being able to enter or equip dlc content you don't own but there is still quite a bit of things you can play with and mods will increase that amount. Speaking or the mods, once you enter the workshop don't be surprised when you come out with a whole list finding their place on your harddrive."
564,kum
565,HELL YES. This game is so much fun!
566,best
567,Its a really fun game especially when you play with other people

583,"You're fine as long as you play just infantry, but when you start getting into vehicles, better bring another keyboard for dual wielding..."
584,"goober
"
585,This game lets you do basically anything theres hundreds of hours worth of playtime with just vanilla and hundreds more with the thousands of mods available for the game. very fun and entertaining game that dosent get boring
586,really fun good game
587,Honestly the game is pretty good but wouldn't recommend buying it now since there's almost no active servers left unless you would be playing the campaign.
588,goated
589,Game is fun only with mods in my opinion.
590,"with over a 1000 hours on this game i can say that this is one of my favourite games,from the mods to the community most stuff about this game is great. if you are looking for great mods these are ones i would recommend please note some of these mods are vastly different and are my opinion.

Half-Life 2's Source Engine had better physics, lighting, friendly & hostile AI, vehicle movement & gunplay. 

What's Bohemia's excuse? Not all your dev-team got locked in a Greek jail."

Really good game, the mods make the game as good as it gets. Play game modes like KOTH, Exile, and Liberation for the most effect of the game."
599,it gud
600,Don't ever play multiplayer KOTH. All they do is spawn camp with the best sniper rifle in the game
601,This game is so good I uninstalled Project Reality after playing it for over 16 years. Impressive sense of scale and immersion. Unlimited replayability + community mods make this utterly phenomenal. Get the Vietnam DLC to complete the total experience! Arma 3 + S.O.G. Prairie Fire DLC are amazing and a MUST PLAY for all fans of Mil-Sims!
602,just play lol
603,"With 300 hours into the game, I can safely say, I still don't know the keybindings. Good game; would recommend"
604,"Graphic content details, is more realistic, authentic physics engine"
605,o
606,"Great game to play and mess around with friends. Tons of funny moments to be had in this game, And on top if that whatever play style you love to play Arma 3 pretty much has it. You want to be a sniper popping head's off of your enemies while your team is moving in to take a compound out you got it, Or do you want all out tank warfare Arma has that as well, alongside the huge maps and endless missions for you to do is a decent community as well for you to download player made mission's and complete those as well. All in all Arma 3 is a great coop to major multiplayer mil-sim game of your imagination."
607,heli landing goes boom
608,Setting up epic battles in single player mode
609,"This game gives you the ability to make your own imagination come true. It is realistic and the best I have ever played, This is by far the most fun I have had since I started playing games. It is the only game so far where I don't get bored easily. But I won't lie, it's a difficult game to play, staying alive feels sometimes impossible."
610,"Most realistic FPS I've come across, playable, editable, SP & Coop, in a big world. good value for money."
611,"It's Arma game (successor of Operation Flashpoint), what else to say. Legend."
612,REALISTIC
613,pog
614,Absolutely love committing war crimes with the bois . This game is so much fun rather playing with friends or making cool scenes it editor
615,FUN and FUN
616,game helped me get laid. Thank you devs

622,;) the best ever
623,"You need to be very patient with this game . It tries to be realistic so expect it to be harder than the mainstream FPS out there. But it depends how your willing to take it , if you take it easy and try to take your time to learn it will be more enjoyable."
624,Arma 3 is the most realistic war game and simulation as first person shooter.
625,"IF YOU WANT A REALISTIC FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS COMBAT SIMULATOR THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU, sorry caps."
626,12345
627,"it takes a certain kind of person to enjoy this game, run across a field for 10 minutes hear gunfire, duck down, run another 15km and get shot once in the arm and bleed to death.
great experience 10/10 would maybe duck for cover next time."
628,Very fun if you play KOTH. +rep
629,"""I CAN'T SEE THEM"""
630,Great game if you want PTSD
631,"If you are looking for a milsim, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a HIGHLY configurable gaming experience, this is the game for you."
632,Runs like joe swanson
633,got to bomb some dudes taking a piss 10/10
634,"Its nice, altough the campagin can get somewhat hard or weird in some points."
635,"This game is like no other, I had a lot of fun on multiplayer servers and making my own (bad) scenarios. I don't have all DLCs but it does not matter THAT much since you can play with people that have a DLC that you don't and even join their vehicle. It has a good campaign that i saw a lot of people disliked but i really loved it, and I really like the content provided in some DLCs. like Prairie Fire, Apex or maybe even Contact. And there's also  the Western Sahara DLC that  adds a nice map and some vehicles/weapons. Pick this game up if it's on sale or if you got a lot of money (28 euros to be exact). I suggest before your first multiplayer experience you play the campaign, watch some guides on planes, helicopters and tanks. After learning how to play the game i suggest you join a multiplayer game on US servers. US servers are a lot of fun and I enjoy them a lot more than European servers. (example: people are more talkative on US servers). The stock content or the content that's in the base game is good, but mods add a lot to that. There are a lot of mods, ranging from weapons mods, vehicle mods to Titanfall mods, faction mods(RHS for example) and even star wars mods. There are mods that add effects, particles, (i.e blastcore) and 3 editor mods that add some quality of life improvments. I whould've liked to type more but I think that this is too much for most people already."
636,Much Chog
637,really big and good game. super underrated compared to other games.
638,The best game i have ever played
639,AWESOME Game!
640,Awesome! Simply awesome!!
641,"Too realistic but with a bad script and long loading time, this game put me into a loop of annoyance. If you want a chilling game to temporary forget about life, this is not recommended."
642,Great game
643,"amazing game
"
644,"uh, how have i not said this game is incredible yet..."
645,"Best Game EVER. I would certainly recommend buying ARMA3, You wont regret it!! However I would defiantly wait till it is on sale."
646,"This game has honestly been one of my favorites, ever since switching to PC gaming 6 years ago.  You want to casually play by yourself for hours? Too easy tons of missions either studio based and creator based. Want to get into milsim? Tooooo easy, there's plenty of good groups out there. I will say that you need a decent machine to run this game and run it well enough to not see huge frame lose in big battles and or in towns.  Other then that its worth the buy at full price.  With so much content either player made and studio, you cant go wrong!"
647,"
good shit
"
648,"Arma is a love hate relationship, I can complain all day about issues with it but probably one of my favourite games."
649,I've played for over 100 hours and I have only experienced a tiny fraction of what this game has to offer. Play with friends.
650,Do you like having fun? Are fun things fun for you? Play this game. Play it alot. Play it forever.
651,good gane it is so good i wold kill my self for it
652,"it's coo, i guess
"
653,Yee
654,Personally the game is good though public is chaos i enjoy it single player is good but can be hard for newer players who haven't played any arma game or tactical game but is easy to play after a few hours so yeah i think is a good game also if you can get the apex dlc or any of the cdlc.
655,YES
656,Like it.
657, helicopter
658,ha funny number
659, pretty pretty pretty pretty good
660,AGHHHH
661,Best Game
662,"yes
"
663,DLC too expensive
664,Yes.
665,learning curve if new to PC games but for sure worth the time and patience.  I've managed to use a PS4 dual shock to map most usable buttons and keep mouse and keyboard near by for all the other needed buttons (especially when running mods) i 100% recommend to anyone tired of the same old shooter and actually wants a game worth their time that as far as i can tell isn't getting old any time soon
666,"First off this game has so much mods,content and players this game is super fun and you can never get bored with how many mods there is i have about 80 mods installed and it does not mess up my game and im playing on a gaming computer so its pretty easy but it takes awhile to get use to the game like i still am trying to figure out how to use a flashlight or bipod or laser. But this game is great buy if your into tactical shooters"
667,some of my best gaming came from playing arma 3 if anyone sees this have a good day :)
668,"A lot to learn but once you get it right amazing experiences can be had, no matter how big or small."
669,gg
670,Amazing/Immersive. You can do about anything in this game.
671,army 4 great game like to draw on map
672,Best in Genre and one of the Best purchases in my life
673,This game is amazing so much fun and action packed and full of DLCs.but my computer is pretty old and cant handle a lot of things but i suggest you buys this game.
674,I have now tried it again after years and once again conclude that the game is unenjoyable. Clunky and soulless.
675,not bart
676,gucci
677,payed way to much not good enough
678,Good

683,"ArmA 3 while a bit intimidating at first is a fantastic game for those who like sim type games that cover a broad spectrum. Their is something for everybody in ArmA from flying, infantry, armor, content creation, etc."
684,very fun even if you just like top play by yourself.

"
688,Good. Expect months of learning
689,kuy
690,Arma 3 is an highly entertaining game that is capable of creating thousands of hours of fun. The initial investment is most definitely worth it.
691,"ArmA is what you want Arma to be and that's over the top reason why its so GOOD, of course you can do lots of stuff with the editor, but if not you can script almost what ever you want x)."
692,"very realistic
"
693,Awesome milsim with a lot of custom content.
694,"Wow. What can I say about ArmA 3. (Armed Assault 3, that is) This is an absolute phenominon of a game, and that goes beyond the core gameplay and fun factor delivered in the executable file itself, but in the knowledge gained from partaking on this veritable adventure. First, there is the transferablle tactical expertise, which when gathered from playtime in this game can be moved to other games like CSGO, or PUBG, or even the Witcher 3, to further enhance your experience there. Upon seeing the loading screen of this game, your mind is injected with subtle yet core changes to its strategic stratephos, allowing calculations on a grand scale to be conducted in lightning speed. Next, we see that the game actually makes you an immediate comedian. Simply saying in game catchphrases like, ""Contact Contact Contact"", ""Im taking overwatch"", or ""Calling in CAS"" will have your friends, family, significant others, and neighbors sprawled on the ground laughing. Finally, this game gives you a complete rudimentary understanding of everything military based, think of it as being in the army for a year or two. When you see a veteran in public, you can now approach with a wide variety of conversational topics, such as PTSD, or how black NPCs are worse than white ones. You can tell them you fully understand how heavy a pack of gear weighs, and how long average in operation transport flights take. If you dont understand some of the ""terminology"" ive been interspersing throughout this review, I think that just goes to show how simple minded your brain can be pre-ArmA 3 experience. (Armed Assault 3, that is) Talk to me when you barrel roll your first helicopter inside of a friendly APC while blasting trap music over the stereo system while 600 invisible objects explode around you, sending you flying under the map, while your CO applauds you on your incredible dedication to immersion and realism. Silly casual. Maybe (Scoffs) COD, or (Chuckles) Battlefield is more your thing."
695,"In the great words of the little man himself ""I will be pilot"" And his mentor ""Grape Greap"" This is an awesome game
"
696,its a great game.
697,"good
"
698,yeah it is good
699,da
700,war fun
701,The games fun with friends
702,nice game
703,"Very fun with mods, without mods is meh
"
704,"For a certain kind of someone. Co-op lobbies are my jam. Slow burn, but when things get hot it get's really really hot."
705,The best moddable mafia and/or army shootout game ever !!!
706,"What can I truly say, after 2300 hours its one of the most versatile and enjoyable game out on the market. The sheer amount of modification to play to everyone's own play style is mind boggling. Between map builidng, zuesing and volume of modifications to tweek however you want to play make it hands down one of the best games available on steam to this day despite its age."
707,"now do the flashbang dance
"
708,The best war simulation ever.waiting for arma 4
709,one of the best sims out there
710,Great game!
711,cock
712,Best Mil sim out there
713,meh
714,An extremely good game but has to be played with friends and modded for some long time journey. Or if you're a Russian dude sweating a King of the Hill server
715,kinda good but you need a lot of mods to make it feel smoother i recommend it but only if you like alot of mods
716,got touched by the tailban 10/10
717,Graphics
718,It¬¥s ok
719,"My little brother wanted it, played it for 6-7 hours, never touched it again. But he still liked the 6-7 hours he played so yes I would say its a good game for those who like shooter games."
720,I have put so many hours into this game there is an endless amount of content to be had and friends to be made in the arma 3 community. Wanna be a Clone trooper or a mandolorian and kill droids in epic conquest battles all player made we have it. wanna be a american paratrooper in the 1940s fighting germans we have it. wanna fight scp's and be sent in to save the world from destruction we have it. wanna replicate what the future wars are going to look like we have it. This community has showed me so much love and given me so much joy over the years and i know its old and it has its own issues but i promise play this game find a milsim or a group in general and play with the various mods and youl find yourself addicted.
721,Very good game!
722,"The game has it glitches and has its bitter sides, but in all honesty, a person who loves to play and enjoy different kinds of games, i would have to admit that this is my favorite one, this is the second copy ive bought and if i had to, i would buy it again ."
723,great game if your into mil-sims
724,"the best of the best still in 2022
"
725,fucking amazing
726,"Arma 3 is a milsim taking place in 2035 in on the Island of Stratis. Its Main Campaign ""The East Wind"" is nothing sort of perfection both performance and graphical (for a game from 2013 at least) 

It features both single player and Multiplayer modes ranging from;
- Single Player Campaign (with more that can be purchased via DLC)
-Multiplayer Campaigns that can be purchased including Tac-ops which is imo the best MP Campaign content
-Multiplayer battles across multiple maps with many popluar game modes like CTF, Sector Control, Assault

There is also the Eden Editor which opens an entirely new range of options to makr your own Sp and MP missions or (Scenarios) that you can make as difficult or har as possible.

The inclusion of the Workshop allows you to upload or download Mods ranging from Graphical overhuals, Weapons, maps, Cosmetics, Gear, Characters, and more. Making the eden editor something to be feared my other games.

Also if your looking for a group to play with message me Id love to give you the tour as us vets always should.


See you on the Battlefield soldier
"
727,"Fun, and not fun. WATCH THE ROGSCAST, ISLE IS WORSE THAN THIS GAME!"
728,Finally I'm an Arma 3 veteran I've reached 1000 hours
729,"I can't enjoy the game fully because I have no friends...

If you have friends buy it, then it's good. Otherwise don't even bother."
730,its fine i guess
731,pretty good
732,"its arma what more can i say
"
733,ARMA 3 is a must have game for all MILSIM enthusiasts around the world. It has been so much enhanced by the community that is now a node for various universes and play styles.
734,"Its ok
"
735,scientifically realistic
736,GG
737,1 whole day in arma 3 and im still not bored
738,"I have thousands of hours in A2 and hundreds in A3, I love Arma, so much fun when it works. The problem is that it doesn't work so often, so many bugs and quirks. It seems like it has a mind of its own some days and is quite temperamental. One day it will work (mostly) flawlessly, the next day it will screw up over and over again and you might as well give up because it's just an exercise in frustration. I wish the engine could be more consistent."
739,Great game very nice for people who l enjoy with to do
740,Best hope you got a decent pc
741,good.
742,This game really gets u hanging off your seat and on your toes. Its really competitive And its rally fun
743,yres
744,"Yeah, its pretty good"
745,..
746,Cool simulator but not good for me.
747,"god i wish i knew how to play this game

4/5 - apparently there are at least 10,000 mouse buttons ,according to this game"
748,"very fun and i enjoy it
"
749,no
750,I bought Arma 3 a long time ago and now is not in my library any more?
751,3rd in line next to league and csgo takeover

753,Warcrimes simulator love every second
754,Best realistic game ngl
755,"much harder than you think but if you look for strategy this is the game for you, just played 10 hours and feel i just started, highly reccomend"
756,good
757,Good game.
758,Get ready to press f5 to go forward and numpad enter to move backwards. H to shoot. mouse 3 to reload. mouse 4/5 to walk left and right. z to aim. It's easier to control a human by shoving your fist up their ass than to control your character in Arma.
759,"MAKES ME SAD, TAKES ALL OF MY MEMORY"
760,"Arma is like skating. You want to learn how to do it because it is cool but the procces is way too boring
"
761,"Really nice, can do many war crime."
762,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
763,"Arma 3 has been around for quite sometime, but I continue to come back to it. It is my most played game on Steam at the moment. The community among players are always welcoming if you enjoy online. The in-game editor is very diverse and allows you to create any type of content. The workshop of this game is also endless with free content that is beautifully made. And lastly, if you just want to play the game on your own, the original campaign has a good storyline and a lengthy playthrough. Buy it. Play it. Enjoy it."
764,no idea how to play it properly. there really wasn't a campaign mode that was straight forward idk maybe its just me. i dont have any friends to help me through anything and couldn't really figure out how to do multiplayer so for now i dont recommend unless you know what your doing
765,It's a great game the only downside is that you have to buy a lot of stuff that should just come with the game.
766,good game. one hitting other players and then get onehittet by sniper would recommend to other friends
767,"Good luck remembering all the keys!
;)"
768,"I go Adam Mode on this game
"
769,FUN
770,"Realy hard , nice"
771,"one of the best, if not the best"
772,"Alright game, but that's just my opinion"
773,"sus
"
774,the trees are speaking vietnamese
775,"This is a very good game if you like sandbox, multiplayer, shooter, action, and thousands of great mods and comps. This is the best game I have every had!
One thing I don't like, there are so many things that are DLC's so when you join multiplayer games they call you poor if you don't have the DLC!"
776,Fuck this game
777,nice
778,"had this game since alpha, best way to play is with mods"
779,The ui isnt good and not as good as advertised 5/10 do not reccomend
780,video game
781,shoot people
782,It's pretty good
783,Best game ever.
784,its ok
785,"I enjoy the act of RP and having fun, then RP while going on a cocaine gathering run. Gets me into the game and results in hours of fun. Even if we stand around thinking of what to do for 10 minutes; there's always something going on or someone randomly approaching us that we kidnap and sell their organs. When trying to take out a vehicle from your garage though, be careful. Some people like to camp out and attack you once you do. Or you can go out into the outskirts of cities/towns to more remote garages or truck shops. 

Getting Uranium is a pain. Most players don't seem to take part in the fun activity of mining in radioactive areas, then processing the Uranium at a nearby Nuclear Plant. But my friend and I sure do. So if you're ever nearby and want to say hi be sure to wave! We love guests and enjoy some company between driving and the process of mining all the resources. 

If you ever go to a busy city, just go prone and roll. This is the pro strategy for getting out of being arrested or being detained and kidnapped. The majority of people don't know what to do or are so caught up in you rolling around they get mesmerized by it and join you. They could kill you for not cooperating but that isn't very nice. So if someone does kill you without a valid reason, spawn back and kidnap them. Take them to an undisclosed location far from any cities or towns, preferably where nobody would hear any gunshots if one were to pull a trigger on a loaded weapon. 

I will leave you with this, 
Since you are either part of two categories of people (those who are looking at buying this game, Arma 3. Or those of you who have bought it and want to see what others have said about it) just have fun. Shoot people with reason and don't be a downer. New players are more likely to get kidnapped and robbed off the bat. But you could also be kidnapped and meet a gang you enjoy and become their leader. Eventually, one by one killing them all from behind and become the inside person. ""Taking down the biggest gang in Arma 3"" just imagine being able to say you did that!

Vibe with people, shoot some people, rob people, skin people. It's all possible in the wonderful world of Arma 3."
786,"theres a man whit millitary uniform offering this game for free for a blowjob, stay safe everyone"
787,good
788,me when my car does a 180 flip and we can no longer drive (all of our bones are also broken and we're bleeding to death)
789,best combat game ever
790,"Pros:  You probably won't find a military sim more realistic than ARMA 3.  Different servers have different rules.  I'm currently playing a zombie Day Z mod.  The server isn't crowded but I'm in the US, and the Dev's along with a lot of other players are in Europe.

Cons:  There is a thing called ARMA physics.  Riding a bicycle will kill you some times depending on how ARMA feels.  The controls are not straight forward like most shooter games.  I mean you can adjust your sites to zero distance on most guns. 

From modern warfare to Vietnam jungle warfare, this has it all.  I didn't really like the Vietnam addon because you couldn't see the enemy, but its not supposed to be easy, but accurate."
791,Good op game!
792,Forever lag
793,this is the best and most played game I have on steam i bought a pc to play this game and that was one of my best decisions I've made

817,"I bought this game expecting to get blasted with complex mechanics and while yes, it is a bit complex I learned it in 10-20 minutes of a game and it was a really good experience."

822,Great game.
823,"The most realistic war simulator on the market by a far margin. It has its trolls but they are nowhere near as common as in games like CSGO and some of the other FPS on the market. expect to die a lot. and then expect to die some more. but then you start to slow down and peak every corner and listen to your team making calls and you start getting the hang of it. and then you die a few more times.....now you should be able to make the AO on a regular to semi-regular basis. Now hold houses within the priority zone in KOTH. Move with the zone as it moves. You will have every enemy that knows how to play coming to you and it will increase your gun play opportunities and therefore your gun play results. I try to play with at least one person in my friends list but honestly the teams don't scream and yell at each other. The community just seems more mature than the communities of other games I have played. I can honestly say my run ins with ""suspicious"" players is less common in this game. If you look hard enough you can probably get a mod that runs a game you want to play within the arma infrastructure but only with the more detailed imagery and options."
824,"The epitome of jank. Just about everything in the game is janky. Movement is janky. You basically move like your character just downed a fifth of Jack Daniels. Just navigating over fences without the advanced movement mod is pain because instead of a jump key you've got an awkward stepping key that may or may not clip you into a fence. Deploying bipods is a nightmare. You may only deploy your bipod when and how the bipod god deems it appropriate, usually clipping into a rock or in a way that gives you like a 5 degree field of fire. To top it all off, the enemy AI practically use aimbots given their insane accuracy and ability to spot you.
That said, it's got the most insanely fun and intense multiplayer experience. Despite all the flaws I mentioned, I've still put close to 200 hours into it just from mostly playing invade and annex 64 player co-op and I've had more than a few memorable moments from said co-op experience. Landing in a hot LZ in a little bird only for the pilot to get SHOT IN THE FUCKING FACE as everyone bails out and scrambles for cover, hopping in the gunner seat of an IFV in a convoy and rolling into a town blasting enemies left and right, and storming towards an enemy HQ with like 20 other guys in a Soviet esque charge as guys drop left and right and enemy mortar fire rains down around us are just a few of a the fond memories I've had of the game so far.
If you do get it, I'd recommend playing just enough of the singleplayer to familiarize yourself with the controls (believe me, there's a lot to familiarize yourself with), jump into the multiplayer, and then never bother with the singleplayer aspect again."
825,goody
826,i tried to play this game so many hours in a row that it would kill me. im calling it quits at 4127 hours. game's not bad tho.
827,Good game :D
828,"I've been playing this game on and off since release, I'm a boring single player only kinda guy.

This might count as a spoiler, so continue at your peril;

I only finished the base campaign last night, and after the final mission if you make a certain choice, you're abandoned and sort of left to your own devices, I decided I was going to try to survive and go to one of the nearby docks to try to find means of escape, Corporal Kerry had come too far and done too much to simple roll over and die in a last stand.

There was a convenient quad bike left on the road, so I hopped on it and made my way through the dark night to the dock.
I started to turn around to face the direction I needed to go, I hit accelerate and after maybe 20 metres, I hit a rock which killed me and was then faced with big white letters stating ""THE END"".

It was a sad end to a heroic tale."

839,Amazing game
840,Its ight
841,good fun to snipe from 2 kilometres away
842,"this game is very educational along as very fun. its slow paced but rewards with satisfying kills, and makes you feel good helping out the team. for a 10 year old game the graphics are very impressive as well. the only issue with this game is that because its ten years old it runs mostly on one core instead of multi core threading that causes frames to be around 20-40 depending on what server you play on. the game can educate people who arent familiar with military warfare tactics, and how guns work, what things to use ect. instead of cod that almost forces you to use the ugliest attatchments and almost have no impact on your gun irl. i reccomend this game to the older audience for it is slow paced, but rewarding."
843,NOICE
844,uh good game
845,"cause goood
"
846,"Cool if you have friends, i dont"
847,"An excellent game overall. Not without bugs or flaws, but my experience playing Arma has been positive 99% of the time. It does, however, take quite a bit of time and effort to become familiar with the mechanics and controls. I still don't know them all. Arma is definitely a game that requires both commitment and skill, but it's worth it."
848,nice game
849,Yes
850,Yes
851,"I don't understand this game.  It's supposed to be a FPS but there's nothing to shoot at. 
After 2 hrs of gaming I have died about 20 times and I've not seen one enemy yet.  It's like I'm an  easy setting tutorial NCP."

853,"Well, about time i write a review. If you are reading this, you probably wonder whether to buy the game or not, especially considering the fact the game is almost a decade old. After so many hours in this game, i can say this game isnt for everyone. The people that enjoy this game are playing it mainly for the mods and communities, or altis life. You will find mods for almost all popular shooter settings, and more. The only limits are your imagination, and the games ancient engine. That is the games real strength, it is the only somewhat decent shooter sandbox, with nothing out there coming remotely close to that. If you are looking to get the most out of the game, join a community or clan. The more the merrier as they say."
854,Best expiriance
855,bad
856,uhh good game lol
857,"It's a very unique game that BI has made here. A cross between Sandbox and tactical shooter, with tools for the community to easily make content is an impressive feat I've yet to see any other game achieve. While the vanilla game can sometimes feel shallow, mods like RHS or ACE completely change the playing field, and those really only scratch the surface of what you can do. Hundreds, if not thousands of hours of fun, and really worth every penny.
If you're willing to learn somewhat funky controls and get over the learning curve the game does have."
858,old game but brings a smile on my face evry time i start it
859,Favourite Mil-sim Might seem outdated but add some mods and the game outranks all mil-sims
860,Bug factory
861,"√ìtimo jogo de simula√ß√£o t√°tica, n√£o joguei muito, mas posso dizer que √© um √≥timo game pra quem busca um realismo impressionante em um ambiente hostil em meio a um conflito t√°tico onde cada pessoa tem que fazer alguma determinada fun√ß√£o para assim cumprir o objetivo que o jogo d√°, futuramente pretendo dar outra chance para esse game, mas agora n√£o curti muito ele, talvez seja por n√£o jogar com os amigos em coop fazendo alguma miss√£o feita pela a comunidade."
862,its ok sometimes
863,"Epic funny military game, would recommend after playing 5 hours on nothing but zeus getting frustrated at the keybinds and wondering why there is so much. Game is fun but you know these key binds can be very frustating and wish it was more simplified, better to play with friends because playing by yourself or with randoms can be depressing"
864,"This game is scary to play, but I enjoy it :D"
865,yes
866,"Recently bought the game during the sales and it's already the best decision of my life. Perfect for Milsim/Tactical Shooter Gamers with a little bit of Role Play (from a Project Reality Player). Despite being release in 2013 its still fun and has a lot of content from a singleplayer and multiplayer perspective that can be found at the workshop. Time was well spent especially when playing in a community with the same vibes and culture and can make the game very immersive when things get hot real quick, Overall i recommend this game to those who like Milsim/Tactical Shooter games."
867,best game ai kinda suck and kinda dumb but its a pretty fun game for someone that has 1006 hours on it they also make these deals
868,good game
869,"Default gameplay is garbage. Only play with mods, there's a shit ton of mods for almost everything."
870,its realistic
871,fun game
872,its really a 1 in 1million find for people who like miltaristic simulators
873,I hate it
874,"Great game, my graphics card isn't the greatest (1050ti) so I have to play on medium/low settings... game would be even better if I played on an upgraded card. Takes awhile to get used to the controls and how somethings operate but that is expected for the vast amount of things you can do in this game. Would recommend to anyone who likes realistic shooters and anyone that is willing to invest some time to learn all of the optional strategies to go about this game."
875,"naravno dobar simulator, Karam ≈°iptare ko 99e. 

Naravno Don ≈†apca. Vidimo se."
876,good.
877,"Really good, but its becoming old. I hope for more polishing and improvements in the next release.
Also the DLC while pricey, are ate least qualitative."
878,guud game play with friends or big servers
879,i think hamburgers and cheeseburgers work well with fries
880,"Man
I love shooting civilians"
881,pretty nice game but hard to remember all the controls
882,"Committed 19 war crimes just yesterday.
 10/10, would recommend
"
883,gut
884,Perfect PTSD Simulator
885,pro reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
886,Highly recommended if u want the most realistic modern warfare experience in a game takes a while to get used to everything but the community will help you quickly.
887,great game really realistic
888,o
889,very good game!
890,Nice :)
891,"So darn good , but its cpu heavy"
892,if you like realistic tactical fps shooters and want to feel like your in a real conflict this is the game for you
893,OK
894,Is good
895,:NATO: CTRG GAMING CTRG GAMING SCOTT MILLER IS SO BASED :NATO: :NATO: ATTACK MIKE 26

902,PTSD and warcrimes.
903,gib arma 4
904,good
905,"Very realism heavy with a steep learning curve but its a brilliant game, on your own or with friends its a lot of fun."
906,"this game is honestly good for pve, i refunded it because i was looking for pvp but there literally no servers for pvp. if you are looking for a game like arma or any military simulation look at ""Squad"" or ""Ready or not"""
907,"Most realistic mil-sim game I've played. Definitely has it's quirks and times where you'll fail to pass a checkpoint, but overall great."
908,"Action packed, play with friends ""good idea"" game. SSD required for optimal experience from my book :)"
909,very realistic
910,Very fun and provides the intense ass clenching action im looking for! I would highly recommend using a mouse with plenty of extra buttons though.
911,is good
912,"Great game, a lot of fun to sit down and blow off some steam playing."
913,Hyper boring. I'm not sure why so many of you like to waste your time on these garbage milsim games
914,good
915,"multiplayer isnt even good, which is why i bought the game, all the players ive encountered are toxic and my own teamates constantly tk me and when i retaliate after being tkd multiple times im the one who is kicked, in my almost 20 hours of gameplay ive encountered one friendly player on a altis life pve server"
916,press page down to breathe in and F12 to breathe out
917,Probably the most amazing game in the world.
918,They said it was realistic
919,"wery good, wery nice."
920,"very good
yes"
921,"No fun, hard to navigate, could not get into it. 0/10"
922,YYYESSSSSSSSS
923,"Vanilla game is mediocre, but community filled it with ton of great mods and missions that took me houndreds of hours of life together with my friends. It is worth spending time to learn how to play and join (or create) a group yourself. Really good option for a coop."
924,big tank go boom big plane go zoom

935,Really fun!
936,"""Do you wish to crawl through a field for hours, only to get lasered by an apc? this game is for you!""
Come on... that is not the way to reccomend a game
*clears throat*
DO YOU WANT WILD FUCKING ACTION? PTSD. DO YOU WANT TO IGNORE EVERY LAW OF WAR, EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE OF THE GENEVA CONVENTION?!?. DO YOU WANT TO LEVEL AN ENTIRE CIVILLIAN TOWN JUST TO FINISH A SINGLE MISSION?
WELCOME TO ARMA 3 SOLDIER!
DID I FORGET TO MENTION THIS GAME HAS INSANE MODS?
BUY NOW (on sale, im not saying its not worth 30 euro because it is, 30 euro is kinda expensive so wait for a sale if you care)"

961,"In [EDITOR] i was fulling around with controls to get the hang of it but when i went to fight bots with bots it was glichy it was like i had low frames or somthing, all though i had every display setting on high.               
 {could ya'll fix that plz}"
962,"Pretty good game. Not as hard as you'll think but what's hard is figuring out how to play and what to do after you figured out how to play. Various mods allow you to turn the game into whatever you want. Bring Star Wars or 40K into Arma, and more. One of the best Military Sandboxes of all time definitely."
963,"Solid war simulator dev from operation flashpoint!! so good that you just dont want to get into contact with the enemy, just like actual war."

984,Nice game for milsim fans
985,"Ehhh, I think 2000+ hours expain themselves how much I love Arma. Tremendous amount of mods and every one of them enhances the feeling of the gameplay. If you want a good shoot em up bang bang/zombie slayer/ millionaire sim/ thug life/ all in one package, this is your go to game. 

From all these... from simple beautiful screenshots of landscapes to ferocious fights, to high skies with jets, underwater stealth operations, screeching of tank wheels as you roll with your combat gorup, blades cutting air as you fly with attack helicopter... or just casual driving offroad doing site-seeing. 

10 / 10 

This is Arma."

1003,"Honestly, I was about to tire out of King of the Hill, then I got recommended to try a Modded RP server out, and I've been hooked. The game itself has a lot of bugs that you just end up getting used to, but you end up still having a lot of fun even in high populated servers."
1004,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.

1011,"2022 game hold up pretty well, I recommend getting the profiling exe for better fps other than that this game is a true gem

STEPS

- Right click on Arma 3 in your Steam Library, then Properties

- Select the tab BETAS

- Enter the code CautionSpecialProfilingAndTestingBranchArma3 then click CHECK CODE

- Finally, still in this BETAS tab, use the dropdown list to select the branch profiling - Performance Profiling Build"

1020,i am thai people. first thing first. i can speak and type English not much. and i don't know about game system much. OK so i ganna tell you developer. your is good  it's have a lot content and a lot of system in the game. but your game is very bad. i mean S-ck. your engine can't make GPU run 99% or 100%. it's not run to 50% additionally. i check on afterburner every i play your game. my GPU and other is same situation i knew it. your game is not bad and not good but if you fix this problem you game will better than battlefield 2042 or whatever game. and your sale will be better than present. if type something wrong or not gentle i sorry in this comment. i hope this game is better because this game is my favorite game when i feel down from working all day.

1056,Do it all milsim
1057,fagot if u dina buy the game
1058,Amazing
1059,If your a war fan like me buy this game. Great gameplay and rp is great too. Didnt find anything bad or annoying except the lobbies with friends are abit difficult. Otherwise love this game 10/10
1060,"Do you like being screamed at by other random online people? Do you like being overly frustrated because you paid $60 or whatever this shit is now, and you literally cant even figure out how to get passed the MENUS? Well then ARMA is for you.

You want to play with your friends? Well good luck because its going to be a team effort just to figure out how this fucking game works.

Prepare to hate yourself for hours as you die repeatedly and never know or understand how or why you died, if you even make it that far. Spawn in on the wrong team? Too bad, bitch, the red team owns the whole map, fuck you.

Wanna run to that building over there? Too bad bitch, a random sniper from literally 4 kilometers away shot you in the head before you could even move.

Ok, I'll get in a tank, thatll be fun! Nope, fuck you. Air strike from a jet or a drone or whatever, AS you waste any money youve accumulated over any amount of time to buy the tank, destroys the tank and kills you as it spawns. Great.

But.. I'll just get in a jet myself then!... Nope. The other team owns the air field. You cant take off. Because the game wont let you... Yes. Thats how dumb this shit is.

Go buy Battlefield. That game is at least entertaining. This game is just shit. If I want to experience what its really like to be in the military, I'll join the military, not play fucking ARMA.

Garbage UI
Garbage Gameplay
Garbage Controls
Garbage community"
1061,JUST GET IT ALREADY ITS SO GOOD!!! Honestly I love this game and the fact that no kizzy I got rocketed out of helicopters 5 times before i got on the battled.
1062,"This game is amazing! Large scale, full mod support, multiple maps, single player scenarios and campaign, server browser, custom game mods, map creator, scenario creator, wide variety of weapons, vehicles, characters models going from NATO, Independent forces, CSAT, AAF, FIA, and civilians. Incredibly realistic milsim (other than life role-play servers). So basically you should get this game if you love fps games, milsims, and flying sims too."
1063,10 fps is good.
1064,"Great game. Get the SOG Prarie Fire DLC and play mike force for some fun PvE. The standard stuff lacks coordination, but game types like Invasion, and Mike Force help bring ransoms together online. I never got into clan stuff, but it looked emersive. I‚Äôve enjoyed the different roles and vehicles to fight. I would say this game is harder to find coordinated server games than Squad. I think the command, squad, role would enhance this. But it‚Äôs a sandbox, so that would only put restrictions. Anyway, a must have if you enjoy simulation or sandbox military games. Also only $7.50ish on sale days! Bought for a friend when it was that cheap."
1065,you would let this game anally violate you. that's how this game feels to play. pain and pleasure at the same time.
1066,It's pretty good I guess.
1067,"Arma3 is pretty good, thing is the controls are shit to get used to."
1068,"Fantastic game, make sure to join a group of people to play with otherwise can be boring.

1073,"realism in this game is like 1000%
And ofc worth buying."
1074,Ive had it less than a week and already loving it
1075,"This game its great I have been playing it for years honestly into the milsim stuff cause due to previously being in the military but overall it scratches that milsim itch that you have especially with the game's units etc the base game is nice but what really makes this game shine is the mods.

The community is great as it always has been always creating new content and singeplayer missions for people to play on or use its frantically amazing and I'm looking forward to arma 4 because of this. There is one gripe with the game and it is the way how SOME servers are runned which I've seen myself and it comes down to the admins when it comes to bans it is either you were an ahole or the admins are an ahole there's no in between thankfully most servers don't have those type of admins but when you do come across them you will definitely notice it.

Some servers will run it for having a strong community and playerbase and others are just outright toxic from the head of staff all the way down and constantly beg for donations for their dying servers which I've seen very common amongst the exile mod community and thank god those servers died cause their staff were extremely toxic towards their own playerbase.

Now when it comes down to the Milsim community its great I have zero complaints except for those that just don't like the purpose of a video game which is to have fun. The community is great and always willing to help personally I'm in the TSB units which is one of the best units I've ever been involved in it takes hard work and dedication to be in it and overall its a great experience and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to be recruited into a arma unit.

The sound designs are definitely old but some mods as well as JRS soundmod keeps the game fresh in a way even the mods for the guns such as NIarsenal or cup or rhs weapons it feels and plays fresh oh plus the USAF mod has a juicy A10 thunderbolt sound that goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRT other than that I'll give this game a 8/10 now why didn't it get a 10/10 well...

Its the way how the developers treat their dlc's or game in general which is ouch I seen one of the recent dlc's ( obviously the cold war dlc ) they've put out which is just GOD aweful and should've never been released in the first place and they charge 15 dollars for it? for a dlc that is completely broken also jets and other dlc's that they still charge for full price over 6 years like jeez is it hard to drop down the price of it a bit the game isn't brand new. Plus some dlc's clearly copied from mods which could be a copyright infringement in steam conduct of rules. Despite SOG prarie fire dlc being surprisingly good it clearly shows that they've copied some assets from the UNSUNG mod especially the guns and some vehicles the real reason why we never gotten anymore jets in that specific DLC is because they don't want to come out as exactly copying everything or caught doing so especially with unsung jets and PT boats. Hell they even copied the songs playing inside the heli which was blatantly obvious to anyone that played the mod other than that I suggest to leaving that whole fiasco alone as they're trying to stir away from the UNSUNG Mod which thankfully they are to create their own assets and looking forward to seeing the new content coming up in the near future. Please whatever you game devs do do not create a big mess like the cold war DLC again that was just god aweful your fanbase have high expectations of you and respect don't destroy it.

The last one is just about cpu usage just why arma just why lmao it uses a crap ton of cpu usage which causes massive lag spikes even with a i7 12th gen so be prepared to get random lag spikes out of nowhere in the game and get accustom to verifying or repairing your files every now and then due to some mods screwing itself up after a update which causes pbo file errors.

Overall the game is 8/10 its a experience like no other which you cannot find in any other game and if you're thinking about buying this game get it while it's on sale it's worth it and always review mods or dlc's before purchasing or downloading it only buy the dlc's when it is on sale and also look forward to seeing Arma 4.

1114,"This game is honestly one of my favorite games I've ever purchased, one of the very best milsims that I have ever laid eyes on. Playing with friends on servers, running missions, flying and cooperating is amazing. If you ever thought about buying it, its worth it."
1115,"Solid 7/10. This game is special in the way that knowing the game is far more important than being good at shooters. It's not a difficult game to get into after learning the controls, but there are so many mechanics that even players with hundreds of hours will still be learning. However, the game's age definitely shows, with performance issues and AI that is so inconsistent that it's sometimes frustrating. The developers have given plenty of tools to make your own maps and game modes, which is my favorite part of the game. You can be as simple or complicated as you want with the mission editor, and you can use their game engine's shitty scripting language if you really want to do something cool. The biggest issues I have with making my own content is the lack of accurate documentation on various tools and scripting commands. The developers are somewhat active in the discord, and the community is mostly friendly, so pretty much any question about the game will be answered. All in all, the game can be fun if you play alone or with friends, or if you want to play PvE or PvP. If you can get past the shitty graphics, the annoying AI, the lack of weapons, and the normal occurrence of smoke grenades and vehicles being launched into the stratosphere, you will have fun with this game."

1128,*Laughs in warcrimes*
1129,"Can only recommend this to diehard fans of strategy wanting the absolutely most realistic experience.
I don't fall into that so tried servers, and was able to enjoy some rp server where you grind jobs and get to drive more fun vehicles in an immersive environment but that steals endless endless hours only a school kid has.
I also tried a TDM game which was neat though in stralia it was hard to find good servers, and the people playing were very good so it's not welcoming at all for newer people

Tried the campaign but it's not at all how you'd think a game campaign would be done with heavy action, clear objectives, basic player interactions - instead everything is complete and realistic. You ride a heli for a minute or so. You hop off and listen to a lecture. You find where to go after consulting multiple of your devices. You go there, etc etc.
I don't know how the game has such a large fanbase with how hardcore and realistic it all is"

1140,the best fps drop simulator money can buy
1141,"Definitely a great game even though its about 10 years old. Its not perfect i know, physics in this game can be crazy. The modding community has been doing so well over the past years. The campaign is very nice, well made and has a great story to it. Overall 9/10 great game, may need a couple more fixes, prolly a couple optimizations and yeah."
1142,This game is quite realistic. I like it.
1143,after 10k hours i dont think i like this game takes to long to get to places but good mmo
1144,Probably the best mil-sim on the market. Mods are heavily encouraged for the full experience.
1145,yup
1146,"first of all, the game has a good base. There are a lot of obvious glitches to the game. But im writing this review because i want speak on the behalf of like 80% of the community. Why is it a Israeli Merkava (slammer) versus the ZBD225 (t140) 
i mean its rediculous, Opfor gets 3 different types of tanks which can all take 5 rounds of APFSDS right to the side and be fine
on the other hand you can shoot a slammer with an HE round to its strongest spot and it dies, im requesting a delete of the merkava and replace it with the challenger 2 or abrams, i mean it just would make sense
another issue, the Nato AA seems so weak to neoprhons and shikras. i have good techniques for shooting down aircraft. But it wont work when the missile just scratches the aircraft. make it more realistic where the missile absolutley destroys the aircaft with one or two hits. i just got off the game from being so pissed after being camped by a neo and xian for 20 minutes and i put 3 missiles into the same neophron and hit it directly and all i got was engine smoke and it was still able to strafe and kill me and my heli without any issues. im sure i have more issues but i cant think of them right off the bat like these. other wise the FPS part of the game is great, i love the map, i love the guns but i wish more guns were added like the M249, i also think Actual artillery would make a good update to this game such as mortar AI's or Vehicles such as the russian 2S19 and the American M109, i think a lot of people would use them and love them in Warlords. and this seems like a stretch but honestly if you got rid of the shikra and the blackwasp, the game would be waaaay more playable for both sides in late gameplay, i think this because the best counter for both jets is their rival opposing jet. and replace the two jets with UAV planes. If i have any more ideas id be sure to leave another review, but other than my certain issues. id rate the game 7/10. and i understand the game is old, but its still very much alive even though the community is smaller than most games. good day!"
1147,"This game is absolutely amazing. I'd suggest getting mods as the game can get boring fast. It took me a while to find some decent marine mods, but after 1-2 hours of searching, it was worth it."
1148,it's ok
1149,Good game but people kick you for no reason from servers or shoot you than leave.
1150,Gud game
1151,"Super fun military sim. As someone that usually sucks at these games and gets bored/frustrated with them pretty quickly, I actually like this one. And there's a lot of mods out there to add nice free extra content."
1152,good game
1153,awesome
1154,fun

1156,Fun tactical shooter. Good simulator story was good and custom games are amazing. Coming from real player but have a good PC because this game will push it to its limits in large scale battles.

"
1165,"The community for this game has put out lots of free mods that make it worthwhile, even despite the somewhat lacking underlying framework."
1166,"If you like tactical military games, the scope of this is huge, and i like it."
1167,It was ok...
1168,This maybe an old game however it still holds up. If you're planning to play mods are strongly recommended to bring the game up to scratch.

1172,"This game has been an addiction for me for years and I enjoyed almost every bit of it.

Outside of MMO's this game has my highest playtime."

1178,Solid game fun modes to play like wasteland or you can find some milsim groups if that is your sorta thing. Fun with friends or make friends with randoms definitely worth.
1179,"I was expecting to have fun playing this game, but it's too hard. I get the point of trying to be real, but I spend more time loading the game after dying than actually playing it. Not to mention the long fields you need to cross while managing your stamina.

1206,"If you're looking for a game that can give you anything from small scale special ops missions, to massive campaigns that take days to complete, this is the game for you. The modding community for this game is truly massive, you can write your own scripts and cut scenes, and the code library available to mission makers is nothing short of massive. This game looks superb, but runs like dog doo. It's mostly locked to a single CPU core. For reference, I have an RTX 3090 and 8700k @ 5GHz, but I still dip to 20-30 FPS at times no matter the graphics settings. It's just something you'll have to deal with, unfortunately. If you can look past that issue, this is truly an amazing game. May you have 1000's of hours of enjoyment and tales like I do."

1215,I was killed by an airstrike listening to a sermon in church. 10/10 would recommend
1216,"it good
"
1217,"now by no means do I say not to purchase this game. but i think it is important that you take note of this before purchasing. 

Arma 3 is an unbelievably realistic military shooter, but by no means is this for your everyday gamer, the controls are complex, the game requires a good-great PC, and is overall a slow paced skillful game. if you have experience in a game along the lines of this, it will be a fun challenge. but Do NOT recommend for your everyday gamer."
1218,"If you have even a passing interest in military simulation or a first person shooter sandbox with the freedom to approach situations by any means you like, this is a game you will love. Large scale, open maps combined with great mission design, unparalleled multiplayer, and immense modding support ranging from milsim mods to add that extra bit of realism to mods adding content from series that have nothing to do with arma, or are downright memes. DLCs add new maps, campaigns, weapons, and vehicles - but none are vital to your initial experience. At $30, I highly recommend this to anyone who passes by."

1292,"Fantastic game for military enthusiasts. The game has vast amount of content, so a lot of players could enjoy it, whether that be flying aircrafts, helicopters, riding tanks or vehicles, or just simply rushing down with infantry lines in battle. But, to whom i think this game will really shine and be in its place, is the those players who like a realistic and tactical experience, which this game absolutely succeeds in, and by fair amount then some other games perhaps. Yes, it might look a bit old school, it has been on the market for almost 10 years now, and its age is perhaps shown. However, the game is beautiful in my opinion... Crisp, polished out, to this day patched and still carries huge amount of support of the community. I would a 100% recommend trying this one out, you wont regret it."

1300,"this do be bussin
"
1301,"guns go pew pew, cars go vroom, pretty good game"
1302,"the game is great over all, amazing mechanics along with a helpful guide. the game has a mountain of content to dig into and hundreds of servers, the servers are mostly active with a wide array of game modes ranging from general missions with friends which last around 20-45 minutes at a time depending on mission, to large scale missions which get's you starting from scratch and creating your own army with friends.

Arma 3 is a true sandbox experience with hundreds of vehicle's, weapons and game modes to choose from. the only bad thing i can say about this game is the learning curve. this game has less of a learning curve and more of a learning cliff, the starting guides are great but in some ways poorly designed somtimes not giving the player enough information to complete a task.

over all great game

1311,Worth it but it is extremely difficult to get into and requires a beefy CPU.
1312,"insanely awful game and extremely frustrating
literally every part about this game is just annoying boring and dumb
its so over complicated and plain unfun

0/10 one of the most bad games ive ever played

not to mention while trying to refund this game it turned out that the launcher was still open making my play count 2 hours..

if i press ""quit"" then it should quit out of everything dont you think?"
1313,"This game is timeless. It calls back all the training we got in the military and applies it to situations that are similar to what we've experienced while providing the safety of a game or simulation. I'll probably play for the rest of my life. Like therapy, but with some ragdoll glitches to make you know its fake."
1314,millitary game very detailed
1315,fun
1316,"Extremely intimidating game at first, but man I've only just scratched the surface of this game, and all it has to offer; and yet it is still by far the most in depth tactical experience I've personally encountered.  Can't wait to see what Bohemia has in store for us with their new engine."

The level of in-depth customization that this game offers is truly fantastic, with hundreds of outfits, dozens of factions and a vast amount of attachments that one can put on a gun.

1371,"TLDR: game good, mil-sim optional, give it a try. Continue for details and recommendations.

NOT JUST A FUCKING MILSIM!

this game is not exclusively a mil-sim. If someone recommends you this game, and you discard it because ""its a milsim, i dont want to follow a bunch of rules, do nothing, talk certain ways, have certain roles"". Very tragic. any time i hear people describe this game, mil-sim is usually in there. it kills me because thats usually where THEY stop summarizing, or people stop listening. This game is VERY flexible. want a faster paced, more actiony experience? Liberation, its a pve capture the map game mode created by the community, it works very well, tons of fun. what if thats too arcadey, but the action is nice. maybe you want to do a little more planning but still the light-hearted fun where nobody is telling you how you fucked up. Antistasi, another community made gamemode, PVE, capture the map. Or what if you want something closer to Dayz but with all the fun mods and nice maps, Exile can be PVE or PVP. 

Point being, you can do a lot with this game without coming even close to mil-sim. If the game SEEMS interesting but the mil-sim part of the game scares you off, dont worry theres lots more to do. all of my hours have been exclusively between those three game modes, and i have absolutely ZERO interest in mil-sim and feel no pressure of running out of things to do. ive made servers for all of the game modes I've mentioned. Not the easiest task, but something I'm glad i took the time to learn because i can create the exact experience i want. theres plenty of help available to learning how to create servers, seek out the discords for any of the game modes ive mentioned, people will help you understand, and you can create exactly what experience you want out of a shooter like arma. 

THE BAD: Its worth noting, this game is rough around the edges, id love to see more performance, stability, nicer tools for those who wish to create AND USE mods. The game could improve on a lot. the whole game is a learning curve, from just the menus, to the vehicles, to just moving your character and using your equipment. error messages are common. the game will frustrate the ever living shit out of you by randomly dying, touching a fence post and flying across the map, touching a bush and dying. it is seriously almost a skill just avoiding bugs. 

so yes, tons of bugs, sometimes hilarious, sometimes day ruining. bugs aside its not an EASY game. but i'll never forget playing antistasi, clawing my way to work from a pistol, to arming a rebellion. VISCOUS fighting for two in-game days, tooth and nail, for an airport, and seeing friendly green tracers and rockets fly through the night sky and take down incoming enemy helicopters, gunships, and jets. Javelins spiking down onto enemy tanks or ground vehicles. 

its buggy, its high maintenance but gosh dang if this isnt the best game ive ever played, i dont know what is."
1372,"good game
immense fun if played right
teamwork based game
graphics are alright
fps drop can be hard in large scale battles which includes vehicles
lots of mods to work with
variety of maps is immense
vanilla maps are already really good
however id recommend only buying this when its on sale except you really wanna buy this game

dlcs are extremely well-made
overall a very good game id give it a 8.5/10 from personal experience
"
1373,Nice
1374,it stinky shitty

1388,"After putting hundreds of hours into Arma 2 and the Dayz mod I went into Arma 3 expecting something that was the same but fixed the problems of Arma 2.

What I got instead was Black Ops 2: Larp Edition, with hundreds of dollars of DLC to make the half assed unfinished game I bought actually feel complete."
1389,"I would recommend it for people who have a lot of spare time. It's cool but joining a random server as a new player is not very enjoyable. You should definitely play alone until you are comfortable with most of the keybinds, or you can play with an experienced friend that can teach you the controls (for vehicles as well)."

1408,"A boring walking simulator where every semi fun thing is locked behind a paywall,
the game also ran really bad, even if my pc is not great it still is able to run vr so its infuriating for this to run poorley,
might try it again in the future if i get a better pc but for now this game is an expensive walking simulator worse than death stranding"
1409,The game is fun but the issue is that the game is slowly dying but if you enjoy milsims they are always going around if you can find communities that host them

1558,"Step one: Get in a lifted russian van that is very buggy
Step two: Find your friends and spend 5 minutes trying to run them over while they shoot at you
Step three: Run into your friend and hit a truck at the same time turning your van in an EF5 Tornade and get sent 4km in the air

10/10"
1559,Good game
1560,"Eh, I think I still need to put in a few more hours to get the real feeling for it, but it seems good so far"
1561,Can't say enough good things about this game. Except optimization....
1562,"there are somethings that could be improved, but other wise its fun."
1563,"[b]After about 600 hours I started the campaign...[/b]

[i]This game is great if you:[/i]
- Like modding
- Like using mods
- Like 'realistic' shooters
- Don't mind long build-ups to short but high intensity fire-fights
- Like semi-real vehicle/air combat

There are various conversion mods that take you from a modern mil sim to say, Halo or Warhammer - and the communities to back em. That said, you do have to get lucky with the communities you become involved with.

[i]Why it might not be something for you:[/i]
- You don't want to spend more than 30 minutes to an hour on a game session
- You want quick dopamine shots, easy kills and someone to hold your hand while you're playing
- You are sensitive to war depictions

The communities in Arma 3 in my experience are extremely varied, both in what they offer and how toxic or welcoming they are. In the end it'll come down to your luck and perseverance when searching for online communities. 

For the single player or co-op buddies: There's also plenty of content for you on the workshop to enjoy :)

[i]Guides, support, troubleshooting and content:[/i]
- You can find a lot of helpful tutorials and guides on YouTube
- The game has a decent support system and an active forum
- The game offers a decent amount of starting content in the base game, further expanded by DLC's, mods, and scenarios from the workshop."
1564,Yes.
1565,too realistic for my taste tbh

1578,"Very difficult to get into but really cool once you get any good, not recommended for people with low patience."
1579,"This is a fundamentally broken product.

The single-player campaigns would be dismal even without the mountain of bugs and crappy UI in this game, but in its current state it is basically unplayable. Interacting with game objects is done through the mousewheel because actual UI is more-or-less non-existent. Operating vehicles is borderline impossible as the game's physics engine seems to think vehicles belong upside down. AI squads are incapable of traversing longer distances than a hundred meters without getting stuck in random rocks or trees, and cannot drive vehicles without ramming every wall, sign and building in their path. Commanding squadmates is an exercise in frustration as the commands can ONLY be navigated with the numbers row, and if you do actually find the command you want, it will most likely not do anything at all, or cause the AI squadmates to take totally bizarre actions like trying to run across the map, or repeatedly crouch and stand up, or randomly shout ""covering fire!"" even when nobody else is around.

The AI is so broken that it is almost comedic, traversing flat ground by crouching, lying down, shouting ""covering fire!"" then getting up, walking ten feet, crouching, lying down, shouting again, is this a ""military simulation""?

And even if you do teleport them in range of the enemy, the extent of their abilities is to stand stock still and shoot wildly in the general direction of enemies. They won't engage armor, instead they will happily take out their anti-tank weapons, hold them, put them back, take them back out, turn around to look at you, then get mowed down. Or, sometimes, take out their weapons, aim point-blank at a wall or a teammate, and just blast their own squad away.

I spent eighteen hours in this game over the course of a couple of weeks, and every single moment of it was either digging in menus, or trying to run test games ""to see if it would work this time"" but it never fucking did. Every SINGLE time I tried to play this game, I would set it up, begin a scenario or whatever, figure out the objective, start trying to go there..... and then realize half my squad is back at the base because they can't walk through doorways or are inside the floor. Or the vehicle hits an invisible wall and flips or injures everyone. Or I get stuck in something. Or the game crashes. Which one of those is realistic military gameplay? I never experienced a single moment of gameplay that I would call interesting or fun. Every play session with this game was spent trying to delicately babysit AI squadmates across simple terrain or through doorways, or searching Google for how to perform minor interactions, or searching for solutions to bugs, hoping that EVENTUALLY I would figure it out and finally start PLAYING THE GAME, but I gave up.

I have watched gameplay videos online and saw people putting up with a lot of jank, but I didn't realize they were walking such a fine line to get this utterly broken project to even work at all. And the multiplayer is so awful and desynchronized it might as well be a play-by-phone board game.

Basically, this game is bad at every level: bad engine, bad UI, bad single-player campaigns, bad multiplayer functionality, bad community. The fact that this is the current state-of-the-art milsim game with a die-hard following is deeply disappointing, and speaks loudly to how little gamers actually care about quality control.

"
1580,
1581,yes.
1582,"The DLC model for this game is so awful, it's turned me off to this developer permanently. It's impossible to play the base game that you actually paid money for without having advertisements plastered all over your screen for their many expensive DLC's. 

In the middle of a firefight? Let us take a moment to block your line of sight with a message telling you that the gun you happen to be using is part of a DLC, even though there was no indication of that when you were selecting your weapon for this mission.

Want to make an escape in this civilian vehicle before the 50 enemy troops on your tail catch up and monkey-stomp your head into the pavement? Tough luck, because this vehicle is part of the ""bend over a little further"" DLC.

Want to take 30 seconds to get immersed in the ""Simulator"" environment? Feel free, but you can do that while we cover the entire screen in DLC watermarks, right? And I do mean the entire screen. 

I really tried to like this game. I think I would have if they'd shown even the slightest amount of respect for their own product and their customer. As it is today, however, you're paying money to open up ad-space for Bohemia on your hard drive. Please do not make my mistake and contribute to this terrible business model."
1583,Just got shot by the AI 250 meters away....With a pistol.. 10/10
1584,Game is difficult at first but you'll get a hang of it with enough time and dedication. Be sure to turn off battle eye when running mods or addons from the workshop.
1585,I get to the hill and get shot by a sniper 500m+ away :)
1586,"I can not recommend this game! I've spent over 1000 hours. from it be apart of various mil-sim groups or simply just playing invade & annex. oh boy don't even get started with the mods that come along with this game there is tons of replay ability and also so surprising with what the modding community can do (soft spot for the star wars mods). Although it is a military tactile shooter, believe me when I say trust me this game can be what ever it wants to be with it being a sandbox. Yes i has it janky times and buggy, but that wouldn't be ARMA without it and look on the plus side always makes a good laugh,."
1587,this is aa pretty fun game to play but you haved to have a good pc but if you do and your looking for a good millatary gamee this is the ine
1588,GG

1604,"Outside of the few issues you get when the game gives you bug issues or when you get hit with FPS problems, this game is amazing. Best way to play this game? Well find a community of like minded individuals and hop into the zeus ran multiplayer missions, you'll create bonds with friends from all over the world playing this game and the memories you'll have with them will be with you forever."

1610,"Super fun and definitely the most realistic war simulation game out their with amazing online capabilities.
The modding community is also super active making the game even better."
1611,pretty sweet
1612,"The game it self is great, as much as expected from ARMA, but the lack of stuff to play without buying the INSANELY expensive DLCs. i'd pay 2-3 euro but 8-9 for some tanks or other things? gimme a break. im bored already and wanted this game for so long :("

Absolutely love the @Exile Mod for Arma

1616,"All I can say is that if you don't have any friends who are into military and strategy stuff then I don't suggest getting this one. I mean yeah there are some game modes on which playing solo is fun and all but it gets boring really quickly, at least to me.
Even then the this game is a masterpiece so that's a ‚ù§Ô∏è from me."

1626,fu king sucks fight me
1627,"To be as realistic as possible, I've made sure my war crime ratio is as high as possible. The game did not reprimand me for this, so I've come to assume that it's how you're meant to play. Very awesome."
1628,"goochikeyr game
"
1629,"in 2013 i Tried ARMA II for the first time, not one week later ARMA III was released.  The MilSim to use, to play on, and all the fun is in the battlefield.  I highly recommend this game for everyone who enjoys war on a scale that keeps you busy, for hours."

The PACER Test score is combined in the FitnessGram software with scores for muscular strength, endurance, flexibility and body composition to determine whether a student is in the Healthy Fitness Zone‚Ñ¢ or the Needs Improvement Zone‚Ñ¢."
1639,This game sucks
1640,It is a very fun realistic shooter but I warn you make sure you have a setup that can handle it because it needs it.
1641,Only fun with mods and in a unit
1642,"Best FPS to date. Way better than any FPS over the last decade. Completely wipes the competition with how realistic and playable everything is, not even a comparison! Continuation of updates which make the graphics better than most modern games today. ARMA developers are legit and remind me of how developers used to be. They don't ruin their games like AAA title developers all have! Highly recommend this game over any FPS!"

1681,"if you want a deep soldier Simulator, this is it!!!"
1682,Best game I ever played!
1683,"Lots of fun, excellent mod availability and compatibility. Only real criticism is the performance being bad due to the game being heavily single threaded, so on KOTH servers with lots of players I'm forced to set my view distance to the minimum (500 meters) or else I enjoy a slide show. Not nearly as much of a problem on smaller servers with only a handful of people, but I still can't set my view distance that high, which is important for seeing CAS in time to hit it."
1684,FUCK YES TRAINEE!!
1685,if i were you I would give this game a try
1686,FUCKING CHOOOTS!
1687,A fun game with mil-sim mechanics and an interesting sandbox you can lose yourself in if you're not careful. The experience is only further improved with the wealth of mods available within the workshop.

1704,"he enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.

The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves."

1730,"You Will Need:

10 tablespoons (145 grams) unsalted butter
1 ¬º cups (250 grams) granulated sugar
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, natural or Dutch-process
1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt, use slightly less if using fine sea or table salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large cold eggs
1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour
2/3 cup (75 grams) chopped walnuts or pecans, optional

Directions:

Prepare Batter:
Position an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. (This helps when removing the baked brownies from the pan, once cooled).

Add enough water to a medium saucepan so that it is 1 to 2 inches deep. Heat water until barely simmering.

Combine butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over simmering water (if the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water). Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don‚Äôt worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.

Remove the bowl from heat and set aside for 3 to 5 minutes until it is only warm, not hot. Stir in the vanilla with a spoon. Then add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.

When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the flour and stir until fully incorporated, then beat with the wooden spoon or spatula for 40 to 50 strokes. (The batter will be thick). Beat vigorously here. You want to see the brownie batter pulling away from the sides of the bowl (if you do not have the strength to do this by hand, use a hand mixer). Stir in nuts, if using. Spread evenly in lined pan.

Bake Brownies:

Bake the brownies for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick can be inserted into the center and come out with a few moist crumbs. As a visual test, brownies are done when the edges will look dry and the middle still looks slightly underbaked.

Some readers have found they need to bake an extra 5 to 10 minutes. Brownies are easy to overbake so keep an eye on the doneness of the brownies and use the visual and toothpick test as your guide.

Cool completely then remove from pan. For the cleanest lines when cutting, place into the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to firm up. Cut into 16 squares.

10/10 would recommend, tastes absolutely delicious a cup or so of chocolate chips can add that extra shot of fudge if you so desire.

The game is cool too I guess."
1731,like this game
1732,"Arma ... what can I say its Arma. I have been playing Arma for a pretty long time, Arma II all expansions really liked OP Flash Red River, All the way through to todays Arma 3 and its littany of content... there is a ton. I love this game.  Rediculously immersive SIm.... Yes SIm. DONOT expect to pick this game up and just play it.... Yeah thats not a thing here. This Application took me a good year to be fully functional. You must understand why, and appriciate it for that. If its in any military from 1900 through today and beyond... Yeah Arma does it.... Faithfully most of the time. Literally the only FPS ive seen where you can turn your head independent of your rifle while in a full sprint if you so choose. Only FPS where, when your prone, and that Commie is popping at you because you overstayed your welcome, You can ROLL while prone behind the tree trunk you were firing around..... So many weapon systems , so many weapons to learn and/or choose from.What to do? well there is Single player campaigns Persistant Coop missions that evolve over days, Straight up tdm.... The versatility and openness is staggering really. but it can be clunky, definitly sensitive to the build you create. Can be frustrating. but once you achieve what you were looking to achieve,  the rewards are there for those with the will and interest. Its not COD or Battlefiledf or Apex by a long shot. If you want to tinker, Your gonna need to understand your PC in general. Must understand File systems, and Extensions, compiling and all the technicality related stuff. if not it can still be a brat if you mix two paid dlc that dont like each other. . 

The combat.... Punishing and Rewarding on equal levels, She's gonna hurt your before she pleases you...Your gonna march with your squad for 45 minutes through any terrain you can immagine. then take two well aimed rounds from 110 meters and its freakin over.... or on the other side you and your squad Marched for 45 min.... Anticipated your foe, FLanked before they know its and enemy mowed 12 men down and overwelmed the last two who managed to make a stand, and took the town... this gunfight lasted 3.5 minutes and when your the winner it feels good.

In the end you get out of Arma and its community what you put into it. Again it is a Simulator through and through no Rambo shit here, Rambos die early and hard in Arma. if you like preperation unmatched customizations, planning, troubleshooting and thorough immersion Arma might be your home. If you want to dive in for 30 min at a time gets some rounds off, move on...."

Arma 3 is a perfect military game to play with others, however I stress that it will only be fun if you play with others, be prepared to set aside around 100GB for the game and mods, low fps if your hardware is not good enough, finding a community, and once you have done that‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll be able to fix a Mk VI Destroyer.

Nevertheless this is truly a masterpiece of the 10‚Äôs and in my opinion is the second best sandbox to date."

1748,Servers are useless. All have a ping over 1000. I have under 50 ping in every other game. Save your money and don't buy this ancient trash..

Just love it."
1750,Game go Bang
1751,
1752,It is a very realistic and fun game the items are very well rounded and I think it is a great game
1753,game keeps getting better. As prior military its very cool how it can bring back memories
1754,"Very good for the average military rp enjoyer, whether it be serious or just joking, Arma is a good way to get into the feeling of being an actual military soldier. I'd recommend this game to people who enjoy roleplaying or enjoy Military genre games."
1755,"Great game to play co-op, make your own missions."
1756,fun . cool
1757,yeet
1758,10/10
1759,"El mejor (y √∫nico) sandbox de simulaci√≥n militar. M√≥ntate tus propias operaciones y misiones con tus amigos gracias a su complet√≠simo editor y mapas de cientos de KM2. Las mods no tienen desperdicio tampoco. Si te gusta el realismo b√©lico, Arma 3 es el juego a tener."
1760,gode
1761,i cant spot no fucking enemys
1762,Take the time to learn it and the mods will take you too the moon.
1763,very nice!
1764,really fun besides learning the controls
1765,"It's a fun military simulation, the closest experience you can get to real life military stuff without the danger. You can play as the commander or a grunt and do fun things with equipment that's usually not for civilians."
1766,trash game.Have to download 10202519588342559210758187365891658971 mods for it to be a little fun but still boring after 20 min. #L #TRASH
1767,Love the coop tactical play in it
1768,"Joined a KOTH (king of the hill) sever with a buddy and we decided to get a heli and fly 1km above the combat zone. 41 kills later, the enemy teams still dont know where TF we are. 10/10 would snipe from orbit again."
1769,"i fly plane
i drop bomb 
i happy 

then turns out i broke the geneva convention 
i get murdered by team

1770,You either play this game once or gain an unhealthy addiction to this game and never shower again.
1771,Very Good Game worth it.
1772,yes
1773,makes me horny
1774,it's good
1775,"A 8 year old game that still holds up surprisingly well. Definitely give it a shot when it is on sale.

1784,yes
1785,"no mater what sever your in its always the level 1000000 players with plasma rifles 5000 meters away killing you, and you stuck with a broken Akm with no irons. its always the same."
1786,I only have a few hours in this game but you get shot at a few times and see nobody and then you see a tracer fly by you and hear a crack a few seconds later with your rco you look over a nearby hill see nobody and get shot in the head. Very good game much recommend!
1787,good shit!
1788,"yes
"
1789,can barley find games most servers are locked or have 2-3 people in it but that dosnt matter because almost all of them require multiple dlc and you cant even play bye yourself because the story and scenarios are all dlc too. Dont bye unless your spending a 100$ to get everything to play in the underpopulated unlocked servers. also battle eye is buggy and wont let me join the 3 servers that would let me even tho the only-thing i have on the pc is steam games.
1790,"This game is great. Nothing more to say. Go for the grind!
(Join 205th Recon Battalion!!)"

1805,shit game
1806,"Good game, but please optimize this game better. I do not own a good PC!"
1807,"Ah yes Tank to face
"
1808,One of the best games ever
1809,very easy to run and very long games for realism
1810,"Arma 3, its a game thats for sure."
1811,It's like pretty sweet for an old game. Def worth the money with all the mods and rad community.
1812,Game = good
1813,wut the freek happened this game is poopy my dog died so i barfed and then pesar bears had anurisms
1814,Try this before you go to war.
1815,"Great game few issues.
Issue 1: 
For some reason the game won't use my full power CPU usage while playing the game is 30-32% max settings and this is a CPU based game i have a ryzen 7 3700x and a RTX 3060 12gb and nothing goes over 30-32% useage while playing this game on max settings and max render\
Issue 2:
 i'd probably get more FPS if it used my computers hardware like a normal game But like a wise man once said ARMA doesn't give a F*ck about your specs it will run at 20fps just please try and optimize (Oh wait it's a old game i don't think they will)
I love this game overall it's great and feels real if the game isn't shitting itself because of a server filled with mods"
1816,"What can you do in Arma 3? Better question is, what can't you?

Multiplayer is where it is at, with unlimited potential through the editor and various communities. Mod community is outstanding and active, and holds the heart and soul of the game (but not required for a great time).

I personally would not recommend for singleplayer, but there is some content there for those who would."
1817,Would not recommend
1818,
1819,Only turbo-virgins and mil-simmers play this game.
1820,yes
1821,do not play at 3 am
1822,"This is one of those games thats.... terrible and fun all at the same time. Its such an old model, but no other game has been able to replicate what ARMA has done so for that it truly is one of the best games ever made. 

The modding community is absolutely astounding and amazes me every day what they are able to put in engine (functional ODST Drop Pods, GIANT Warhammer mechs etc) 

Find a group, make friends, and rage at the jankyness of the game. It will pull you back in over and over no matter how many times you rage quit."
1823,walk 2 km to be shot in the head by someone in a bush 4 miles away
1824,Awesome Game
1825,"A great mil sim, but don't expect a FPS. In large groups with friends, this game is a blast."
1826,"I have no idea how to play this game, but I think it's good."
1827,"The most intense, casual, serious, hilarious clusterf-ck of a game you could ever play. Friendships strengthened and strained, it is an absolute roller coaster, and I do not regret a second of it. 

Just make sure to allocate an hour to get dressed up, barbie simulator is just as fun as the combat."
1828,it is a fun game along with mods and some arma groups can be fun and are the best to play wiht or with small group of friends
1829,i love the ever changing battle ground but dislike that i cant play or host a server with mods that others cant join in on
1830,awesome
1831,gud game

1834,Only played the campaing with aimbot ai but goddamn still fun.
1835,AMAZING GAME
1836,"Fantastic game. Plenty of servers to join with all sorts of genres and game modes to enjoy. Features amazing Single-player gameplay as well, with the scenario editor and Zeus. Along with thousands of mods to choose from."
1837,Es el mejor juego de todos
1838,Very large game. Somewhat realistic. Good campaign and Multiplayer.
1839,garbage engine no fps + need to buy DLCS.
1840,"I would say worst game I've ever played but I can't even play it. May have played it a little bit many years ago but it just seems utterly impossible to join a lobby, waiting ages to download a million and one dlcs for it to then say ""Host not found"" etc, it is beyond a joke, DO NOT BUY this dumpster fire of a game."
1841,"its good
"
1842,Most of my hours are hopeing the game gets fun (with friends)
1843,"If I pull that off, will you die?"
1844,military simulator for advanced players.
1845,War Crimes.
1846,good game
1847,"I just have always wanted to play this game like im still new to pc but this game is a lot of fun the community is amazing

1886,"It's a bright morning in Altis.
The loud clanking of a broken engine comes from afar, the only source of sound besides the deadly silence, the whishing sound of an allied helicopter hovering above the island slowly reaches you, followed by the insects screeching, you moved on, the town was just ahead, you can make it on foot......

""Sir... What's the plan?""
Your teammate calls from behind you in a worrying whisper, his voice, dry and tired, just like everyone in this unit, you raised your hand from your rifle to wipe off the sweat on your forehead, silently pondering in your own thoughts as the team stopped.
You stayed mute, for seconds that seemed like minutes.

""We're going to regroup, with our allies.""
Your team stayed silent, there's nothing else they could say, nothing was better, it's either through this uncharted, possibly filled-with-opfors town, or trace back few kilometers to another friendly unit.

""Formation diamond.""
You waited, for your teammates to form the mentioned formation, but there were only silence, the quiet, but noticeable clanking of that engine, and the rotors of the helicopter.
Maybe, they're all tired of being led by an incompetent leader, maybe they just want to end this war already, that's right, in this cruel battlefront, every town you capture, every meter you drive, every step you take, might be the last...

You turned your head, the infantry truck was about ten meters away, sideways, the driver's window shattered, the scent of blood, gasoline, gunpowder forms a mixed cocktail in your nostrils, your gaze lands on the group of corpses, either on the ground, or dangling from the railings.

Your own corpse was laying in the middle, your service rifle was dropped beside you, half-empty from the resistance you tried to put up, but being hit by an IED, thrown around in a crashed truck and being shot at from all directions made everyone panic, and aim worse than an untrained office worker with a machine gun.

You knew it'd happen, you always knew, you've been here before, you've died before, seemingly several times, the wind, tainted with the smell of rust, creeps towards you, the grunts and weeps of fatally injured soldiers, creeps towards you, the snapping sounds of super-sonic rounds flying pass you, creeps towards you, they creeps towards you from your own mind, you're used to it, and you thought to yourself,
Would this time... Be any different?

You reloaded your MX rifle, completely empty by the excessive amount of rounds you needed to shoot into what feels like an easy target, the empty magazine falls on the ground, the engine finally stopped, ran out of fuel it seems, the team silently moved, into the town, into the trap, because everyone knew, there's nothing they could do to prevent this from happening.

Followed by a silent, unnoticeable pop, you felt yourself hovering, 4 just stepped on a landmine planted by the local guerillas, the detonation rocks the ground, you fall to your knees as you were brought down by someone, whizzing noises go past your head, you look up, your face splashed with a rust flavored liquid, a thud lands beside you, followed by another.

""Six is down!"" You hear 2's voice shouting, you crawl behind your teammate's corpse, praying it'd conceal, or block some rounds for you, you watch as 2 put up a valiant fight against the ambush, only to be brought down by the returning fire from several opfors, and then, it ended.

Followed by a loud boom for a split second, your vision fades to black, distorted television appears in your sight, followed suit with a ""Mission Failed"", you've died, everyone died, there were no allies to regroup, you were always on your own on this god-forsaken island, with nothing to escape from, with vehicles that doesn't have fuel, with guns that doesn't have ammo.

""Leader's down! I'm the new field leader!"" You hear 2 shout, as your team runs past your body, running to safety against the sniper that just dug a hole in your chest, unknowingly running into an enemy MRAP with a manned MG turret.

It's another loop, it's another loop until you finally finishes the mission, until you finally completes the objective.

Welcome to ArmA 3, welcome to war."
1887,my best game ever
1888,"Arma 3 is a good game. you don't need DLC to play it.

Its amazing how a game from 2013, still out classes fps games now days.

The graphics are ok, its not like its a nintendo 64 game. And the gameplay dose not get more submersive than this.

All in all its great game the price is worth it.                                  FUN GAME"

1895,Good military simulator if you ask me
1896,"After playing Operation Flashpoint for a long time, ArmA 3 made me a child again.

Comes with a lot of workshop content, your game is customizable to your liking of combat simulation. I mean seriously.
EDEN Editor is the very best thing i seen since OPFlash editor, its like the original but so much better.
Also there is a lot of content that you can use and learn about real combat situations. Realism is top notch.

I want to say thank you to Bohemia Interactive to put this miracle together. Bless you guys.

One of the few best games ever. Worth every cent."
1897,just yes
1898,Good and fun game
1899,there's like 25 different positions to die in from 2000+ meters out. great game.
1900,"If you can familiarise yourself with myriads of controls and keybindings, it can be very enjoyable.

If your'e fond of touch of realism, you'll also enjoy it.

If not, there are always more casual and relaxed and less tactical shooters out there :)"
1901,good
1902,"Good game if you know how to play, tons of mods to make sure you can get ptsd. very good"
1903,"One of the best open world military stimulator I had ever seen. Furthermore, the mods make the game more interesting to play while multiplayer gives you an extraordinary  experience. This game is worth to pay."
1904,good game bad graphics
1905,Fun with Milsim Unit
1906,100 per fucking cent
1907,"I made ODSTs fight Nazis, it was dope"
1908,gamer
1909,GOOD
1910,fun
1911,waste of time and money
1912,I know nothing about Arma
1913,great sandbox sim!!!!!
1914,Is fun. takes 5 min to regen stamina. but can carry 14 rockets and a gun
1915,"Despite all the RP servers, I find Arma 3 is at its best when you treat it the way it beckons itself - as a hardcore military simulation. The game has a near-limitless toolbox available to players and creators alike, allowing for a truly one-of-a-kind milsim experience that I find myself coming back to time and time again."
1916,good
1917,play with friends
1918,.
1919,great game
1920,Bought in 2021 and still amazing so many years after launch. The ultimate military sandbox - hours and hours and hours and hours of fun.
1921,Good game. YES.
1922,"I've played this game back n fourth for a good amount of time. 
If you're somone who look for a milsim game where you can litterly do whatever you want and create anything you want, this is the game for you. Mods and additional packages are endless and the workshop is huge thanks to content creators. 
However the PvP aspect in this game is a bit clonky it's not perfect compared to other games but I don't mind it really. I'm all about the Milsim aspect of it, the co-op play style. You can set up scenarios from 1800 all the way to the laser beam guns.
The community is also very welcoming and there's alot of milsims group all over the world who arrange milsims weekly for anyone. If you so are serving, ur a veteran, looking forward to serve or your just a enthusiast this is perfect for you. They will surely help you with tactics, moves, formations, chain of command, etc.

Really recommend this to any military enthusiast!"
1923,love the visual effects and spot on realistic actions
1924,"An amazing game with people constantly feeding it new content.

An amazing tool set to create your own little military missions and recreate historical battles. need more specific units or armies? check the workshop and you will find everything you need and more. 10/10 spent 80 % of the time in the editor. rest playing coop missions with friends.


Praise milk and 30fps"
1925,Sick game! :-)
1926,haha plane go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
1927,Can't wait for a VR version of this game !
1928,Amazing game
1929,"It's Arma 3, what is there to dislike?"
1930,is fun
1931,fun
1932,VRÎ°ú Ï¥ù Ïè¥Î≥¥ÎãàÍπå Ïù¥Ï†ú Î™ªÌïòÍ≤†ÎçòÎç∞
1933,If you would like a game that is realistic to the point where you do not even know where you are getting shot from.... this is the game for you...it  is very unfair which i personally love and it is one of the most tactical games I have ever played...... It is an overall 7.5 or 8/10
1934,"11/10 physics, Vanilla game play is not really that good but if you use mods it will make this game 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000x better."
1935,i love how detailed and realistic the challenge is...
1936,"I love it like a religion.
Yes it has bugs, yes the engine is getting old, yes the learning curve is high, yes I'm biased but damn its still the best combined arms military simulator you can buy. No other comes close. 
If you play mil-sims and don't own it, shame on you."
1937,its a shit load of fun if you have a crew of people to play with
1938,"its a sim heavy shooter so expect a lot of controls. its un optimised so expect some issues graphically. however its very detailed, quite difficult and overall fun game"
1939,REAL LIKE FEELING
1940,the most realistic shooter in existence!
1941,very good
1942,Plays like doodoo. They don't call me dooki splatter for no reason.
1943,"extremely difficult if you are a beginner, just watch videos on youtube to help you out"
1944,yes
1945,Best MILSIM of all time. Just look at how many hours of my real life that I spent inside this virtual one.
1946,Thirty five dollars
1947,this is awesome
1948,this game sucks
1949,ees goog
1950,Mil-sim or sweat no other option.
1951,
1952,I've played it for a few minutes seems good...
1953,pog
1954,This is the type of game where if you find a good server you can fly a huge plane with your friends and laugh when it get flung 10000m into the air
1955,"Man, 300 meter, front.
Can't see shit, 11/10 would get shot at again."
1956,It's fun. the game is complex and mods are weird. But 10/10 would do again.
1957,"It's not really playable in its current state. The developers add more and more and more content to it with each update, instead of fixing the huge issues that cripple this game's fundamental features.

The abysmally bad performance notwithstanding, it's playable in multiplayer. But the singleplayer features are useless. The AI couldn't hit a barn 10 feet away and is incapable of walking in a straight line without bumping into a wall. Indoor navigation is nonexistent, and even just navigating city streets seems like an impossible challenge for the unbelievably stupid AI - despite the game boasting and advertising several maps which feature dozens of cities. The built-in scripting language is a frankensteinian abomination that barely deserves being called a language, and there is no meaningful debugging available.

Despite seemingly very advanced functions to command NPC comrades, the AI fails the most primitve tasks, such as ""aim at this guy and fire"". Any attempt to lead AI comrades into the field is hampered by NPCs either running around where they shouldn't, going prone when they shouldn't, aiming but not firing, or firing when they shouldn't. More often than not, you're better off telling your NPC squad to wait and then finishing the mission on your own.

The advertised ""wide variety of single- and multiplayer content"" is really just multiplayer content. Which works, I suppose, if you have friends willing to play with you. The public servers are a dumpster fire where cooperative play is virtually impossible. So unless you plan on wandering the maps alone, playing singleplayer isn't really a thing you can do. Even the official singleplayer campaigns are rendered worthless by NPCs who appear to have been lobotomised. An untrained toddler with an assault rifle would be more effective than an entire squad of NPCs. With no functioning pathfinding, seemingly randomly malfunctioning aim, and a complete inability to follow commands, the AI alternates between being absurdly perfect aimbots, and brainless targets barely useful as cannon fodder."
1958,great mil sim
1959,great game
1960,gud gud m107 go boom
1961,One of the very best games/sims out has been for years and still holds up above many
1962,once you buy the game you still need to buy add on's that cost around 100 dollars all together
1963,dis game is rly gud :))) i lik it
1964,"I enjoy Arma, I do, because I played Black Hawk Down as a kid a ton and Operation Flashpoint.

In 2022 though I just don't think it's hardly relevant anymore for new players.  Movement is bad, gunplay is bad, optimization is bad, UI is bad.  It does plenty of things well like land nav and the technical military aspects that many games miss but the bad will always outweigh the good because it's limited by its outdated engine.

Hopefully Enfusion will solve that one day."
1965,From OFP:Coldwar crisis to now Arma 3 one of the best game series i ever played throughout my childhood.
1966,you can commit war crimes with the boys
1967,Good a10 goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
1968,pog
1969,One of the best multiplayer games on the Steam library ! Recommended
1970,"This game is a very bad purchase, I regret buying it. The enemy will kill you within seconds, the characters have little to no health so you die every couple of seconds, on RECRUIT DIFFICULTY. The game regularly glitches out.

The multiplayer side of things is very difficult with the server page being very confusing and hard to manage. Creating servers is very difficult, taking hours to set up a team group in order to join your friends in the same server.

I wish I never bought this game, it sucks, total waste of money.
Bottom line, don't buy this, its a waste of money."
1971,Easily my favorite steam game. Started with multiplayer and just started single player mode. What an amazin' game 10/10.
1972,"Without any doubt, the very best value game in the MilSim range."
1973,Great concept but unintuitive controls and buggy as heck
1974,8yi
1975,"Waited my whole childhood for this i don't regret the purchase, DLC i would wait for a sale though"
1976,"Fun Milsim on its own, but with Mods it can become basically aything you want a FPS to be."
1977,#EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
1978,"choose role, take gun, shoot shoot, enemy killed, win win."

1984,
1985,Hell yea the community is so much fun to play with
1986,"Just join a unit after something you're interested, learn to play, and have fun from there!
OPTRE (Halo), RHS (Modern Warfare), and IFA3 (WW2) have been my main picks."
1987,gud
1988,game is wicked after 50 hrs
1989,"""What kind of military arsenal that these Americans have? Let's see""

-Literally every world leaders playing this game

p.s: Afghanistan.exe has a bit of problems for the past few months so hopefully it'll get fixed in the near future"
1990,MODS
1991,The reason why i say u shouldnt play this is cause of the rampart hackers who kick Zues and the Toxic community If u Want a list Of names INGAME NAMES FYI Its Gustav and Sgt.Major.Smith and u wanna know the time they did hack it would be 13/01/22 2am Australian time So If bohemian has some ball and also read this they should be able to trace the time and date i given but knowing them with their so called ways to keep their public servers safe but we already know where that leads
1992,best game i have ever played.
1993,"I love how much of a sandbox this game is and the community is great. Doing ops with your friends or strangers is a lot of fun. Also this game got me head somehow, dont ask

Would warmly recommend for any NEET who wants to be an operator without actually going outside and spend hours scripting a maticulously made mission just for your friends to do something stupid and break it in 5 seconds, or just accidentally saving an empty map on your mission file"

2034,cool game
2035,Great game sad its dying bring out arma 4 bohemia
2036,wold not recommend unless if you want to buy all D.L.C's
2037,Nice one
2038,"Let me be very simple. Arma 3 is not only a milsim. The mods and all the content created by the community allow you to make this game to be whatever you want it to be.
Whether it's a great battle simulator, a cheap knock-off of GTA V (although, much better), a WW2 war crimes re-actment or an real-time editor and sandbox. This game has it all. And if it doesn't the modders will probably make it so.

Why buy CoD, Battlefield, GTA or any other game really. This game has it all.


Of course, this game has quite some issues in terms of performance. But that's easily forgetable. This game is most playable at 30 fps or higher and it highly depends on the scenario going on. I play IFA3 on my own servers with 50-120 FPS depending on what's going on. If I replay a D-Day scenario with over 300-400 units, planes, ships, canons and whatnot I can expect 20-30 FPS. That's normal.


Anyhow, feel welcome to join and go do great things. Join a server, make your own, make friends and do crazy shit like backflipping tanks with JBU's.

I recommend looking into Zeus mode as it allows you to do scenarios/stories dynamically with friends. There are great mods that enhance the experience and IMO if it weren't for Zeus mode this game would probably have died off long ago."

2046,"Well personally, I'm into milsim kind of stuff. Arma brings this love for the genre and makes it a reality. It allows for more in-depth play style than your generic action shooter games. I enjoy the large community and mods people have produced to enhance the game. I thoroughly enjoy and recommend this game to anyone looking for a more in-depth gaming experience. Although, I will say, enjoy getting Arma'd! Haha you'll understand."
2047,ARMA 3 is the gold standard of Mil-Sim'ing and has been for seven years now.
2048,good give it a try
2049,its good at times and bad at others. I saw npcs glitching around under the map. I got the game for ten bucks with the sale but fifty is too much
2050,fun if you get help
2051,gud gaym
2052,40fps at min settings in a city. My system costs over 2000‚Ç¨.

2060,good game
2061,OH YAH

2083,Snipers.
2084,It's hands down one of the best platforms for custom co-op content and the mods are almost limitless and make it better.
2085,"Awesome just awesome, nothing bad about it."
2086,"I NEVER Fuckin' played this Games, and I wish that who ever it is that is getting, and giving these stats, I wish you would get your information straight, I tried telling support some time ago that I have never played this game., just because I purchased this game, DOES NOT MEAN THAT I HAVE PLAYED THE GAME, yes I have had the game on my PC, for many months now, and every time i have to uninstall and reinstall the game, I see that it always says that I have played the game for 9 hours. and would I rate the game, well here's your rating, AGAIN, I have not EVER PLAYED THE GAME YET.

Yes I have roamed around on a few server alone only to check out how things look on the game, maps and all. but again I HAVEN'T EVER ACTUALLY PLAYED THE GAME, and damn sure no 9 hours.

Yes I game a thumbs down, not because I do not like the game, it's because, I can't rate what i know nothing about. yes I have played other game on steam, but not ARMA, now it's out there, Hell I have not even played my favorite America's  Army, yeah Steam, that was the name before you got the game, get your stuff together, I have not played the game, I'll get around to it."

2091,"Where Arma IV ?
aber basst scho"
2092,43.625 days of my life spent with no regrets. Patiently waiting for ARMA 4.
2093,"This is one of my all time favorite video game series. I played the hell out of 2, 3 went on sale the other day and I finally gave it a chance. I have a weak laptop, I was worried it would not run right. It looks and runs better than 2 on it somehow. I can eek out normal video settings, which looks fine IMO. I love the realism. The combat is unlike any other shooter you will play, its intense."
2094,"Arma is Arma. What can I say? With the right people, and the right preset, with a good Zeus, it's a blast. Other than that, it's like sticking my hand in the garbage disposal and turning it on. I hate that I love this game."
2095,is of bestest gud
2096,cool game
2097,"I LOVE the great modding capabillity that comes from this game
"
2098,It's gonna take a while to master the controls and game mechanics but its a very fun game overall. I also recommend getting the DLC's to make the game even more fun.
2099,love it
2100,"Spent a boat load of time playing ArmA2/OA, loved the game. Played a lot of wasteland (mostly Tonics, a little SaMatra, etc), also loved playing PvP CTI mostly on OFPS servers. Great game, but often clunky in terms of setting up mods/DLC/etc. Never really got into the DayZ thing as much, but like everything else. The ArmA2/OA had a ton of stuff to offer everyone, I loved ArmA2... 

ArmA3, with its laundry list of extra $$$/DLCs. Is very, 'meh'... I just don't feel it like the old game. Kinda boring 'futurisim', every uniform/gun/vehicle/aircraft just looks silly even laughable. I'm 'old school' or at least contemporary when it comes to gear/guns/equipment. So the whole ""futuristic cool-bro"" look of just about everything in this game... Kinda ruined it. I wanted to love ArmA3 like I used to with Arma2, but it failed. 

-ArmA2 is a super-model with all the right features, she's a little mentally unstable, but damn kinky (in good ways)... 

-ArmA3 is an angry, blu-haired, 300lb sow, that hates you, and makes you question why your life went so wrong with her..."
2101,gg great game
2102,Gud
2103,sus!
2104,just to learn the game
2105,yes
2106,MILSIM
2107,"This game is an absolute clusterfuck mess of bugs, low frames, and ""Arma moments,"" but my god is it some of the most fun you'll have. (You HAVE to play it with AI mods, vanilla AI just does not cut it.)"

2123,"good game, very complex and detailed"
2124,"Takes some getting used to, but once u get the controls down and get some friends on its amazing. I put 38 hours in 3 days when I got it, rarely get bored of it -not to say there are no boring moments in the game, sometimes just feels like walking simulator with sometimes guns- and if u or ur friends launch a server for urselves, the amount of stupid fun ull have is easily worth the cost. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A FAST PACE SHOOTER"

2131,"The game has very good mods and it is very fun to just do your own thing and mess around on.

2132,I have over 3000 hours to have more fun i recommend you look for a unit.

2136,"One thing that I do not like about this game is how the AI have such good aim.
"
2137,
2138,mmmm yummy
2139,Limitless possibilities to this game. The online community and modders are dope as well.
2140,"Literally spent 400 hours in the Eden Editor messing around at 20 fps, 10/10 i'm too introverted."
2141,game be fun
2142,"300 hours in and I have finally installed all my mods, time to start learning the game."
2143,The options for mods and customization in this game are endless. The community is awesome. This is my favorite game to play.
2144,)))
2145,"love it
"
2146,"worst game I've ever played, it runs very bad i get about 30 fps on the game and i have a pretty decent pc and it should not be getting 30 fps i tired everything to fix them but nothing work and it also have a ton of bugs like my weapon getting jammed and then won't fix when i click on the fix jam button it just does an animation but it still jammed i do not recommend this game and it is definitely not worth the 30 bucks"
2147,If you rp you will like to have your kindeys removed and sold
2148,Good game
2149,What can I say im a decorated solider
2150,"Laser guided a bombs, jets, drones, tanks, guns, npcs, huge maps, multi player, epic mods... ARMA 3 is whatever you want it to be. 1200+ hours... 10/10 ^^"
2151,yes
2152,if you like mil sims 10/10 would play again
2153,Hey you! Want to know how to feel even dumber than you are now? Well then buy this game and hope to the fucking entity that is up there that it will let you live for more than 10 minutes! Good hunting soldier!
2154,pretty rad
2155,GOOD
2156,Fun Gun Game
2157,"In my small time of playing this game I can gladly say it's very fun. There is something for everyone. You want to be a merciless bounty hunter in the universe of star wars doing random tasks with your friends? Hell yeah you can do it. Want to be a grunt being absolutely demolished by enemy artillery rounds every 0.4 seconds? Yeah my dude - you got it! 

On a serious note. Great game for semi-realistic/realistic guys looking for some fun. It's always best wehenever you have a group of friends with you, but for the ""I only work alone"" guys there is a lot of stuff as well.

Highly recommend and for any new comers - have fun little ones in the endless universe of complete bullshiterry!"

2191,"good simulator, gonna enjoy it for a long time"
2192,yeah its an ok game i guess
2193,"Game bad couldn't shoot kids with my M249 saw with a M203 grenade launcher firing a HE round at them.. along with my M249 saw jammed on the first round.. couldn't even use my new ACOG and laser.. Please fix game, also add a mod that puts kids into the game or just add kids so we can kill them lol. They are just tiny bandits if you think about it and please add a space laser.. ;)"
2194,Arma 3 will probably be close in terms of military simulations. Mods enhances the game and makes it even more realistic compared to vanilla. It's amazing to see creators and what they have to come up with. Definitely a buy for anyone looking for a slow paced shooter with some roleplay for spice.

I would check out your alternatives. The game died because of the DLC ripping the community apart and spreading players too thin."
2224,"Pretty lit, das all I gotta say. I love the freedom you have from doing dumb stuff with your friends and doing tactical operations. The freedom with mods also makes it very fun to play around with. 10/10 would recommend."

Keep up the good work team. 

Would recommend this to anyone who wants to or is thinking of buying this game or sim shall I say..!"

2268,"Epic game! Can be almost anything you want it to be with the power of modding which lends itself to why I have 2k hours. Maybe only have 10 -20 hours of multiplayer play at most because with eden editor once you learn it and especially with dynamic spawn mods this game has almost infinite replayability. AI can be a pain, especially since they can't drive. There's workarounds however. 

Can be difficult to learn the controls for infantry movement as well as vehicles when you're first starting out though.

A must recommend from me for sure!"
2269,fortnite
2270,Neat game. Not much more to say right now. Like the campaign so far but the controls are a little different than what I'm used to. Game is sufficiently advanced.
2271,I just got this for the Halo mods
2272,"This game makes my brain hurts, everything isn't what it should be. I need go get an doctor appointment.


The quick game server doesn't have much server for you play.

The game isn't friendly with newbie, you must play the tutorial before you start anything.

Reload- immediately hide behind a rock until a bot spots an enemy, creep out and fire a few rounds, get one shoted by a bot. Reload - it happens again. Reload - it happens again. Reload - Manage to kill all the bots, get to the target and a glitch keeps the mission from moving forward. Uninstall."

2304,"It's still good. After all these years Arma 3 still has the advantage over most tactical simulator games in 2022. However, one concern is that I've spent so much money on DLC in this game over the years, albeit always on sales prices, that if they ever make an Arma 4 I will be sad. It would be great if they could update the engine, but for the most part this is still a great game because of the options.

I spend a lot of time playing the SOG Prairie Fire DLC, and it doesn't get old. Just so much content.

If they ever make anything really new, or could make a great change, it would be to update the engine. I think it still runs on single core. 

However, overall, still a great game to get lost in."

2312,fun
2313,"Honestly, I can't think of a better way to waste time than modding this game and playing with the editor. I love this game."
2314,"This game, while well made, is not going to be universally beloved. It will only be appreciated by a select group of people, and those people already know who they are. If you know you'll like ARMA, buy the game. If you're reading the reviews to make a decision, it's probably not for you."
2315,good game
2316,its the bees knees
2317,"Game had decades to sort out jank and mods compatibility... and yet it's clunky, janky, junky, in places extremely not user friendly. In that aliens dlc running directly to a marker on a map - game over, u've left area of operation... what the fuck... game itself sent me to that direction... ffs... basically massive exercise in frustration and very rarely fun. Official campaigns are puny because around half of those missions have little to no activity... the prologue thing is a bunch of missions where u just ride in a car / walk to a point and that's it. Basically if u're into pve / coop side of things - don't bother. Go get insurgency or ready or not or even breakopint."
2318,"This is is very old, and over priced game. I purchased it during a major sell and still feel I got suckered out of my money.

You:  ""Why is my game dropping down to 15 and lower fps often?""

2327,"Good game, Good Graphics, But it needs you to buy a DLC for more experience, Either way, you could just ignore it and play the game."

2334,meth
2335,"Whether you're a military reject, a military veteran who misses the life, or a twenty-something who wants something better than the same old Call of Duty run around and shoot em up type of experience, this is THE best military simulator you can find besides Squad.

Expect the vehicle physics to be sub-par, though."
2336,"you cant be good at this game, i had the game for 6 hours mostly me just leaving it on i joined two servers and during a game i got banned for hacking 
, i dont even know how to hack wtf, i just have a good aim."

2340,"it is a very hard game to understand, especially when you try to join servers, but still worth it because of the quality and realism"
2341,americans invade some shitty island
2342,This game has a lot of real situations you just don't grab a sniper weapon and are a ace you have to learn distance and wind and adjustment's. Tactical moves and you will care if you die as the maps are so big it may take you 20 min run there or hitch a ride with a pilot if you know how to work your radio.
2343,"Good military game, only fun if you are in a unit tho"
2344,"Worst public servers I have ever seen. If you are intending to get this game as a solo player, avoid."
2345,"I love this game, but the frames are trash. Still love it tho"
2346,Dont buy ARMA3 unless u have atleast ¬£100 To waste on shitty dlcs not worth it just buy squad
2347,"base games aight but the mods really make it great
"
2348,this game is bonkers
2349,Nice
2350,Very good it's like Genocide Impact but better.    :D
2351,hehehe gun. medical supplies running low
2352,War crimes goes brrrrrrr
2353,Yeah it's alright
2354,"this is one of the best games to play and quite frankly close to combat, I absolutely love this game"
2355,aaaugh euuuugh ooouuuffff
2356,"GOOD GAME GET 
"
2357,great game easy to get lost for hours.
2358,"[h1] Only good for multiplayer [/h1]

I bought this because I read some people said they have thousand of hours playing single player. Minimal SP content and sadly i didn't find it fun playing SP. Being a 'realistic' milsim it is known that there is no such thing as solo operatives on the field, and you must have battle buddies, in SP your battle buddies are AI, and they are very bad, even though i took the game really slowly clearing building and tried to position them the best I could at every place (even download the C2 mod), but they died of ridiculous cause i.e. I stationed them inside a 2 stories stone building for overwatch and they took fire from outside without firing back and they all died INSIDE the building. Even the dev-made 'showcase' mission for SP have our squad rushing ahead and getting killed on open terrain rendering the mission unable to be completed. Very high learning curve, especially if you install mod which drastically change gameplay, in my case this means faster time for my AI teammates to get killed. Because the base game isn't fun for me, I don't want to bother with learning this game further.

Maybe it's fun in multiplayer, but it's not my cup of tea."
2359,"I honestly don't know what to say regarding Arma. It's a beautiful buggy mess and probably one of the best modding platforms out there. The base-game stuff is great and there's literally endless content. If you like realistic or semi-realistic shooters, or really just shooters in general then you're doing yourself a disservice by not having this installed."
2360,"Yes, just yes. Neverminding the 3000+ keybinds just to move forward its an amazing game."
2361,This game is GREAT
2362,It's Arma 3. Need i say more?
2363,ok game
2364,MAC-SI NUMBA 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2365,Bomb away your allies :selike:
2366,"ARMA 3. 
I love it, not much else to say."
2367,yee yee
2368,"spent so many years playing this game, and it's honestly a game that continues to give, zeus offers you so much in terms of ways to play, no zeus (the player in charge of the game mode zeus() does it the same as another. ALso there's loads of mods plugins added daily, be it armagedon,Exile (dayz   for arma 3)
RP servers, King of the hill, wasteland. Theres so much to play and so many ways to play it that you can never really get bored of it.

 my only con for this game is that most of the community takes the game too serious and doesn't allow new players to be new. If you make a mistake people will get toxic  like you're meant to know it all  instantly. But  theres also a big part of the community that is helpful there for the laughs and fun.  it balances out the toxic to non toxic Gamers well."
2369,Amazing game!!
2370,"Its an okay game, I guess. You'll probably get a few hours out of it."
2371,Very boring :)
2372,fun
2373,awsome mil sim game
2374,ears are ringing after helicopter crash
2375,amazing game highly recommend
2376,IT IS FUN
2377,Me make gun go pew pew.
2378,100 more hours and I will have reached 420
2379,takes alot of patience zeuses are annoying af but other than that perfect game
2380,I find enjoyment in executing the civilians of Altis.
2381,Get a couple friends or make some- this game is best with a couple buddies
2382,I've played Arma many times it's so fun to play if you have friends (which I don't)  Some people could be toxic in public lobbies so be careful with that.
2383,once you figure out zeuz it becomes very fun
2384,Yes.
2385,big 'D' energy game
2386,if u wanna rp like a mad man and spend hours to learn all the mechanics and other bs go for it
2387,
2388,Good game
2389,I recommend. Very gut and realistic
2390,Worst fps ive ever played
2391,gud
2392,"Great shooter, little dated now but still a gooder."
2393,im coping
2394,.
2395,Best game in the world.
2396,filled with man babies but still very fun
2397,good epik game pls get and i play with you epikly
2398,"As a fan of realistic games, this one really lives up! A custom scenario creator, customisable men, ect. And access to the workshop? Yes please. Very great game, and I gotta say, it's my favorite of all time!"
2399,fun.
2400,"Have anyone ever played vanilla Arma? I couldn't even tell you what the vanilla experience *is*, besides booting up one of the single player missions and being sniped by an AI from across the map almost instantly. No, you play Arma for the mods, and while many standalone games have been made from ideas that originated in arma (PUBG, DAYZ), Arma still has an incredible depth that those games can't hope to emulate. It's janky at times, it's frustrating at times, but it's also some of the most fun you can have in a open-world shooter."
2401,fun
2402,i love it Boom
2403,Only fun if you can handle downtime...... and bugs...... and janky movement...... You can have amazing experiences you will only ever get in the arma games though.
2404,"Many years since the game was initially launched, it remains riddled with bugs - some of which could only be worked around by using dev commands. This is hardly acceptable."
2405,"it would be extremely useful to profile my windows compatible game pad to configure my own control keys 
"
2406,love it
2407,GOOD FUN IF YOU LIKE MIL SIM AND MODDING MAKE SURE U HAVE A GOOD PC THO
2408,its very fun
2409,"Good game for god price.I like game. Because very fun/ i like this game. buy game :)
"
2410,Altis life is weird.
2411,Nah
2412,"I've had some of the most fun times in this game, there's so much to do or even create you can spend hours upon hours in this game and keep learning new things. i would highly recommend adding this game to your library due to the fact that with not only the campaign, but with the community continually adding new projects, you have such an arsenal of gameplay its hard to get bored of this game.

In recap, Arma 3 is personally one of my favorite games that has plenty of gameplay just with the campaigns and scenarios themselves, adding new workshop mods to the game adds practically infinite gameplay for really anyone looking for realistic to non-realistic warfare and combat simulations. 

Are you still reading this?? Buy the game and play!! trust me when i say you wont regret it!
"
2413,good
2414,"After all this time, yes, I can't believe I haven't left a review. It's obvious to a lot of people that this game is versatile. There are a ton of mods, which makes this the hardcore tactical military shooter version of Garrysmod. There's a lot to do, whether it's playing official scenarios or playing Exile, Wasteland, RP, or BR.

This game still holds up, even being from 2013. It's not for the faint of heart, but it is tons of fun once you get the hang of the plethora of controls."
2415,Super Realistic
2416,"This game makes sense, you can learn teamwork, cool shooting mechanics, if you play with friends it will be even better, very difficult moments of performing different missions, a varied type of game, I advise you to try it yourself and with your friends!"
2417,"7.5/10
I just played Altis Life"
2418,"Game very realistic cause of the following points:
Tracers work both ways.
If the emeny is in range so are you.
Armor is realistic.
You can't quickscope.
No bunnyhopping.
Your scouts and recons are always wrong.
No teammate you played with has ever enough ammo, supplies or passed general inspection.
Your weapon is made by the cheapest company and can't hit shit.
Friendly fire is more accurate than enemy fire.
The people that have all the resources didn't do shit.
Your five second grenade fuse lasts three seconds.
Calymores are always faced toward you.
You opening fire ""irritates"" everyone around you, even silenced.
If it's stupid but it works, it ain't stupid.
Always work together in a team, it gives the enemy other people to shoot at."
2419,cool game big military sandbox
2420,this game is too lag.i also don't know what to do in the game
2421,yay
2422,"Great game when you play with friends and mods, very enjoyable when you have something to actually do recommend to people that are interested with realistic infantry gameplay but not realistic to the point where everything is almost impossible to achieve. You will basically need mods for good gameplay but it is worth it."
2423,Would use geneva suggestions again
2424,"pretty fun with a friend tbh, just get two players to do patrols and youll have a good time"
2425,very good and realistic
2426,fun
2427,"i just dont like it
"
2428,ITS SO GOOD
2429,Boom bang bop 10/10
2430,ITS A LOT FUN
2431,"You can easily lose many hours playing ARMA lll, it is so good due to how immersive it is."
2432,"I spent all of my time fixing mod files, changing the keyboard layout, and creating custom loadouts. I haven't even played it yet."
2433,pretty good
2434,"extremely fun, and i haven't really gotten too much into multiplayer yet!!!!"
2435,"Boring game, 0/10"
2436,"is good
"
2437,penis farts
2438,It‚Äôs alright
2439,"It'll take a week or two to find that server that really ""clicks"" for you, but when you do, you'll be addicted."
2440,Funny game physics go brrrrr
2441,"Decent game, definitely worth purchasing if it's on sale. However the main problem i have with it is paywalls. Almost every vehicle and a large chunk of the necessary features and locked behind a paywall. The games seems sorta bare-bones of you just play the base game."
2442,"PVP is not ARMA's greatest strong suit. It is the ability to customize and modify every aspect of the game. Best way to play this game is to join a unit of your favorite type of flavor (WH40k, Star Wars, HALO ODST, etc) and play operations with people on Discord. Incredibly fun.

Regular servers are dead/boring af. Only buy on sale."
2443,Best game I've ever played by far.
2444,"""You've played for 414 hours, Would you recommend this game to other players?.""
YES!"
2445,I have 50 hours on this game and I still don't know the controls
2446,"Best Mil-Sim Hands down!
plus the million mods available lol"
2447,Good
2448,i die
2449,"Joined Altis life, got captured and raped by kids 10/10 would get pegged again."
2450,makes me sad
2451,"Did you not have any friends with whom to play army men in the backyard when you were little?

Do you have friends now?

If so, live through what you missed as a kid."
2452,its an okay game
2453,Great even if you have bad computer.
2454,"One of the best milsims out there
"
2455,With all due respect sir.
2456,sheesh
2457,"If you are looking for a serious battle simulation with cooperation within teams and realistic missions, this isn't it. Most populated servers are crappy cops and robbers roleplays and pay to win rpgs where everyone goes out on their own. Not to mention the low framerates and constant freezing.

"
2458,yes
2459,game play shooting yes kabooms
2460,Very good
2461,"Good game.
"
2462,mmmmmm tactical
2463,Fun game
2464,Good game and very replayable. The company seems to have its head on straight generally.
2465,Good game overall. Poorly optimized.
2466,very nice
2467,pog
2468,Yes.
2469,Hahaha funni parkinson goes brrr
2470,"Very good physics and logic. You should buy, and if you do not I WILL FIND YOU AND MAKE YOU PAY for the game."
2471,"i cant login in and start my saved game 
i have to start from beginging"
2472,i love it there are lots of bugs tho
2473,Good
2474,this game is like heroin
2475,most amazing game ever
2476,nothing
2477,very good simulation
2478,gud gam:)
2479,its good but i still didn't get my drink from barney
2480,"can i get a, hooooooyaaaaaaaaaah"
2481,complicated but good
2482,worth a buy
2483,gud game
2484,I'm still learning the controls.
2485,"good 
"
2486,its good ja
2487,"Best Milsim
"
2488,Good to play with friends
2489,Fantastic game. So sad it took me until 2022 to get the game.
2490,"It gud & realistic
"
2491,Great game to play with friends but if you dont mod your server prepare to spend a good chunk of money on DLC for the game to work without a watermark and to use all the vehicles.
2492,Very good game and is fun to play with a group of friends.
2493,"401 hours in the game, at least 200 of them are spent in the launcher because I forgot to close out the game. 

That being said 200 hours in I've maybe played 80 in normal multi-player servers and the remaining time has been in modded servers for Warhammer 40k. Want to server the God Emperor of Mankind? You'll find plenty of units to do that with. 

Joined a Krieg unit. Learned that shovel is life. Now I spend my night chasing after my battle buddies who disappear into the night to chase demons with shovels."
2494,Yes very Good!

2515,many memorys fun game i dont play it everyday but enjoy the days i come and visit
2516,The game is amazing and the Physics are beautiful but the only problem that i have with the games Multiplayer based system it that you have to run a dedicated server for everything and its irritating because if i wanna play with my friends then i don't wanna host a server before playing with them i just want to send them a invite and play missions and enjoy our time but keep the dedicated server software for the game if groups of people decide to run their server to still do their thing.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."

Is it quirky? yes. does it sometimes launch an M1 Abrams to the sky for running over a bike? yes. but what you get out of it is about as real a milsim as one can get without being in the military."

2612,"AMONGUS IN REAL LIFE, SUS SUS"
2613,UP THEIR WITH BAD LEVELS OF SPLATUNE 2
2614,"I've played Operation Flashpoint for ages, same for Arma. For some reason I could never get into Arma 2, but my love for this franchise is huge...

Current overall opinion (aka tl;dr):
If you liked any of the previous installments, get it on sale (70%+). Depending on what you want to do, prepare to buy DLCs (which can easily range into AAA prices)

*********

Since I've only spent 3 hours so far, I will update this review, but there are some points I already have a strong opinion about:
1) A launcher... really? Can't I just launch the game?!
2) ""Buy ALL the DLCs! YES! You must buy them! Have we told you about the DLCs already?"" I remember when we got the AH-64 in OFP for free...
3) ""Oh hey there. I see you are playing a campaign... Look at how many campaigns there are! oh yes, those are only available with some DLC...""

8.4h:
4) Campaign missions can get locked up if the squadleader (AI) dies, removing neccessary triggers to proceed...

19.5h:
5) I found a dog, but I couldn't pet him!

100+something hours:
6) The DLC-issue persists into multiplayer. 
- Vehicles are locked, with a pop-up prompting to buy the DLC.
- Equipment is marked as DLC in the arsenal, except sometimes it's not (Ghillie suits, looking at you) and if you equip it (which is possible), you have a constant frame prompting you to buy the DLC. Also, in certain intervals, your screen is overlayed with... something... that makes it hard to do what you were doing at that moment. Much fun to be had if you were currently fighting.
7) The launcher promises to deliver all neccessary mods to play on a server, except it doesn't and you'll get run over by a floating player, because the model of the tank didn't load. Or you get run over/crashed into by an invisible jet on the runway. Or you get shot by an invisible enemy..."
2615,best open world military simulation with and immersive feel and great graphic optimization
2616,War crime go brrr
2617,"me think game good, 11/11"
2618,"Awesome! It's a great first person shooter for someone looking for something closer to a simulator/reality. It's not crazy fast pace and unrealistic like battlefield or the call of duty. Depending we're you hit or get hit affects the play and there's only so much a basic first aid kit can do in the hands of a grunt. It's upon you to learn and keep your skills up with the varies equipment, vehicles and weapons, because there's only your familiarity and the amount of previous experience that will dictate how well you utilize the previously mentioned."
2619,ultimate regret from buying this

2634,good game
2635,"While the base game makes you pay out of your arse for more content the modding community has picked up the slack. 
great mods for this game, however prepare to spend even more space on these mods aside from just the base game."
2636,i love this game its my fav
2637,"Still one of my Favorite Games !!! 

If you never tryed it ....Give it a Try !!! 
You got  soooo much to see ..... like for me it is the MilSim World !!! 

A lot of Idiots out there who forget that it¬¥s still a Game but you can have Hours of Nice Firefights with your Friends !!!

And dont forget to try out High Realistic Mods .... the enemy is pretty Smart with that !!!"
2638,I am refunding this game. It's simply way too hard and I can't really see the enemies that well. It's a shame too since not many tactical shooters really have linux gamers in mind and I'm glad bohemia made a commitment to at least supporting proton. But I don't see myself playing this game in the future.

Only thing is,, you have to purchase DLC's for to be able to pick up more than 20% of the weapons in the game, use outfits and / or be able to get in specific vehicles. ALSO, i do NOT recommend playing it on anything lower than 8GB RAM and a 3060. It's not exactly an optimized game."

2663,Haven't enjoyed it that much.
2664,this game is freaking meth
2665,good game like call of duty but realistic
2666,PTSD Simulator indeed
2667,"Played the series since the original Operation Flashpoint, and can totally recommend this installment even years after its initial release. The amount of mods makes it even better."
2668,"Best game ever, possibilities are limitless.  Waiting for ARMA4"
2669,aim shoot run die
2670,"Man this game is awesome. It might seem overwhelming at first but as soon as you get the hang of it it just turns into this game you'll want to play everyday all the time and you'll just want to explore more. The fact that the average arma buyer spends more than 100+ hours in this game is not false. I will now list some tips for you to enjoy the game and get setup as soon as possible
1. As soon as u get the game regardless of when u wanna play it download the game and then download the common top mods as they are used by pretty much every unit/server and are pretty huge so completing major downloads at once just makes it hassle free
2. Join a unit: even if u have 0 experience and haven't even loaded into a game applying for and joining a unit is still possible and is the best way to learn arma in the easiest way possible plus it just makes things way easier. I'd recommend joining only one unit as joining two is like a burden and joining more is near impossible as most have minimum attendance and have a lot of activities u have to do such as marking attendance giving loa's if ur missing an op etc
3. Before your first op and after boot camp or the training camp for unit load into single player and play some of that just to learn some other keybinds controls and things about arma. I'd prefer playing with the simple single player cheat mod so u do not have to worry about dying and bullets and such and can focus on learning the mechanics tho if u wanna enjoy the story as it is load in without any mods.
4. That's pretty much it to get settled into the game. U can now join multiplayer servers and can participate in game modes like exile, king of the hill, wasteland and can rp in altis life. Time to rack up those hours :)


ALL THE BEST GUYS
ENJOY YOUR TIME IN ARMA 3"
2671,poor controls and AI
2672,"A really great game, it has some pretty grand physics relating to bullet drop, the maps are really large and expansive with great design, the base game weapon selection is rather lacking but the dlcs/mods will make up for that, the uniform selection is massive, you can make your own mission with no limits and place you own AI to play a mission with your mates or just make a pvp session.
BUT with out people to play this game with it is rather dull, but most arma community falls into 4 categorys, 
the hardliners that only care about remaking bollywood flims in their own way but with the yes sir no sir, 
the streamers that only care about setting up the players into boring and inventive encounters while having a SPECOPs squad with the steamer in it save the day for view
the dullards that have next to no enjoyment in mission because all the  missions are the same, helicopter insert, sweep a site, helicopter extract 
the zeus betas, where all the mission that they play have to go according to plan"
2673,10/10 would die in KOTH again
2674,No
2675,was fun when playing but then got banned for no reason at all never downloaded anything to gain a benefit over anyone and was literally just grinding to get the snipers. ive contacted everyone i possibly could have and never got a reply.
2676,"Its legit green army men toys, but the playground isn't your room >:)"
2677,got me feelin like sergeant johnson straight outta boot camp
2678,I like it way too much. I love messing with the editor and playing with friends.
2679,dude its fun
2680,"Honestly wasn't expecting much when I got this game, Judging by how old it was but honestly I gave it some time and I fell in love with this game and the community around it. Probably one of the best mil-sim games I have ever played and it also has some great people that are willing to teach you how to play(Its not that hard to learn you will catch on quickly). If you have the money I 100% recommend you get this game."
2681,"game good, buy game"
2682,I am too retarded to play this game
2683,This was the equivalent of doing Calculus for a Shooter Game
2684,game is kinda mid not gonna lie dont have too much fun and its just overall boring no community no mods to play with and honestly just overall bland
2685,gun go boom
2686,Everything hurts.
2687,"better than I thought. Originally afraid to buy it because of the commitment required to learn, but don't worry about that at all. You might need to google one or two things but the game does a good job teaching you and it's very fun."
2688,"i love the diversity and amount of things you can do in this game, from multiplayer, to dlc, and mods, to eden editor! arma 3 is one of the best military simulators out there. 10/10!"
2689,"Not until I can play it will I give it a good review, I bet this game is great but I can't even launch it the real kicker is I am past the recommended specs I have a better pc than the recommended but every time I try to launch it. it gives me an OutOfMemoryExpectation error and I have 16 GB of RAM! and I have 10 GB of available ram I have tried everything from restarting my pc from verifying the files if you have any idea of what this could be feel free to comment I would love to play this game."
2690,very fun both in single player and multiplayer
2691,gud game better if mods and clan
2692,so fun omggggg!!!!!
2693,"i thought i wanted to play a milsim game, 300 hours later, a sad amount of reading, roleplaying, and insults from unemployed 26 year old manchildren who did JROTC in highschool i have realized my initial desire to play arma was naive. great game tho would reccomend definitely looking forward to the inevitable fifth installment"
2694,THIS GAME IS VERY REALISTIC AND BECAUSE OF THIS IT TAKES ALOT OF TIME TO LEARNN HOW TO PLAY BUT TRUST ME IT IS SO WORTH IT. ARMA 3 IS NOW MY FAVORATE GAME.
2695,This game is the best game what I played ever
2696,great sim
2697,"I highly recommend this game, but there should be more help with entering modded servers."
2698,good game to commit several war crimes
2699,"kinda trash ngl
"
2700,Good game but is best played with mods and in multiplayer
2701,"its good
"
2702,Fine Game
2703,Took me 5 hours to even figure out the controls
2704,is horrible
2705,good game
2706,"Overall, this game is pretty fun from the customization of your character and the map, to the weapons and vehicles. So far the only reason i've gotten bored is because of the single player aspects which are the only real problem. Overall 9/10"
2707,Its bosh
2708,Warcrime Simulator
2709,Like this game allot its incredible to have such a realistic game.
2710,"army

2711,"yes

2713,"your mom
"
2714,"i have not felt the touch of a woman, but this game helps me overcome this

good game"
2715,if you want to completely emerse yourself into an incredibly realistic milsim game then i would definitely recommend this game though it does take a lot of patience so be prepared for that.
2716,"yes
"
2717,"use to be a great game with friends with all the mods... but now after buying new dlc went to play dynamic reacon ops and guess what yi cant connect to friends or join there servers,, but u can play standard game with friends... dont know if there going to fix this or just leave it broken ,, disappointed in such a great game going to waste"
2718,it is a really fun and pretty realistic shooter and is 100% worth it

Sniped my enemys within Altis life.
Robed Upstanding Citizens in Altis life.
Got accepeted into the police Force (in altis life).
Got corrupted within like a week.
And then i started playing unmodded Arma.
It tells storys like only an awesome community can.
"
2760,"game really difficult to be honest. I had to lower the difficulty to 0.0 for the AI. I am not even a bad FPS player but the style precision of enemy aim is on point even with normal difficulty. I like realism in games but that when its unplayably realistic. At least I was able to change difficulty, some games like this don't allow which is where it because a problem. Campaign is the only fun thing so far, server take years to get in and don't offer details on the objective of the server and figuring out voice chat is a pain. Button layout by default is ok just takes a second to understand, so thats not an issue. Over I have been watching people play the game and seen the uniqueness and realism overtime for a few years and it meets expectations decently. so in all, is good game, buy game, you like game."

2787,idk its a fun military sandbox.
2788,war crime simulator
2789,"the game play is good
the basis is good. 
the graphics are dated compared to other games (think early 2000).
the controls are very clunky.
there is a steep learning curve to the game if your looking for simple jump in action stick to battlefield games this is more authentic war combat roe rules.
7/10
game still needs alot of polishing in parts

2790,"A-R-M-A I-S AN AMAZING GAME! You need to have some friends, but if you do, 100 mods and a good zeus and you got a GODDAMN AMAZING OPERATION. A must play for a group of milsim enjoyers, great for RP."
2791,really good game for militairy game fans
2792,Great game. I played Arma 2 before this and it's just fantastic. I do however wish the story mode was less futuristic. That's one of the reasons I perfer Arma 2's campaign but other then that the game is a fantastic milsim.
2793,good game to play with friends or alone you can create scenarios and get some from the workshop.  only things bad are the AI as your squad doesnt always listen to your orders.
2794,"I don't see death so bad anymore

10/10"
2795,War crime simulator with less war crimes!
2796,it's arma 3
2797,this game is just perfection
2798,"It's Ify but I don't regret buying it.

2799,pretty realistic dont expect a steady 60+ fps cuz its not happening

2801,"I've got 350 hours in this and I have to say that it is awesome. Despite it being 8 years old (at time of writing) it has a massively active community, official DLC's and more mods than you can imagine. If you fancy diving into an engaging Milsim, you could do far worse than this one. Still looks pretty and holds its' own against many more contemporary games."

2805,"this...game...is...amazing!
from unrealistic Star Wars clone trooper gameplay to literally switching switches and levers in a UH-60 helo, and from 4 man patrol missions to 200+ people jumping out of C-130s, this game can be modified to whatever and played however you want. it is honestly the most addicting game i have ever touched. my most favorite aspect is aviation, with the most realistic rotary wing aircraft mods making it difficult, but that's why it's fun for me. i only have like 450 hours at the moment but expect it to keep going up."
2806,"I want to like this game but the amount of times that I've looked up how to specifically run a mod the game just won't run ever start it. Controls are H E L L. Even trying to rebind them takes about 30 minutes along with other settings to even start playing then another 30+ to figure out how to join your first ""game"" only to be thrown into chaos mid-match with no knowledge of how to start. Tried the tarkov mod recently as a last attempt, followed every step, still didn't work. I want to like this game but sadly it's just impossible with how over-complicated they've made every single aspect of this mess."
2807,TIGHT!!!
2808,ITS a VERY GOOD game i enjoyed it. UNTIL my BIG problem come by which is Battleye and i am sad because of it because i want to play with my friends but deal with it and move on
2809,"30 hours on a pirated copy, 12 hours now on steam. Still don't understand how to play well but it's fun üëç"
2810,"I never thought I would like a game like this, never thought I'd be able to pick it up. Oh boy was I wrong. 
I enjoy this game, and I think I have the most hours on this game than any other games on steam. This game has its issues, but who cares? It's so much fun to play and I love the community, from people who want to be a milsim to people who dick around and play the game unintentionally. I love it. The DLC is worth it. I could be flirting with girls and try to make a name for myself, but I play this and I haven't talked to a girl in a week. So get the DLC if you want to be a sniper or a pilot. Never mind that, get it because it unlocks the game. It's a lot of fun and people who say otherwise didn't like it I guess. 

The thing I like about it that you can never get bored. You spawn at base. Get on a transport heli, fly to the LZ, get off and ether get shot or survive for a bit. I once ran out of ammo for my main rifle, so I dropped it and ran into the front lines and shot a squad and then got shot myself. I felt very badass. I enjoy it and I recommend it. If your going to get it, if you haven't hit puberty, good luck. Have a voice changer or try to sound like you have a naturally deep voice, trust me, some dick head will make fun of you. It's fun, I like it, and if you do get it, stay frosty."

2813,"Im getting tired of going to the top of a hill after a 3 hour battle and having absolutely nothing left, having used everything to reach the top, with no support from HQ, and most of our men dead, when an A-10 warthog does one gun run and wipes out the last 3 and a half hours of work


10/10 would buy again"

20fps feels awesome, it almost feels as good as 60fps

even 10fps is really good

10/10 game"

"
2816,"Good game, good times however it's dying, wait for a new one."
2817,"A fun game with fun mechanics, my only issue being that half of the sandbox items of this game are locked behind dlcs.  tanks, jets, marksmen, and helicopters combined is 40 dollars
(which i guess is understandable considering how much work went into this game)
more than the base game
even though the cool sandbox vehicles and weapons are locked behind dlcs, i do enjoy this game.  The customization, gunplay, and many other features are great and well made.  For a game from 2013 this is extraordinary, especially the map."
2818,very hard game i still dont know how to play but it is very fun

2820,"4867.9 hours.
Its fair to say i'm hooked.
To try to put into words the hours enjoyed in different worlds of the community's making..
Whether it be mods and scenarios or mods, and scenarios.
Mad discord servers and last minute joining with stupid mod loads.
Overall.
Just boot up the editor and have fun.
Find a mission on the workshop that looks legit and then try to defeat it one night.
Shit can get heavy fast.
Its up to you and that is why i love this game.
Lit and Legit.
Nothing like it.

2833,one of the best military sandbox games
2834,"Honestly it's been years since I last played Arma 3. I still like military sims, but Bohemia's gone the way of mainstream publishers and started to pack on DLC that add up to a pretty ridiculous price. The main game and the DLC are both dubious in regards to military sim content because.... why would a military sim have go-kart racing?

Granted the rest of the DLC available is more appropriate, but it's important to point out that people play Arma 3 for the overhaul mods more than anything, because the base game and its DLC are both... well see above.

You'll get more mileage and focused quality out of Squad or Post Scriptum which are actually played for their vanilla game modes and come, out of the box, with military sim quality gear.

So yeah, can't recommend this game, it was already deviating from the military sim style when it was released to begin with and now we have proper alternatives available for better prices."

2850,"Runs like an obese blue whale, laying hopelessly on a beach, on its back, missing all of its limbs, with the inability to help itself ( Bohemia Interactive). For just 30 dollars you can hire a truck and move this majestic creature from the beach and into your games library. On second thought, why not just leave it on the beach or forget the beach ever existed and set up a quarantine zone so that people can only laugh at it from afar?
Roasted pork and soup dispenser upgrades are arriving today for the office, code optimisations will have to wait... (ITS A TRAP!)

performance is shocking and i didn't end up having a whale of a time as i expected...

just give up, buy seven 6 packs of beer and become an alcoholic like the developers instead..."
2851,"I've got about 800 hours of gameplay, and rarely take the time to make reviews, but this game is still live and kicking. 
It's simply the best Military Sim out there, and even if you play against AI, it's real hard and makes you have to focus and play as a team in order to achieve objectives. 
Highly recommended game!"
2852,this game real fun i say u should get it
2853,"i already haven't played the game for long but I'm already in love with the gameplay, I like how unlike traditional shooters you can't be riddled with bullet holes and suffer no consequences. I love the entire build your own battle concept and im going to enjoy playing around with it more. However i cant give it a positive review due to the fact that you are essentially bullied into paying ¬£50 for all the DLC's. It even puts watermarks all over the screen and to the side a picture asking you to buy more. It also doesn't help a lot of guns, vehicles and even multiplayer game modes are locked behind a dlc. I love the game, but im going to assume unless i don't pay the full ¬£50 for all the dlcs i wont really be able to enjoy it to its fullest"

2887,I mean... its arma.

2889,"The best MilSim still on the market. I've had more joys, laughs, epic moments, and frustrations with this game then with any other. ArmA is something I look forward to and it keeps me building awesome memories with friends I rarely get to see. Thanks to regular updates and a well established modding community, the greatest limitation to play with ArmA is your imagination. A major thanks to Bohemia and the modding community for keeping me playing ArmA since 2008.


Let me start off with the 2 biggest cons that dissuade people from playing ArmA 3...

#1. Not the Best. ArmA is a jack of all trades, master of very little. It is not the best flight sim, it is not the best FPS, in 2021 it is not the best visually, and it is not the easiest to launch and play. If you want the best shooter experience, or the best air-to-air fighter pilot experience, go with something else. These silos of excellence exist in many other games. If you want to forgo excellence in one category and you want to try everything combined under one roof, then read on.

#2. ArmAisms. If you play ArmA, you will regularly deal with frustrations. These can include but are not limited to players occasionally bugging out, dropped connections, getting stuck waist down in a rock, team speak and Arma not syncing properly, etc etc. These frustrations are affectionately called ArmAisms. There are far less now than there were in 2015 and if you left the game then, I'd suggest taking a second look. That said, bring a little bit of patience and a good attitude. ArmAisms can be a great laugh and memory, or they can send you packing.


The three best aspects of this game...

#1 The Environment. The ability to play solo or with a group of friends in any 20th/21st century battlefield setting. This is in large part thanks to the modding community which has worked tirelessly to build upon the excellent vanilla maps created by Bohemia. Thanks to the efforts of so many, I can fight as member of a U.N. Taskforce in C.A.R. 2016, storm the beaches of Sicily 1943, conduct a night raid on a drug cartel in Columbia 2005, conduct an armored assault in East Germany 1985, investigate an SCP breakout tomorrow in down-town USA 2021, or fight a well designed list of campaigns from Greek Islands in 2035, to Vietnam 1967. There is no limit to the places you can ""operate"" in.

#2 Practice made Fun. I do not know any other game that has immersed me in air and land combined arms more than ArmA. I will never forget the day in 2015 when my friends and I conducted a night time HELO insertion, trekked 2km behind enemy lines to an over watch position, and using long range radios talked on a friend in a fast mover at 6,000' AGL who acquired and locked-on our target lase to destroy a militant assembly area. We had worked weeks at putting it all together and that day it all fell in place was epic. 

This game makes practice fun and rewarding. Of course you can practice in other games, but in Arma you get the real opportunity to practice on your own and then come game day weave your capabilities into those of your team. Ask anyone who has played this game and made the 1km sniper shot so the team can move forward unnoticed. Or dropped the mortar rounds danger-close using a radio, map, and protractor while your buddies are on their last mag, black on bandages, and screaming for support stuck in a near ambush. Or you step up and hit the moving enemy APC with an RPG at 350m before it rolls up your friends fighting in the village... the ability to practice and become good at something is so worth it in this game.

#3 The Editor. The editor is fun and easy to start using, especially since they made it 3-D. For every hour I have playing this game, I likely have 2 hours building missions. Your imagination is seriously your only obstacle as you create the scenario that best suits your style of play. I've been intimidated by many editors in other games, but this one really is easy to get into. 

The addition of Zeus is also a tremendous advantage. As I've gotten older I have far less time to build missions the way I used to. No worries, now I can set up a simple mission and add to it in-game using Zeus. There are also many modules that let you focus on playing while the AI creates its own environment.

Encore...
#4. Civilians on the Battlefield. I had to add one more. I have a hard time enjoying other combat focused games when there are zero civilians on the battlefield. As far as realism goes, what battlefield in modern times doesn't have civilians seeking shelter or walking around getting in the way of your very important operation. ArmA missions that add in civilians just increase the excitement and confusion. Using mods you can interact with the civilians, gain information, or try to win over their support. Then the suicide vest goes off, you've got 2 local nationals down and small arms has just opened up from a civ dressed combatant. Oh wow Saturday night just got real. If you are looking to immerse yourself in a real combat environment, but still want to sleep at night, then ArmA is probably for you.


Get ArmA 3, find a group that suits your style, mess around in editor, check out the workshop, and then make a few memories with friends (or strangers) that you'll remember years later. 2,022 hours and 8 years later... it's worth it."
2890,This game is INSANELY fun.
2891,its just really good
2892,"Best game ive played in a while. ALthough, I wanted to play on controller at first, this game has way too many features for that, so I was forced to learn keyboard and mouse. I have never been any happier with my gaming experience. Will take time to get used to, boy do I need time to learn how to fly too."

2895,Most realistic MILSIM game I've ever seen
2896,Oh boy.
2897,"I've just got back into the game. As everyone knows, Arma is THE milsim experience. If you are looking for such a thing, search no further. The game has a variety of mods in the Steam workshop which can further enhance your experience by adding guns, combat shirts/pants, and other things like that."
2898,".
"
2899,"I don't like giving games bad reviews but I feel like I need to for this one to give others a warning. The game is great: great graphics, large amount of vehicles, and lots of guns that the developers spent a lot of time on. HOWEVER, IF YOU DO NOT LIKE GAMES THAT TAKE A LONG TIME TO LEARN, I highly recommend you do not buy this game. I just gave up 30 minutes in the campaign because the system to manage your inventory is just so complicated. If you do want to buy this game, be prepared to do a lot of research on how various things work. I guess a good lesson I learned from getting this and other games I don't like is to read the negative reviews first instead of the positive ones."

2901,"With Nearly 5k hours my experience is good , Ive played more on the Role play Servers than the actual game but this is an amazing game , Ive loved all the time ive spent and some of the Modded community are the main reason this game is popular , The exile is absolutely amazing with the base building and easy to hop on with a group of mates , Some servers are like small community in which ive made some amazing mates who 6 years + still talk to all hopping on a role play server , This game has endless opportunity and would highly recommend"

2905,"ArmA 3 is a good game, I play in milsim units and enjoy the community"
2906,yes i like it
2907,Games Is pretty Ballanced I play on laptop well.. an acer aspire 3 and the game runs so smooth on low setting I love this game

2913,VERY GOOD SOME TIMES IT HARD TO GGET OUT TO THE BATTLE FEILD ON PULIC LOBBYS BUT IS REWARDING
2914,"Very good and realistic military/combat simulator for the masses. The only bad things IMO are that this game doesn't support Steam Cloud, so make sure to back-up your saves and player profiles manually to the USB flash drive for example if you are going to reinstall your operating system. 
The second thing is that the DLC are pretty much a must if you really want to get the full ARMA 3 experience. These DLCs are quite expensive so I HIGHLY recommend to buy all the major DLCs when they go on sale. 
But overall really amazing game with tons of things to do. Also the community is (most of the time) really friendly and there are really good amount of player servers which give even more ''content'' for the player. Recommended"
2915,"got it for xmas wit da boys and it's fun would recommend highly

2916,great game!

2923,SOMEWHAT HARD AT THE START THEN IT GET MORE EASY AS YOU GO
2924,Even on an old underperforming pc  it is fun and enjoyable. Would definitely recommend.
2925,i was banned for reasons not at my fault that one could say was almost for no good givin reason ; this happen more then 10 years ago and have not been able to play since. take it for what its worth would be my to words
2926,is cool. bring on 4
2927,great game with or without friends 100 percent recommend. one down side you need to use a 3rd party software to play with friends unless you live to gather or join a public game.
2928,i dont know what my binds are still
2929,Nice Game
2930,"A good game very creative and very entertaining, it is one of the best war games if not the best"
2931,"Great sandbox game, fun with friends. The planes' physics are a little weird but the helicopters are okay. It's really annoying moving through buildings. But overall as a large scale military sandbox its best in class"

2937,this game is amazing
2938,rly realisticu u can put suslide vest on and then u no die
2939,This game is fun and annoying and has tons off fun to be had But kan be really slow. It has tons off mods and they can expand your game i would recomend getting the ultimate editon beacuse some mod require the dlc's and most dlc's are really good.

2958,"So Arma 3, is a great game but not the campaign areas. The joy of this game comes from the communities/units you will join in your time of playing this game. There is a ton of issues and glitches but the devs are always working on things.

It does stink that a lot of the nice things are locked behind the DLC packages. I would recommend though getting this game then joining some unit which peaks your fancy."

2977,Awesome game and fun
2978,"GOOG,NO GREAT!"
2979,Arma 3 is the best horror game you can buy.
2980,"Overall this is still a very good game and worth playing.  

Pros:
1. open sandbox with many great community mods
2. original content still playable after many years, new 3rd party DLCs being created
3. editor is easy to use, well documented APIs

Cons:
1. as with many other games, the AI vehicle path finding needs some work.
2. the graphics engine is a little dated. 
3. game slows down when adding many AI units. need to either sacrifice AI count or graphics / view distance.

2991,"This game is THE BEST Military Third/Fps game ever,,,, Ground breaking graphics makes war even real tactics and planning every step you take is awesome Great war atmosphere Unlike Cod/Battlefield You have to be aware in Every step you take Cuz You can be shot 400 miter away Best Simulation Game Ever. XD
Pros:
-Awesome and Ground Breaking Graphics.(Maybe One of the best looking games ever)
-Tactics and real gameplay
-Sounds in game are awesome you'll feel like the war is at the neighberhood.
-Steam Workshop.(can play any user created mission instantley and our community is creative as hell)
-Exciting and awesome Multiplayer (tension and stress makes adrenaline pump in your veins)
-6 months the devs was making Tweaks to it so you will experince no bugs most of the time

Cons:
-Low fps when playing multiplayer(a 20/30 Drop in fps When playing multi) Devs may fix this after release.
-Single player compaigne will be delivered as free dlc after release (Some pple prefer to play singleplayer So these pple will be turned off)"

3013,"I don't know why i keep coming to this unoptimized piece of crap.

-Inventory system is just really really bad. You see a weapon on the ground and it's almost impossible to grab it sometimes because it doesn't show up in the action menu or the ground when you open your inventory.

-AI so bad the community had to fix it (try ASR AI or VCOM.)

-Physics are absolutely horrid. You'll get your vehicle flown to an altitude of 5km/blown up if you happen to touch a stationary MG etc. Also walking on rocks is extremely dangerous, you might somehow warp inside the rock and never get out.

-A lot of copy&paste vehicles on BLUFOR, INDFOR and OPFOR. For example every side has the same stationary weapons, even the same UCAV but with different names (it's like if China operated the MQ-9 reaper lmao.)

-Very clumsy weapon handling. You reload certain weapons like rocket launchers and your character will stand up, crouch, holster your rifle, unholster your sidearm, holster your sidearm, then actually unholster the launcher, holster it back, then unholster it again. (a little exaggerated but if you've played the game you know.)

-Vault mechanic is hilariously buggy. Vaulting over something will sometimes get you stuck in the object you're trying to vault over and your character will do the fall animation and damage you. Also you're able to walk through some wall objects if you look down facing the wall, vault, then by walking backwards you're able to slowly phase through the wall.

-Bunch of overpriced half-assed DLC. Just stick to the awesome community made content by RHS, CUP, JSRS and many more.

-Very very very very poorly optimized so if you don't have a beast PC then DO NOT GET THIS GAME.

There's probably A LOT more stuff i forgot to include but despite all this the game looks very good for an 8 year old game and Bohemia Interactive is still very active with the community. I like the gunplay because you actually have to shoot semi-auto accurately and the only time when full-auto is useful is when you're giving suppressive fire or in very close-quarters. I also kind of like the clumsy movement in a way because it prevents players from being able to dodge bullets by sliding, bunnyhopping and shifting from side to side like you always see in mainstream shooters. Zeus allows for some really fun scenario making with friends and the 3D editor is manageable.

For some reason i'm still having fun here and there and i've accepted the negatives in this game but i know a lot of people won't so that's why i can't recommend this to anyone. With Bohemia Interactive announcing their new game engine i'm beyond excited for the future of Arma."
3014,somew guy shot me and i died very sad. harambe would not be proud
3015,Just play even u don't know what to do
3016,"I have been playing this game for some time now and it so fun to play with friends and it's realistic military game. I recommend purchasing this game right now as its 75%.

[b] I rate this game a 10/10.[/b]"
3017,"Well it was about time I reviewed this game, huh?

Short version: It's good. If you like military stuffs, this game is as close as it gets to the real thing.

Long version:

I've been playing this game since the Beta, and I've seen it grow into what it is now; The best military experience you can get without having to step outside.

The game has a steep learning curve and can be intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of things, you'll have a very fun and rewarding experience.

I'd reccomend the new players to play the base game's campaign, it will show you the ropes, but dont expect hand holding. When you've had enough of the base game, there are a couple DLCs, which honestly are pretty good and I'd reccomend getting. If that's still not enough for you, well you're in luck.

Arma 3 has a massive modding comunity. Wheter you are into hardcore milsim, roleplaying, sci-fi, PvP, Coop or simply wanna hop in with a couple friends and mess around, I can guarantee there is something out there just for you.

Arma 3 also has a big online presence as well, ranging from public servers to propper communities/clans.

I'm not big into PvP, so I won't get into it, however what I love about this game is a specific game mode; Zeus.

Zeus is a multiplayer mode where one player acts as a game master and can make and change missions on the fly, using a real time 3d editor.  This means that for example. the same mission could be infinitely replayable, or that a mission could have different outcomes depending on player actions without having to script a single thing.

If you are not into the multiplayer side of things, don't worry. Arma 3 has plenty of official SP experiences, and if that's not enough for you, the community has you covered. You can also make your own missions using the Eden editor, a very solid 3d editor which offers you a wide variety of tools to make your own scenarios.

Not everything is positives though;

The game and its engine show its age. The physics can backfire in hilariously ridiculous ways (specially on multiplayer), be careful when driving vehicles at speed over bumps!

On a less funny note, the AI can be pretty hit or miss. It's usually fine, though, and there are AI mods you can put in the game for a different experience.

All in all, it's a really good game."
3018,so ba d
3019,it is fun
3020,"Many thousands of hours in (Not just on steam) and this game still does not grow old. Yes it is clunky, yes it is technically ageing but it continues to provide new, fresh, fun and variably infinite, infinitely repeatable experiences alone, or primarily with other players. Friends and strangers. Strangers have become friends because of this game. I wholeheartedly recommend.

I have been playing this game since it's first incarnation as Operation Flashpoint and have never stopped. It provides an experience like no other game I've played. Currently I play it a few times a week with a small group of friends, varying our play styles. From fun death-races,  racing cars being hunted by a lone Helicopter, to PvP Skirmishes, or online King of the Hill, through to long, tense Special Ops style military campaigns requiring stealth and coordination. Its always a blast. 

The editor and modding community place this game so far beyond any other in terms of variability and scope. It can spawn entire new game play styles (battle royale) or provide quick entertainment. Can be great for those hard ore nights with a mate or two or for some fun elevated FPS shooter like King of the Hill / Invade & Annex. 

You WILL get stuck in rocks. You will get killed trying to open a door. You will glitch out driving a tank after you hit a shrub. The interface is unintuitive, the movements janky, the AI questionable at times yet this game holds strong nearly a decade after release. 

100% go buy it!"

Most things (99%) are 1-click install, 1-click load, 1-click play.
You can adjust most of them to your liking in-game to fit whatever you're trying to build.

"
3108,cool game
3109,My first 70 hours in this game have been spent solely in the mission editor. That alone warrants a buy.
3110,good it fun
3111,Great game!
3112,SAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
3113,"good game mods are good game is good all you need in game very much fun

yeet"
3114,"Still have PTSD from all the times beef was settled at OG.

I thought I could drive pretty good until I found myself in a hatchback sport zooming down Kavala road.

If you're bored and looking for a game to play, I recommend Arma 3 entirely. Even if you don't enjoy the game itself, you can find ton's of enjoyment just from reading the side chat on most servers. Always some toxicity there."
3115,Super realistic
3116,Gud Game It fucks over your Life
3117,lol war crimes go brrrrrrrrrrrr
3118,"Although I did enjoy playing the game it was difficult to play, even on the lowest settings my fps rarely ever reached 50. It is very disappointing because it is such a fun and unique game. I would only recommend buying the game if you have a pc that can run the game well."
3119,"This buy is definitely worth it. The game is exciting, engaging and the squad combat system gives you total control over several units in the later game. The storyline is engaging and interactive, and you can even use radio callouts, which I find appealing.  The multiplayer aspect of this game is made pretty well too, and can be fun with the right crowd. There is enough content in this game that at 81.8 hours on record, I have less than half achievements complete and it took me around 10 hours total (Estimate) to beat the main story once, spread over several days. The DLCs look good but I do wish they were freely incorporated into the main game. Either way, this game is definitely worth its price and its been a while since Ive seen a game this good. I do have to warn though, the game definitely requires a strong computer."
3120,"Its a unoptimized piece of shit...

like dont get me wrong, arma 3 is great, all the game functions are great
mod support is amazing.

but holy shit it runs bad.

40-45fps with a 3060ti and i7 processor, utilisation of the components doesnt even hit 50% and it still runs like dogshit.

like how long has it been out? how many DLCs can you buy?

I wont recommend this game untill they release a DLC that optimizes the fucking game. cheers"
3121,"Downloaded the game, was super hype. Problems started instantly. 
Main menu was super confusing and took me a good 10 minutes trying to figure out how to join a game.
Then found out the first menu isnt the actual menu, so waited another 10 minutes for the real main menu to launch.
Spent another 5 minutes tying to understand the lobby and server UI. After not understanding any of the game modes or how the servers are organized, btw there is no option to organize servers by game type or player count.
Finally found a server that was populated and with a gamemode that was self explanatory, tried to join but was met with multiple problems with Gamespy Anti-cheat.
So now im about 40 minutes into the game, still havent done anything but look at menus, loading screens and scroll through servers.
Finally, an hour into this mess i have at last joined a server, gave myself a ""role"" in a squad, i think. Spawned in with no idea where i was or what i was supposed to do.
Voice chat was absolute hell with people arguing, talking over each other, it was a nightmare. Listened to people threaten to kick each other for 10 minutes because they all think they can fly planes better.
Here i am running around in the middle of nowhere looking for another player. 
Then proceed to get shot by an AI who was hidden in some bushes on some far away hill.

0/10 probably wont play this shit ever again. Going back to Squad
"
3122,"Arma 3 is the most played game in my steam library. It's the most played since it has the most things to do.

Arma can be a modern MILSIM, a WW2 shitpost, an RP game or you and your friends getting the shit scared out of you in Tanoa; all of this thanks to mods. Bohemia also listen to their community, shaping the game around it. 

While this game may have a difficult skill curve (depending on how you play and what you do) the ability to do so many things (especially if you learn your way around Eden) is something that exists in nearly no other game (if there even is one in the first place).

I recommend this game to people who like indepth stuff; if you like games such as Squad, DCS, Door Kickers and all those indepth/realistic games I recommend Arma."
3123,sexy game
3124,"Been an ARMA player since the first game. A3 is a great game, but I do wish the vehicle pathing AI was better. unlike A2/A1 - this version has some issues with vehicles staying in formation. Lots of MODS to keep it fresh."
3125,"is good
also USAF mod is top tier"
3126,fun but may cause ptsd
3127,it is hared
3128,10/10 I bombed civilians
3129,you want a good game that's military based then here you go ....... also based !!!!!!!
3130,BEAST
3131,"An Antimatter Powered RTX 3069 Super Quantum is needed to play this game on 60 fps, And it would still crash."
3132,to much shit to learn
3133,Arma 4 when?
3134,yum yum
3135,good
3136,fun game
3137,fun
3138,war crimes simulator
3139,"fun if you know what you're doing but incredibly beginner unfriendly which is good
"
3140,It's fun
3141,"Amazing game to new players that want a realistic shooter that you actually use real military things and techniques. This is a great game if you wanna walk through a mountain for 1 hour just to get fucked by IEDs, but hey this game is great to play sp or mp with friends or not with friends. this is a great game if you like realistic military combat and wanna expereince real military stratagys and how they have it out their in the field"
3142,"pro gaym

3144,fun

3146,"if you want to play milsim, yes, anything else? theres better games"
3147,"good game its amazing but its boring if u play it alot
"
3148,"The hitboxes are more clapped than that chicken that was slapped till it cooked, the graphics are getting more outdated than Joe Biden and the gun play is as fun as trying to use a wet baguette as a saw. Funny war crime simulations though and vechicles are cool i guess."
3149,its good
3150,great fun game
3151,Good game
3152,it gud
3153,It's good
3154,Best game ever
3155,big gun
3156,geneva convention more like geneva suggestion
3157,If you like realistic shooters that pretend to be a military simulators - Arma 3 is probably the best choice.
3158,I believe Arma 3 is a great game where you can do alot but it can get boring alone. I recomend playing on some server with atleast 4 friend or joining a Unit.
3159,"very nice game, i love playing half baked modded servers with incompetent devs and admins"
3160,one of the best realism games out there
3161,Pure pain
3162,"The game has been around for a while. The single-player mode can be pretty tough - even unfair - for first-time players who are still learning the game, and customizing the difficulty levels down to it's easiest doesn't seem to affect how tough the AI are when they are shooting for you. So it's a slow, step-by-step progress that requires tons of game saves and restarts, while you learn just how to defend yourself. But for those who like military simulation games, ARMA 3 is the best that's around...."

3165,"[h1]Arma 3 is what you make of it[/h1]

If you like drop in / drop out gameplay, then you will enjoy public servers.
If you have a set time per day/week to play, then you will enjoy private Unit servers more.

If you like PvE, then you will flock to gamemodes like Zeus, Escape, and Campaign;
While PvP players jump at Warlords and KOTH.

'Real Military' equipment not your style? Download a total conversion mod, and join a unit that runs operations with it.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769440155] Halo [/url]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2649081108] Star Wars [/url]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2221541445] Alien [/url]
The possibilities get pretty wild

Want more realism and 'milsim'? Mods like 'ace3', 'jsrs', and 'suppress' add a realism feel. Combine those with unit modpacks like RHS and/or CUP and you have several additional factions, maps, equipment, and uniforms to fight with.

Interested in all this and not sure where to start? Join an interesting unit's Discord and ask away. [url=https://units.arma3.com] https://units.arma3.com [/url]

If you want the true experience without missing anything however, you're gonna need to buy some DLC. Sites like Kinguin or G2A have a lot of the keys at ridiculously low prices that undercut the Steam store by up to 90%, so definitely look there first.

DLC's that you WILL NEED are as follows:
Apex (It adds  too much to list here)
Marksmen (Rifles and sights)
Helicopters (You're gonna use these a lot)
Tanks (Could do without this but its nice to have)
Zeus and Malden are free, just download em

OPTIONAL DLC but still great to have:
Karts (cmon dude its a kart)
Jets (only if you are fond of being a CAS pilot)
Laws of War (adds some misc. gear)
Contact (Adds a fantastic map for use in multiplayer, some gear, and a subpar campaign with bad fps)
Western Sahara (a 'standalone' mod that launches apart from the regular game to add a fun survival mode and a co-op campaign style Extraction mode)

Every creator DLC aside from the one listed can basically be simulated for free via workshop content. SOG is supremely overpriced and the Unsung mod is the same thing but free

Tacops mission pack will probably come with some other DLC if you buy from Kinguin, but don't buy on its own



Most performance issues can be fixed by fine tuning settings and or using mods that increase the fine tunage of said settings

3173,"The game automatically puts the campaign on the hardest difficulty, so the first thing to do while playing is lower it."

3183,Geneva Convention? More like Geneva Suggestion.
3184,"Arma is a fun milsim type game. I don't play it really anymore because I just can't really get into the head space to dedicate the time needed to run ops in multiplayer. However Arma is one of those games that benefits so greatly from its modding communities, and has a really dedicated one at that which is putting tons of work to really make this game fun along with more militaryesc. 

All and all fun game, but despite having single player missions and such this is absolutely a multiplayer game, do not play it alone, look into servers to play with."
3185,"pretty good game though it is glitchy, dont bother with just vanilla instead use mods"

3218,"Army can be clunky as F and there's a ton of valid criticism to be had, but in the end the scope of the experience is just unparalleled. 

I've lost myself in Arma 3 more than in any other game. The difference is you can have bona fide hour-long adventures with unknown outcomes in uncharted territory  versus predictable (polished) competitive gameplay experiences. There's nothing wrong with the second, but only a few games offer the first."
3219,"Nice game, the world building is really impressive"

3275,"Jank as fuck, but the memories I've had with this game outweight it. I've fought zombies, launched the vietnamese space tank program, and even got to defend a small town from an onslaught of angry criminals. In short, I'd recommend this game."

3288,No regrets.

3294,Pog game Pog Pog
3295,Even if you don't touch the campaigns or multiplayer at all it's still worth paying for just for the sheer depth and power of the mission editor.
3296,I've spent more hours on this game than my last girlfriend. 10/10. Make sure you give all aspects of the game a shot. There's a wide variety of communities out there that it shouldn't be a problem finding one you like and enjoy. Know that you're first 200 hours of the game is just figuring out the controls.
3297,"Cool game, much much content!!"
3298,the game is pretty hard but if your a smart person this will fit you. Theres alot of strategy involved and ALOT more fun with friends. Personally i recommend
3299,if you wanna be virgin for life play this game
3300,"Amazing multiplayer, just find an active group and have hours of fun"
3301,bueno
3302,What else has 100+ keybinds?
3303,very gud
3304,"Battleeye banned me from ArmA 2 after i edited the Process priority in process hacker to the highest setting. That was in the old DayZ times and apparently a unfair advantage i guess. After buying ArmA 3 in its Alpha i noticed on my first mp join attempt that i also was banned in this game. Same ban reason, battleeye never responded on my several inquirys over the years. I requested DSGVO info about my account from the company to get some more info. Got no answer.

So i bought this game a second time und use this account here for a headless client. I still love the game for its milsim capabilities. Just the engine should get some mayor improvements. Car physics for example are just bad. And the AI, oh gosh. So much headaches when developing scenarios for this game."
3305,"Really enjoy the way the developers embrace the mod community. Besides this, the game is of course legendary."
3306,"I've been playing all the games in the Arma series since Operation Flashpoint back in 2001. So I have to say it's hard for me to have a really objective view of it. Some of the places on these maps feels like coming home. Yeah... it's a bit messed up.

Once you get around all the controls and you find the flow of it, it's extremely rewarding. I've played it almost exclusively in coop with with some of my friends.

The community around this game is second to none. The constant addition of high quality user created content makes this worth so much more than what they charge for it. Also the devlopers spend a lot of resources on providing tools for the community. 

It's clunky, realistic, unforgiving, difficult and wonderful. It's a game you always get better at, but not because you learn to do quick combos and grappling hook jumps. But because you learn to communicate, plan, anticipate, take your time, aim, calculate and know when to shoot and when to wait. 

I can't recommend this enough. For me this is the number 1 game out there. Amen."
3307,"Yes,"

3317,"Arma 3 is the best option if you want the ultimate freedom in a military simulation sandbox style game. the 3D mission editor alone is worth buying. It is by far the most in dept and very easy to use mission editor, unless you want to create a complex campaign with cinematic cutscenes, but you can do that too. There are literally 10,000 plus great mods that can change game dynamics to sound/visuals to just adding a ton of new vehicles, weapons, new factions, and maps. Really, the only bad things I say about Arma 3 is it's not a AAA title so quality isn't the best. The graffics arn't bad though, just the movements and can glitch out sometimes"
3318,Yes
3319,No words but Great Game. It's a Good Buy!

3332,Very fun with Antistasi
3333,"very good
"
3334,just fun times overall. maybe a bit many dlc's and cdlc's but it's understandable
3335,"Without mods this game would not be a great experience. A big thanks to the community who make it run great and look amazing, this game is awesome fun. If you are here fora first person shooter, you may want to go somewhere else. If you want a war simulator, then you have come to the right place. Be ready to put at least a hundred hours in before you know your controls and understand how the mods work. Once you understand those things this game is great fun"
3336,"the game is veeeeerryyyyy goood this game is the best
"
3337,Was able to kill commies and had a fun time doing so
3338,Best. Military. Sandbox. Ever.

"
3342,dont do it
3343,"You know its good game when the term ""Ahh Sh*t i just got arma'd again"" exists"
3344,eh game
3345,This is the worst game of all time.
3346,dude... it's arma
3347,Plays really well and plenty to do if you can bear the aids of other players
3348,"100/10 recommend. I have played this game a LOT, and have a lot of great memories with friends in the community. Easily modded, ever-changing game-play."
3349,The best overall milsim game out there.
3350,fart
3351,good
3352,"My life has changed after surviving a helicopter crash, killing 14 VC, and saving 2 American soldiers in Vietnam within my first 20 minutes of playing. This game is amazing"
3353,Good game
3354,"It's a cool game, but hard to learn"
3355,"Really fun game, perfect for you to just mess around with your friends, or do Role play"

3364,Good game
3365,"Daddy chili
"
3366,I just love this game. Its unlike anything else.
3367,Absolutely recommend it. It works on an 11th gen Celeron laptop (N5100).
3368,Mostly realistic MILSIM. The enemy being able to both detect you and identify you as a threat is a little too unrealistic - the enemy knows you're someone to kill even though you're laying still in a bush hundreds of meters away. I'd hate to be one of their friends just taking a nap in a bush. Otherwise it is a fantastic game and very reminiscent of my military experience.
3369,The best military simulator on the gaming market!
3370,CANCER
3371,Game is alright played it here and there. Quality
3372,this game is gonna ruin my social life
3373,another great arma game
3374,a really great game i played this for 219 hours i will admit if your looking for super realistic shit then look at some of the workshop game mods it'll be fun but invest in cheaper games to get a feel or watch videos before you buy good luck. killer
3375,fun asf on bd
3376,I love when someone shoots me for no reason 7/10
3377,"Now I've only played Arma3 for a little bit, but if you enjoy war crimes, wasting civvies, targeting civilian infastructure and  ignoring every and all laws of war; then this game is for you! Cluster Bombs go brrr."
3378,"If you don't like CoD but do like Rising Storm, Hell Let Loose, Post Scriptum, Squad, etc; then this is the ultimate exercise of Military Simulation. 
Fantastic game, can't wait for Arma 4."
3379,"i love the game overall. it has been a working process for the game tho but i still like it, it has a lot of content too enjoy."
3380,good.
3381,its good
3382,great
3383,"good game
"
3384,"I think this is a Great MilSim game. The single player stuff is good, but its 10x better with friends. the mod support in this game is insane. Like Skyrim levels of mods. The DLCs are also a lot of fun. Especially S.O.G Praire Fire! 100% Recommend if you like Milsim games. If you can get all the DLCs, their worth it."
3385,Have you fired your gun yet? No? Good.
3386,Great game
3387,u
3388,best milsim outthere. youll enjoy it so play it.
3389,good game. loads of fun to mess with the endless amount of mod. 10/10 would recomend
3390,"This game is one of my favorites. I use it for milsims and let me tell you, there are alot of them!
"
3391,"Yes, many hours in sandbox I have accumulated."
3392,Is good
3393,"The game is an absolute blast, i havent played it with my friends yet but its definitely worth buying if you have the sanity after these past two years"
3394,They tried so hard to make this a frustration instead of a game.
3395,Not bad
3396,Its Ight
3397,"This is a really good game! With the community workshop making mods to improve gameplay, it makes it much better!"
3398,Great Game. Must join Discord server for Arma 3 content. https://discord.gg/Wua9jCyNqv
3399,Dope ass game
3400,good times. made alot of different scenarios and have killed alot of time

3413,"I've played for thousands of hours over almost a decade, and this game still keeps creating new experiences for me whenever I decide to hop back on. I played Arma 2 and OA before this, masterpieces in memory even if they're dated and broken when looking back today. Arma 3 is yet another masterpiece, an evolution of its predecessors. Despite its age it manages to be a powerful game with endless tools, capable of creating even more powerful memories, enabling you to do whatever you damn well please, however you damn well please. Now we eagerly await Arma 4, and hope it can be Bohemia Interactive's next masterpiece.
If you don't have it already, you should probably buy it now. But we all know you already own it and are just browsing through reviews like the rest of us.
10/10"
3414,alright

3419,"Base game   8/10  (one of the best military combat simulators of all time to me. )
DLC              8/10  (can be a bit expensive, buy in the big steam sales and you will not regret it)
Mods           10/10 (endless amounts of mods for everyone's bread and butter.)
Graphics      7/10  ( i would like to rate this higher but you need a flagship pc to get the best quality graphics)
Gameplay   8/10   ( can get a little boring in the down time walking etc. but overall its perfect.)
Mechanics  7/10   ( could feel a little clunky from time to time but when you get used to it, its perfect.)

Overall       8,5/10 ( perfect if you like military simulators and everything that comes with it. Also the community is one of 
                                the best out there. Definitly something you should look into buying)

3420,"i was originally gonna write a review at 50 hours but the game carried me away, with mods your game might lag but its worth it, large maps, can be modded, awesome community, and plenty of communities to join, its squad but PVPpve larger maps and i would say more opportunities than squad."

"
3433,<3
3434,"This is absolutely the worst milsim game and its completely over-hyped. 
The controls alone are the worst I've ever seen, there's no reason why you should have to press 8 million different buttons just to try and heal yourself. The UI is a clusterfuck trying to bind new controls.
The stamina is garbage, you can only sprint 100m before your character slows to a crawl for over minute (AI apparently doesn't follow this rule so they just leave you behind if you're trying to follow them."
3435,vvcvvc
3436,I've had so much fun with friends and I've met new ones. I still talk to them to this day. I love this game and it's full of amazing mods made by others. I totally recommend this game.
3437,great game
3438,Best of all!
3439,"failed in the tutorial, bAd gam e"
3440,WHERE IS ARMA 4
3441,FANTASTIC! Wish I had discovered Arma along time ago.

3453,yes
3454,"Bareboned game is kinda boring and lack content, but heart is in modding. Not user friendly and need some time to get full potential out from it. Still had some really fun time with it. Recommended."
3455,really good fun but it is quite confusing to get started and definitely worth the money
3456,everthing
3457,It may it take a while to get used to everything but i'd say it's worth it.
3458,now that my hardware can run the game on high detail at 60+ fps it's really good.
3459,play with friends u will love
3460,ye
3461,"If you‚Äôre looking for some serious milsim experience or combined arms, Arma is definitely one of the best games you don‚Äôt wanna miss!
It‚Äôs said that Arma 3 is, well, relatively more unrealistic, compared to its military version, VBS 3. Well, maybe it‚Äôs due to some you-know-why reasons. But Arma is still a hardcore milsim game.
You and your squad are pinned down by a group of MGs or LAVs? No problem!  Just call in CAS or artillery to wipe them out!
Spotted enemy arty or MBT while doing recon missions? No problem! Just mark the target with your laser designator, and  call in air support unit with GBUs to enjoy some fireworks!
But for infantry combat, tbh, you might have to patch some mods to make it better.
With all these DLC, Creator DLC, Eden Editor and mods, from CQC to massive all-out warfare, Arma can do them all!
  P.S. Maybe 20 yrs later, Arma 5 is able to support 512 vs 512 PvP servers. Imagine we‚Äôre a part of a 1024 Players battle where people fight like real military would do. There‚Äôs command units, combat units, support units, etc. 
Well, it‚Äôs probably just me. 1024 Players seems not possible for now."
3462,geed
3463,There is yet a game to be made to beat this one.
3464,"the ""story"" is too short.  But too short is a great rapper."
3465,"Literally unplayable

10/10"
3466,Good RP game loving it 10/10 paws get it and find a discord server for small ops or mil-sims if you are into that stuff!
3467,"Yeah, i would recommend this to other warfare players especially since it's a Open World, World and Scenario Building which others can create in their own pleasure and satisfaction based on their kind of battles or they wanna make a mission for other people and make them have fun in his creations.. so yeah i would recommend it!!"
3468,After the change of Arma from 32 bit to 64 it became the game many of us envisioned for years! Armas huge scale maps and interesting mechanics make for a very realistic yet wanky experience in which your pumped because of the pure scale of the situation or laughing at the crazy glitch that sent your vehicle 80 meters into the air. I have had so much fun in this game over 1000 hours worth and hope this recommendation sways your interest because its worth the buy!
3469,gud game but i potato pc
3470,kinda hard to learn all the key binding but its fun

3479,Must have MilSim
3480,"Good game, very cool"
3481,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - YOU WILL NOT GET A REFUND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT. 

This game has a lot of potential but unfortunately i think it is too rigid and difficult, especially lone wolf players.  It took me about 20 hours to learn the ""Basics of the game"" via tutorials and a couple of the single player missions.  I go online and spend 5 hours trying to figure out how to join a multiplayer game. Then another 2 hours trying to learn how to fast travel on a map (there are NO instructions on how to do this).  Then another total of 5 hours trying to get into vehicles that it doesn't let me get into because of my rank/loadout.  Then another few hours waiting for other players in helicopters to ferry me over to the battlefield where i die within seconds.  

This game is not for people who enjoy battlefield games. This is for groups of people looking to have teamwork, most likely veterans.  This is not for the casual gamer.   

I want my money back. But since I invested 40 hours trying to learn this game, Steam declined to give me a refund because i exceeded the max play time of 2 hours.  You heard me TWO HOURS.  It took me over an hour to finish the crash- landing a helicopter tutorial ALONE! and that was part 1 of 4 which was one section of 12.  

Not only is this a bad game for casual gamers. But STEAM  has a terrible return policy. I will no longer buy games from Steam nor will i buy games by Bohemia Interactive."

3494,"game includes a bitcoin miner that makes my PC commit neck rope, toast bath, blow dry shower and undo life"
3495,"It's a realistic game (yes, there are a few things that wouldn't happen in real life), the amount of stuff you can do in this game is crazy. Even if the stuff you want isn't in a DLC, mods can change the whole experience. Most of the time, they work and are reliable, tho sometimes bugs occur, but that is to be expected.
You can play alone or with friends. Even if you don't know how to make your own mission, there are missions premade for you, and if you don't have any more missions to play, again there is the option of workshop. :D"
3496,shits gas
3497,Good milsim. Just what you expect.
3498,With BF2042 disaster you appreciate Arma games even more. Must be strongest year for BIS
3499,its good. believe.
3500,"If you want a military simulator, this game is for you. I would highly recommend getting into some of the mods from the workshop as well because it enhances how enjoyable this game is. After 470 hours into the game, there is still so much that you are able to do thanks to the Eden Editor. You can create any scenario that you want and have it as long and as complex as you would like. I hope that they come out with Arma 4."

I remember the meme between Battlefield and Call of Duty when i was younger, then i discovered Arma III thanks to it, and oh boy was i up for a treat.


-----
Arma's main idea is itself, not its story, not its gameplay, not its visuals, Arma is probably the most meta game there is, you play a simulation of a real battlefield, of a real conflict, and each decision, each action matters. You could remove a variable of it and it would still excels in its genre.


Its a massive sandbox, you mostly play it for the custom missions, the multiplayer and the campaigns.
-----


[b]Lets say it straight up the visuals of Arma III are not exceptional[/b], dont get me wrong they are [i]good [/i]but they wont blow other game out of the water, it focuses on what it needs to focus on and it does it well and that's it.
Just dont look at the details for too long or it might hurt your brain.
Arma could very well need a refresh on that bit, support more technologies to improve the visuals a bit, but again, [b]you dont play Arma for that.[/b]


-----


Gameplay wise, its simple, you are human, you have so many customization features that its impossible to list them all.
Its a sandbox, and a simulation, if the idea of dying after a single bullet doesnt appeal to you, skip it, its not for you.
I like the idea that this customization applies all the way to the game's settings, finally a game that lets you choose your graphics to the exact level that you want.


-----


Arma is from 2013 and yet im still amazed at how alive it is and how much content is poured in it regularly, its the gmod of milsim.
Arma is a mood at this point, its a small military corp and the devs are focused on what they love.

One of the few games that i can recommend full price no doubt on that.
Lets hope that the next one will be just as good if there ever is one.

3566,AAAAHHHHHH ARRRRRRRMMMMMYYYYYY
3567,"Steep learning curve. A lot of controls. Optimisation is rather poor. Clunky. Yet, I would highly recommend it. There is A LOT of replayability in this game. There is also a very active modding community adding tons of more content to the game. If you have the time to spend as well as friends or a clan to spend that time with, get this game. Especially for you MILSIM people."

3583,I would recommend Arma to any Milsim roleplayer. Lots of server for role play and a story to it.
3584,arma 3 is the best army simulator you can find. unfortunly this game is really dead and slow multiplayer doesn't help. there is no point in the campaign the real fun is playing with friends. but even messing around in the vr room is very fun and worth it if you bought this like me for 9#

3597,"ARMA 3 can literally be whatever you want it to be. The modding potential for this game is insane. Even if you play it straight though, it's a stupid fun time.

Invade and Annex is what I love to play with ARMA. It's basically a PVE mode where you're working with a team of human players to take areas from an AI faction. I have already done a ton of cool things: using an anti-tank rocket to take down a heli Rambo-style, having an epic last stand beside my comrades in a tiny fort against a horde of enemy troops... the best story bar-none though is the story of a friend and I waiting for heli pickup along with maybe 10-15 other people. We made jokes about ""Pepsi flares"" because there were twenty blue and red flares going off all at once. I wanted to throw a flare to join in on the party... and accidentally threw a grenade into the middle of our group huddle. The entire squad died... and I freaking died of laughter. I still have yet to laugh as hard as I had in that moment.

ARMA is an amazing game to create stories, whether you're playing with friends or strangers. No matter how you play ARMA, at the end of the day you're gonna have SOME memorable experience you can talk about... and that is ARMA's magic."
3598,Is it a nice game? yes. Am I addicted? yes. Can you commit war crimes? yes. Is my life going downward? probably.
3599,its a really good realistic mil-sim and i would recommend it to others wanting a mil sim experience.

only some people will understand this"
3604,"Arma 3, What can I say except how good! I have just ticked over 200hrs and feel as if I am barely scratching the surface of this game. The sheer amount of variety that comes with this game from the official DLC to the community scenarios and mods is just endless. If you can think up a scenario or game type or mission type then chances are it has already been made and ready for you to run. If not? you can make it yourself in the scenario editor. Hands down the best game I have come across to date and would recommend highly. Do yourself a favour and see what it is all about, you wont look back."

3624,"Arma3 is an unique type of game which today there are quite.. alot of, if you find a nice group of friends to play it with it is quite the nice experience. I've enjoyed all my hours on arma, especially with friends like Gideon, he's serious but not at the same time, if you get what I mean. Arma3 has a few downsides, and alot of goodsides to compensate for that. One thing I really wish they would add is more naval vehicles, we don't see them enough. This review is about my experience with arma and honest opinion, not some ""but, but but..."", feel free to share your thoughts on this with me."

3639,"One of the most content rich games/sim available, however it is on a dated engine. Some nitpicks: 
The weapons should have rounds in the chamber.
There should be a way to manually load magazines and repack magazines (mods fix this).
There should be emergency reloads where you drop the magazine entirely."

3655,"Pretty good game.
 Its multiplayer is where a lot of the fun is to be had but single-player scenarios are still very fun. However this game was released in 2013 and it does show its age performance wise and without its community making all the amazing mods they do i don't think the game ever would have got this far.
 If your willing to deal with shortcomings of an older game that doesn't quite run right it can be an amazing experience. Overall ide recommend this game."

3665,fun (and explosive) times with friends
3666,"pretty hardcore but fun as fuck once you get the hang of it even slightly, nothing like virtual ptsd from watching your squad die infront of you from an enemy mortar. 10/10 could be better optimised tho"
3667,"The game's a ton of fun, especially when played with friends. If you like a good coop PvE experience, I suggest trying out the ""Dynamic Bulwarks"" mod from the workshop. Like that mod, there are plenty of others who enhance the game in various ways, from improved sounds to new weapons, maps, and gear (some even from completely unrelated settings such as Warhammer 40k, Star Wars or Fallout), with the community constantly working to add more onto an already fun game. That being said, the AI is kind of janky (sometimes they just stand in place, other times they one-tap you from the other side of the map), but the settings are generally tweakable, especially with mods."

Turned off ""Auto-hover"" to see if I could fly it on my own or whether it makes much of a difference. It does. Fell out of the sky killing everyone on board. 10/10.

3732,"This game is amazing, you dont even need friends to play, my favorite gamemode is zeus as you can make the mission of your dreams and with workshop items you can make the game more intresting and fun"
3733,Very in depth military simulator. So far so good.
3734,Pistol is op
3735,"   Depending on what you use it for it can be quite fun and nice and neat. Been on this game for years just fuckin with the editor so yeah. Definitely not sucking the life out of me, what do you mean?"
3736,"Starting with the good, it's a great platform to set up intresting multiplayer games, coop or pvp, Zeus is amazing, and of course, mods!

Now with the bad. The DLCs. Some are good, some are not worth the price, some are just awful, but in general they're way too expensive, a massive ivestment to get them all, and if you dont own them and somebody, out of your control, sets up a game with them, you'll suffer game breaking popups all over your screen.

Physics are janky af, vehicles, and even movement sometimes behave like its gmod, or even worse than gmod sometimes. Destruction looks quite bad.

Sound design and gunplay sound underwhelming. Not outright bad, but just not as good as other games like squad.

Now all those are possible to overlook often, but the thing that fully kills it is: The community. Holy shit the community. Now if you just have a group of friends and play with them, you'll be fine, but most ""clans"" ""groups"" ""squads"" whatever you join are... UGH. The WORST

Not only you'll get bullied if you aren't good at the game, they'll also actually add GRIND to it. like they'll often make you get promotions and shit in their stupid group before you can actually get access to all the game's features and play different roles. It's packed full of edgy violent military wannabe LARPers that are just the most annoying kind of cringe in the universe. Also these """"""clans"""""" have this braindead annoying retarded kind of tribal mentality where they'll constantly get into drama with one another and just in general it seems like half the players of this game need to see a psychologist. I'm sure there are exceptions, but that's my experience.

Now, apart from that, the modding community is just THE WORSE. Instead of working together towards a common goal you'll get 10 mods trying to do the same thing all working independently and fighting each other, and this going extremely slow and just... So stupid. Often this competition is linked to the same kind of shitty ""clan"" mentality they've got since sometimes mods will be attached to a specific clan, officially or unofficially. Hell! Some clans just play with private mods they make and don't release! Just overall, AWFUL community.

Maybe if i'd been more lucky with who i got to play with my review of this game would be positive but as it stands, I cannot say, ultimately, I had much fun with it, or that I see myself coming back to it anytime soon"

3743,"in many occasions where i want to play the game i see that 70% of the servers are empty and the servers with players has insanely high ping and some servers you cant join because some kind of file is missing

when it comes to gameplay its alot more fun with friends if you dont have any like well thats a problem but that dosent mean you cant make friends with people in the server that your playing with if they reply anyway"
3744,Only game I've played so far which i had to run for hours only to get shot once from over a Km great game still playing often

3753,"The game itself is very fun and engaging when are not getting team killed. The game took awhile to actually get into. The controls are many and my brainpower is few; I can fly a chopper, but I can't land. My only gripe is trying to make it so your friends can join in on the co-op campaign as Bohemia still thinks its 1995. The game is enjoyable if you find the right people in the right mindset to enjoy the game. The tutorial could have been made a bit more clear than it was put out to be. The soundtrack slaps. The VR Training is very useful if you are new and would like to try to learn the basics and a few niches. Anything goes in Arma 3 a game made in 2013."
3754,"*If you just wanna the overall, just skip until you found the OVERALL section.

What's good in the game
- Mod/Steam Workshop Support
- Sound Effects to weapons, and armaments.
- Extensive, yet awesome Post-Launch content.
- Interesting story/lore.
- Amazing Weapons (Base + DLC)
- Multiple Large Terrains

What's Suck on the game
-Bad Optimization/Performance
-Braindead/Stupid AI


OVERALL

This game is overall fun and expansive, but it's plagued with a horrible performance/optimization and a stupid/braindead AI, especially during a firefight. But that can be compensated for the meantime if you find yourself in a mp community/doing solo on campaign/custom content that are available on the Steam Workshop.

Final Score: 8.5/10"
3755,tbh visually a great game but plays like a hammer to the head and have never bean more confused in my life during the tutorial

3759,"Gets one shot out of heli from AI, 5k away. FUCKING GREAT GAME"
3760,Great game to play with a group of buddies. Take turns being Zeus controller and you make missions that your squad carries out. We just implemented the use of a radio operator that controls fire support using one of the added mod modules. It makes for a really great experience and the AIs are very perceptive and adaptive to the situations. I highly recommend this game!
3761,Very great game!

3765,"AMAZING game. Be patient...this is not Battlefield or Call of Duty. While I enjoy those games for what they are, first person shooters, ARMA is a military sim. I have played since Operation Flashpoint and no game has continued to provide the years of enjoyment as OFP and ARMA."

3789,very fun game
3790,"Arma 3 is a difficult game to talk about. The vanilla offering, even with DLC is quite mediocre, but certainly worth the price so I can recommend it on that level, but when you buy Arma 3, what you're really investing in is a platform; consider this the G-Mod of tactical shooters. It's a blank slate, a chaotic playground for you and your friends to mess around with hundreds of mods, all tied together with complex ballistics, huge maps, a rich community and an endless supply of mission generators and milsim groups to get you out on the field.

It isn't terribly important, but the overarching setting for Arma 3 is the year 2035, with the CSAT alliance of China and Iran making up the featured antagonist for this entry, however PMC groups and other NATO adversaries like the Russian Federation or the fictional Altis will make regular appearances both in Bohemia Interactive's content and beyond. I wouldn't call the game futuristic as such, but there is a pretty nice helping of fictional firearms, vehicles and equipment if that appeals to you.

Arma 3 is often slow-paced and can be brutally difficult. Unless you have a great deal of experience in the game, one combatant is easily enough to kill you, so taking on groups of enemies without allies is a fruitless endeavour. Firearms function (for the most part) with a high degree of realism. Wind, distance, drop, calibre and penetration are all things you will have to consider while fighting, as well as keeping track of how many shots you have left per-magazine. This goes for vehicles too, where sharp turns in jets will spark you out, and the wrong launcher rounds will not take out a tank no matter how hard you try.

I'll wrap this up by saying that Arma 3 is a very personal game, your experience depends on who, and what you play with, regardless there is something here for everyone."
3791,Arma 3 frames per second.
3792,Amazing RP servers on it
3793,"""Realistic"""
3794,"This is the game I've always wanted, yet never knew just how much I wanted it.   A++,  10/10, 5 Stars!  It's got everything you could ever want.  Deeply strategic and tactical, run n' gun, large battles, stealth missions.... choose your battleground, sea, air or land.   Maybe you want to just mix it up for a mission.   Given the library of mods, the game has endless possibilities.  Number 1 game of all time in my opinion!"
3795,pog
3796,it good
3797,"Definitely a good game BUT, if you're looking to play with friends, Arma 3 multiplayer is not easy to set up with all that port forwarding and stuff. Wish there could just be an ""invite via steam"" button."

For the best experience playing this game, find a unit or clan to play with online. There is so much you can create and do in this game it amazes me. I have almost 1,500 hours at the time of this review and I know that I can still get at least another 1,000 hours out of it playing with friends."
3800,Best Millitary Sandbox Ever.
3801,gg
3802,Zafir Gaming!
3803,Too complex and sweaty
3804,Remember to close your launcher before going to bed.
3805,"Been playing A3 since 2015, safe to say this is hands down one of my favourite milsim shooters. Saw a scene in a war movie and want to re-enact it? Do it in A3. Saw that clip on youtube with the A-10 providing support for infantry on the ground? Do it again on A3. Solo or with a group of friends, you will have fun. Mods make the creativity limitless. Go back in time, stay in the present generation or even go into the future. A3 can do it all. Just buy it! 10/10."
3806,"I love this game so much.  When I look at how many hours I have on it I always consider playing something else.  But something always draws me back.  This game has allowed me to make so many memories with all the different things that could happen.  I appreciate this games campaign as well.  It took me a while to figure out the story and all the complex parts.  But when I did put time and consideration into it my appreciation for it skyrocketed.  The controls for this game are complex and take some practice but when you do figure it out it makes the experience much better.

This games community has always been in my opinion one of the best parts about it.  I have met countless people through this game that I have had much fun with.  It always makes me happy when I first meet someone new in the game.  I have a special love for the people that use this game for art. Some of the pictures I've seen of this game amaze me with how much effort was put into it.  This games lot of DLC's are very fun.  Especially the S.O.G Prairie Fire DLC it is so well made.  Although the DLC's are so much fun another incredible thing about this game is the mods.  The mods for this game make it what it is.  The diversity of it is incredible.  They are so easy to install; for example, it takes 4 minutes and I could have Darth Vader be fighting the bugs from Starship Troopers.  The mods of the game are incredible.

My final message of the game is that this is simply one of the greatest games I have ever played.  I will continue to play this game with countless hours of fun.  Then when or if Arma 4 is released I will move on and keep playing another game from one of my favorite game series ever.  I love this game"
3807,"if you wanna have fun, do it with friends."
3808,"Great community, at least the servers I play on are. Game still has bugs, but overall, this game is great! Towns are so big and so many angles, it takes some time just to memorize an area in town."
3809,retarded
3810,"If you're reading this, you're already down the rabbit hole. Just get the game. Infinite hours of fresh gameplay, amazing modding community."
3811,"The base game is great in a challenging way, forcing you to think of most things very stragicly. very fun solo but really stands out as a fun time with friends working and communicating as a squad"
3812,"Yo dawgs, its YE boy TIM. This game is fye af no cap. 69/10 would reccomend. Ive played around 69 hours and its pretty aight. I bought this game for my 69 year old granmama bc she in the military my granmama said it was fyre no cap. She got a ptsd attack from playing but thats good because the game is realistic. One issue with da game is dat it wont let me pick a black character this really got me and my homeboys HEATED. I think arma studios gotta make a BLM collab. Other than that the game is fyre no cap would reccomend."
3813,Arma 3 is a great game. 10/10 would get shot down by a Phalanx CIWS again
3814,i love this game. It is extremely immersive. Gather your friends and give it a try.
3815,"too complicated, runs poorly, bad optimization"
3816,"If you're looking for hardcore battlefield keep looking, but if you want the best mil sim on the market currently. This games for you."
3817,dis game is ching chang chong ok
3818,You ever hop on here just to commit war crimes? Me neither. Unless....
3819,"This is an amazing game for anyone who like milsim and chaos. Your imagination is the limit in the eden editor and the multiplayer servers are always loads of fun (when they're full). The campaigns are great as well and there is plenty in the workshop for replay-ability. 

I wish arma 4 would come out already but, until then, here I am."
3820,"Great option for MILSIM WITH the right mods, it is a good inmersive experience with your mates. DONT recommend it for SOLO playing."
3821,Pretty realistic. Good fun if you got mates to play with
3822,My intenet is so dogshit that I have 10 ours on a game just because i dwonloaded 2 many mods
3823,"It's very fun, considering it's similar to the COD franchise. As you can go on stealth mission, loud missions, special operations, etc."
3824,it is a game.
3825,great fun
3826,love it
3827,makes me schizo
3828,very cool game
3829,Do you like committing horrific war crimes? Do you like vehicles with awful physics? Have you ever wanted to engage in a gunfight with your framerate in the single digits? Do you enjoy having a mod folder almost as large as the base game? Well I know I do! Pick up ArmA 3 today and experience murdering civilians with military grade weaponry and rigging ambulances with C4's and detonating it into middle eastern forces!
3830,"Hard to get into it, controls poorly set up. 
Spent more time waiting at HQ than doing anything else.
Slow movement/clunky, zero enemy flinching when shot.
Connecting with friends took far to long, just not something i could get into after hours of trying."
3831,"This game is so amazingly broken that its workshop dlc can be mistake by other games in progress as THEIR workshop dlc, and the reviews are so broken that steam thinks my FRIENDS reviews are MY reviews.

Truly a labor of love don't forget to vote!

edit: Despite having 400+ hours in this game, steam has asked if I would like to revise my opinion after a mere 10 extra hours. I cannot help but laugh. Don't get this unless you have the dedication to learn it and mod it lol. It is a cursed game and hilarious to watch us fools play, however."
3832,very good and sus
3833,This game never dies!
3834,.
3835,"
Ha ha ha suv make the ifrit go airplane"
3836,Bread
3837,Worth the purchase. Several hours well spent 10/10
3838,"Awful game many unfree  dlcs are needed to play this game and it certainly gets boring, its very hard to get used to an old layout and loading into games was very strange, unless you want to spend 10s of pounds on dlcs be my guest, however the graphics certainly arent the best (yes i know the games 8 years old) in normal matches it is very hard to spot enemys and overrall this game bcomes very awful, only purchase if the game is on offer for only 2 pounds
"
3839,"The most in depth game in history! My new love, You could play this game for 5 years and still not do everything!!!!!!!!"
3840,As a long time player. I always find myself being drawn back to this buggy at times gem of a game. Better played with friends.
3841,"this game is really good the graphics are okay but thats not the important part the important part is that this game is CRAZY milsim and stuff so yeah defintley recommend
"
3842,"oh no
"
3843,10/10
3844,The best!
3845,"After playing this game for 72h I still feel like I know only 10% of it, in reality I think i only know like 0.01% of it. There are so many mechanics, mods, servers, communities, what I can't tell how much I know of it since there is always something new. As long as you like military, you will like Arma. However, starting is hard, bc finding a server with gametypes you like can be hard. But once you do, I'm sure even a COD player will find this game awesome!!! And if you don't find the game realistic enough, then search no more, just install the mod ace3, and then tell me if it's still unrealistic!!!"
3846,Warcrime simulator
3847,very realistic military simulator but controls are very hard to navigate
3848,Best Modding game
3849,king of hill
3850,yes
3851,"One of the best real war simulator

Great gameplay, great realism, but for those who are just entering the FPS genre on PC, this might not be the best choice. I would suggest Call of Duty, Halo or Battlefield, as they aren't as complex, as you don't have to calculated bullet drop, wind speed, and distance to be able to use a sniper at long range.

3860,Best Military Sim and the mods and content creator makes it even better.
3861,"A game with endless possibilities thanks to the ENORMOUS amount of mods and the scenario editor. I mean if you don't play this game more than 200h you haven't even tried 1/10 of what Arma offer. I know that because I have played this game for 1,300h and I still have thing to do and discover"
3862,Lots of fun.  I'm sure I'll get to the campaign eventually... Right?
3863,jews are pretty weird and you get this game.
3864,"If you've ever wanted to DM a modern battlefield this game has it. The mods are unbelievably expansive 40k, WW2 anything you can think of this game probably has a mod for it. For an 8  year old game this game is still hella fun."
3865,"Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.

The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.

The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.

Thanks for making such a great game"
3866,it's alright i guess.
3867,"This game is really realistic,immersive and fun. would recommend"
3868,"If you're having a hard time with this game, try to find a unit online. They'll show you the ropes. Good luck!"
3869,"its kinda ok

find someone that makes missions, and friends that want to play them.

enjoy the next 500 hours"
3870,"

3871,"love letter to mil-sim. 
gmod of mil-sim.
magnum opus of mil-sim.

3872,video game
3873,my god does it take a while to shoot someone
3874,litterally love this game needs some type of in depth guick play function but thats it
3875,its alright i guess
3876,"Arma 3 is a Simulator game where you can create whatever you want with mods I highly recommend.
The Tactical game with a lot of variation of military items and equipment, Better to play with friends or form a group With people they met in the game. with many mods and Game Mode that are also in the old ones, The best known Battle Royale, which started in ARMA 2."
3877,"Overall it is a good game with good gun-play. But 2 things need to be taken into account if you want to buy this game: 1. this is not cod, you cannot jump into a room full of guys and win. 2. when you get to the mission, ""death valley,"" find a guide and write that shit down because that mission alone took me 45 minutes to figure out how to get the drone to work. Other missions have issues but this one took the cake.

IN CONCLUSION: OVERALL A VERY GOOD GAME BUT MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT DIFFICULTY FOR YOUR SKILL AND THAT YOU ARE PATIENT."
3878,"Scale of the simulation is all that matters. Clunky engine when comes to vehicles, bouncy and unstable."
3879,"Its almost fully realistic and its really fun
"
3880,GOODGAME
3881,"yeah this game pretty cool ngl i enjoy roleplaying as a man with RPG that is currently going through their 15th divorce on antistasi and blowing up NATO

on top of this you will be shot and killed before you can see where the enemy is

anyway i can pretend my fatass is in the army its pretty cool"
3882,"This game is incredibly immersive and very damn hard to learn and play, but once you get the hang of it, it's amazing how realistic a game can be."
3883,Still amazing years later
3884,Hands down best mil sim sandbox still playing in 2021
3885,very imersive
3886,"10/10 great game, has aged far better than GTA V. Great fun with friends. Exile FTW"

It still gets support, it has enough content and mods to fill any pc's storage, the player count is only growing, and it is almost always on sale, buy it."

3899,good game just pick it up on sale
3900,"This game is still god in late 2021. A new Arma game would be good, due to the graphics engine being too weak for the extremely ambitious project of Bohemia Interactive, but overall it is still amazing for being this old.
Graphics are decent, optimization is dogshit, very CPU based and overloads one core. Gameplay is decent, but gets amazing once you use mods. the campaing is really fun, super replayable.

3920,it may cause a divorce but its worth it 10/10
3921,I feel this game Is great when you play with DLC but the DLC is very expensive so i personally recommend to get arma at a discount not full price. PS you need mods as well the base is fun but gets dull after a while so use the steam workshop

3937,"681 hours logged at the time of this review, and I still crave more. Some things that I have really enjoyed doing in this game:

Downloading a map of Manhattan, spawning myself and a tank onto a building roof and driving off of it. 

Putting a static platform 5k meters in the air and spawning on it to try to start a mission by skydiving. 

Spawning 20 NPCs in the air at the start of the mission and skydiving down with them - no one had parachutes. 

Finding a way to cause chaos, destruction and death in the showcase missions without triggering a mission fail for friendly fire and having it actually work. 

Placing 50 empty vehicles on a runway, spawning a plane with infinite ammo to practice bombing runs. 

Trying to fly the speed of sound four inches from the ground. 

Trying to make a hill defense mission in the remains of a hill top castle. 

Renting a private server to play custom missions with my brother. 

I have enjoyed manyof the campaign missions, had a ton of fun on various multiplayer servers and spent at least a hundred hours in the editor. The learning curve is steep, the keybindings can be ridiculous, but it has been a rewarding experience, with a lot of rich content out there to be experienced. Highly recommended.

4011,"This review comes from somebody who majorly plays unmodded; spending most of their time in the 3DEN editor, and little bit in the official Warlords gamemode.

[h1] Infantry gameplay [/h1]
If you plan on hopping in any common official server, it's more than likely you're going to be playing infantry most of the time. There's a countless amount of oddities, such as
* Walking crouched with a primary weapon, you have almost no movement sway with your weapon, except the occasional bump, but only when walking forward-right.
* Sidearm sway can only be negated when moving very slowly or standing still.
* Standing with a rocket launcher gives you less sway than when crouched.
* Sprinting speed is affected by your equipped item; fastest run speed is in the order of unarmed > binoculars > sidearm > primary > launcher.
* Unarmed stance can only be achieved by having nothing equipped or by going prone while holding a launcher; unarmed crouch sprinting is the fastest way to travel as infantry.
* Trying to mount certain ladders is metaphorically painful.
* Switching and reloading weapons can feel really awkward at times.
* There are some timegated mechanics that you can stack for an advantage (reload then heal, reload then mount ladder), but not the other way around.

[h1] DLC [/h1]
It's not too intrusive, but for when it does show, DLC markings are very inconsistent within the editor and arsenal. A few examples being
* Karts DLC items are not marked as DLC items in the arsenal, but are in the editor.
* Equipment and clothes from various DLCs are marked as DLC, but only some items require ownership.
* Reskins of vanilla weapons and attachments that are marked as DLC typically do not require DLC ownership.
* Being able to situationally use DLC equipment without owning a DLC as a try-before-you-buy thing is nice, but having the player learn what items do and don't require ownership through trial-and-error isn't intuitive.

[h1] Hidden/unused content [/h1]
There is a load of unused content in the official game, such as uniform/vehicle reskins that requires unusual techniques to access, such as using the setObjectTexture commands in the editor. There are also props that you can only access using the createVehicle command, such as foliage props and pieces of large buildings.

[h1] Vehicle gameplay [/h1]
There's a sizeable variety of vehicle gameplay. Submarines, boats, karts, quadbikes, cars, APCs, MBTs, helicopters, and jets, and it mostly feels pretty solid.
Unfortunately for submarines, there's only one, and it's not very enjoyable.
All water vehicles, even aquatic APCs while in the water, suffer a bug that makes them go in a direction indefinitely if the driver changes seats or dies while holding forward/backwards.
Small land vehicles are extremely delicate, quadbike, car, or truck, you'll probably learn that driving through a few bushes will harm you very quickly.
Armored vehicles have no issue knocking over bushes, and even fences, at low speeds.

[h1] Multiplayer UI [/h1]
The chatbox feels old and clunky with no way to filter chat channels.
This is a generally a gripe of mine because I may not want to see server messages (Player is connecting, player connects using modified data, player forced respawn, etc.) or the global chat channel of a server, which usually ends up being two teams mocking eachother.

The playerlist is only sorted alphabetically. No way to sort by team or join order.

Muting players only affects their voice activity, and the ""mute all"" button only mutes players currently on the server for you.
If a new person joins and starts screeching into the mic, you have to open the player menu again to mute them. My current workaround is to just have the voice-over-network audio option turned all the way down.

Hackers/exploits exist.
I can only remember one encounter with what I'm assuming is a hacker. They did something that just rapidly played a honking noise that disregarded my volume settings. It's wasn't voice activity; I had that way down at the time, and muting all players on the server didn't solve it.

[h1] Character management [/h1]
You get to pick your face and some facewear. Usually doesn't even matter, though, unless you're a tryhard that refuses to use anything other than the stealth balaclava. The preview is bugged and won't show reskins properly.
You can upload a custom face, but a server has to allow it, or else you'll like Mr. Clean dipped his head in a vat of bleach.

Overall it's kind of okay, but not something I'd recommend to others."

4022,"Over 2.3K hours in the game and still loving it. Has bugs but is easily the best sandbox game out there. The single player campaign is engaging and challenging as well as a good way to get started with complex operations or understand of weapons and vehicles. I would recommend KingOfTheHill servers for a quick plug in and fire shooter and hours of fun. Or find a DayZ mod such as epoch and make some friend or bring them with for zombie, base building, raids, and survival.

There really is endless possibilities with Arma 3. There is an abundance of sales for the game so no reason not to at least add it to your wish list. I have started many friendships from playing the game as well as endless hours of fun and look forward to the more to come."

4029,incredible. I got told 'hands up or die' within 2 minutes of playing altis life. This happened 15 times until i got fed up of being shot by a firing squad and refunded.

But yes I would definetly recommend.

4081,"Arma 3, is the ultimate soldier simulator.
Because it offers a player just about any situation, any area the player wants to work in, explore or die in!
Ground soldiers, vehicles, armor, aircraft...  Not much is missing.  You have so many options just for boots on the ground.  So many weapons and options on those.  And you can be the friend or foe.
Maps are usually complex and full of variations, from potential cover, (for both sides), to civilians, to zombies...  What more would you want in a simulation?"

4109,"Its starts with you buying it on a sale because you want another shooter, find out that its not that kind of a shooter and stop playing it for 3 months minimum. Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity. Then somebody comes over and says, you wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome (Spoiler: Its not) and you want to play with a more organized group.

When you wake up, you have spent 4 years playing with the same group of people, while having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week. You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up all the 58+ mods you are using 1 hour before your operations...

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6 times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

ARMA is everything and nothing and I cant recommend it enough."

4134,"This is a very good and entertaining game to play with friends or when you are bored. I would 100% suggest this game to a friend. 
When I first purchased Arma 3, I didn't expect much but when I first entered the game and witnessed the amount of different opportunities within the game, I was stunned. There is so much you can do within this game and it is very entertaining and you can really do whatever your mind is thinking.
Another thing that I love about this game is that you can easily access mods that you can use within the game itself which just help to improve the players experience while playing the game.

Sincerely,
Boris Johnson"

4146,"Great military sandbox(there are campaigns too) complex scenario editor, enormous mod community, healthy server list even 8 years later. 9/10. Controls are clunky at first and desync/collision can get real wonky at times. Deserves a spot on every top-10 games list, not really anything else like Arma."
4147,This is a fun game the singleplayer is decent but you have to play with mods and an arma unit (https://www.reddit.com/r/FindAUnit/) to get the true experience.
4148,"I'm really torn on this game. I *love* the idea of it and it's actually pretty well done overall. Great graphics given how old it is and it's definitely one of the more satisfying FPS games. I even loved the first episode of the campaign. But I got to the second episode where you have to control the AI and it's absolutely terrible. It's game-breakingly bad. Not only do I not want to control the AI and I'm forced to, but they're also idiots. 

Your AI units are just utter morons and the control system is one of the most unnecessarily difficult and overly-complicated things I've ever seen in the history of games. You have a couple of seconds to set your units up and give them all commands, yet you find yourself cycling through endless, unnecessary commands. ""Crouch, not fully crouched, but not half standing crouch, yeah, that's the right sort of crouch"". I'm not exaggerating. There's about 3 or 4 different levels of 'crouch'. Then you've got to control each person individually, because they can't just do what should be common sense to anyone with even the minutia of experience of combat. Tell them to hold fire and they wont fire at all. Even if they're getting shot at from point blank. 

It's a shame, but their idiocy has legitimately ruined my experience so far. I'm hoping to play some multiplayer because it sounds fun with people that aren't idiots like the AI, but I haven't yet, so I can't comment on that.

What I can say though is that it's ruined the campaign for me. After my 5th attempt at the 2nd episode mission, it annoyed me so much I rage quit and uninstalled the game."

4156,Good game
4157,PTSD Simulator
4158,Great Milsim. Wonderful experience playing with friends!
4159,Good enough
4160,Warcrimes.
4161,"Just wait for Arma 4, trust me"
4162,good game to play with friends
4163,this game is not like any other first person shooter. its a spot on war-battle simulator.
4164,A good military simulation game in my opinion. The steam workshop is also one of the best parts of this game.
4165,"Pretty good game, if youre into MilSim and a more realistic approach of weapon handling"
4166,"Very realistic, very tough, very fun. This is war!"
4167,Ok Dokey
4168,love it
4169,shooting game good. war crimes cool. 10/10
4170,Fun to play
4171,"Configurations and controls by default suck. Spent over 2h to try to fix some things, still unplayable at all. I will see into that later..."
4172,Good
4173,fun shooting
4174,"No tutorial, confusing, don't know what the hell I'm doing. Gameplay itself is a meh, not a great shooter. I could see why some people would like it but this isn't my cup of tea. Buy this on a 75% off sale, any more that then you're better of burning your money."
4175,too good
4176,pretty lit lots of workshop mods fun game
4177,"Good

4180,Awesome
4181,good
4182,King of The Hill is the best
4183,"One of the BEST Military Sim
Simple and Straight......"
4184,good game
4185,Amazing with the amount of mods and extra content out there.
4186,"The game itself is pretty complicated to get in hands, the DLCs are pretty nice and I recommend to get them as it spices up your game and offers a lot of different possibilities."
4187,Lots of different game types to play and when you add mods from workshop its like hole new game again still its arma :p glitches are to be expected also don't expect to have 60 fps XD but all thing considered its lots fun whit friends.
4188,"360+ Hours and still love the game, thanks to the community creating mods for us to play, the fun and operations basically never end"
4189,"From Operation Flashpoint GOTY (Not to be confused with Dragon Rising), to ARMA, I just love these games, They have so much playability value. My two favourite genres are FPS and RTS, these games have both. They're also a simulator. Whats not to love about these games.

I look forward to any new incarnations
I still play Operation Flashpoint GOTY occasionally, that's how much of a gem these games are"
4190,Yes very war crimes.
4191,leg
4192,Decent game
4193,too much dlc
4194,"Is yes game, very yes"
4195,Great game to play with friends and witnessing (and participating!) in various war crimes!
4196,.
4197,Super fun! Plenty of stuff to do even with just the vanilla game. I recommend getting it on sale because everything is super cheap.
4198,"Honestly, with all the love and care put into this game, it's surprising that more people don't get into it. It's a fun and well thought out Milsim Shooter, and at times it has given me faux PTSD. Love it to bits."
4199,very realistic game if you have mods
4200,Finally I can commit [b]War Crimes[/b] without the UN sending me an annoying complaint letter.
4201,well - ArmA3
4202,Great Game !
4203,thats crazy but anybody know what the current grid reference is?
4204,Thank you
4205,"This game can be old but its still a piece of art.
It takes their DLC and gameplays to an whole different level.
We can fight aliens, we can discover the island of Livonia, make our own military base in editor mode.
This is the type oof game than is very difficult to see in nowadays.
"
4206,"The game is a hardcore milsim 8yearold piece of shite. the gunplay sucks, my pc can't handle it and I do recomend it. I can't wait for the next one. but the miltiplayer is a bit anoying seeing as getting the real milsim experience from the videos you see is basically imposible if you are not in a big clan or ""UNIT"". if you want to buy this game because of a youtuber don't. but it can be fun at times. primarily in the ZEUS gamemode."
4207,Very fun game
4208,"I have been playing this for 820 hours and I can safely 
say that this game is very clunky and the performance is very bad, BUT!!
I must recommend this game
this game is one of the best experiences  I have played, you can do so many things,
you can make your own missions, you can script and edit, so many mods you can use
you can even play this offline lan ( I specially love that feature, its very important for me)
100/10 buy it !!!
"
4209,war crimes have never been easier 10/10
4210,"There are no good Arma 3 players. Only bad or worse.

There comes a point in every man or woman's life when they must grow up and be an adult. This is the gateway into that process. It reveals a very ugly truth however. Being an adult, with responsibility's is garbage. You just suck all the time. Everyone is somehow better than you as well. They, themselves are bad, but you are worse.

Now the game. Call of duty, This game is not. Battlefield this is not. This is where you decide on if you want to play a realistic game or play a kind of goofy game like the former listed titles. I highly recommend this game. I've cried over this. I've shouted over this. I've been sexually confused over this. I have been a stronger man because of it. Terrible Arma player but stronger man."
4211,I have wasted way too much time playing this

4213,I'm still new to this game and I don't know shit but the gameplay is nice
4214,"I like this game much better than any first person shooter I have played before. The number of roles you can take part in is difficult to properly describe. It can be a little intimidating at first, but mostly good sports play and will point you in right direction. If you are considering Arma 3, I say go for it, so much is offered by this game easy to get into playing."
4215,"This is both the best and worst game of all time. My addiction to modding it is very severe. I have spent 150 hours playing in the editor only. Editor --> Select the map --> Add Zeus modules --> Fool around with mods for several hours --> Repeat. The performance ranges from slide show level to a somewhat playable experience, but the amount of variety, complexity, and immersion brought by mods is so freaking good. It is probably the best 7.5 USD that I have spent in my life. It was even useful in real life projects... If they ever make Arma 4, it better run well or I'm gonna commit several war crimes against the civilian population of Altis, Stratis, and Tanoa. This is a threat."
4216,war!!!1!!!!
4217,"You spend more time trying to figure out the game than playing it. When you finally figure out how to play it, you realize it sucks because of its detail. Great for people disqualified at MEPS."

4239,"The scale of your world is a bit unrealistic, but.....you have gone so much further than any other competitor has done.

Your air to ground weapons are hopeless borked. If real life aircraft weapon systems responded like yours does air to ground warfare would be next to impossible. 

That being said, you are the greatest at what you do, and you left that up to the modders to figure out. Come on...put out a DLC or something that fixes it. I will buy it out desperation."
4240,"I love this game. I haven't played nearly as much as the other people in these reviews, but I love this game. 51 hours in and I'm happy as a clam. There are some things I would like to point out (even as a fairly inexperienced player):

Pros: 
Really, REALLY Good tactical shooter. Feels like you are immersed in the game. 

Good gunplay, I'd wager better than most games I've played. 

Really great emphasis on team communication (more on that later) 

Most people say this game isn't beginner friendly, but by 10 hours I was making maps for me and my friends to play on our own, and knew all of the controls decently well. 

Great online community (albeit sometimes toxic, as with any online community) but you can find some really great servers and the game still has active servers by the developers to play on, 8 years after the game came out! 

I personally really love the vehicle selection, especially with easy-to-download mods, it's a blast.

Cons: 
While there is an emphasis on team communication, if one of your team mates sucks at communicating or just isn't very friendly, it ruins that game. You get into this negative feedback loop of wanting to quit because of this teammate but you can't because if you do that you jeopardize the mission. If you mute the, you miss important callouts and stuff too. This isn't a huge problem all the time, but it can be a glaring issue when it pops up. 

Toxic online communities seriously suck. I hate getting into a match and seeing slurs in the chat or hearing them on radio. I also see offensive server names from time to time, which really sucks. Wish I could report those. 

Finally, this game is 8 years old. It's got flaws, and while most of them can be overlooked, it would be nice if Arma 4 or a comprehensive patch to this game came out in the near future. 

Thanks for reading! :)

ARMA3 is love, ARMA3 IS LIFE!"
4263,"Still good, new dlc nice"
4264,cool
4265,"One of the best purchases for video games i ever made. While yes the engine is a little bit buggy at times, this game is by far one the best wartime simulators around. Arma 3 has provided me with many hours of enjoyment either playing single player or multiplayer. The editor is a fun, great and enjoyable tool with many possibilities. This game has pretty much infinite play ability due to the modding community and the Steam Workshop. I can go on forever with many positives...

In Short:
Buy Arma 3"

4318,"It is getting a bit old but this is one of those games that you always come back to play again. Ive realised that after playing it on your own for a while that it is more entertaining and enjoyable to play the game with friends. 

I still recommend getting it, it is a good game."
4319,i like it
4320,"This is the type of game that makes you think:

""Why all these different buttons just for one thing done slightly differently?""

Then you spend another two hours.... oh well already 3 AM.... with the game and realize that you might not wanna go without this complexity again.

Arma 3 is realistic, painstakingly hard at times, ultracomplex and will leave you with content for everyone, for ever.

And if the content that you like doesn't exist yet, make your own.

Absolute must play."
4321,Cool game with huge customizability options. Note that if you have a low end computer you will struggle to run this game well and will need to find loads of mods to get a stable framerate. I would recommend at least a i5 9th gen and a gtx 1660 to run the game at high graphics (not ultra) at 60fps

4339,"game crashes every hour, cant play this game"
4340,"Still getting updates 8 years later and still has a massive community.
Is a good time"

4357,Its good.
4358,very good
4359,Good range of options and a great mods.
4360,geneva convention? more like geneva suggestion
4361,I  recommend this game !     :)
4362,i liek
4363,well pretty hard but fun to play
4364,cool game with friends
4365,It's alright
4366,veri noice geim
4367,"very pog.

Game has guns and people with realistic systems and thingys

game no have jumping"
4368,One of the best load in and create a plot military games I've ever played.
4369,I like this product
4370,"I've played this game like three days and actually i'm addicted.
Most likely i play with mods and in the popular servers.
I highly recommend this game for those who like realistic war games or something like that or with mods like dayz or something. But yeah, give it a try and let's see if you can survive!"
4371,Nice
4372,game fun dlc needed
4373,it ok.
4374,Best MP game
4375,fantastic
4376,It cool.
4377,"Even with all the years Arma 3 has, is still the best Milsim out there"
4378,Great game. Many hour of fun
4379,"pretty good, but sadly you cant play with your friends with your exact mods unless you open a server, which i tried but failed with

moral of the story
pretty fun
add something like the gmod join thing pls
"
4380,"The campaign story is good, the first few missions suck and the ai really sucks but it can be made easier, other than that the game is kinda good."
4381,"Great game, just requires some time to become good."
4382,arma 3
4383,dont play altis life the admins are so fucking stupid and everyone just screams rdm whenever you kill them no matter what
4384,hahahahahha ba ba boey
4385,"Be prepared for a Arma 3 menu that is totally non intuitive when you throw down money for DLC add ons.  Then, set some time aside to search for support."
4386,well the mouse cursor didnt work properly and i realized that maye my computer wasnt strong enough for the game and multiplayer didnt work right for me.. but if you have a good computer i definitely recommend this game to you
4387,w
4388,gud game. give it a try
4389,AWSOME!!!!!
4390,Sit and camp in the zone
4391,war crimes
4392,It's 2021 and I still don't know what the optimal graphic settings are for this game while running a i7 9700K and a 3070.
4393,Best sandbox game ever. Mods make it better. Bohemia tries to kill it with DLC that is made by the modding community but the gamer's stand strong.
4394,"it's a magic game, the realistic stuff and the mechanics is soo immersive. And you can't get bored with the new content in the workshop"
4395,yes really good
4396,SICK GAME!
4397,love it with friends
4398,One of the best if the not the best military games on steam.
4399,Arma 3 is such a good game everything in this game is perfect the two maps are massive and beautiful people should repopulate this game not that is isn‚Äôt populated but people should start playing this game more. There is so much to do in Arma 3 I love it.
4400,"very fun game with pals, also great for nerdy mil sim ppl, 10/10"
4401,i like sometimes
4402,lol
4403,Arma go brrrrr
4404,"The best military simulator there is right now, this game has aged well since it is from 2013, but the community is still active 24/7 and with many servers."
4405,It's pretty decent
4406,so bad
4407,"Coming on to nearly 3000 hours on this game and coming from ARMA 2 i can say that this game has never disappointed me. I will always have a place for this game and come back to play. I 100% recommend buying this if you haven't already.

There is a wide variety of game modes and it has so many more opportunities with creators being able to create mods and their own skins."
4408,This game is really good for realism if you join a unit within the game to play modded
4409,"Best sandbox military simulation game, with alot of stuff for every scenario you can imagine."
4410,best game ever big ups outputgaming
4411,It takes a while to get used to.
4412,Great game. Kinda sums it up.
4413,much milsim very many fun
4414,One of the best games ever made.
4415,i love the survival modes
4416,"great sniping fellas
"
4417,Bicycle OP
4418,good game
4419,good
4420,"Ok, changed heaps from when I brought it though."
4421,"I love this game, the modding potential alone keeps me coming back!"
4422,Very fun and realistic military sim. More mods than you could every play. So many communities to play with too.
4423,Great game. But 1 warning if a new version comes out you may lose all progress for everything. ( I do not play online so I am only speaking from a offline single player experience). I still recommend it because this is not a frequent thing and to be blunt I just like it enough to re-do everything all over again. This game is loved greatly by many for many reasons. If you're looking for Call of Duty then go get that this is not what you want. If you looking for a game that might take you 6 hours to take out one target with a knife and get out of the location without being noticed then this might be for you ( 6 hours is a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point).
4424,"Good thing go pew pew and boom, what more to ask."
4425,Very Fun game.
4426,Honestly have no clue why I own this game.
4427,So many hours
4428,"After so Long still a good game, love the latest updates except that one CDLC (Iron Curtain). But overall still good I hope bohemia is pushing for Arma 4."
4429,"Arma 3, i would say is one of the, (if not the), best military-simulator out there. It has came so far since its release. The vanilla experience is great, but once you add mods into the mix, it makes it 10X better. Overall an phenomenal experience.

"
4430,"I swear to christ, i play escape with my friends. We do well, get to airport, NO AA GUNS. We get in chopper and start flying.

BANG BANG BANG.

4 hours gone, helicopter down and a screaming 13 year old irish kid.

10/10 would reccomend"
4431,"one of the best mod supported games out there, the Devs also supports the mod community making the game really fun with how many options you have from mods and other aspects involved in the game."
4432,War Crime Simulator 2021
4433,it pew pew good
4434,"The jank is real. The modders are solid. The average Arma III soldier is a shaky-handed asthmatic.

Fully enjoyable game and community.

50% bought this because of SovietWomble's Bullshitteries, but it ended up being right up my alley."
4435,"good game, much fun"
4436,"This is not like any other game out there. Honestly, it's not a game, it's a simulator. Whether you want a sandbox for MILSIM, 40k, Halo, whatever, ArmA 3 and more importantly the modding community delivers. Sure, BI has done a lot for ArmA. The 3d editor 3den is perhaps the single greatest accomplishment in PC gaming. But the really great thing about ArmA is what the modding community has contributed. I give ArmA 3 a 7/10 on it's own. The community brings it to a 9/10. (10/10 will happen if we get a core engine upgrade *glares at DayZ*)"
4437,"Is it clunky and rough around the edges?

Yes.

But this is hands down my most played game of all time and probably the game I've gotten the most enjoyment out of in terms of online multiplayer.

Buy it, you won't regret it."
4438,Find a unit. Its good.
4439,It's like battlefield but better
4440,"if you buy this game, be ready to put many hours of your life into it. Should that be playing with others in multiplayer, or experimenting in the in game editor. Either way, This game proposes hours of endless fun and immersion."
4441,"I played Ring around the rosie with an enemy tank around a shack,
10/10
spoiler,



the tank won"
4442,endless possibilities
4443,Don't even know what the fuck is going on. But I do kinda like it.
4444,yes good game
4445,"The campain is really short and they want you to buy alot of DLC for a complete game. Plus the only thing that keeps the game going is the multiplayer however you try to join a server and get disconnected with no explaination, or you dont have this mod or this DLC and even after that you still get disconnected while trying to connect with the server. so you end up trying to connect to different online servers hoping you have the right dlc or mod or that you dont have the wrong DLC or mods its extremely frustrating."
4446,"Time travel 6h to the futurte, scream at AI that uses wallhacks, and wonder why mortars fly off in the sky like helicopters while you crash the game with too many mods. 
Highly recommended. 10/10"
4447,I love my 20 frames
4448,very fun lol
4449,GG
4450,i love it the game it is good
4451,so fun but ull never get ur lifeback
4452,This game is full of fun filled disasters.
4453,Remember playing with your plastic army men as a kid? That is literally what the 3den Editor is.
4454,"i have around 4500 hours in this game over around 2 year ( yesss, i got addicted over lockdown ) and have had both good and, well, bad times, however no matter what this game has been alot of fun, from spending 2000+ hours learning how to fly a hummingbird to spending alot of hours learning how to CQC in altis life.

this is not a game you can just play and understand in a few mins, you've got to put time and effort into it.
theres a variety of modes to play and alot of downloadable mods that can make the experience best for everyone depending on what you want.

you will find alot of people moaning about the bad framerate, or really difficult AI. but welcome to arma, you'll get used to it.

i highly recommend gamemodes such as:
- Altis Life
- King Of The Hill
- Invade and Annex

"
4455,"Only a few hours into the game, seems alright I guess."
4456,my friend got shot and the chiniese guy said it came with eggwo
4457,"The Best war game ever
-simpsons comic guy"
4458,"pros:
-The best military sandbox out there.
-Zeus Game master.
-Mods No really tons of mods of steam workshop.
-Eden Editor.
-Modding Tools are also on steam: you can make Pbos with click of button.
Cons:
-A bit Clunky.
-AI takes a toll on your CPU.
-AI has a mind of it's own and don't follow orders quite efficiently OFP:DR had better AI."
4459,It¬¥s Arma it¬¥s always nice.
4460,my butthole wheeps with the sensation of a nice game of arma
4461,Great game!
4462,funny
4463,"Oh, so you bought the game and want to start a multiplayer session? 
It would be a shame if you needed to setup port forwarding, then restart everything, then try again because it fails for some reason only for this garbage game, then give up and try playing on official servers, then the server reminds you that you don't own the DLC, then try another official server which has high ping, then it fails to connect, then try one last server which does not start and you are stuck in map overview
Absolute garbage"
4464,"Playing Zeus is like playing with Barbie dolls, but the Barbie dolls are actually middle aged men in the year 2035 in an armed conflict between NATO and an Iran-China-Southeast Asia alliance."
4465,"I mean it's a great sandbox. A bit clunky and you need mods to really enjoy the game.

If they make the game more accessible and less clunky in Arma 4 with better graphics and optimisations, you'd probably have the perfect MIlsim game"
4466,"Love this game, been 360 no scoped crossmapped by the bots hundreds of times."
4467,When they called this game ptsd simulator they were completely right. 10/10
4468,I just got the game and I absolutely love it the controls take some getting used to but after that it's a really fun game and I don't plan to stop playing anytime soon.
4469,"Still enjoying this game after almost 1,500 hours.
Originally released a number of years ago and long overdue for an Arma 4.
That aside, we still see new content being released with two recent CDLC enhancing the game and keeping it fresh, lets not mention Iron Curtain.
Prairie Fire is an amazing addition, with the maps, assets, new features and soundtrack (stream friendly), I wish I could nominate the CDLC for game of the year. Developed with assistance from great workshop mod creators and veterans from the real life era.
The most recent CDLC Western Sahara has a very nice map and expanding the content with polish that fits with the original and some of the more recent DLC. 
Arma 3 is a sandbox combat simulation so has strengths in areas that COD and Squad may not be able to fulfil."
4470,"Normies play Arma3 but GIGACHADs play Arma2 B)

4477,left my wife for this game just to get robbed 10 times over on arma 3 life
4478,"It is somewhat a good game, janky but still loved."
4479,One of the best military sandbox games out there. Really enjoying playing it would recommend it to anyone.
4480,very good entertaqining
4481,Yes
4482,"God I hate that I love this game.

A little buggy, but most of the time, that makes it more fun! Best played with a regular group of people, either in PvE or PvP!"
4483,Yes
4484,warcrime central :D
4485,good game
4486,One of the best milsim games if not the best.
4487,cool funny physics
4488,"this game is a ton of fun and was worth the $7. I find the ease with which mods can be obtained to be very nice, this allows me to do things that I cant do in other games. the squad system is still new to me, it will take a bit to get used to, controlling the bots, but otherwise it is very easy to use and straightforward. I am having a lot of fun making scenarios of all sorts in the Eden editor, and with mods, I can do almost anything. I just wish that a: I could move my camera up and down while in an vehicle, and that the AI teammates would not be able to phase through some structures."
4489,"It would be the absolute be-all end-all of milsim games if not for the engine.

I understand the limitations due to the calculations needed in real time for ballistics etc, and even with the engine issues, i'll still happily rattle through hours and hours of content, and can forgive the occasional crippling 20fps in Kavela while online, so for that alone, it's far worth it, with well over 10k mods/missions/scenarios/campaigns, and the ability to craft your own, or even run an entire mission on the fly with Zeus, there really is nothing that comes close to ARMA, there really hasn't been since Flashpoint

BFBC 2 PR:BF2 came close and that birthed SQUAD
PUBG started as an ARMA mod, DayZ started as an ARMA Mod, this is the original root of so many beloved games, and the only thing stopping it taking it's rightful crown is the need to update the engine.

You'll get whatever FPS the game will give you, she's a fickle bitch of a game, but we love her anyway.
sometimes you'll be running through the forest at a glorious 120fps, the crack thump of rounds overhead allowing you to pinpoint the incoming shots at 1km away, and the next, you'll be driving your squad through Kavela pumping cheeki breeki tunes through vehicle chat at a glorious 12fps only to be met with a pea sized pebble with the density of a neutron star that somehow causes you to fly to the heavens in a ball of fire, and both of these scenarios will have you completely immersed and enjoying yourself.

4515,best game ever
4516,real war exp.
4517,good
4518,This game is amazing and the devs aren't giving this game up any time soon. If you are a true fps or 3rd person mil sim player craving intense battles and want the real feel of the military then this is the game for you
4519,"It is fun, has decent graphics. But realistic encounters and gameplay."
4520,"Best game you van possibly play with friends.
Good performance and sheeesh"
4521,Eyy that's pretty good
4522,"Amount of possibilities (DLCs, mods, scenarios) this game offers is the reason alone to buy it. Realistic, well optimized and entertaining."
4523,you can be a spec ops protogen üëç
4524,"it's ok
"
4525,"Honestly one of the best sandbox games to be created, almost limitless in the amount of fun you can have with Arma, Especially with the modding community theres so many different types of game modes, One of the worst negatives of this game however is the poor optimization, even with a beast of a computer you'll most likely never find yourself pushing a stable 60-120 fps game play most times you'll be glued to the 30's. Still Arma and Bohemia will forever hold a special place in my heart."
4526,"Great game especially with the use of A3 launcher and mods, 100s of hours of RP and FPS funs.."
4527,war crimes
4528,Epic operator game. Be aware that some take this game way too serious and find themself behaving as Gen. Douglas MacArthur on the battlefield.
4529,"Good game, but got shot from 2000m away."
4530,This game has a perfect balance of retardation and seriousness which you won't find anywhere else.
4531,"Not bad, played it once or twice"
4532,"OK. this game is pretty good. the game has a great and helpful communities. by itself the game is good but there's a reason behind the dlcs. the dlcs aren't really required but wow do they enhance your experience. the graphics are a bit outdated but this isn't battlefield 2042 were talking about. the game is pretty open world and all defult maps include an editor for special scnerios. heres the list

pros:
VERY open world
a ton of maps
dlcs are worth every cent
customization is trough the roof
every thing is destrucable such as the ground and buildings.
simple and interactable ai system
modding as a blast
milsim(Its very nice by that the enemy ai can see you as long as theres no obstruction making its slower and more intence.)

CONS:
modding takes a while as most of the time is a pack
a ton of keybinds whitch do the most random stuff
dlcs are needed for a couple cool and important stuff
its a but buggy
milsim(yeah very slow and manually going on road to a place only to get blown up from an ied from 1973 isint really on the list of fun. plus realsim makes stuff like radio complicated)
you have to do a little reaserch on some stuff to understand its use like a first aid kit is used for first aid like a broken bones and splints, theres he, heat, apbc shells whitch do its thing etc.

tl:dr, game cool and realistic but outdated(kinda). 9/10 would play again"
4533,great

4535,"Always wanted to try out a Mil-Sim and started with Arma. A nice game overall. Fun to play with friends, might seem like a bit of a grind if playing solo, but the community is very friendly and helpful.
A few DLC's and Mods are definitely required to have a better playing experience. 
"
4536,fun game
4537,"So much stuff that If i spent hours telling you guys about it.. I'd really be scratching the surface. Check the game out, Who knows what sorts of fun you'll find. -D3ltazon

4538,Crazy good game 11/10 Would recommend!
4539,
4540,Sniping is great
4541,"This game has been a cluster of rage, creativity, and physics that cause the gods above to shake and burst out laughing. So many communities and other game modes that entirely shift the play style. 10/10"
4542,Great game. It requires concentration towards detail and is rarely as easy as running and gunning. I would rate this as a game for people with respect towards the skill it actually takes to perform as active duty military and demonstrates the variable skillsets that exist on a battlefield beyond shooting
4543,finally i can commit war crimes in pace
4544,this isnt vr hot
4545,I love this game so much :)
4546,"Got it for 75% off, and I still don't think its worth the money. No tutorials on how to play the actual game, and very boring experience anyways. The most exiting experience that I had was I was being shot at then I died. My squad left me to die. 
The helicopters, which are in the games main trailer? You have to buy them to use them. So do the boats. And tanks. The game also sometimes makes you wait to get out of the game for a few seconds to look at a car that you have to buy. And, the servers that are actually fun? You have to download gigabytes of mods to play them. 
This game is a cash grab, the same of Arma II."
4547,one of the greatest games of all time
4548,"I am a big fan of military games and god simulator games and this puts both of those together. I love the eden editor and how you can pretty much make any scenario from spec ops to plane bombing runs, this game has so much to offer and is worth every penny."
4549,amazing game
4550,ecks dee

4579,It's good
4580,"Always great to come back to, tonnes of content on the workshop to make it worth coming back to."
4581,"Arma 3 is now plagued with rising tension between the player base and developers.

As the devs are beginning to start working on the next Arma game this game is going to be left in it's sad and sorrow state.

It's pretty dead and the DLCs are on the verge of being useless other than a singular vehicle that is important to get making you need to get it and doubling your install folder everytime as for example ever gun has 100 different 4K models with the different attachments.

The modding community is also pathetic and half assed with 99,8% of mods being completely useless and then there being maybe 50 mods that serve a purpose but still are s hi t.

Don't get the game, get another game like Squad or Tarkov."
4582,Good game! Loved the charity DLC. I wish there were more games with proceeds going to a good cause.
4583,Insane DLCs with a huge amount of maps and modes to play. Recommend
4584,Great game. Physics are the only problem. you NEED mods!
4585,good game is a must have
4586,i like it alought
4587,The Community of Arma 3 and it's devs give you all the information about the game. In my opinion and view I play this game in singleplayer in the editor and by my self I get the feeling like im in real combat and modern day millitary. The workshop gives you a lot of mods where you can experiment and play with anything you want. I love the community and the devs updating and creating the game oftenly. The Arma franchise is something special and I recommend it to everyone who loves a real combat simulation game and combat experience.

4617,nice but my pc not good enough to run it
4618,"[h1]TL;DR: You'll get some bang for your bucks![/h1]

Well, I'd say you probably get a couple of hours of fun out of this game :) And sometimes frustration, too. But that's nothing compared to the doors Arma 3 opens for you. 

It's not just a shooter - it's a sandbox of almost endless possibilities. Thank to it's decent mod support and the build in editor, you can create your own game-modes, missions or customize the experience to your likings.

Don't be scared... not everything in Arma is MilSim. There's lots of content for quick and dirty gunfights, too ;)

Oh... and the community is just awesome!

Make Arma, not war!"

4635,"Amazing game, still relevant and I find it hard to play any other FPS because of this game.
The CDLCs have been awesome, the mods are plentiful and the jank is endless.

Only con is the steam workshop for mods could be better."

4672,"fun but get mods to make the game better
"
4673,Friend blew me up and then crashed my game. 11/10 :)
4674,.
4675,I enjoy the game but the tutorial was one of the worst I've ever experienced simply because of how difficult it is to pick up and the controls are too complex.
4676,"very cool very swag.

i like it."
4677,I spend hours fighting aliens and the taliban... sometimes both at the same time.
4678,"with the right people and servers, its fun"

4683,"boats n hoes n guns n planes n heli's n fukn everything. 
Fantastic simulator with some great single player and even better multiplayer, just find yourself a discord for events or just play on public servers. 

Best experience is if you treat it like a simulator rather than a game."
4684,"Only played the single player campaign. This game runs at like ~40 fps which is apparently good and this was with a rx480 8gb with a fx-8370 4.2 ghz and 16 gbs ddr3 ram. I do have to say this game looks awesome and the customization is huge, even larger with mods, which is what i spent most of my time doing. I have not really found a way to play this game as single player besides the campaign but with how large the modding community I'm sure there's a lot. I guess I had a good time with the game just customizing but if you are only going to play single player and not mod then there is not too much else you can do with the game from my experience."
4685,"what a great game
"
4686,"Game was enjoyable but got boring after not having many friends that also own Arma 3,
I suggest it if you have friends that will also enjoy to play with you."
4687,mm yees gun :)_
4688,"IF you played tarkov for guns and that ""milspec Feel"" then get this, and see if you like it"
4689,"Milsim good. This is less of a game and more of a purchasable sandbox for you to play around in. With the right mods, you can make arma into whatever kind of simulation you want and it has never ceased to entertain me."
4690,fun
4691,Spent hours just fucking around in Zeus making ai fight each other. 10/10 would recommend.
4692,"good only with friends, the MP sucks dick and the game's mods are primitive compared to other titles,  a good game though."

4724,"this game hensem, like me , fun with friends, must have so many mods.. join lots of arma active communities around the world."
4725,Issa gud! :D
4726,"The game is hard to learn at first and there are a lot of key binds. But if you look past that, the game is a blast to play! There are hundreds of servers to join that range from beginner-friendly to hardcore. There are many game modes as well. My favorite is Zeus, where a player can create a custom mission for others to play. I've had a lot of great experiences with this game, and I think others would enjoy it."

4733,Very fun
4734,Gaming
4735,"Amazing game, took me 2-3 days to learn the controls. Its a pretty realistic game and it kind of gave me onward + PUBG vibes, overall the gameplay is legendary but the animations arent the best. Still a good game with plenty of gamemodes + campaign."
4736,"I made a car bomb...











in arma of course"
4737,Well the game really depends. I don't really like the fact that you need to buy dlc just to get access to vehicles sucks.
4738,it is a really nice game.

4768,I will always recommend this game. Ready for Arma 4
4769,why did i buy this
4770,"i love that you can have over 100 people in a lobby
"
4771,laggy game
4772,long learning process but is fun dont get banned tho just have common sense and dont say anything offensive
4773,.
4774,I Don't put 1548 hours into a game if I don't like it.

4781,"Runs surprisingly well on my old PC, even with mods and DLC enabled"
4782,"This is one of my favorite games. i love how its so realistic, and really is the only game with actual recoil on the a-10! i bought  
the apex expansion yesterday and doubled my playtime. best game modes are king of the hill, invade and annex, and official warlords. i highly recommend this game. only thing is, there are a lot of people who are really serious about the game. overall, great game play!"
4783,.
4784,Pretty good
4785,"Yeah, nah, yeah, nah, nah, yeah, nah, yeah..."
4786,Personally not a fan
4787,amazing game and very realistic dynamics.
4788,best game ever
4789,pure unsaturated low texture quality larp
4790,
4791,"really good options in video :), my toaster can run it, just the story mode its lacking of soul, but everything else its really good"
4792,Not much to say here. Arma is the best of the best. I'm 36 and have played almost every 1st person shooter ever made. The sheer scale and possibilities Arma offers cant compare to anything else. Communities and opportunities for super realistic combat experience is top notch. I recommend not only this game but joining a unit to run op's with. Enjoy.
4793,look i have only played this a couple times but i would never find a server sadly but now im giving it another try
4794,This game is very nice
4795,cool
4796,Awesome game! First mil-sim game I've gotten into and I'm loving it!

4816,It really look like a good game but it run like sh*t even playing alone.
4817,Just fucking play it. Unless your dumb. Then don't. Because this game can be a trainwreck.
4818,its fun
4819,"I love this game now that i have a really good machine, but if you don`t have one, then i wouldn`t recomend you buying it"
4820,Great game but again for private servers way too much extra content to purchase.  I prefer number 2 but the graphics are the best.
4821,...
4822,"Alright no bullshit, this game is very much worth if you are into milsims. It isnt like what people say as in you get sniped after 10 min of running. All of the fun from this probably comes from operations hosted by the community, which is very easy to be apart of. Lastly, the DLCs are not needed to go on operations, all you really need are mods which is easy to access and the community discords will help you go through with everthing"
4823,seems like a fun game... but its too complicated for me :[
4824,yeah sure
4825,BANG BANG
4826,Very cool
4827,I've been playing for around 7 years now its super good would recommend to anyone that's looking for a new game to play :)
4828,Everything you would want in a war game.
4829,Very good MILSIM game.  The mods are good and community is chill.
4830,SIMPLY THE BEST.
4831,"it fun

4832,"awesome mil sim, best on the market"
4833,"gun, but realistic"
4834,"Yeah so basically this game is cool and has a learning curve, if you have played battlefield 4 before you‚Äôll be good at it, and uhhh yeah so basically if you‚Äôre a young person playing this game you‚Äôll be playing with all of these cringy neckbeards, so that‚Äôs definitely a downside."

and my friends wondered why we had low reputation :(
it was fun :)"
4840,gud stuff. many warcrimes.
4841,silky smooth movement
4842,"A good 60%-80% of my time comes from just messing around in the editor! I think more games need this level of player creativity and freedom. The campaign is cool but can be infuriating at times, and the story could be better but it's enough to keep you entertained. ( it's not "" somehow...Palpatine returned."" bad. )"
4843,"Honestly, An amazing experience, probably the best sim i've ver played, extremely emersive depending on the activities but honestly worth the money!"
4844,good game
4845,good game

4877,"One of the best military sandbox experiences around. Arma 3 offers essentially endless possibilities with modding, custom servers, and much more. Though it can be quite clunky at times, and requires a powerful PC to run well, the amount of content and things to do, in my opinion, means that it is well worth the money."
4878,The UN is after me
4879,sex
4880,Amazing game. The rat approves.
4881,Pretty fun. Even more fun if you have friends.

4883,Realism and scope of theatre
4884,"Played for a few hours, it's really good"
4885,"good game
"
4886,I've been playing the Arma series from when it was called Operation Flashpoint. This will always be my go to series for milsims. Arma 3 is the best iteration so far. And the willingness of the community to improve and add to it is unparalleled.
4887,The trees are speaking.............................................................................................................................

4900,good
4901,"Overall, Arma 3 is a fantastic military sandbox. Bohemia Interactive laid down the groundwork for modders to implement features and content free for the consumer on the Steam Workshop. The highlight for Arma 3 though is the community. Join a Mil-Sim or casual unit to play cooperatively with others against AI or other players and you‚Äôll have a good time."

4909,"very fun game recommend.
very good modding"
4910,good base game and love the modding support but there are multiple hidden fees that ruin the game. unless you are willing to pay an extra 50+ dollars on mostly useless dlcs then i wouldnt bother getting the game.
4911,brilliant
4912,Great game nice and realistic but you legit have to pay to drive fun vehicles mainly tanks and jets which is really annoying but still a good game
4913,toy soldiers and roleplaying
4914,This game such a lie! Dont buy this bullshit scammers cant make a server and for coop needs more money (dlc).
4915,"Lots of fun, especially flying. Recommend this game to all"
4916,just noticed i never reviewed this game. it's great
4917,yes
4918,cool beanz
4919,I took me 30 hours to figure out the scopes
4920,VERY GOOD GAME
4921,"So as many many years have passed at the time I would have gave it a thumbs up or atleast 3 out 5 stars, but as the time has passed I have noticed a trend with how this game is being put out, so at first the patches and updates to fix the bugs and glitchs were being put out, but over time the fixes are far from being worked on, so yeah figuered that would happen and they move on to another games, yet they seem to be at a point of no fix, no new game, and worse they keep spitting out DLC milking the hell out this game."
4922,About 4 years ago i was browsing the store in look for a cool game. found Arma 3 . I launched it and meet some cool people on a random server. and i still play with the boys to this day . the boys and i have fought in  every battle zone in the history books and we still are not bored with this game. tips to staying active for a while. Join a semi serious unit and you will be alright.
4923,An absolutely fun and fantastic game.  Personally I recommend checking out King of the Hill servers.
4924,Honestly if you love realistic tactical and somewhat open world first person/third person shooters you will love this game. The military tactics to the gun play is just right don't believe me? go find out for yourself. Not to mention this game can be pretty challenging in some scenario's depending on where you at during the conflict.
4925,one of the best games i ever play
4926,Finest form of jank there is.
4927,"Really good for a milsimmer, only downside is it's hard to find a hardcore group, from my experience"
4928,"Despite the game being almost a decade old, it is still a great time. There are many active and packed servers you can play on. If you can get a couple of mates on then the experience is ever better. Overall a 10/10 game."
4929,"extremely realistic, if you like long and Military style missions. Graphics are Out of this world"
4930,Chad game even for 2021
4931,Realism simulator
4932,"I would 100 percent recommend this game, endless possibilities with scenarios , especially when you have friends to play with, it really enhances your experiences, while def lacking with its graphics/optimization department i would give this game a solid 10/10 Great game!"
4933,dis gud

4940,"No, it's not realistic at all especially when vehicles mesh into each other but it's the people you meet and the time and training and shit that makes it the game it is, just try and have fun"
4941,this game is actual dogshit i have never met anyone who said dis game is good
4942,more controls than i have brain cells
4943,sooooo gooood
4944,"Back in my day, mod packs were free..."

4946,"Hetman's War Stories and A.I. Skill around .2 and A.I. Accuracy around .3. Remember this. That is what makes this game the best infantry soldier simulator on the market. Yes, you can do anything that a military can do in Arma 3 from flying planes to driving tanks, to being a commander of an entire army while being able to play as an individual unit. However, Arma 3 is really buggy in the mod department and really underachieving in the vanilla game, so to really tweak the game, you gotta sacrifice ALOT of time. However, I have spent that time doing that and you might not have to. I initially hated this game, because I felt like the vanilla game did not do it justice, since this is a sandbox game and why would you make it so FREAKIN' difficult to create any scenario, with any faction, on any map, with full scale joint operations, using all the units, vehicles and weapons??? So, with almost all simulators, a stong mod community is a requirement and the former mod mentioned with a few option tweaks makes Arma 3 a study course in warfare. Period. Hetman's War Stories is the mod that jailbreaks Arma and makes it easier to ""see everything"" in the game without having to be dang near a software engineer and read LOTS of material on how to create the type of war you want. Alot has been said about the A.I., but with the above settings, you will be sweating and feeling the full effect of a ground war. Arma 3 isn't perfect in it's vanilla state, but wilh some help from the community and a few tweaks, this will be the last FPS game you will ever need in your game library. Also, I took the time to take a break from the game to write this.....the British and CSAT are having a brawl on Malden for 3 real time hours....seems to be a stale mate with lots of casualties, but I wonder what will be the strategy that will allow either side to finish on top....and before that I helped NATO wipe CSAT off Stratis using the ""expeditionary"" strategy with superior air forces....but before that CSAT really gave the FIA independent militia a hard time and class in guerilla war 101. Welcome to Arma 3."
4947,"bad game, my cheats got detected"
4948,Huge initial learning curve but it's a lot of fun after that! Multiplayer with friends is the way to go to have a good time
4949,"Very fun and realistic MilSim, Fun to play solo and the campaigns are amazing, and i haven't come across anyone super unfriendly........ yet"
4950,"Basic game is pants, More DLC and bugs than I've seen for a while, don't bother!"
4951,It's cool. A bit janky at times.
4952,yes
4953,Nice game but too much dlc's
4954,"420 hours, fun game, very good pew pew"
4955,This game/simulation is incredible and still holds up today.  A true sandbox experience that rivals modern titles.  Buy it! You will find this is a true hidden gym.
4956,I love realism
4957,War crime simulator
4958,Pretty fun
4959,I dunno just look at my hours
4960,"Realistic FPS with extremely in depth mechanics. If you're looking for something to hop into for 30 minutes at a time and then leave alone for days... don't buy this game. You will forget everything. Even the basics. It's one of the most complicated games I've ever played, BUT, it's incredible. Landing that well placed shot, or finishing a punishing, difficult mission is so rewarding. If you have the time to sink into it I highly recommend Arma 3."
4961,High Realism Insurgent Dark Alchemy Simulator. very good game.
4962,"Despite being a rather old game, it has been nothing but interesting and fun. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a amazing military sandbox game."

4966,to be honest i havent got one kill in the game i have no clue what im doing but for some reason its still fun
4967,"Saw a video on it 2 years ago, it got me into milsims. 2 years later I downloaded it. 

Ive spent 57 minutes trying to load into a game with friends. 

Other than that the loading screen is fire ig"
4968,"One of the best purchases i've made in gaming, hands down. Performance is really determined by what you are running, but I have both myself and my girlfriend playing this together on a private server (PHRP - Project Harvest Roleplay Server - a halo modded server) and we both can run it. My machine is pretty up-to-date, but her's is for all intents and purposes the definition of a 'Potato' machine - but yet she can run it smoothly on low-mid graphics. To say this game is accessible no matter your PC is an understatement.

The best part IMO is honestly the community. Due to the sandbox nature of this game, there is so much that you can do in Eden Editor / Zeus that allows for so many different scenarios and stories to be told - you don't see it all that often in the current world of gaming. There are so many passion project servers / scenarios, that you are bound to find something that interests you. I never expected myself to start playing in a Halo-modded RP server, but here I am months later playing twice a week with a great group of folks."
4969,nah
4970,yes
4971,good game
4972,good
4973,nice game

"
4981,"(True play time over 10k hours and absolutely my favorite game and series)
I woke, floating to the ground in my parachute. I assumed the flames in the distance was my airplane. I had no idea where the other people I had been with were, or if they were even alive. We had been experiencing magnetic distortions for more than an hour, so I knew we were way off course. Maybe by hundreds of miles.
I got to the ground and immediately started checking my drop bag for any food or equipment I might be able to use. Other than an MRE and a bottle of clean water, there wasnt much.. It was already nearing dark, and not knowing the area, I knew I needed to find shelter soon. There was no telling how long it would be before I found civilization, or even another person so I had to prepare for the worst.
No more had that thought filled my head and I froze as my head and ear instinctively turned. ""Did I hear an engine?"", I thought. I closed my eyes and listened for a second. At first I thought I had just been hoping, but then I heard it. It was a helicopter! ""It couldnt be a rescue so soon."" - I stood and began meandering toward the sound of the blades off in the distance. Someone flying nearby must have seen the crash or saw the flames. 
As I walked, listening, I could hear the small craft getting nearer and as it peaked over the distant hills, I began jumping and screaming and waving my arms. The chopper put its nose down and began heading straight toward me and I felt an overwhelming since of relief knowing that I wouldnt be stranded. And just as my screams became a calmed smile, I heard it. ""PPEESSSHHEEWWWWWW!"" - From my days in Afghanistan I instinctively recognized the sound and the streak in the sky as a portable ground to air rocket. My shoulders  shrugged as a forgone reaction and I almost grabbed my ears as I already knew what was coming. I saw the chopper try to make a very abrupt evasive maneuver, but it was to no avail as the rocket hit its mark. The chopper exploded and I saw the pilot thrown to the side as a parachute started opening. I was relieved he made it, but immediately I started hearing gunfire from a high powered rifle and watched in horror as the man in the chute became a dangling, slow floating target. I knew he wouldnt make it and gave up even watching, as I knew my life was in danger and I had to get some cover. I crouched as low as I could while still being able to run and began heading toward the wood line in the distance.
""What the fuck is happening here? What is this place?""
(this is not ONE game. This is 50 games in one package. Now stop reading and buy it!)"
4982,"Best milsim.
Great community.
So much fun.
Thanks ARMA, you make my life better :)"
4983,"This game is quite worth the buy. It gives you countless stories to remember upon playing. Most of them in my experience are fucking hilarious, but also give a you a feeling you've accomplished something over the 1-2 hours you have been staring at your computer screen for. (providing your teammates are people you can work with, of course.)"
4984,alright game
4985,"If you like FPS war simulators this is really in its own league, by far the best I've played and I still have no-clue how to do some stuff in it. Multiplayer is really fun and the majority of what you should be playing anyway. This game is especially fun when you have a group of friends to play with, grab a vehicle of some sort and blast music for the hour-long joy ride you'll take roaming around to kill some people."
4986,"Best Military Game Ever. I Play a games like Call of duty Campaign and Battlefield Campaign and i feel like man i want to create a missions like this! and this game make that come true i can do anything about Military in this game i can create an Invasion, Terriost Attack, Rescue mission, Tank Battle, Jet Dogfight, ANYTHING! and lore in this game is pretty awesome for me. Campaign in this game really Stand out from other game campaign unlike COD or BF it just not some straight mission blahblahblah you should really try this game's Campaign! However if you are casual gamers like me before i addicted to this game. You should know this game is pretty realistic you can get kill with 1 single bullet in this game And Enemy AI in this game is pretty smart *Campaign* So if you are Hardcore FPS fans BUY THIS GAME!!!! if you are casual fps players reconsider this game! Overall a Amazing game!"
4987,i thought this game was supposed to be fun
4988,I don't understand this game at all
4989,"Racist, Terrible and Toxic. 5 Stars!"
4990,"the 2000 hours I have on record means I didnt make $70000 playing arma..... lol
"
4991,"HOLY SHIT IS THIS GAME GOOD! I have only played the campaign though so I can't speak much about the multiplayer part of this game, but the multiplayer is the reason people buy the game. Don't let me start on the mods for this game, it is enough to rival skyrim."
4992,Tactical.
4993,arma moments
4994,"Easily one of the most boring games, but at the same time, one of the most fun."
4995,i love prairie fire DLC
4996,"War crime simulator.
Need I say more?
11/10"
4997,Still glitchy af trash game trash company fix your game
4998,"Played a couple of hours now, seems fun."
4999,i liked the opportunity for realism while still being able to make the game easier for less skilled players
5000,amazing
5001,"It's like if Gmod were a milsim with near-obsessive attention to vehicle detail and giant open-world maps, with tons of mods available that can give you a huge amount of sandbox bang for your buck. If you're expecting a casual run-and-gun experience, you'll find this game very unforgiving."
5002,"Still the best game for a complete milsim experience, despite the age. No other game combines ground, air, and sea combat as well. Be prepared to mod the game heavily, as the base game only has units to simulate a near-future scenario. Luckily some great mods include different eras."
5003,ye
5004,"Play with friends, if you have no friends, find some, or find a unit/server to play on.

Play the campaign solo, it is kinda fun.

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITH FRIENDS."

5014,sheesh
5015,I'm playing Arma since OFP. ~20 years? Good enough for a review? ;D
5016,very cool
5017,"This game is a milsim, so if you're looking for instant action, then yeah you can find it here. It has coop missions and now aliens. 

There are some super serious servers I heard. I played some MP, but mostly mess with the editor or do the APEX missions. Plus now it has aliens, which I'm waiting to go on sale. I spend more time in the editor creating my own scenarios I think which is weird because I'm not that type of guy at all. The sounds and rifles are all realistic I'm told. I like insurgency sandstorm better though for my PVE fix or player vs AI. I did get in on a really cool server one night and people were working together and it was seriously fun as hell. Those moments are few. The game is clunky. If it's on sale get it. Need the apex expansion though. I will probably get the alien content as I imagine there is more playability for me personally there."
5018,A great warfare simulator. i always recommend this game to people who think COD is a real battle game.

5027,HANDS UP OR DIE
5028,after 2600 hours i just realized that this game is fuckin trash dog. is like every other fps is weed and you be hooked to meth or black tar heroin. you cant even run 87 mods at the same time beyond 20 frames per second yet you will wait 40 minutes for a reincertion helicopter just so you can be racist and make fun of your temporary friends. greatest-hardcore-gaming-i-ever-done.
5029,A fun game to play with friends the physics is a bit jank but i actually enjoy playing this game a lot
5030,"Brilliant, no other words for it........"
5031,Ara Ara Waifus Approved Girls Frontline Mods
5032,"merica boom boom boom tanks go boom, NEEEEEERrrrr *plane* thrrrrrrrrrrrrdddddd dead all, dead"
5033,godest game
5034,"The game has gone through a lot of changes, and I have to say it is much more stable now then it ever has been. Depending on the experience you go for, servers are still very prevalent. The glory days of whitelisted RP servers are pretty much gone, unless you get on a German or Russian server. Exile servers are normally 1 man expeditions met with teams of 4-8 friends who have dominance over every mission on the map at the time. Despite this, I still get some good play hours in at times. This is better with friends at this point. If you aren't experienced with milsim shooters, this game will be a frustrating, vast, learning curve for you. It can be a very rewarding experience. If you a returning ARMA player from previous versions, you'll find this hits every spot in the nostalgia slot."
5035,"This game is just one of the best ones i have ever played. It has so many features like Editor, Multiplayer, Campaing you can also download a hell alot of mods and make your own Factions and Mods if you know how to do it, also you can host your own server and make operations and play them with your friends. I am recomending this game to everyone 110% ( unless you don't like military stuff ) but othewise check it out !"
5036,Best realistic shooter out there with a large active community
5037,g√ºzel
5038,You Arma 3 Dev Sill Need To Fix All Bugs And Fps Bugs And All Maps Bugs In Arma 3 I Love The Game But The Game Sill Fix Up Or Remaster Arma 3 I Well Buy Again

5040,yes
5041,I'm starting to like it I think. Will definitely play it a little more.
5042,is good
5043,great game
5044,"Arma 3 is such that without most dlcs you're left in a very disadvantageous position in multiplayer or missing out on content that should have just been given to you. That being said, it was overall quite wholesome when i got it on sale with Apex and the other minor DLCs packed. One of the Creator DLCs i would recommend to continue the experience would be SOG prairie fire by Savage Game Design which has multiplayer in the form of KOTH, KP Liberation, Life, and Mike Force. Being a military simulator more than game, you at least don't come across thirteen year olds like in COD or Battlefield whining and ranting as often. Arma mod workshop ensures that you'll never get bored."
5045,"Great game in the sense of how realistic it can get in war. Still making my way through the campaign but as for now it's a solid. Some of the missions make my computer Freeze which is annoying, but that is because of a GPU driver glitch that has been in the game for a bit now."
5046,Army !
5047,"The only game you could ever need in your library, unless Arma 4 is out by the time you read this that is!"
5048,Best milsim game i've ever played!
5049,It's just fun
5050,
5051,Is good
5052,I have just hit 3000 hours played! I gotta say with the diversity of mods... there are so many different things to do in Arma 3! I can't say I will ever stop playing!
5053,Fun and explosive warfare
5054,amazing <3
5055,simple good
5056,"fix bugs with crashing and the other few bugs and the game will be perfect
"
5057,Fun
5058,I mean.... it's Arma =}
5059,i love PTSD
5060,great game even after 8 years its still a blast ! slight learning curve but nothing to bad . Shooting a man never felt so good.
5061,"Warlord alone makes this game fun but if you dont have a good CPU then be prepared for loss of FPS

5078,"This game is very different than other shooting games such as COD or Battlefield. Though they also have some single player campaigns, ARMA truly focuses on the single player battle experience. ARMA replicates how real life soldiers would go on about on a mission. There are many scenes where there are many enemies to shoot at, but are also many others where you would need to just walk for a very long time, or just wait for orders. Nevertheless, that is necessary for a real mission experience. 

Though ARMA could improve on the human aspect like Scum, GTA Online, or Minecraft (heart rate, hydration, stamina, hunger, etc - this would help make the game experience even more real), it is still a very great game to enjoy if you want to try what a mission-specific battle experience is like. 

For me personally, it is a great game to enjoy from time to time if I want to play a slow paced game, and not a too extensive and fast paced game like COD or Battlefield where you're constantly facing enemies and respawning. ARMA actually got a bit boring after the 20 hour mark, so it is only enjoyable from time to time."

5094,"Arma 3 is definitely a game that on its own in singleplayer can feel like a HUGE game with TONS of functionality, but so little necessity to use those functions. HOWEVER! In multiplayer, particularly modded multiplayer, you can have a tremendous amount of fun with custom operations. Its got this pacing and feeling that's unlike any FPS I've ever played, and can be just as goofy or serious as you'd like it to be."
5095,"Oh wow, where to begin...

So after 418 hours of gameplay I can safely say that is a small number in comparison to where it will be in a year or two. And thats only after like 5 months of owning it. I just wanted to stop here today to tell you that if you enjoy sitting down for 12 hours a day, building levels in games, browsing a seemingly infinite pool of mods to change the game, and a super clean game that at least in my 418 hours of gameplay has never crashed or supplied me with game breaking bugs, then buy this game. Like yesterday.

So Arma is difficult to describe. You want a zombie survival game where you find loot and eat food and drink water? 
You want a realistic tactical shooter where your character is a medic in a conflict in world war 2 and it's your duty to heal broken legs and gun shots and shrapnel wounds on a battlefield?
What about a space age roleplay where you're a clone trooper policing on tattoine?
Maybe you want an experience where you're just a dude driving around in the country side.

Buy this game. Now.
If you're looking at Arma to perpetuate any RolePlays or just a fun shooter game BUY IT NOW

And it's clean with mods too, You can load this game with like 22 mods (my current mod count) and it runs like a dream. 

No its not the most beautiful game
No it's not a Game Of The Year contender
But it deserves to be.

This is one of the best games in the world. Please Give them your money, let them know that the slavery they put into this game is worth every penny.

And worth every second of Gameplay. 

10/10 

5 Stars

Would recommend to everyone who is looking to buy it."

5098,"If you even remotely enjoy military sandbox type games, military simulators, customization through modding, or just a straight up good ol' time with your friends, as long as you don't have the attention span of a nat like your average Call of Duty player I'd highly recommend it.

5145,"This game lacks allot of performance mainly in multiplayer. It should 100% run better on a packed server. I get (with 20 ppl in a server) an average of <20 fps. Absolutely painful, since it doesn't matter if I'm running ultra or not all running at 40% utillization. Single player I get 60 no problem. The game has a lot of buggy broken functionality, but for what it is it Is somehow very enjoyable. Even at 14-19 fps at times. If performance was better I would say this game was amazing.

5159,"played it a bit, it's okay"
5160,"Greatest military simulation ever created. Period. Been playing since the European version of Operation Flashpoint was released back in early 2001, ever since I've been addicted. I'm an old salty dog veteran of this franchise so I've watched this simulations game engine mature and be refined over the last 20 years. The greatest asset Arma 3 has is it's huge amount of amazing modifications and the people that create them. For the folks making them it's a labour of love. Do I recommend this simulation? I'll let my hours played speak for itself. Is it perfect? No. Does it do something on a scale no other current military simulation does? Yes. Once you get the hang of the keyboard layout and customise it to your own needs, you'll be immersed and addicted. 

The multiplayer community that surrounds this simulation is fantastic, it's mostly comprised of ""older"" folks who have been playing for years. They are very protective of their servers and the people they play with because there's been so many pathetic cheating idiots attempting to disrupt their games. That said, they weed them out and are always welcoming to new players who are looking for the same kind of experience and good time as they are."
5161,gooooooooooood
5162,game fun and have some great mods
5163,"I've been a host of Arma2 & 3 servers for over ten years. what I can say is that, on the whole this community is crammed with people who don't care an inch about their respective hosts efforts to provide unique experiences. All of my servers were dense with detail, were tough on the player and granted challenges not found elsewhere.

But after such a long time of running near empty servers (players just want pink tanks & guns as far as I can tell) I have given up on this community of selfish, fickle soldier wannabes.

Thanks for the very few good times.

BIS have earned my contempt. They persist in selling the game in slices. Their version of DayZ (standalone) was pathetically mediocre at best - and even after several years - it still looks & plays like a early access game. It's clear the money raised was ploughed into the micro-transaction filled Vigor.

So that's me done, permanently.

Here's to spending more time with my family & looking after myself better - I've grown out of this childish nonsense.

There are so many better alternatives to Arma or DayZ. Save your money & time & avoid anything BIS 'produces.'

Absolute rubbish!"
5164,"Highly moddable and fun when you learn the controls, My only complaint is that servers tend to be iffy at best unplayable at worse."
5165,game play is amazing wish they can add more missions with jets and helicopters
5166,"Very fun. I'd recommend finding a unit for what you enjoy (NATO, starsim, etc) and play with them. Single player alright, but units and modding really push this to a great experience"

5204,"Pretty rough around the edges for a game from 2013, performance might be an issue. But it does take the cake for military sims and it has dedicated developers and a dedicated community. A ton of content. And for someone whos never touched an Arma before its pretty easy to get into.

the controls are a clusterfuck though"

5220,"I know, 1200 hours and I am sending a negative review. ""Clearly you liked it else you wouldn't have played for 1200 hours."" Yeah, I will be honest Arma 3 has had its ups and downs over the years. For the people who care I finally snapped and I realized that this game pales in comparison to Arma 2 even years after release. If you want to play arma 3 MODED like Liru, go for it. Else stay away from this if you value your sanity. For the people who care, this is why

Day 1: I just bought Arma 3, this is before the Apex DLC or anything of that sort. I realized straight off the bat that Arma 3 was shallow in almost every way. The three factions in terms of kit were spread with 1 MBT for each, 1 jet for each which really was just CAS (neophron for CSAT, A10 ripoff for NATO, buzzard for indie). In terms of armored cars, 1 for each and 1 APC type of each (except indie, since they had 2 APCs). There was NO RADAR, no advanced tank armor, the module esc damage was a thing of the past since most things just outright killed you. 

Flash to today

Jets DLC added 3 more jets, of the air-superiority type, radar was added but really it is just pathetic. From playing DCS for every just a few hundred hours I can see truly that their radar is sad. AA combat because little more than a point and click adventure 

Tanks DLC added a few new items that fleshed out the tanks, interiors is a waste that never gets used. Armor system was revamped so tanks can now be disabled easier however getting hit by a tank shell still tends to just ""dent the armor"" with no real damage being done. This makes it so the other tank can return fire and depending on the hit it might be an insta kill. So essentially the devs need to make up their mind. Do they want tanks to be disabled preferably or destroyed preferably. Either way again this is just a point and click adventure now. They even do ranging for you and speed for moving targets (which is realistic though).

This is not even going into detail about their aggressive marketing which was upped from Arma 2. As opposed to arma 2 where using a vic from a DLC might have a watermark show up. In Arma 3 you just CAN NOT use said vehicle in multiplayer what-so-ever. This is disgusting since it means people have to test DLC items against the AI which is frankly a hot mess that can either one shot you across the map, or fly into a cliff (A3 wasteland has shown me.. a LOT of AI bugs). 

If we want to continue this pain train from hell. How about we talk more in depth about the AI shall we? Without mods the AI pathing is sad at best which can be backed up with quotes from Liru and other Zeus users. Fast vehicles on a curving road will not slow down enough to actually make the corner. Prime suspect here is the Hatchback Sport. Tight bridge crossings like in the NW of Malden have also seen many tanks/apcs when they panic straight drive off the road. This is actually a tactic in A3 wasteland since if you hit the convoy at the right time one or more vehicles can get stuck. Aircraft pathing is easy to see as bad because the aircraft slow down on attack runs making them easy to hit even with Vorona TOW missiles. They act like they are coming in for a gun run on a Tigris that just mulches them when they should boost off and hit it with a mav. 

I genuinely believe aircraft was a second or even third rung priority for the team. the aircraft wobble up and down when passively flying hinting that there are no buffer zones or that the AI does not calculate where the plane will be in advance (say where it will be in 2 seconds). This type of system may even help vehicle AI not drive off the road and slow down before a curve. 

The worst part of all is that there are TONS of GOOD MODS that people like Liru use that completely fix or overhaul the AI for all elements to make them much better within the confines of modding. Yet these are mods so for people like me they will never be a reality. Especially since, years and years out from its launch these are still issues that plague it to this date. They have no intention of fixing them assuming they CAN even fix them. 

How about we talk about viewdist now.. and how this game looks like it could stand in for Silent Hill. Multiplayer default viewdist is a travesty that has range from 2 to 3 km. This is fine for most things, infantry combat will not exceed 1km for the most part. Tank combat also will not exceed maybe 2 to 2.5km. However aircraft get the short end of the stick. If you are flying 1km above the ground that means you will ""see"" 2km of ground in a circle around you. However around this 2 of 3km mark this haze starts occluding your view. This makes it borderline impossible to spot something small unless they are really stupid. So that being said, the effective viewdist is <2km. Even in wasteland they use a plugin to modify this and that increases the max dist to 5km (mist appears at 3.5km). This makes aircraft a lot more use-able but again, MOD.

I will not say anything more, but understand that this is just the tip of the iceburg here for all the problems in Arma 3. I do not want this post becoming longer than some school essays. Even with that said though the game is really fun sometimes. You get a group of friends together on wasteland and get some missions done. Just this game is not fun most of the time since outside of having friends it is a slog.

I guess, when was the last time you saw pure Vanilla Arma 3 without any mods just DLC. if the answer is no then you will probably be shocked by this review."

5271,"I left the launcher on periodically. When the launcher was open it added to the gameplay time, aside from that the tutorial is about 4 hours, so if you complete it you cant refund the game. I think its a decent game for the right people, its not my thing at all, it was much slower than I anticipated. The maps are giant and time consuming. I really thought I'd enjoy it more but it felt like a grind, in a bad way. The only reason I'm negatively reviewing it, is it's impossible to give it a try and still have the refund option. I get that this game is not for me, and is for other people. Throughout the tutorial it seemed exciting, but while actually playing the game I don't have the attention span to move in a straight line for 15 minutes before I get to any combat at all, which from what I experienced was short and frustrating. Storytelling is weak for the official campaigns, however there is a ton of content, especially from the community. Good military sim, but for someone like me this is a terrible game. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine."

5330,"I don't know what it is about this game...but I've had a gaming laptop finally for the past 7 months, and i've put about 600 hours on this. The thrill of flying a helicopter and providing CAS to troops on the ground, or flying people to their insertion point or extracting people out of a hot LZ...Is probably the most fun i can have in a video game. I would recomend this game to everyone."
5331,ocen harasho
5332,"its a god game but not for me. reasons:
1) its too tactical for my baby brain
2) its doesn't feel casual for for someone with short time
3) very realistic, not only with movement and bullet physics but with compasses and map marking

i can see this game being fun but not for me or a very casual player"
5333,"I only play Single player games and I find this game extremely difficult to get started in ""single player"" mode. Sometimes when I try to come back to it I can't even get it started again. To me this game is/was a waste of disk space, time, energy, and money.  The game itself looks like it would be good if I could only get into it."

5339,it is realy good with mod i would recommend
5340,Very fun takes time to learn the controls
5341,It's a realistic military simulator.

5366,funnn
5367,Great military simulator with editor options!
5368,"No matter what gamemode you play in Arma, you will always laugh at something. If its a car randomly flipping, Your teammates making random jokes, its always fun. Yes it has bugs, but theyre not bad. This game has so many options from just playing the campaign or standard king of the hill to playing modded online operations. Theres so many possible things to do in this game that you almost never get bored of it."
5369,"campaign more like ""camPAIN"" haha ‡≤•_‡≤•"
5370,yeah good game. Played it for a bit.
5371,"The game so far is great! i love the gun models and how they work, the vietnam dlc is insanely good. 100% recommend buying."
5372,"Positives:
- Gigantic map.
- Base game has a lot of value.
- DLC's add a lot.
- Different scenarios, from lone wolf missions to full-on war.
- Custom-made scenarios.
- Multitude of servers.
- Great Singleplayer.
- Great CO-OP and multiplayer.
- Tons of content.
- Active community.
- Soundtrack.

Negatives:
- Hard to learn (more hotkeys than a flight simulator).
- AI.
- Horrible fps drop when fighting in big towns.
- Physics.
- Chunky animations, you can't even jump.
- Sometimes it can be really slow and boring.
- Doesn't simulate army logistics or morale.
- Weather doesn't affect you or vehicles.

For me ArmA 3 is a must-play for anyone who likes to shoot guns."
5373,ye
5374,oooga boooga good game very diverse u can simulate a starwars battle or a modern day fight basically if u can think it the worksshop probbably has it
5375,MIL-SIM HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
5376,"good communities, game is pretty fire itself"
5377,GOOD SHOOT GAME
5378,"7/10
really needs to be optimized better. Game doesn't even use your gpu really its all cpu dependent it seems. Its very weird but the graphics are really good esp the view distance and size of these maps are the biggest i've ever come across they are actual real sized islands where you can cover miles and miles of terrain. 

Would be a 10/10 if the optimization was better."
5379,Its time for ARMA 4 Bohemia.
5380,ITS ARMA YOU CLOWNS GET IT
5381,"The best Military Game, Period."

5394,It is fun
5395,nice but hardly bagi game
5396,"Tried really hard to love this game, but the A.I. is just a joke. Sadly it's super unrealistic. I don't mind a challenge, but I don't like playing against 'cheaters'. Probably still enjoyable as a multiplayer game."
5397,"Can't recommend this enough. Made some great memories and some amazing friends through this game. Very realistic game that you can push to its limits with the workshop content. Really fun and as you can tell quite a lot of hours you can sink into this, making and playing with a unit is truly an amazing experience."
5398,"Just buy it, trust me. Get a few mates and hop on a king of the hill or invade and annex server. If none of your mates own it, peer pressure is acceptable"
5399,game is shit
5400,Finally finished a mission after 110hrs. 20/10 would waste my time again

5405,good
5406,are you into not sucking?  do you want to kill?  is there a black heart buried in your hollow core?

I feel like I should just leave because clearly nobody wants to be around me and everyone would be happier if i left anyways so i‚Äôll just go and i hope all of you find happiness in life and i‚Äôm sorry for all the troubles i‚Äôve ever put any of you through. i give up. goodbye."
5415,haha jet go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

5422,"When I was first exposed to ARMA, I watched FRANKIEonPC and instantly fell in love with the game. Had alot of fun with ARMA 3 when I was really into it. The learning curve is massive not to mention the numerous amounts of mods you potentially also may have to learn the mechanics for. You'll find a numerous amount of gamemodes when exploring the server browser and I'd recommend KOTH to start out till you can find a decent group. 8/10 would recommend IF you are know what you are getting when you play the game."
5423,Very fun.
5424,yes man good game you can be african rebel or be jewish or jihadi

5428,"Fantastic game, great community and well worth it even if you're only marginally interested in military-like tactical games. If you're uming and aring over this then wait wishlist it and wait for one of the many sales, then it's usually around 5-7 quid."

5474,"Cannot find a good server, this game is dying. It is like nobody is online in my region. The controls suck, too complicated, sometimes a lot of lag in the game... I have good pc with strong graphics card and the game even still doesn't run smooth in some servers... It is badly optimized.

But the worst of all, this game, especially the anti-cheat system gathers dangerously a lot of personal information about its users. They gather a lot more than required. I do not really trust this, I am sorry... This is privacy violation. Also, for example, the game displays your administrator account name of your pc and windows account name in public, visible for all other players in the game server. But who knows what kind of additional information is visible to the rest of the players... Also, if the software gathers a lot of more unknown information, this could be a target for potential hackers. The game doesn't feel save."
5475,just great
5476,it the worst game i have played oh wait i cant even play it.
5477,NICE MILITARY SIMULATION
5478,BRUGH
5479,this game is what you make it especially with mods. the game however is mostly a modern military simulation game so expect a ton of realism on a ton of servers which for most people who play Arma is a good thing but its not for everyone
5480,"[b]""Our studio is dying, and we can't effectively develop games anymore - so we're going to sell MODS to the community instead!""[/b]

From the *cough* new and improved 'Bohemia Interactive' that has completely forgotten their job as a 'development studio.'  I guess the talent left with Bohemia Interactive Simulations and VBS3, eh?

Let's take a look at how BIS feels about old daddy BI, shall we? https://www.bisimulations.com/company/news/press-releases/bisim-statement-investment-former-owner

[quote]Feb 09, 2021

ORLANDO, Fla. (USA) ‚Äî Commercial game developer Bohemia Interactive recently announced that Tencent Holdings agreed to acquire a minority stake in the company. Bohemia Interactive‚Äôs announcement has no impact on the operations or ownership of Bohemia Interactive Simulations.

...

""Bohemia Interactive is not and has not been an active participant in BISim‚Äôs business for many years,‚Äù said BISim CEO Arthur Alexion. ‚ÄúBISim has been a completely separate business from Bohemia Interactive since Riverside acquired BISim in 2013. We have no commercial links or ongoing business relationship with Bohemia Interactive.""[/quote]

Hmm - as soon as everybody's favorite 'technology conglomerate holding company' bought into Bohemia Interactive, not only did their golden son - that makes [b]virtual reality simulation games for Government Militaries and Private Security Contractors abroad[/b] - disown Daddy BI, but the sheer quality of their DLC practices has dropped.

Immensely.

Consider the sheer difference in quality between S.O.G., Global Mobilization: Cold War Germany, and CSLA Iron Curtain.  Assets from each DLC aren't even uniform.  You have two different Strelka AA launchers that aren't even the same size - don't even get me started on the textures and shading of freaking AK-47s.

[b]Bohemia Interactive simply took what modders made, put a price tag on it, slapped it on the table, and sold it.[/b]  They performed no quality control whatsoever (if you want to argue, I just have to say say [b]""CSLA: Iron Curtain""[/b] five times fast and I'll win) and they proceed to profit.

All of that profit, because their legacy is what fuels them.  ArmA 1 was great, ArmA 2 was better, and ArmA 3 had the best potential out of all of them.  Then the little split happened, which should've been a red flag to all partakers...

At this point, it looks as if ArmA 4 is going to be a fan fiction collaboration between players, that Bohemia Interactive will sell as their own.  I don't know WHAT happened to them, but if you're looking to waste money, there are countless other military themed games you can spend it on and get your money's worth for.

If you want to invest in the dying legacy of the ArmA series and set yourself up for disappointment - consider yourself warned.  Like their future sales will reflect, I give the direction of this company a solid thumbs down.  I wouldn't pay ten cents for their next game knowing they've lost touch with everything that made them great to begin with!"

5508,Great RP possibilities in this game with pretty good combat. Excellent open-world possibilities with really cool vehicles. Definitely recommend.
5509,"Still one of the best multiplayer combat sims. 
Best to be enjoyed on larger servers with more experienced players, as the learning curve is shallow (no not steep...) and some features are non-obvious.
The variety of classes, weapons and vehicles guarantee you will find your favourite playstyle.
Even the vanilla Solo-Missions provide many hours of tense action sprinkled with some stealth.
Although the engine is dated, the graphics still are pretty enough to feel immersed in the environment.
Combined with hundreds of good to excellent mods and endless custom missions, this game can entertain you for years."

If you wanna play multiplayer good luck finding a decent server.

5526,"I avoided this game for so many years, thinking it was just a boring PVP milsim game, where everyone took it super serious, and you had to walk 4 hours just to get shot and die. Little did I know, that this game had a sandbox mode where you can make your own AI battles, missions, and wars, and play it with friends. Lucky for me, sandbox games are my favorite.

5560,"A personal favorite and still surprising even as it's age starts to show, now I am no 'serious' Arma veteran. Arma 3 is my first Arma game and it blew me away with how honest/true to life the gameplay is (sometimes). Granted even with only having Arma 3 under my belt in-terms of mil-sims, this game is worth the janky, wacky, and zaney engine along with physics insanity. If you have been on the fence about getting Arma 3 and all the DLCs, honestly you'll need at bare minimum Arma 3, Contact, Apex, and Marksmen to get the best starting experience however you don't need the DLCs if you don't want them, enough people have each DLC to make most situations work. Hope everyone who sees this has a wonderful day."

5563,Great game for military enthusiasts
5564,Yes
5565,You'll keep yourself busy with trying to get good fps and blowing stuff up.
5566,I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone i know. It is the best military sandbox currently available! There is so much to do from single player campaign to pvp multiplayer. The community is still very alive with thousands of mods to improve your game. Would you like to be a Lego man with a hi-tech sci-fi rifle? There are mods for that. 10/10 I love this game.
5567,Just boring. Great solution for insomnia.

5582,"base game fkin sucks but if you mod it, its very good"
5583,gun and tank and exploding trees = funny
5584,"Personally this game is very fun but also very difficult to master
It is a realistic Military fighting game where you fight as a soldier for a large variety of factions it has great graphics and physics (Most of the time) it's gameplay is very fun and puts you in the moment as if you're there, Every action counts making possibly one of the most realistic games out there.

Overall Functionality
This game is mean't to be a realistic fighting sim where you fight or fight for a large variety of factions, the medical menu is very simple until you turn on the Advanced setting which makes it very difficult to learn and use properly, fighting isn't that difficult due to me being used to First Person Shooters with realistic fighting but still can be a little challenging, Communication is a little bit of a scuff for me because it gets messed up easily with the wrong keybinds (Still finding good ones for me) but overall I'd rate this game a 8/10 for Functionality and 10/10 for overall gameplay."
5585,"Ultimate military sandbox game. Infinite mod-ability allows for a huge amount of user content. The scale of the maps is enormous, perfect for combined arms operations or urban operations. However, not every building is enterable so not a lot of opportunity for out of the box close quarters combat. 
The single player experience is passable, but I enjoy it most with multiplayer cooperative modes. The large scale of the maps make Player vs Player modes not super fun in my opinion. Too many opportunity for bush snipers. 
There is a fair amount of bugs and built in weirdness, but given the scale of the game and the relative small size of the development team, this should be expected. I've been playing this franchise for about 20 years and enjoyed all of it, flaws and all."
5586,"At First this game is very confusing but as you learn and get better this game is really fun and good too (only if you have a good PC) you can be a sniper, you can roleplay, you can play as GOD (Zeus) and have fun with alot of people make amazing missions n bases and maybe even post them on the Workshop for other people to use"
5587,I liked how real it felt but it would turn off for no reason

5607,ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooooooooood
5608,"The game may have been good when it launched but not for 2021 standards, in my opinion.
I have a good cpu and gpu and i barely get 70 fps.
I went through walls and terrain multiple times during the tutorial.
I had to search 15 minutes for a good server and then spend another 15 on figuring out what do to (still don't know to this point).
Maybe i would be able to ignore the low fps and ""bugginess"" but I don't really want to spend so much time on learning what and how to do.

I can't give a bad rating though, because if i would spend some time learning how the game works i could play and enjoy it, but I don't really want to spend 10 hours on learning a game."
5609,cool game
5610,no.
5611,I've had so much fun playing this game. You're really able to do missions and maps in your own way with your friend group (or just with one friend) and have so much fun dying haha. The rage from dying is 10/10 worth it
5612,"well it runs, at 13 fps."
5613,"yeah its something to pass the time with, or in my case a little bit more than ""some"" time."

5625,Cool scenarios to be made if you are a fan of war spectacles.
5626,Yes
5627,Lacks a clean and understandable server listing. Would play online more but every server i end up joining is south american. Gunplay is decent but messy. I get the whole tactical thing but it feels really janky.
5628,"pp
"
5629,"After a good 8 years of this game's release I think players still find it a great game to play, despite it's obvious issues surrounding scripts and AI, It manages to stay relevant in today's gaming community as well as maintain a level of versatility in terms of what scenarios happen in game. Overall I think this game is a great experience and investment for players wanting a milsim type-beat. 
The creator DLC is a bit concerning though, I disagree with this decision to turn workshop content into paid DLC, I believe that should be the developers' responsibility."

5657,"Arma 3 in short is a  Mil_Sim. 
Here's my medium length review.
It is with out a doubt the most intracranial piece of gaming masterpiece we will see for a long time. 
The dedication and attention to detail is without a doubt nothing short of amazing.
The list would continue for miles on how this game plays, its cons as well as its pros. 
Let me save you the details...
Find out for yourself! lol.
Just buy the game and skip the endless reviews.
Trust me, if your looking for the ""Best Mil-Sim Ever"", you've found it!"
5658,too many dlc's i couldn't get onto a server because of that so i just gave up.
5659,stonks
5660,"yes i do and but only if you find good server or community most people don't stick to arma for very long its a community game full stop. if you just buy arma 3 with no DLC its extremely bare bones and while its truly an amazing sandbox that will get your heart pumping with combat envoirments can feel electric and chaotic there is very little too do in the base game other than a short and fairly poor campaign that is short and annoying due too the player being forced too command troops and arma has less than user friendly interface for things like this...there are single missions but you will mostly relient on mods from the handy easy to use steam work shop...fancy converting arma into HALO or alien you can do that

if you were to play arma with a small relax mil sim group that do stuctured OPS / missions you will probably fall in love with Arma such as i have it truly is an amazing game....the biggest flaws is its an old engine and does not run at very high FPS without having a beast of PC arma is terrible at making use of your PC resoruces as are most older game engines..."
5661,Best Game i like
5662," nnm,hmghmgh"
5663,its a really good game i really love playing offline mode tho because i don't know why but i just love editor mode its really fun i recommend this game to people that love military and roleplay and i just freaking love it.
5664,"Sir, with all due respect, play ARMA!"
5665,"worst game ever made. everything blows up upon bumping it into another vehicle, the ai are good EXCEPT they are all given 4th-person thermal vision so they just lock onto you through foilage and only shjoot you in the head,. rock placement intentionally done by hand in order to maximize inconvenience whilst offroading, in addition to random rock walls!!! takes up 367531980 GB of space with no way to update arma 3 without downloading a 157t1398 GB update from creator dlcs. speaking of dlcs anytime you somehow access dlc content, like in the virtual aresenl, you just ghet blasted with DLC ads ingame in addition to a 2162 second DLC purchase screen you cannot skip when you exit a server. lilterally impossible to host a game unless you are a port forwarding master or have a upnp enabled router. anything i do in this game cuases me physical exhauistion. if you enjoy playing walking simulators like death stranding this game is for you. what game has MOUSE STEERING enabled when you enter a vehicle by DEFAULT????, with no OPTION TO DISABLE IT in the settings. get used to double tapping ALT to just drive a car with keys normally. one of the biggests inconveniences of the entire game. speaking of settings, you cant even change your FOV there unless you do some 4head configuration file setting changes that require MATH. its like 70 fov default. no one is playing arma 3 on a  tv 50 meters away so whats the point of a headache inducing fov being the default??? like hello?? devs??? this is the only game that has made me geniuneyl mad. the stamina system is also off the hinges. no way this game is realistic in vanilla so why try to have a realistic stamina system to just inconenveince the gameplay. not to mention the 50 million voice and chat channels you have to browse through to even speak to you r fiends with the ingame system. whats worse is the devbs really added ghillie suits. play on any community server and its just idiot rats running around in ghillie suits playing a click and point adventure game. they get to one tap you because they have the sniper dlc and you dont. dont have access to a NASA supercomputer?? have fun going through the hoops to try to optimize this game to even make it PLAYABLE. even then you will still have 0.11111 FPS. Nothing can help you with the infinite bugs in the game either

only good part is playing with friends and the campaign and graphics. eden editor is also ok.

2/10"

5670,war crimes
5671,"An incredible war sim, a one of its kind, with many mods and customizable content. Beware this game has a bit of a deep learning curve and the tutorials aren't great nor the campaign mode too scripted. Sometimes you do get lost, just like you would on a real battlefield if you knew nothing about what you were doing. For those who like a tactical and realistic combat experience, you should get this. If you just like killing people and lean more to an arcade experience, stick to the traditional FPS games."
5672,"The performance is terrible, no matter how good your PC is. The bots can see you through grass and shoot at you before you can see them. The movement is clunky, not fluid. 
My 1000 hours in this game were a complete waste of life time. I don't know what I was thinking when I kept playing it years ago."
5673,"Would I recommend this game, absolutely.

My Super Fancy Criteria:
Talking with cool people and shit: 9/10
Gameplay Shit: 7/10
Doing Cool Shit in a cool place: 8/10

Talking with cool people and shit: 
This game might be my favorite of all time, and most of the reasons are not because the actual game play.  The comradery you can feel with a bunch of random guy's on the internet is pretty cool, given they're not jackass Delta Seal Special Force Wannabes.  The community has it's dark sides, but I have also met some long time friends in this game that I hang out with on the regular (not just in Arma).  If you are lucky to get yourself in a good community then you can have the time of your life.

Gameplay: 
Yeah this games mods and initial concepts are awesome and really fun to play, but it's so fucking buggy. Arma really shows its age. If you play Arma and say ""Wow! Everything is fine!"" then you are a pathological liar, or just really lucky.  The only other thing I would say in terms of game play, do yourself a favor and look through the workshop and find mods that you find fun.

Doing Cool Shit in cool places:
If you just want to feel like a bad ass or really dumb this is the place, some of the moments in this game feel straight cinematic. Despite it's old age, the vanilla maps still are very pretty besides some textures that are on the lower side.  Even when there's nothing going on just being in a visually appealing environment can make you experience that much better. 


Overall rating: 8/10
Would recommend wasting your time on this nightmare of a game.

Overall good game, there are some mistakes bugs but they can pass thru. The biggest problem is that you need to download around 50-70gb of mods to play properly. If you are looking for some good teamwork military simulation and combined arms that's a good choice. The game whit mods add a lot of movement options as well as realism like putting things in vehicles, repairing tires, vehicles.

5705,"I love the community within arma, i've spend many great hours with many great people. The game itself has issues at times, but a great game that allows a lot of cool things."

5707,"Nice, It hurts"
5708,"[h1]Arma 3[/h1]
[hr][/hr]
[u]""These games are getting.. really realistic.""[/u]
Most buggy performance dropping game I've played since Grand Theft Auto 5's terrible online optimization. 
I can confirm that peeking out for 10 milliseconds without anybody suppressing my position and being clapped in one shot is accurate and realistic."
5709,There is always something youll love if u dont like the first thing u try out find some other unit have fun and so on theres guarantee to u liking atleast 1 unit and continue playing
5710,"This game is insanely good. Community is still active, ping is not an issue, good weapon pool and much more! Just buy it right now, cuz it's worth it. It is a bit hard to learn though...


Overall, 7 million/10"
5711,awsome
5712,This is the only game where you can be full on sneaky boi into compound...then you die bc some AI happened to look in your general grid ref blasting you away...but usually a fun story...11/10 would get shit on again
5713,fun
5714,Nice game but very poor optimization... would still recommend it tho.
5715,"if you like mil sim, buy it. you can do anything and its so fun to play."
5716,Want to have PTSD without actually being there? You come to the right game
5717,Great game. I love it.
5718,1
5719,"A large scale customizable military simulation game, play Arma how you want, for a price tag like this you get a game with multiple player communities, frequent updates, and tons of new content. 

Do you want to roleplay join a milsim that fits your preferences or join an Arma life community

Do you want all out works way two there are mods for that, maybe Vietnam there's a CDLC for that. Want fast paced cod like gameplay join a king of the hill server. Want to bomb  cod like players join a king of the hill server and use a tank or airplane and proceed with a relentless bombardment.

This is a great game and might only be bested by it's sequel arma 4."
5720,"love it
"
5721,great game for people who want a somewhat realistic shooter. in my opinion have a group or clan to play with it will be so much more fun.
5722,"got shot by a bush man 40,000 feet away with a magical 9.5mm head popper. he was maybe 4 pixels on my screen. 10/10 wouldn't want it any other way"
5723,mepp
5724, the servers are ass and nobody plays the role play servers at all thats the only part i wanted to play this game just sucks dont wast your money on this or do i cant control what you do
5725,tactics and strategy put to the test on how you can handle being under pressure
5726,amazing
5727,"Great milsim, with incredible mods from the community. With so many guns, vehicles, maps, zeus mission making, the replayability is of the charts.

The bugs are part of the main course though..."

5731,Best tactical FPS
5732,"One of the most milked cows on steam, literally only held above the water by the community. Performance is atrocious even on decent hardware."
5733,I would leave my friends for this game fr
5734,"I'm a simple man. I see Arma, I recommend...

the meme potential in this game is through the roof. Most fun I've had in a game ever"
5735,Fun but over realistic
5736,Find a clan/group and you are golden in this game!
5737,"i can only find enjoyment from eden, whatever"
5738,"This is not a game, it's a simulator. Think of it as DCS but for infantry. From fire team movements to section tactics to platoon sized assaults to Combined Arms operations with APCs, Tanks, CAS and Naval Artillery, ARMA has it all. And that's just the base game. oh and did i mention IEDs?

With mods, you can do realistic reenactments of famous operations like market garden with realistic equipment and accurately recreated maps. You can play as the UNSC, hunting down Covenant elites. Heck, you can even reenact a walking dead episode with the zombie mods or play as a Vietnamese Tiger chewing of american flesh. Someone even recreated COD:MW2 campaign in ARMA which is pretty good.

There's no learning curve in this game, but there's a learning mountain so tall that you might meet Morgan Freeman up there narrating your fails. As of writing this review, I have 563 hrs in ARMA but i'm still running around like a headless chicken with Morgan Freeman up there laughing at my incompetence. 

10/10 would recommend if you enjoy multiplayer military simulators."

5740,hi
5741,gud graphs
5742,GOOD
5743,Clunky movement and keybinds but one of the greatest shooters of our generation. The amount of mods made for this game rivals skyrim. And playing with friends makes for some of the most fun Ive had.
5744,Game hard. Much fun. Many walk.
5745,GOOD
5746,gun goes shooty shooty
5747,this game reminds me of what i did back in angola 07' and yugoslavia 90'
5748,"Challenging but realistic Mil-Sim perfect for beginners that want to get into Mil-Sim games, lots of active servers"
5749,There really is nothing better than committing war crimes against innocent civilians by dropping cluster bombs on the fuckers.
5750,Arma lets you download mods of mods of mods that are nested inside other mods that let you try to do stuff in mods that the mods don't have in the first place. It works 5% of the time for 1% of people.
5751,IT WONT WORK!
5752,Awesome mil sim sandbox engine  B-)  Out of the box A3 doesn't offer as much but with modding the game shines for unlimited possibilities
5753,it is a super fun game with hours of entertainment both with the campaigns and the map editor. You never run out of challenges or new ideas to make and explore.
5754,Originally i thought the game was gonna be some RP game and it is but i thought its gonna be terrible and im just gonna troll and have some fun like that but decided not to and the game is fun when you play along with the RP like its fun to drive an APC or fly an A-10 Warthog and all in all its a good mil-sim game (although if you cant fly a helicopter or plane then let someone who can but if you want to practise you can download some mods to help with that and then practise in the eden editor)
5755,very good game with many diffrent tings and game mods you can do
5756,"Have you ever wanted to simulate numerous crimes against humanity, experience the horrors of war and feel what it's truly like to be a soldier. Well, this game can do that, and that's the reason I and many others have played this game. However, expecting that to happen is a bad idea. A combination of a jank physics engine, dumb players and a malicious Zeus means you will probably not have the full military experience. 

However, that doesnt make Arma a bad game, far from it. Player interaction and the sheer scale of an 8 year old game with decent enough graphics makes it a blast to play. Arma 3 units become a group of close nit dumbasses who joined for the milsim and stayed for the community (probably). Modding is mandatory, vanilla Arma is expensive and no where near as content rich. Trust me, thousands of hours of entertainment await if you hit the right note with this game.

You can also play on public lobbies and experience war crime induced aneurysms and metal insanity through KOTH and Invade and Annex. You could join the ranks of a questionable resistance. Or you could simulate the state of Florida in Altis life (dont). Or you could destroy your will to live while making missions for friends to play, only for them and dumbass AI to ruin your perfectly laid plans.

Arma 3 is worth the purchase. You probably wont regret it"
5757,fun
5758,9/10 its bretty good
5759,"nice one BI, very nice (not)"
5760,Yes
5761,good game nice guns

5764,ffghjkl
5765,"Pretty good, still a noob tho."
5766,Total immersive realism
5767,"Incredibly immersive
graphics STILL hold up."
5768,"I would recommended ARMA to anyone who is looking to play in a community, as I feel that is the biggest draw of the game. The sandbox aspect of this game makes modding really common and you can pretty much find a community for anything. I found a good home and I'm sure you will too!

Keep in mind that this game on it's own is cool and many people enjoy it for what it is without mods, but it is without a doubt a game I come back to because of the mods and the people."
5769,Fantastic game.  You can do anything in Arma.
5770,"GREAT GAME:0
"
5771,"This games content is really good, its vary detailed and has really tangible gameplay, but its super glitchy it need many mods to run more complex opps and has stupid amounts of DLC witch if you use without buying the game will put a watermark over your screen. Get squad instead."
5772,very good game cant help but love it all the way around the island and back
5773,"Can be a fast paced action game, or a skilled base game that requires heavy communication. The story mode is also very good and is a very open game to new people."
5774,Endless fun. Especially wih mods installed. You can play for hours and never play the same scenario twice. And if you join the milsim community it's even more fun!
5775,Such a highly realistic military simulator shooter! I can truly immerse myself as an American soldier pulling up in his fancy german car to the taliban.
5776,"If you have a group of friends to play with, then sky is the limit for this game."
5777,awesome!!
5778,better then destiny i have flawless title you guys are bad 1v1 me smd
5779,"dont be intimidated when you first get the game, just give it some time itll be worth it"

5788,Can't play multiplayer without buying all the DLC... More than 120$ just to play with some friends. Seriously this is bullshit. I can play other game for almost nothing and they are better than Arma 3.

5800,"Just a wonderful game, honestly. mods or not you will have a fun time if you are not a stupid individual."
5801,"Literally spent 8-9 years playing this and Arma 2 on my free time. It has a variety of different gamemodes to play off the bat and if you're still not satisfied the modded community creates enjoyable experiences such as Life RP, WWII KOTH, Star Wars,  Exile and more. Arma 3 vanilla is beautiful, immersive and well worth the money if this is your type of game. There are very few notable bugs but are often caused by lag/desyncing."
5802,I only played the Tutorial
5803,its fun with mods
5804,"It's secretly a dress up game, 8/8 best game. Don't even need to buy any of the DLC to enjoy it there's a fuckton of mods in the workshop."
5805,"Disregard the single player campaigns, scenarios and multiplayer servers. They are not bad, but the scenario editor is much more fun, especially if you download some mods. Just be aware that they are heavy in terms of hard disk memory."
5806,.
5807,after this i went to war....... War Isnt Simillar To This :C
5808,Diese gut Game
5809,"whilst Janky, Arma 3 provides everything you could possibly need to make any type of FPS content you need, at this point i feel like there needs to be an internet rule for ""if you can think of it, theres an Arma 3 mod for it."""

5834,the most boring game shit ever like waht tha fack
5835,"This game is incredible, the vanilla assets alone are fantastic but when you have mods (of which there are literally hundreds of thousands of) it never gets old nor boring as there is always things to do or try. The Eden Editor is amazing too, giving you basically full control of any aspects of a mission."
5836,The game is fun if you like milsim games.
5837,its ok
5838,I think this game is good?
5839,Fun even in 2021
5840,"Alright lets begin. My review about Arma 3.

Hmm where to start.. lets begin with the gameplay itself, this game is very very replay-able the  level of difficulties is very customizable, from easy for beginner to extreme for real veterans. as for me myself i play this game with the level of difficulty at 'normal' and guess what? it's hard af. the gameplay on the story mode is really immersive, the way how u can give orders to ur AI teammates individually is just mind blowing, there's so many ways you can interact with the game, but i have never said the game itself is smart at following what u want them to do. For example, you want your AI to get in the car, you know what they will do? they shoot you. yes you. i don't even know what have happened or what i did to them. It is quite disappointing for the AI itself, but the game? dang i never regret a single buck paying it. Just buy it during the sale. Also expect playing while watching youtube for tutorials, because it is both combat and strategically hard. If you know what you're doing then it would be easy, but if you still need to find a way to play the game, then it would be challenging, not hard. 

Alright next one, public co op or private co op. As for this i can not say much, this is due to the fact that i live on Asia and the server i've been wanting to play to is a north america server, so i always get high pings. This is also a warning for you who wants to buy this game for the online server, make sure that you're in the right region and right server, because it could affect your ping. This game would and will kick you if you have ping above 200.

How about the graphic? well for a game that has been here since 2013 i would say the graphic is magnificent, this is because the developers keep on giving us updates non stop, there's always something to do in Arma 3, no doubt. The map has amazing details, shadow, textures, shadow, and lighting everything is near perfect for a game that's already 8 years old.

im too lazy to write everything and the review i have wrote above is just 1/5 of my total review. So i will state my point. The game is worth it, it is a very replay-able game, so many things to do with various mode of gameplays, also good graphic. My note for all of you is try to buy it on sale since this game might be a little bit off from your expectation both gameplay and difficulties."
5841,"""Get to the choppa!"""
5842,ai go BRRRRRRRRRRR
5843,Amazing game.
5844,mhm yes

5858,"If you want a military simulation game with one of the best moding comunities this is the game for you. It has poor optimisation but what it lacks in preformens it greatly makes up with gameplay, content and a huge list of mods so you can basicly do whatever you want."

5874,a nasa pc wouldnt get more then 40 fps
5875,gud
5876,"Does it have smooth frame rates?
No
Is it bug free?
There are hour long Arma bug meme videos and physics fails about this game on youtube..
Does it have a learning curve?
It is more like a learning cliff, where you will stumble down on your face most of the time
Is it bordering on the real life - level complication?
It depends on how good you are at deciphering many different sights and range finders before you empty a full mag to kill just one enemy soldier against which you still can't accurately calculate the distance to kill

""So why are you giving a positive review"" you ask?

Besides its quirky faults and bugs, this game is the ultimate epitome of the sandbox MilSim legacy of Bohemia Interactive. Not only Arma 3 gave rise to several game genres on its own, like MilSims (Squad/Post Scriptum), Battleroyale (PUBG with PUBG developer starting out as an Arma 3 multiplayer game modder), it also allowed unique customisation options.

The vanilla game version offers you a Singleplayer campaign, Co/op missions, and multiplayer games/missions. You can either create, cooperate and multiplay scripted missions, permanent missions, co-op PVE and PVP missions. Everything you see on the map (and even under the water) is within the game zone; see those distant mountains? You can climb there to get a vantage point on the enemy or carelessly get sniped form there... whilst on foot, driving, flying and swimming, whilst also carrying a wide range of equipment.

And this is not even the best part of it yet:
Arma 3 is very mod and modder friendly, with developers releasing increasingly quality of life and user friendly updates, mod integration and semi-official, themed DLCs. After 7 years the modding community is still up and running.
Want to play as a WW1 trench fighter? a WH40K space marine? a WW3 panzer commander in the 80s? or even go go-karting dressed as My Little Pony? There is possibly a plethora of mods for those, making the sandbox experience unique, and giving the players unlimited creative freedom to create, share and play their own missions/content.

Also has a decent multiplayer community, ranging from retired army corporals shouting in military jargon to ""warcrimes go brrr""-toxicity players, but despite all the flaws i counted, this is one of the games i enjoy playing the most, both SP and MP and has a unique feel."

One of my favorite Sandboxes, played 2 of the Operation FlashPoint games and they're sandbox, but with a good community the game is pretty good, depending on the Servers you use with A3Launcher, and the Mods you do use you can have a experience that most games wouldn't."
5882,Wait for the game and all the DLCs to go on sale and then its worth it. played casually on RP servers for around 300-400 hours and then didn't play the game for awhile then hoped back on and now KOTH consumes my life.

Only thing I could say negative about it is a bug here and there and you need a bit of a more beefy pc to play high frame rate with the distance turned up. But the bugs are pretty rare. And the view distance isn't much of a problem if your're not flying. TL'DR 9/10 one of the best."

Want to be a part of a massive milsim group, practicing squad-based tactics with a set structure of command? There are plenty of units who do just that.
Want to play casual drop-in operations on the weekends with a group of likeminded individuals? There are units for that, too.
Hate interacting with other people and just want to play on your own? Official and fanmade singleplayer campaigns exist and are very good.
At the end of the day, ARMA is whatever you want it to be. There's no right or wrong way to play."

5954,The Best
5955,pog
5956,"if you like military based sims, and wont get butthurt that its actually realistic and difficult, this is the game for you.
"
5957,"As old as this game is, i highly recommend if you wanna just play with your homies and just have fun, love it"
5958,"Obviously, this wins the award for most realistic military game in existence, but it's also really fun. I don't have many friends who play this so having the campaign is handy (firefights are kinda hard with my hardware though because I do not have a fast computer). 

All in all this game is really good (huge download though so make sure you have the patience for an all night download, although that depends on your internet speed) and I would highly recommend this to anyone who has even the slightest interest in this type of game or simulator kinda thing."
5959,war crimes
5960,it may take a little bit to get used to the controls but its really fun and realistic.
5961,Mikem said i have to do this or i dont get any mcdonalds in the basement. 5 out of 5 stars
5962,HELL YEAH I RECOMEND
5963,Walking simulator. Not user friendly. Toxic community.
5964,Its Fucking Awesome
5965,"fun milsim modes + arcade gamemodes
very realism"
5966,"good for war crimes
"
5967,yes
5968,I LIKE THE MODS AND THE WAY THAT THE GAME HAVE BEEN PRESENTED
5969,"Can't say much for the base game but playing in large groups online on ops is loads of fun and you meet some great people. If you're interested in starting with a group with weekly ops check out the 48th mechanised infantry on discord. We're always accepting more members
"
5970,"Imagine you just get of work its 1830 and you hop on arma 3, now you can relax. Except after a long day you spend 30 minutes getting an in game counseling on an Official DA form 4856 from the guy above you in your milsim unit. THE COUNSELING WAS FROM FAILURE TO REPORT when I was still at work in the actual military.... but yea its a great game, with a wide scope of a community"
5971,"Compare to the other games, with the right players it can achieve more, we don't need call of duty fans
to play this game and say, ""Omg this game sux ballz, i cnt run faster, i cant shoot anything omg""
so, if you hate a Real and intense game play don't buy this game, it need communication and team work,
which simply no kid in cod has ever done before"
5972,"Its a god dam good game, if you wanna buy it, and you love military or any kind of guns and fights, buy it!
And join a group, then it is lot easier to have fun and get a lot of friends!"
5973,Too much fun.

5981,Base game is not enought to be able to play with other people and it is a multiplayer game. The game looks awesome but you need a lot of money in order to play the game.
5982,"the game is fluid and enjoyable 
"
5983,"Alright game, personally I didn't enjoy as it was too confusing for me and required a lot of DLC's for it to be fun. If you like games like this I recommend it however it does get boring fairly quickly. If possible I would like a refund.
"
5984,"its just good 
thats all i gotta say"
5985,"The best tactical combined arms experience ever. Wanna drive a tank over the corpses of those who would oppose you? Do you identify as an attack helicopter and desire to rain down hot lead on the dirty masses? Fancy yourself an artillery man, a sniper or a medic or would you rather wage unconventional warfare with IEDs and suicide bombers? ARMA may not look the best, have the best bot AI or have the most intuitive controls but no other game allows you to wage war on your terms.

Bohemia interactive have made this game and offered it to the world. They update the core game, add content regularly but have no objections when the LARGE community of modders, mappers and senario creators add and support the Arma experience. You will find 1000's of hours of game play with more added daily. This is the game that continues to give!"
5986,Best simulator Ive played
5987,"fun
"
5988,runs like doo doo in multiplayer but works well in linux with tweaks and single player campaign and mods all work reasonably fine.
5989,"Great game, funny memes, terrorist simulator and proper milsim all in one."
5990,I lik ie
5991,ive played too many hours into this game. its just fun
5992,"Do not be fooled when this says ""Arma 3"" it's actually Gmod"
5993,The game is good especially with another friend. I really enjoyed messing around on zeus with my friends and playing warlords or domination games.
5994,It's a great game. I just wish you didn't have to pay for the game and then have to pay for DLC's to actually play.
5995,Bro for a multiplayer game they really make it hard to play multiplayer
5996,good
5997,I like to blow people up
5998,To anyone looking to buy this game. The singleplayer situations you can play are fun but are not indicitive of the real game. I honestly suggest watching multiple arma players on youtube and looking for what playstyle looks the most intriguing. When you have identified the playstyle you enjoy I would find a unit that embodies said playstyle because the true magic of this game comes from the utter chaos and fun of having 10 to 50 or more players all trying to complete a task together. Also a great way to meet new people and make new friends. This is a great game if you find the correct community for you.
5999,Fun game to play with a group of people.  This is a much different experience than twitch shooters that rewards planning and teamwork.
6000,Yeah
6001,lazy bunch of developers for the bad optimization.
6002,don't get the base game you wont be able to play on any servers without buying all of the DLC's
6003,"very good and high quality
"
6004,Good game
6005,"I love this game. 1st person shooters with larger maps are fine and all, but this game really does it for me. The community is mostly adults from what I can tell, but that hasn't stopped me from having fun in this game. There are many ways to play, from logistics to acting as close air support, to infantry. Many different play styles are supported through this game. Sure, if you want to try something new, you are definitely going to have to experience a leaning curve, but that's nothing compared to some mods for the game. The modding community for the game a very active, and there is something for everyone. From turning the game into straight up HALO, to smaller things for QOL like workable helmet lights or some prefabs for Editor or Zeus. Of course, some mods focus on realism to the max. Things like realistic starting procedures for F/A-18's or just mods for ambiance such as traffic and other things like that. Another thing to look at is the customization aspect in Arma. The virtual arsenal is a thing that you should first be introduced to in your first minutes on a Zeus multiplayer server, or your first few minutes trying to figure out hoe the Eden editor works. It allows complete customization of things from your weapons, clothes, and gear, all the way down to things like what you want in your gear when you start, like some extra ammo or a few grenades. You might want to watch out for the stamina system though. The more items you carry, the smaller the stamina bar gets. The stamina bar shows you how long you can sprint for, among other things. If you are loaded to the brim with items, you may be slowed to a walk, with no sprint bar. you would have to drop some of your items to get it back. Now here's the only reason that I don't like it. The DLCs are expensive and there are a lot of them. Sure, just don't get the DLC, but its not that simple. A lot of assets in Arma are locked by DLC content. Things from Jets and helicopters, all the way down to simple things such as clothes. It is possible to play Arma without said DLC content, but it is very locked down. If you really want to play Arma at its fullest, then you might want to purchase the DLCs. Other than that little bit, I love the game. It was a wonderful buy. If you are thinking of buying now thanks to my review, I would recommend waiting for a Christmas sale, or another sale. The game itself is worth a pretty penny, but I got it on sale for around thirty dollars. As a little heads-up, the game is set in 2035. That might sound like the content will be super futuristic, but it really isn't as futuristic as you would think. They put it in a semi-realistic perspective on how combat would be in the mid 2030s. Thats all for me, I hope that I shed some light on how the game is going to be for you. If it sounds like a good one, I hope that you would consider buying this game,  but if you don't, I won't hold it against you."
6006,10/10
6007,"ARMA 3 provides a fun and semi-realistic. I have had tons of hours with my friends on here, and I can't wait to start it all again soon!"
6008,The Best Way To Use Up 300GB
6009,"Great Simulation Game campaign is good playing with friends even better, Awesome game Amazing Graphics all around Great package"
6010,"If you enjoy long walks in the hilly country side, or traversing through thick jungle (whilst being shot at by someone you‚Äôll probably never see) then this is the game for you!

I started my Arma 3 journey playing Altis Life with friends, and becoming a Warlord without having to actually commit real life genocide (there‚Äôs still time to check it off the bucket list though). I found it a good place to learn the basic mechanics of the game without the relentless pace of some of the online war modes. It gave me a good chance to practice sniping on moving targets, and learning how to fly Helicopters too.

I genuinely love the fact the community has so many different styles of play, from RP serves like Altis to the full blown Milsim teams, and that the workshop creators are so talented at what they do!

It‚Äôs been a blast (pun intended) thus far, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for the Arma series!"
6011,"Lots of things they could improve on, especially with the UI, but overall an awesome experience when playing with mates, especially with all the mods in the workshop."

Almost untached.

6082,It is confusing and hard to get into especially without an experienced friend to guide you. but it is very realistic and once you get into it it is probably a lot of fun. I just couldnt get to that point.
6083,Only played a couple hours but so far I really enjoy it. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys playing military style games. I've only just gotten into PC gaming recently and this is one of the first games I've bought and so far I'm really enjoying it

6093,quite good so far
6094,"Famous for a reason. ArmA III offers an amazing military sandbox with just the base product, which only gets better with DLCs or mods. The only complaint I really have with it is performance at times."
6095,The best military sandbox ever
6096,if you like milsim games it a good one to get in to
6097,"Best shooter game I have played in my life. 
Makes call of doody and battlefield look like a joke. 
It is a realistic simulator and it is my FAVORITE game of all time. 
DAY Z is also a really good game and second to this, but both are amazing. 
MUST HAVE!"
6098,Its pretty good I guess
6099,This game has great realism and simulations. The maps are really large and beautifully decorated. There is a lot of updates and add on.

6109,its aight
6110,"The game is very good for realism but has a few bugs i would highly suggest it but make sure to get your helicopter and plane settings changed instantly otherwise i wish you good luck. It is good for: Realism, Combat, 3rd person, first person, situations and all around fun."

If you love all era's of battle involving pew pews to laser beams to zombie survival, from small maps to enormous maps, close quarter to a mile away and watching bullet drop to wind effects this is THE GAME to have. This game itself is amazing, BUT the modders have brought so many more worlds to this amazing base game. Dont forget to download A3Launcher! Now get in there and play! This is a MUST for your library! Good luck out there!"

6145,Run and react to combat simulator.
6146,"its a bit lagy but other than that there is something for everyone from hunting zombies to flying a jet and than 
back down to driving a submarine would 100% recommend"
6147,"Amazing game with one of the funnest communities I've ever witnessed, if ur into havin fun with a buncha people i'd 100% recommend this game, if you like going alone its pretty good to but the most fun ive had was with an organised squad."
6148,"came back to this game after years to see how it runs on a better gpu (rtx 2060) than what i had during its prime years, 36 fps is the best i get in the more exciting war crowded areas, the less crowded areas down to the even lesser areas or the ocean where nothing happens goes from 50>80 fps, not worth it unless you want a running or vehicle ""sim"", otherwise the small maps cqc fights are the only way you can enjoy this game, thumbs up just because i know this is a good game and my only issue is the performance"
6149,"My face when, People pay ¬£23.99 for this game"

6155,hated it
6156,Eh
6157,"Well,  when I first started ""bootcamp"" mission, I had thought that I was back in time by 30 years. Completely basic graphics. Do you remember the first Wolfenstein graphics quality 25 years ago ? The very same.... after I quit this mode, I was meaning to play with ""campaign"" missions. Beware, it just happened that the first mission is what ? yes ! Bootcamp again !!!! I managed to change fortunately to mission 2 immediately hoping that quality would change. After a boring conversation on a helicopter, I started my first mission with a truck. I was meaning to check keyboard bindings, but only some special keys I had found. Steerablity of figure is rigid (no 360 degree turnaround possible), not possible to find keyboard keys, the whole game reminded me a forcefully improved game without considering 21st century requirements of game playability, movability, convenience and overall QUALITY of gameplay. I would not recommend it to anyone. In fact, beware of this game unless you would like to frustrate yourself with it. I paid the price, you should not !"
6158,Best open world sandbox warfare game. BUt you can do so much more than just warfare. Love it.

6188,karma
6189,"ARMA? ARMA IS LIFE. Honestly, I bought arma years before I actually was able to get into it. I tried the first time to learn on my own. I am decent at games. However, it was just too much at first, and I just kept dying. So, after spending hours trying to figure out how to get a drone to lift off the ground I gave up. Then years later a tactical buddy of mine that i play fps with told me to join him again only on arma. I am sooooo thankful i did. I dont ever need to play another game again. Seriously, if you are planning on getting this game and know nothing about it. please please trust me on this and find a group on discord or on google somewhere that play arma. thats where its at. you need to find someone who knows what he is doing. thats the only way. Anyone with over 400 hours in should be fine. They will be able to tell you what everything is and it will quickly become muscle memory. Seriously, that is the only way to learn this game. Theres too much going on to not get involved with the arma community. There are people from every country. You need to google the servers and find your group. they will teach you. There are countless groups everywhere for arma. Its a techs game. So, they spread themselves out over a whole bunch of gaming communication apps. Like discord. Just google them its easy and find someone mature ussually an admin of one of the servers to set you up to have someone show you the ropes. Its the most realistic military game to date. As far as simulators go. SO, you need to get involved with the community. Other than that advice. I have to say that arma is like real life. My options are endless because of the modding community connected to the game. I can create any scenario i want. I can play anything i want. But i had to really learn my character first. Being an advanced FPS in other games i knew the most important thing was learning how to make my character work. So really i spent about 300 hours perfecting that to really really get to know my character. And now im perfecting it. Another note. Make sure you try the old man scenario. Its a great way to get to know your character and the weapons and game mechanics since the scenario is free roam. If you dont have the apex dlc get it. also, if there is any dlc you dont have just get it. its worth it. The game is absoloutly amazing. But you need to follow my instructions or you can easily get overwhelmed and give up. Its critical to have someone who already knows the game a bit to help show you the ropes so you can start to learn on your own. even just a couple sessions with guys like that will be enough. alright. thanks for joining our community!"
6190,Such an awesome Mil Sim for an older game.  The Mods are extremely well done with all the hard work of those Dev's  KARMAKUT is one of the best!  Love playing this for hours!
6191,"Man, this is a good game. Base campagn aint the best, but everything is else is really good.  From the 1100 hours I have played, the majority has been in the Zeus mode. Im not gonna spoil anything, cause you should go play it for yourself."
6192,it is very hard but if you love realistic army games I would recommend.
6193,"Long time player,love it and will keep playing it and arma 4 when its out,been here since cold war assault,good times."
6194,"You will spend an egregious amount of time wasting your life away... only to find out... all of the progress you have made, in every and any server has been wiped away, You will die because the universe commands it, you will fly (and then die) because the universe demands it.

Long story short, you will be milked for money and advertised to oblivion, and for some reason, you will continue to play..."
6195,It's fun. probably one of the best mil-sims out there
6196,"good game with good mods
"
6197,"By far one of my favorite sandbox games of all time. It all started with Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and the DayZ mod because the modding communities owned it by bringing life into these games. Its insane what you can do with the editor. Download the community version of Antistasi or download Vindicta and grab a couple of friends, you won't regret it.

Don't buy this game for its singleplayer campaign or default items (in my opinion), buy it for the modding community. The developers make a lot of regular players mad because many things need to be improved upon and fixed but never seem to be touched and just ignored. Bohemia, please listen to us because your game is important for the reasons above.

If you can look past the bad stuff here and there, this game is one of the greatest sandboxes in existence right now."
6198,you have to play with people. people suck
6199,"just yes that is all

6234,"Game is ok, but salts and mod death are killing this"
6235,"horrible game, don't let your friends drag you into it, sucks the life right out of you. Being in A Unit is kinda fun, but only if it's a semi-milsim and your friends are in it. DON'T LET THIS GAME RUIN YOUR LIFE LIKE IT DID MINE. It takes up way too much of your time and you have to be dedicated."
6236,"game's badass. you can mod the hell out of it, and it never gets old. only wish the base game wasnt so large... I had to upgrade the storage on my computer just to download it once... still a badass game tho.

6241,I love this game
6242,"after 1000 freaking hours id say time well spent, one of the most custimizable and scalable military sandboxes ever, i always find myself coming back to enjoy another lovingly made community scenario or mod, or even goof around in editor, all my time has been singleplayer/coop but theres even many good dedicated server for those into that playstyle. Overall great clunky game, just gotta get apex dlc to really enjoy which can be a little pricey for some if not on sale."
6243,it can be a bit glitchy but loving it so far
6244,"Posted: 28 December, 2015
Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with Arma 3, I would certainly recommend it to others.

If you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!"

6256,"Absolute classic, one of the most diverse games in the world. You can remake almost any game in this bad boy, due to the sheer shit loads of mods. So in conclusion buy this game, and every DLC, after which make sure to go harass the devs for Arma 4."

6264,"Arma 3, wow wow wow. i mean, Great game. it definetely takes a while to really get into this game and learn all the controls. I mean, I only recently found out how to climb over fences. And trust me its a real pain having to run all the way around a 200 meter long fence if there are tanks firing at you and enemies running at you from all sides. I also absolutely love how free and interactive this game is. other games cannot relate, like battlefield v. anyways. anyone out there looking for a sandbox war game. this is definetely the game for you. 10/10"

6296,"Arma 3 is an incredible game with plenty of content thanks to the modding community. There's plenty of hours of fun, especially if you've got friends to play with. Overall, it's worth the money, though without Apex you'll be missing half of the game."
6297,yes

6299,"Gun go pew, very fun"
6300,"This is the cream of the crop when it comes to mil-sims/FPS. Bullet-drop and different penetration for various rounds are all modelled. Using the In-game editor makes a never-ending stream of new missions a real possibility. Multiplayer is a blast, especially King of the Hill. Get ARMA 3 today."

6307,Best milsim
6308,"Very realistic War game! The details of each weapons and the mods  make this game  the best for people that enjoy war and war stuff. Syria.irak.usa.russian, any faction can be put in the game and thats what make arma 3 one of the best milsim ever. Each operation is different each mods and each faction. When bored to play with a faction just switch to others and have fun. Arma is the technoligical adavance that was needed into milsims. screw squad arma is here for stay forever"
6309,Love this game. Would fly a pawnee or littlebird for 3000+ hours again!  Bullets go through walls. 6.5 mm and up. Spray and pray! Bipods are good.

6326,I guess I like this game.
6327,stonks
6328,"If you want a hold-your-hand, 'show you the way' game, this is not for you. This is a nitty gritty sim that demands solid time and effort into learning the controls and environment for. It is a sandbox on a whole nother level. Build/buy a head tracker, it's SO useful.

Flight and infantry simulation is the best out there, bar none. Keep in mind what you're firing, because bullet drop and material penetration are important factors. 

Mods and scenario creation is a strong suit of Arma 3.  Huge 50v50+ battles with tanks, anti-armor, helis, planes, you name it, it's possible. 

Very challenging game, will send shivers up your spine when you hear the bullet crack near you and will get your heart pumping trying to survive in a no BS milsim."

6339,DLCs with customized maps
6340,best game ever recommend to everyone
6341,"1.487,8h. Can only recommend this game for everyone who is into realistic shooter/military simulations. Even though the tank dlc kinda made the new tanks op. 
"
6342,it is a good game if you know how to play it
6343,"ArmA III is ultimately meant for people who are less interested in fluid FPS gameplay and more in war simulation, for which it has a wide variety of assets to choose from to create almost any kind of battle, limited only by the maps (which compensate for this fact by being absolutely massive). It also allows for people with coding and programming skills to utilize them in creating scenarios. For those who are less capable, or want more fluid control, the Zeus free DLC allows for a game master to control the scenario more directly."
6344,god its so garbage i cant play the game half the time so many dumb errors
6345,im still learning with this mil-sim with everything there is its gonna be a while before id be able to say its boring or that i know everything about this game great job to the dev team and independent mod creators
6346,Yeah it's pretty fun
6347,Started a rebellion for no reason. 10/10 Would start a rebellion for no reason again.
6348,....this
6349,chill game :)
6350,Best combat simulation game I have ever played.
6351,very good
6352,Just stay in formation
6353,i dont like this game so bad
6354,"For a game that came out in 2013, its beyond amazing game, yes it has its bugs and glitches, and the fact the Devs have gave on this game awhile ago and now third party devs making DLCs for this game. And for that, Mods have kept this game alive completely. I have benched and played for hours at a time with only 34 so far, but its been addicting in every way, when PvE is an option or PvP its great to change things up constantly. With over a 100 Key bindings to learn, it can be a bit much to learn, especially when you playing solo, i had a friend teach me most of what i know and its been a blast even if im killed constantly.
If you wanna kill time and just mess around with friends or even randoms on the many different kind of servers then get this game.
Unless you have DLCs it can be a pain to play, for any use of DLC items you will get a water mark on your screen at all times and random pop ups to buy said DLC, and the fact you cant fly, or drive certain things that are DLC but can fly as passenger only. So just wait as the Packs go on sale often and its a worthwile buy.
Ok Lol, I think im done XD"
6355,it doesnt run great but boy is it fun especially if you like mil-sims
6356,"This game is definetly not worth your money, but it is absolutely worth your time"
6357,"I was having fun until I finished the single player campaign and realized how lonely i was 
"
6358,greatest fps out
6359,its fun...
6360,"With a strong modding community, if there is a part of the game you don't like, YOU CAN CHANGE IT!  Is there a type of combat or battle you like?  It's here!"
6361,Gud Game. Your graphics cards will never be enough to get above 40 fps.
6362,GOOD GAME!! WILL RUN AT 30FPS
6363,its pretty fun
6364,"This game can be incredibly immersive and the community are so down to play full on Mil-sims. Granted it is Very difficult at the beginning for learning all the key combinations but the longer you play the more you love it and before you know it, it has been two weeks and you missed your own wedding."
6365,Proper Military Simulator.  This is as close as it gets to the real thing.
6366,best shooter in existance
6367,"Great game some bs here and their, would recommend"
6368,The best game i ever play. No doubt
6369,"good game good head 

"
6370,"Honestly, this is the best game I have ever played. 10/10 100% no ifs ands or buts. If you are sick and tired of inaccurate representations of combat in cartoony games like the new ""Battlefield"" and ""Call Of Duty"" games. You should buy and play ARMA as soon as practicable. If you want something you can edit and create, unfathomable Mod/editor support and you can still have fun with, you have got to play ARMA."
6371,excellent game
6372,dank
6373,"Always mixed combat situations, interesting and great with friends,"
6374,"On of the most realistic military games out there. I highly, highly recommend. (If you are thinking it's just another COD, you are surly mistaken)"
6375,"best sandbox game. large workshop and many gamemodes. user experience will vary, but at its worst arma is still my favorite game"

6386,i LOVE THIS GAME ONLY TOOK A DAY TO GET USED TOO
6387,"I wake up
I shoot civilian
I sleep
Life is good"
6388,"Arma 3 is simply put one of the best military role-play games ever made. It might not be the most polished, have the smoothest animations, or what have you but this is totally made up for by the amazing breadth the game can cover and its openness to modding and content creation by the community. There is no other game like Arma 3, and I doubt anyone could do better than Bohemia in creating a game like this."
6389,"Best game ever
"
6390,Great game for those who enjoy Mil-sims.

6403,good game :)
6404,"If you are looking for a more thoughtful shooter, this is it. This is not for people that twitch and shoot."
6405,good
6406,Great community. once you find a good server it's a great time. needs a few good people to play with though.

6415,You get blown up by f22 jets all day
6416,Unfriendly AF! Worst game ever. And no support from the devs. Ain't worth the money.
6417,great game love it
6418,It's about as fun as the real thing.
6419,"a great game with everything you need. i played about 50 hours in multiplayer with no mods/little  knowledge and got bored, then i learnt how to use the editor to make whatever i fancied, install mods and joined a milsim unit, now has got to be my favourite game. you can create any scenario you want, and if there isnt a gun,plane or tank in the game you want, download a mod and youll have it like that. really friendly community and one out there for everyone and i hope to play it a lot more. the only downside is that its a bit intimidating with all the controls/functions, but you learn. 10/10"
6420,Watch as your retarded NPC squad mates stand right infront of an IFRV becuase you forgot to tell them that you should not be standing upwards directly infront of a 20MM autocannon-simulator
6421,"I distinctly remember the time me and a friend were playing Antistasi, a rebel game mode. It was just us on the server; and while we didn't have much, we had acquired an overseas weapons shipment FULL of anti-material rifles. 
I remember spending two hours of my life on a hilltop. He was firing his .50 BMG rifle into a town full of cop that had two humvees.  We were looking to take a VIP from the town. I was ferrying ammo in-between joining him in his firing.
Eventually, we cleared the entire town of cops, and we moved in, only to realize the VIP left half an hour ago.

9/10 HIGHLY recommend if you like milsim. DLC can be annoying but mods make it irrelevant would be my only notable criticism, since the game can be modded an incredible amount. It's the perfect game for milsim audiences, and it nails the immersion (And unintended comedy with getting ArmAd) perfectly."
6422,can even join a server without dlc
6423,y e s
6424,kinda fun with friends
6425,"Leading the way in military simulation since Operation Flashpoint. This is not an action game, it is a simulation. If you can't be patient, don't bother with this simulation, play a game. If you're not looking for a kill counter that increases by 10 per minute, you've come to the right place.

When you dive into this simulation you will learn why people fear war and soldiers want peace more than anything else. In the coop you can learn what camaraderie means.

********************

Seit Operation Flashpoint wegweisend in der Milit√§rsimulation. Dies ist kein action Spiel, es ist eine Simulation. Wenn Du keine Geduld aufbringen kannst, solltest Du Dich nicht mit dieser Simulation befassen, sondern ein Spiel spielen. Wenn Du keinen Killcounter suchst der pro Minute um 10 ansteigt, bist Du hier aber richtig.

Wenn Du in diese Simulation eintauchst erf√§hrst Du, warum Menschen den Krieg f√ºrchten und Soldaten sich den Frieden nichts sehnlicher w√ºnschen als alles Andere. Im coop kannst Du erfahren, was Kameradschaft bedeutet."
6426,very gud
6427,good content but a little bit of a learning curve that im still not over yet i would recomend this game to people who like realism or rpgs the community is good for the most part

6439,"Its a chill decent game with friends and by yourself
"
6440,Cool funny game were you shoot people or something.
6441,"AFter years of watching the likes of Jester814, Rimmy, etc. play this game I was finally able to get a pc and try it for myself. This game is insane - the sheer number of options the player has when constructing missions, being able to conduct pretty realistic combat operations in most sci-fi universes via the steam workshop, and the requirement of many hours to learn whatever role fits your play style (pilot, tank commander, etc.) all combine into a brilliant Sandbox experience that no matter what I play, I always come back to it"
6442,its fun
6443,Enjoy the game. Way too many bundles for content O.O
6444,"Arma is a very misunderstood 'game'.  It's not completely a game, per se.  It's a sandbox, that you can use to build custom scenarios to play in.  If you understand that aspect, you will enjoy Arma a lot.  If you're looking for COD or BF, this is not it."
6445,"very fast pace, twitch game, dislike."
6446,Games dope
6447,Outside of physical movement this is total immersion into world of realism.

6472,!!!!!!!
6473,"Okay, ArmA 3 is a perfect game to play with friends. the community is fantastic and it is great to see that many people like ArmA 3. I personally think that slow paste shooters are very fun and ArmA is a slow paste shooter so that is a big plus. Many people that I know like when the gameplay is very fast paste so for them this is not the game."
6474,Its a great military game

6480,"Does Arma 3 have its issues? Lots lemme tell ya
Can the community be a bunch of snowflake soldier wannabes sometimes? Don't argue with loud squad leaders!
Does the AI sometimes resemble a monkey with his brains scooped out? Yeah they aint the sharpest

But god damn! This game gives an experience that no other game could possibly come close too. You're not just buying a multiplayer experience, but hundreds of quality coop and singleplayer hours.The ability to customize every little aspect of the game just makes it an endless amount of fun. It's a one time purchase to something that never runs out of content. The workshop is absolutely insane as well!!"
6481,fun but hard
6482,It is very good to see things blow up in Arma 3 and have ears go deaf and ring when volume is loud so plz beware of PTSD and chaos.
6483,"one of the best shooter games, best played with a milsim group. you can find most off of reddit!"
6484,this game is so old that i stopped playing it. looks like its 20 years old. loved it back in the day but it needs a serious update. so so cluncky. will look at it when they release Arma 4. please use the Unreal engine.
6485,
6486,"weah

6489,Fucking Awesome
6490,totally sick bruh
6491,"Best army game for Military lovers. There you can find from tanks, snipers, rifels, helicopters almost every army gear but with mods this game is best. Game is hard from start and take time to learn, but when you learn it you can play game nonstop. I will recommend you buy this game. really good"
6492,good
6493,Reall war
6494,great game quite buggy tho
6495,"This game is so challenging and ever changing.  It's like having all the different era shooters in one game, just a click away from tons of fun and face palming!"
6496,GG
6497,just yes.
6498,good
6499,Top
6500,"Great game, well worth buying you can play anything from full milsim to a zombie infested map the choice is yours"

Whenever I want to get shot in the butt, I play Arma 3
Whenever I want to find my opponents, they find me as I play Arma 3
If you Ever not want to find your enemies as they have been trained the ways of the assassin, Play Arma 3.
If you want to get good at Shooting Games, Play Arma 3.
If You want to get shot and not know where it came from, I'll be there to hear your pain as I load another round into the chamber, aim, and pull my trigger; the bullet directed at your other butt cheek. Play Arma 3."
6513,eeh not as good as ww2.
6514,It good
6515,"Haven't got many hours, but the game is fun and ejoyable"
6516,if you can walk around for hours as a infantry get this gaMe
6517,Enjoyed the game it's kind of like a warzone simulator. For the vets it's like the milsims.
6518,nice game
6519,Its a fun game with open world PVE and PVP. They just need to improve there ai's by a lot. Its annoying to make a convoy with them cause they do random stuff then they do it. Sometimes not even that. I usually have to delete them cause there taking so long to do the right thing. Also the AIs have a somewhat slow reaction time or just completely ignore the enemy which is annoying as well. But ya.. I love this game.
6520,"The game is very good and very immersive. Totally recommend to find a good community (I was lucky and I found a great community) to play which are using mods (ACE mod completely changes how the whole game is played!). That being said, the game can have a lot of bugs and very poor performance, even in modern Ryzen CPUs. Unlike most games, they can be ignored and it may not always be fun, it gets more and more interesting each time you play and it gets harder and harder as you learn to really play each role in a team. 

TL;DR Totally recommend it if you belong in an ARMA community, it could have bad performance but it's easily ignored! 8/10"
6521,is good
6522,Okay so arma itself ... i wouldnt play. Now on the other hand with Mods its much more tolerable and fun
6523,ass
6524,Its best modern military game I have played so far.
6525,pog game should join tsi
6526,best milisim av played
6527,very enjoyable if you like milsim games

6530,"psst hey you there do you like the military? do you like guns? helicopters,planes,jets,tanks,etc.? and are you a control freak? do you like playing god? simulation huh? then you've come to the right place :D Arma 3 is in other words a military sandbox which has a huge amount of workshop content. enjoy you military enthusiasts. :>"
6531,"Worst game, loved it"
6532,The ultimate game of where's waldo.
6533,MOD
6534,"One of the most realistic ""ground pounder"" simulation out there. Sometime too realistic.  But fun to play solo as well as online.  Two thumbs up."
6535,"A realistic large scale military shooter which makes you feel like another Soldier, Airman, Sailor, or Marine, on a massive battlefield, during huge campaigns or smaller incursions. The game has amazing modding capabilities to turn it from a near future to a modern, WWII, WWI, or Cold War setting. Making the game very versatile and satisfy the realistic large scale all out war itch."
6536,"Do you want a tactical sandbox game? This is the one for you. It might not run well, might not have the best AI, might not have the best animations, textures, or graphics. But you'll have some of your most memorable gaming experiences on this, whether it's just dicking around with the bois, playing king of the hill or wasteland, or staging a full on milsim invasion, this game will bring you good times."
6537,great game
6538,Very cool
6539,even tho it is a great war simulation its not recomended and defenetly not without friends you just walk around 50v50 impossible to know who your teammate is so 80% of deaths are from friendly fire it takes so long to find a game the map is so big you cant find the enemy
6540,Bruh
6541,¬¨
6542,"Very realistic! Great content, would recommend for anyone moving from battlefield or CoD as it gives players a realistic and wipe ranged gameplay!"
6543,warcrimes are funny
6544,"No B bombsite, it's nowhere to rush!"
6545,"Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions."
6546,I am wanted by the UN for multiple warcrimes.
6547,great game
6548,"Once patrolled German held territory during a WWII operation with a platoon.
Here is our story.

1. Encountered German patrol.
2. Our designated medic was drunk.
3. The germans disappeared briefly *Cue a moment of peace*
4. The god **** panzer division rolled up.
5. We learnt that our medic was better at being a medic whilst drunk.
6. She got shot. ****.
7. We drag her away from the kill zone and escape into the country side, never to return.

6553,"It's a great and fun game! i have now over 40 hours in this game I would recommend this game.
i just wish you didn't have to purchase all the dlc.

ps of ur planning on buying the game wait for it to be on sale, it goes on sale around twice a month."
6554,If you are into military fps than this is for you. The single player mode is pretty lackluster. so i would just recommend playing it with friends or just playing random online servers. Also i highly recommend also buying the Marksman DLC pack because it adds some pretty awesome guns. also helicopters and jets are just really fun to fly in
6555,My most played game. Physics are meh sometimes. but 10/10 game
6556,Im just getting into this game

6558,fun game
6559,the got
6560,"GOOD
"
6561,"outdated, buggy, slow and just generally a bad game

but hey at least theres lots of mods"
6562,"I have a lot of hours in this game, it is great. The base game is decent and a lot of fun can be had with it, but the real fun comes when you have all the mods and the big community. The community is certainly not as big as it used to be, but there are still plenty of friendly units that run missions and if you aren't into the PVE stuff you can do PVP or you can go play on Roleplay servers. There is just a lot to do. There are TONS of mods for the game and now there are Creator DLC's. The Creator DLC's are mostly hit or miss, some like SOG Praire Fire are absolutely amazing and completely redefine the entire game and make it fresh, new and interesting. While others aren't as great. This game has a steep learning curve and the controls are clunky for those coming from mainstream FPS games but it is well worth it. This is truly one of the best if not THE best military sandbox game available."
6563,Great game play if you can get the right multiplayer crew! Come join PTF!!!
6564,Alpha bravo six dark going seven.
6565,Nice game

chinese very super intelect.
but campaings in game designed by yanks useless.
the yanks have destroyed this game, as they still cant program a pc after 40 years.
any chinese and russians servers around to play on, 
need to play with people around the world who use thier intelect unlike yanks who do things childish way.
Great games on russian servers and many diff types games on superior intelect chinese and japanese servers

6578,"Arma 3 While being pretty old now, 8 Years old to be specific. It's still relatively modern and keep up to speed with mods making it always a blast. Some hurdles with it is optimisation is not bad. But not great. Usually at least with not that many AI You can get 30-60 FPS Constantly depending on your specs. Some devices can dive as deep as 15 if they are a bad Laptop or have non-gaming spec's. Most gaming PC's can run about 100 AI v 100 AI When unmodded and be fine during the fight in most cases. But mods can really hinder performance but you can't really play without them as they improve the gameplay 10-fold. Mods should be noted, aren't like some other games where they add in MUST HAVE Features that for some reason, weren't added. Instead the mods branch out for example more realism with things like Ace, Then you got more mod's that have different settings and add in different faction's from different era's or games. It's like downloading a whole new game when you enable a few mods which is fantastic. Sadly performance can drop quite a bit if you aren't careful but it's pretty good at staying away from turning down right awful on the performance side of things with mods, Which some other thing's aren't able at doing. Speaking about performance surprisingly there are very few to no crashes during game play.. Don't let that fool you bug's still exist. But they aren't too bad. Unless if you don't like being flung into orbit as if it's Skyrim and a giant just hit you. Game play length wise it's pretty good. You got give or take maybe about 5 hour's of campaign from the dev's base-game without mods. Now Mod's can add technically, infinite amount of game play potential, not to mention multiplayer which has all sorts of game modes and the sort. So I'd say it's even worth full price to buy Arma 3. Although I wouldn't say waiting for a sale is a bad move or anything but you get your money's worth when you buy Arma 3. Now. I have to mention one.. Small problem for many. A Huge problem for some. The AI. It's a dreaded concoction, Ever thought AI in other games are bad? Wait till you get to Arma 3's AI. They are going to be so bad it's not even funny. But don't worry. Once you learn how to make AI Properly in the editor and use them properly? They get alot better. Add on mods? And they are just as good and sometimes better then player's. Anyway. Basically what I'm trying to say is.. If you somehow haven't bought Arma 3 Yet? Do yourself a favour and get it. I think you aren't going to regret it. Oh but be wary of the HUGE STORAGE SPACE it takes up. Like YIKES man."
6579,"Arma 3, I played it for a bit. The campaign is good, it really throws you into the situation and you don't expect a lot of things to happen or go downhill so fast. I would give examples but I don't want to spoil it for some. On the other hand, multiplayer servers are my problem. When I hop on an average multiplayer server, it's mostly people fucking around. There is no organizational structure, there is no solid purpose or understanding of the mission. The confusion it creates I do not appreciate. For example you get to the objective or fight mostly as an individual warrior, not a soldier like a cog in a war machine which is a military force. When you ask ""What's the plan?"" or ""What are we doing?"" you simply get the response ""Killing the enemy"" or something around the lines of that most of the time. This is common in most games, but the reason I stress this for Arma 3 is because of how much people claim the game to be realistic or like a military simulation, which is why I am disappointed. 

My second complaint is graphics, for a game released in 2013 that was a finished product this would be understandable, Arma 3 was released in 2013, but it's essentially not a finished product, the developers still release content for the game. With the lower quality graphics it makes it harder to enjoy the game and brings the feeling of immersion down by reminding you it's just a simulation. 

To conclude while the campaign was done good and enjoyable, the multiplayer experience did not deliver the hard core coordinated military force I expected and the graphics let me down in immersion. Squad, while still having it's own faults, trumps Arma 3 in the general unit experience."

6584,i shot the brittishmobile's tyres then i got gunned down by my teammates
6585,Such a Nice game i have been having fun playing it RECOMMENDED
6586,It's a great milsim game. The last iteration of this game I played was operation flashpoint and this is leagues above that.
6587,It was fun
6588,"From playing as a terrorist destroying the streets of Takistan to a S.O.G group going over the wire inserting themselves in a conflict against the Vietcong. This game truly offers an immersive experience of any conflicts over the past century. Whether you are a role-player or a MilSim Operator this is really the perfect game for everyone.

Have another like 3-4k hours on this game on my alt account. Very Replayable."
6589,i love hitting objects with vehicles and being volunteered into space x
6590,i like the game :()
6591,"There is a LOT to learn about Arma 3. The massive amount of YouTube tutorials and forums online can help, but there is still a lot you might have to learn by yourself or from friends. The campaigns are pretty good so far, but Arma 3 shines mostly with the custom missions. The editor, much like the base game, has a LOT to learn. There are some things you can only set with coding. But overall, this is super fun."
6592,good
6593,yes
6594,Very Good Warcrime Simulator
6595,gud gam
6596,A great game that continues to get support and DLC's even after all these years. I started back in 2015 playing this game and it was a blast to play on some Mil Sim servers and Altis Life servers. I took a break for school and came back in 2020 to pick it up again. All of the DLC's add something to the game that is fun and enjoyable. Playing Altis Life I RP as a medic a lot and some of the newer vehicles are great for that. When playing as a rebel you also have a lot more to choose from now and you really can deck yourself out however you like. If you enjoy the challenge of a mil sim this game can satisfy that.
6597,"yes is fun

6602,"[h1] Overview [/h1]
ArmA 3 is a highly realistic military simulation game. Note military simulation, in the sense that you can simulate conflicts and whatnot. This is not a military ""simulator"" as some would claim. It simply is not that realistic in some details to hold up to that term. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
Honestly pretty mediocre, the futuristic setting is a 50/50. It is evident that the developers went on vacation in Greece and just kinda decided to put it in the game and then made a half assed story to back it up. It's average, some like it and a lot of people don't. Luckily you can download lots of missions/stories/campaigns to fit yourself.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Difficult, tactical and sometimes frustrating. But ultimately rewarding. Contrary to what many say, the AI is good. Playing singleplayer is definitely viable (thats what I did). The editor is easy to learn and you can set up nearly any kind of mission imaginable. Multiplayer is a hit and miss. Many servers run really poorly and lots of communities/groups are grown men pretending to be in the military. Very cringy. But you can find lots of groups that are chill and relaxed and do more than the usual US vs Taliban mission every single day. 

[h1] Graphics/Performance [/h1]
The game looks good for it's time and age. Even today it looks very up to date. Unfortunately this comes at a cost. This game runs poorly and maintaining 60 fps is a struggle. Some will say get a better PC, some will say try this try that. But honestly the game itself is poorly optimised. Some folks with worse PCs run with better FPS than the other way around. 

[h1] Community [/h1]
Great community with lots and lots of content. Mods for almost anything. This is where the game shines. WW2? There's a mod for that. Cold War? Yes. Pretty much any other conflict? Yep. This is definitely a sandbox. You can make it into whatever you want with some limitations.

[h1] Additional info [/h1]
None.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
I recommend this game. I enjoyed it and people who like tactical/simulation shooters with a sandbox will enjoy this.

6608,"While it might be a hard game to get into, when you do, it's a joy to play. There is a single player campaign, but the real show here for most people will probably be the multiplayer.

The thing is, getting into a multiplayer game and having fun might be a big chore when getting started, with many servers requiring specific mods or joining some clan to play, but it's possible to get into the game without any mods at all.

Two servers I've really liked and recommend for beginners are the 77th JSOC Invade and Annex, as well as CodeFourGaming's King of the Hill servers.

In addition, the huge modding scene and built-in Eden editor allow for hours of fun times just messing around offline, or even creating some serious missions for you to play in.

Good to keep in mind, that sometimes the game runs really poorly, even on medium range hardware, but other than that, it's quite a fun experience.

Recommend to anyone looking to get into milsims!"
6609,hhmmm
6610,gud mil sim
6611,Good Game. (with mods)
6612,"Worst game ever made. Too glitchy, too difficult, doesn't tell you what to do. Unable to continue missions. Couldn't even shoot straight due to the game's design."
6613,I think it is funny to play Arma and team kill people... AMAZING REACTIONS!!
6614,"good
"
6615,"i paid for alot of this game and DLC and it's been absolutely amazing, this game and community is great lord knows i need some of the mods parts of the community use in multiplayer, but for the most part the single player campaign is just as great to play and actually pretty good, compared to other games that have been released."
6616,If you like flying in to Hot zones and jumping out a heli with your buddies and destroying shit this game is for you
6617,ace mod good :)
6618,"Arma is one of those games that appears simple, yet there's so much more to it. The actual campaign itself is a fairly straightforward war story, and anyone who has played a military shooter in the last two decades knows what to expect going in. 
Where this game shines is the multiplayer community. No other game offer the sheer amount of potential for absolutely anything you could dream of in a military simulation. From massive team games with every military firearm and vehicle you could think of, to insane community mods that add everything from the Clone Wars to Halo, if you've ever dreamed of playing in a setting in a massive open world, you'll find it here. The community is massive and ever-growing, and generally is welcoming and offers hours of tutorial, training, and boot camp missions. Check you youtube for endless videos and find communities to get you started!"
6619,its good

6644,"Absolutely fun, this is one of the very few games that I can play for hours and still look forward for more.  It is not your typical action or hero-inspired games where you can be a bullet sponge and take hits after hits.  You can literally play on some single payer missions or scenarios for hours and not see any action, only to be dead in a second after being a bit careless.

You can't go guns blazing in this game at all, you need to use your brain, the environment, and the resources you have at hand.  This is why I love every second of playing ARMA 3."

6652,"i love how the game functions as a whole, it is perfect for war simulation and rein-acting your favorite battles, overall it is my favorite game."
6653,"You can walk, fly, swim, drive, shoot, make much noise and damage, camouflage and be cool. Closest to military except be in the army itself, only now you are home with Christmas and in the weekends if you want. Closest, because you can learn something about the military, practising it, enjoy (or harshen) the culture, explore and did I already say shoot and explode things? Vanilla has great campaigns/showcases/scenarios amd modding is....whatever you want. Left for dead? Its there. Halo? Its there. More campaigns? From Arma 1 and 2? Its all there. Its great."

6663,"This game's control schemes are dog water, way too many controls that interfere with each other and switching to controller will not help because it's much worse. Most of the time you will not be able to find a server to connect to anyways. I have 6 hours on this game and only 1 of those hours was actual gameplay the rest of it is me trying to either find a match or optimize the garbage controls for myself."

6678,"Run 1km for 30 minutes, because your stamina is that of a 70 year old chain smoker with asthma, and then get one-shotted from god knows where.

VERY FUN"
6679,"No, I just want to push the thumbs up."
6680,this game is shit.
6681,"While the base game is a lot of fun, ARMA's true power lies in it's various communities of players and modding abilities. I've clocked almost 600 hours in this game and stopped playing it for a year to come back just tonight and have a blast of a time! Join a good group of folks and enjoy the scenarios they cook up!"
6682," Does it have smooth frame rates? 
No 
Is it bug free?
There are hour long Arma bug meme videos and physics fails about this game on youtube..
Does it have a learning curve? 
It is more like a learning cliff, where you will stumble down on your face most of the time
Is it bordering on the real life - level complication?
It depends on how good you are at deciphering many different sights and range finders before you empty a full mag to kill just one enemy soldier against which you still can't accurately calculate the distance to kill

""So why are you giving a positive review"" you ask?

Besides its quirky faults and bugs, this game is the ultimate epitome of the sandbox MilSim legacy of Bohemia Interactive. Not only Arma 3 gave rise to several game genres on its own, like MilSims (Squad/Post Scriptum), Battleroyale (PUBG with PUBG developer starting out as an Arma 3 multiplayer game modder), it also allowed unique customisation options. 

The vanilla game version offers you a Singleplayer campaign, Co/op missions, and multiplayer games/missions. You can either create, cooperate and multiplay scripted missions, permanent missions, co-op PVE and PVP missions. Everything you see on the map (and even under the water) is within the game zone; see those distant mountains? You can climb there to get a vantage point on the enemy or carelessly get sniped form there... whilst on foot, driving, flying and swimming, whilst also carrying a wide range of equipment.

And this is not even the best part of it yet:
Arma 3 is very mod and modder friendly, with developers releasing increasingly quality of life and user friendly updates, mod integration and semi-official, themed DLCs. After 7 years the modding community is still up and running.
Want to play as a WW1 trench fighter? a WH40K space marine? a WW3 panzer commander in the 80s? or even go go-karting dressed as My Little Pony? There is possibly a plethora of mods for those, making the sandbox experience unique, and giving the players unlimited creative freedom to create, share and play their own missions/content.

Also has a decent multiplayer community, ranging from retired army corporals shouting in military jargon to ""warcrimes go brrr""-toxicity players, but despite all the flaws i counted, this is one of the games i enjoy playing the most, both SP and MP and has a unique feel.

6753,"I will explain the performance I am getting.  Game is good, yes, but performance is the ugly head which never goes from view.  If you like the game you will need to suffer this.  

I have played this for longer than 30 hours, trust me and I have all the dlc and I do like this game but they seriously need to improve its performance when they get the new engine up and going, if not for the next game fine, but for this one as well.  People legitimately need an extra 40% for this engine if they are to have the goodwill I believe of the next title should that title come.  This game engine is in huge need of a modern core-update.  Just a little, until then beware because this is a good game which will frustrate you with performance, and indeed, in general because while not tedious it is complex to get going at full speed/goodness in terms of full gameplay.

Performance setting:  What I do for my ryzen and graphics is I have heaps of mods, but with 3700x with ryzen master setting of auto overclock - ryzen balanced power plan installed via amd website chipset drivers on a aorus ultra 570  and an OPEN-sided case (lol yes for air flow and I blow it out now and then, its relatively dust free), and CPP states switched on in BIOS and switch-state 2 as stated in bios, meaning it uses its fast switching, so we know its doing as best it can plus it looks at which is the preffered fastest core, and with ryzen master on a second monitor I can check it all


 I use the distance at 10k on livonia and object at 6400 and it seems to usually hold high fps, at 60-70.  But in lots of action is can sink.  I drop the anti aliasing to 2x and then have other settings on as game auto's to, which is mostly high.  Its cpu limited not GPU.  

I do not use any parameters because with ryzen you do not want to go over and tax anything and the default is just fine for me.  

So its smooth and all that but I wish it remained so, the engine as you can imagine is taxing in the modern day multi cpu's.

I do rate the game highly.  But the performance in 2021 is a sufferance.  It is beautiful though and the nam jungle maps especially as well as several others, but many overall, just the several top tier such as the map from Prairie fire are great.  But the maps alone is a reason to get this, all official maps are good, and plenty of mods.

Even if you do not mod you will like this game should you be able to suffer the performance.  

I was also speaking about single player - in multiplayer, your 70 will become 35 real fast, and sometimes less in heavy moments.  Like down to 16.  This is why they must give this game a little love with the game engine.  Its too expensive othewise in terms of value.  I am trying to be fair, and actually to be fair the dynamic recon and dynamic combat ops mods in the workshop and dynamic civil war mod missions in the game, and normal missions make the game good.  

Remember this game is from 2013 iirc.  That engine is the major blight.  Its not a big company, but for a product can only hope it improves.  In the meantime you will suffer-enjoy it.  You should buy it and hope the bone is thrown toward you one day"
6754,"game takes 100's of hours to learn the key binds, 1/4th of your play time is COSPLAYING at the arsenal, 1/4th of the time is waiting on others to finish cosplaying at the arsenal, 1/4th of the time is waiting for idiots to debug their key binds and mods, the final 1/4th is you realizing absolutely no one listened to the brief, and no one knows what the mission is. As you get sniped by a bot from 2km, that's invisible. After walking for 2 hours on foot 500 meters threw mountain with no respawns. all at only 30fps on top of the line hardware. 10/10 will destroy your life."
6755,"I almost threw my computer out the window trying to figure out the analyzer, what the hell guys, I spent $90 dollars on DLC and now I cant play online with folks, wtf dude"
6756,"2k+hrs cant recomend enough
"
6757,milsim number 1
6758,"I make things go boom, i'm happy."
6759,fun but even a monster pc can only get you 30 fps
6760,"Fun co-op game for a small group of friends I play with. A lot of the mods in the workshop are good and some are bad its a mix. Never actually played the multiplayer but it probably could be fun as well. Overall, it creates really good moments and it has some bads and some goods but I believe the good outweighs the bad."
6761,Amazing experience if you've got the pc for it for the most part community is helpful but sometimes toxic. Steep learning curve for new players but would highly recommend for any military enthusiast/ tacticool
6762,Fire Milsim. Keeps you mentally ERECT.
6763,"My account was hijacked by a hacker who used it for malicious purpuses (even though I had 2-step verification on both my Steam and E-mail account (E-mail admins denied any break ins during that time which is kinda odd)

Account received a BE global  ban which which at first I didn't have any issues with as I hoped that due to my situation I could easily appeal my ban with evidence I held along with Steam Support Conversation.

[h1]See the dislike? They didn't. BI support is only capable to keep linking me to BattleEye support, [u][b]problem is that they only do completely nothing, they do not even confirm they received my appeals. [/b] [/u][/h1]

I am deeply disappointed with the custumer support as it nearly non existent to the point when you feel left completely alone because both [b] BI and BE do not care for costumers. [/b] 

[h1][b] You just lost a fair and loyal costumer [/b][/h1]

I wish that no one would expierence what I had expierenced, though just in case I recommend creating a 2nd account meant for BE only games [b] as guys at BattleEye are  fully not accountable for their actions [/b]"

6766,"me and my friends love this game we have a blast when playing it. its great when we want to goof around because the editor, but what we love even more is how you can immerse yourself in ultra realistic military operations which is possible in very few games on the planet today. bohimia makes the best games out right now."
6767,good game with easy to use control and lots of great content. i dont like that some vehicles are dlc but if i could afford the dlc's i would get them
6768,No
6769,77th jsoc servers you will have a blast
6770,cool shooty guns
6771,good mil sim couple of bugs but great over all!

6779,so great. it's 23hours in game and you still have something todo. not just roaming around. and the mod also good
6780,it's ight I guess or whatever
6781,goof
6782,no
6783,YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE AWESOME? LETS MAKE THE CONTROL SYSTEM CONVOLUTED AND SHIT. THAT WILL BRING ALL THE NEW PLAYERS IN
6784,pretty good because I get to experience what vietnam vets did now :) but with less ptsd and fear and I actually enjoy it but they went through hell and I can be a faggot and say that lgbtq+ is braver than military
6785,who's randy
6786,"Basically Legos for adults. Highly recommend even though the ai either have the most insane fucking aimbot ive ever seen, or are as dumb as rocks. seriously."
6787,Lot's of great content and a community that keeps the game alive
6788,FUN
6789,"Arma is just one of those games that is as fun, or as boring, as you want it to be. It seems weird to say this about a game, but it is kinda inspirational."
6790,"The ONLY ""realistic"", rather accurate, and highly versatile military (and other) simulator. Really good despite the old core engine and certain drawbacks. The most crucial upgrade needs are in computer character AI improvement. Plus the animations that cannot be interrupted are a major pain in the ass. Otherwise, worth every penny."
6791,Very boom
6792,"Gunz brrr
I approve"
6793,"PARA MI ARMA 3 ES INJUGABLE, en el modo multijugador (el unico que importa) se juegan muy pocos modos de juego y los servidores buenos son privados, ademas los requisitos m√≠nimos son una farsa, con un xeon x3440 y una gtx960 a duras penas obtengo 8 fps en servidores con pocos jugadores y sin ningun mod. SI NO TIENES UNA PC DE LA NASA QUE VALGA +700 dolares NO VAS A OBTENER NI SIQUIERA 30 FPS ESTABLES  Y AUN TENIENDO UNA BUENA PC YO ME PENSARIA MUCHO COMPRAR ARMA 3"
6794,yes
6795,"great game its a learning curb but once you figure it out its the best military sim i've ever played 
"
6796,One of the most played games I own.
6797,"The game itself is good but what makes it great is the community. There are so many units that you can join, and there is no end to the imagination, creativity, and dedication that mission builders put into the player made missions."
6798,mods make the game
6799,Nice.
6800,"Love this game. Spent countless hours laughing and having fun with friends. ""Liberating"" is the best feeling in the world!"
6801,its soo cool
6802,After 200 hrs of playing I would say that it's good
6803,"incredibly pog
"
6804,good
6805,"This game is a masterpiece,it really is.
Hours of authentic military experience,it will surely get you PTSD afterwards.
With tons of weapons and loadouts,this game is surely tactical."
6806,"Kek, Arma scratches many itches."
6807,good game
6808,yes
6809,"
holy****** it got crazy last night.

me and one other dude pinned down like a motherf--r in this tiny a** berm

surrounded like a phat booty b*** in a male prison cell,

one of the three people in my group was shot like 27 times looking like swiss cheese laying on the ground, 
the other dude that was with me took turns  stabilizing/applying medical to him... 
all while shooting encroaching enemies and getting shot..

bruh.exe


that shit was intense.

might just sound like arma to seasoned players... but god damn it was absolutely incredible.

after almost 30 minutes of defending this tiny berm with one singular large trench 
(it was all we could literally manage to dig while not dying)I finally took my last round and collapsed. 

Laying there with the blackscreen, I heard more gunfire and autistic screaming from my battlebuddy 
... also heard him steal a red pickup that showed up carrying a group of enemy boogbois and book it out of there..
another 10 minutes pass and i hear him returning.. this time with two other teammates to revive and rescue.

I havent had this much fun playing a game in years.

like... you forget about kd, rank, all the shit you normally take seriously and just.. have fun. 
im mad as fuck at myself for lettin this game sit in my inventory for almost 5 years.

People are also generally really helpful with keybindings and other guidance.
There are alot of controls that do specific things, Its alot to learn,
but once you do start getting the hang of things... its totally worth ALL the frustration. 

ive played over 30 hours in the last week alone... after work, weekends...Im sure itll happen to you too."
6810,"I have played this game for a very long time, I would say it is one of the best games on the market for 2021 as  we know. I enjoy this game very much. It meets all my expectations as a video-game. I feel that the mods are almost essential but the story-line is very good. I have not been able to get far in the Single Player Campaign as it has been designed to be difficult no matter difficulty. But I enjoy attempting the missions. I play the game for multiplayer and have loved all the servers I have played on. I enjoy the way the game plays and feels with weapon physics and ballistics. This game has been an upandcoming game on my list of reviews and has reached the top 5. I hope the mod creators increase the capacity of excellence in making mods. I have found aspects in the Role-Play servers to be excellent and fun. Whether it is playing solo or playing with 100 people this game is a great one at the least. 10/10 from me."
6811," i willl die a lot and get killed my your alis os go for it
"
6812,"Very bad game, Never seen something this bad [DON'T BUY!!!]"
6813,Love this game!
6814,fun
6815,Fun shooter game - I need more time to gauge a true review.
6816,GREAT GAME
6817,If you like thing's that GO BOOM ! ! ! then this is the game for U ! ! !
6818,its fun but the controls take a while to get used to
6819,"Bought this game before I was in high school. I'm now in grad school and am also part of a mil sim unit. So yeah its a pretty good game.

P.S. God bless the modding community."
6820,"Never had such an experience before, truly a great military simulator to play with friends and strangers. Apart from the occasional Troll shooting his own team like a clown, which gets banned pretty quickly."
6821,"I like this game
"
6822,"Lez go
"
6823,very fun cannit lie
6824,nice
6825,Its the  best game ever!
6826,Maybe the best war simulator in the world. Especially when modded. I recommended the ultimate warfare rubber edition and all the CUP -mods. The game takes up a lot of space from your hard drive. Especially when modded.
6827,"As of the time of making this review, I have over 69 hours in this game, yes the FUNNY number. Anyways changing the campaign with Zeus and adding some ""life"" into them is fun, and also I can commit warcrimes against civvies from an Apache."
6828,This is a really realistic military game and is insanely hard to do anything unless you know what your doing
6829,"The communities and the mods make this game what it is today. I've run many servers of my own - still do. It's an old game, but content creators are constantly making the game better than the audience expects from arma and makes you really want to stick around."
6830,Great
6831,this game is very fun buy is its a lot of fum
6832,"This game is really fun, when you have played it for some time, but it can take some time to just learn the controlles. But when you have found a good server and know the controlls, it become very fun. Expect some fps drops and some bugs, but you probaly already know that. Just try the game, its fun!"
6833,Excellent game!
6834,im cool
6835,"it feels like...original i mean..its so realistic military game everything in it is realistic....so i will give it a 9/10 
1 mark reduced so that you have to pay extra for more features...buying those features is not a problem but its soo expensive.....so yea u can try it and u will not be dissappointed...

6868,"Nice
"
6869,"This game is a new taste and experience as a sandbox mil sim , if you never played it before. 
Do i recommend it? Sure, but the community is not welcoming at all on new players.
Meaning you will be critiqued for anything you do constantly and be reminded how and why what you do is wrong or not super realistic. 
Also be ready to get kicked out of server without even knowing what happened."
6870,cant even play on servers with my current pc with my lame ass i5 4570 but still campaign and showcase is good
6871,"Do not be fooled, fellow gamers. This is not a shooter. This isn't even milsim. This is straight-up, unadulterated horror. The intense spastic sensation of your heart being ripped out of your chest after rounding a corner only to be greeted by a full-on 50mm autocannon barrage from an AI tank you thought you had snuck around is irreplicable. Not even the most aggressive of horror games such as Dead Space, Resident Evil, or Twitter are capable of instilling the same quantity of fear into your fragile soul as you learn the painful lesson that bullets. freaking. hurt.

The feeling of being watched by an unseen predator, the constant looming threat of landmines hidden cheekily under the dead floor of rotting pine nettles, the agony of forgetting to quicksave in the campaign before you chucked a grenade that bounced back inside your house. All of these contribute to the obscenely terrifying reality of Arma 3. Real life is less scary than this simulator when the difficulty's cranked up to eleven.

But for real tho. Good game. Very fun. Only played single player 'cause am lonely. The bots have the combined senses of the Predator and intelligence of a gnat. Buy when on sale, DLC is a bit overpriced. Experience the true horror of modern armed conflict in any spine-contorting manner you can think of. Trust me when it comes to the contorted spines. Very funny."
6872,Arma 3 has so much potential from cool fun servers to making your own missions to playing coop with friends its endless the amount of things that you can do! for the price its defiantly worth the buy.
6873,Do not double-tap V in helis
6874,..
6875,It is good game
6876,"this is not a good simulation and its only a good game if its being saved by mods and people. its unplayable most of the time its not worth any money, it might be worth it to play if it was free."
6877,great game. with plenty of mods from ww2 to star wars or warhammer 40k
6878,Pew Pew Army game
6879,i am too frustrated with this game to write a review

Also multiplayer has sync issues. Not recommended at all."
6913,"Rented a server running on Epoch 1.13.1. Client is running on 1.13.3, so I can¬¥t join my server. Downgrade is not possible.
Another thing most disturbing: their dlc-policy is kind of agressive. Whenever making a new mission, there are contents in the list that are not available for players who haven¬¥t got the dlc¬¥s.

6929,"This is the single greatest FPS in existence today. The variety of combat ability is amazing. In one mission you could be dropped off at sea, travel inland, underwater as a combat scuba diver (which could involve underwater combat if enemy divers spot you), take out the beach guard, steal a tank to drive half way across the map destroying enemy vehicles, weapons and buildings then abandoning the tank when it runs out of fuel and ammo. Then you climb a mountain to avoid enemy lines, snipe the enemy general from 1500m away in the middle of a thunderstorm that's making your bullets drift waaay off course. Now the fog is coming in, visibility is down to just a few feet but you have your thermal vision googles, a compass and a sat nav to help you navigate the 30 miles to the exfil point. But on the way you run into a combat patrol which splits you up from the rest of your team. So you make your way to the secondary exfil point but on the way you discover an attack helicopter which you're able to steal and fly to the second exfil but your team members are under attack by an armoured convoy so you hover behind a hill 2 miles away and engage the armour with your heat seeking missiles and cannon before moving in and finishing the enemy off with your unguided missiles. Just as your team mates relax an enemy jet shows up and damages your tail rotor causing you to spin wildly out of control. You manage to bail out and safely parachute to the ground where you search the enemy supplies for anti aircraft weaponry of which you find numerous different types from RPG's to Stingers, there's even an auto guided, auto targeting long range missile system near by but it has no ammo and there are no ammo trucks near by or transport trucks that can pick up the ammo container and move it to the AA system so you have to take out the jet manually. The first few shots are easily dodge with excellent flying manuevers and flares but finally a well timed rocket, fired at the jet's nose while it's diving for an attack run, completely destroys the jet and pilot. You steal an undamaged jeep and exfil with your team, mission completed. Take all of those elements online and combine them with Arma's sandbox design and you can find millions of missions, campaigns, mods, game modes and other addons that take a base game that's an easy 100/100 and turns it into a 1000/100 level of fun.

In short I love this game, but you'll be hard pressed to find an Arma player who doesn't, it does have a few bugs, the AI pathfinding can be a bit annoying and vehicle physics isn't perfect but the combat physics are incredible. The issues just pop up every now and then but in all honesty they just add a level of natural dynamic problems that can upset your mission and make it more difficult which just adds to the fun. Like yeah a tank couldn't flip over onto it's roof after hitting a kerb but accidents have happened where tanks have mounted berms and flipped, if you think of the bugs as being natural errors like that, it doesn't take away from the fun of the game, it adds to it."

[h1] Simple Summary [/h1]

idk what possesed me to buy this, oh yeah 80% off xD... maybe it didnt age well? but i though this game was setting the bar up high, and... well... not really....... shame....

specially disturbing is that when u connect a shot, the animation the enemy is doing stops, he then yanks back like to a default position and then back to the animation, it's HORRIBLE..... totally kills the little immersion i had in the game, and was never able to recover after that, i just.... the only thing good this game had going for itself was immersion..... meh....  i dont care to refund, cost me pennies, but still, uninstalling..."
6938,Its fun af
6939,yes
6940,"Arma 3, what a time I have had with this game. While it may seem like a completely hard cased Mil-sim, it can actually be one of the biggest barrels of fun you could have. The main pull to this game is the community and it's plethora of diverse gamemodes and missions. Whatever you may want to find here, you're probably gonna find it and enjoy it. So cmon down, get your boots muddy, and your gun dusty, the battlefield awaits soldier!"

6954,"Arma 3 is one of those games that rides a very thin line in the mainstream gaming scene without a safety net I believe, some players love it and others don't have the patience for it and it's cool. Mil-sim is not for everybody, but I absolutely love this game. Having bought it over 5 years ago and only having over 650 hours in it, I've made damn sure those 650 hours would be the best 650 hours I spent on a game.

Arma 3 and the ArmA series in general is all about giving players the ultimate form of freedom, from large scale warfare to complete mod support to a mission editor with an entire open map spanning kilometers for you to just pour your creativity into. But where Arma 3 really shines is when it brings all those things together and creates something that distinguishes itself from the rest of the gaming scene, the game doesn't restrict you, it's all about how far you can go.

6955,"Game is fun mostly for mods like Antistasi, only real gripe I have is the aggressive advertising when you're using dlc you don't own."

6960,Very bad had to carry a midget during the entire thing. Kinda fun but playing with a 4ft 9 disabled person kinda kills it
6961,good game with friends
6962,This game deserves A LOT more attention and interest.
6963,"Arma III is a milsim game where you are with your team. There is a campaign, sandbox (which i mainly play as of writing this), tutorial (obviously lmao), and community-made scenarios which you can play.

This game is actually good for 2013, while some game called Arma: Reforger is being made, i enjoy playing this game with my friends.

Thanks Seb for gifting me that game. I thought i would need to save up myself to get it, but you did a nice brother mode. :steamhappy:

btw, if you are wondering, Yes. I do kill my own AI teammates."
6964,"Really deppends on what servers you play, whether not you play in a unit and what you consider to be exciting in a game like this. I've wanted this game since I was like 10 years old and I regret nothing. If you like sim games, this is your best bet for every aspect of warfare."

6979,very cool game. i dont even play online i just mess around with bots and that and that alone is worth it. loads of mods to make it replayable. try catch it on sale
6980,Very Realistic with lots of Real mission Planning Style and Comms Usage and over all Great Mechanics and Great Game.
6981,"if they fix all the issues, then its a great game"
6982,on many servers that could be fun people are just toxic. I'm aware this isn't the games fault or the devs but it still makes it unplayable
6983,"This game is probably the most difficult, frustrating, head banging game I have ever played. It is also probably the most rewarding, fun, and diverse game that I have ever played. I am 41 years old, I was looking for something different than the mindless shooters (cod, battle field, destiny). I wanted a game that made me think, I wanted freedom to execute my missions the way I wanted to, and I wanted a true sim. Arma 3 has a great community of modders, there is new content all of the time. New DLC and an ever evolving way to play. I am thankful to finally pick this game up and started playing. 

I am not the most talented gamer, I crash my aircraft all the time. I can't command my units correctly and I die a lot. Even though the game is tough and has a few rough edges, I enjoy the diversity. I can fly airplanes, helicopters, command units, spec-op missions, even kill a few zombies when I feel like it. I may be bad at the game, but I'm learning and truly enjoy the journey to becoming better. That can't be said for many games these days. 

I'll give it a ""G4 TV 5... out of 5""."
6984,The gameplay is pretty good and realistic. For people who often want to fight ... hahaha and can be modded with mods that are quite good and realistic too in the wrokshop
6985,a really good game!
6986,its alright
6987,good
6988,good game realistic as games get when it comes to warfar it may not be as detailed as squad but you can do so much more in this game and it just feels way bigger
6989,good game
6990, NO INVERT!!!!
6991,no but kinda
6992,"Game is horrible, any weapons and vehicles are offbrand and controls are cancerous"
6993,cant even play multiplayer its so trash
6994,this is what real simulation looks like as a soldier.
6995,"only wish the controls were more simplified for me
"
6996,This is a game that just keeps getting better - it's been over 8 years now since it was released yet more content keeps getting added to it all the time. Combine that with the modding community and you have a game that can be completely customised into whatever style of FPS you want to play.
6997,Badass Milsim! Everything you've been waiting for a great sequel to Arma 2!
6998,i like to commit war crimes

7010,"I've played this game for quite a bit, and i still love it even though it's a bit old. it's the most fun game i've ever played."
7011,The devs set the playerbase up to keep the game alive as long as possible through building a solid foundation of a game. With that solid foundation the community is expanding the game exponentially. If you want to enjoy this game get on an arma discord and play with a community. That's where you'll maximize the game's potential.
7012,A friend bought it for me and i recommend IF now this is a big if you have mods and certain mods make the game better or they can make it worse depends on what you have so i would suggest if you want to mod it to suit what you want.
7013,Grand Theft Arma = <3!
7014,"I cant recommend this game, its not that you cant have fun in it, its just that you are having fun in spite of it. Arma 3, and the Arma series as a whole, fills a niche that no other game does, which is fortunate for Bohemia but unfortunate for players as this allows the devs to release a blatantly cut down, glitch ridden and unfinished version of the game for full price and then shill DLC in an incredibly intrusive way.

> There is precious little content in the game and what is there is often near future tech that is poorly thought out and modelled, with many of the mod vehicles having more functionality

> The game is just terribly buggy and outdated. Even something as simple as playing with friends can be a hassle that just randomly breaks. Your tanks will flip and explode for no reason, you will be killed by stairs and at some point you just wont be able to interact with anything. Seriously, its 2021 and Bohemia cant do vehicle physics.

> The AI is honestly unfun to play against. 90% of the time its brain dead and not a challenge, the other 10% is shoots you though trees and grass or even just stick their heads though walls to kill you. Many missions also have mandatory view distance fog which the AI can see through. You can get around this with a mod but its still an issue

> Despite the games claim to fame being realism, it lacks a large number of features, many of which are added my the ACE3 mod but again, this is a full price game and you shouldn't have to get loads of mods just to make it functional"

7018,"This game is a very unique beast. On the surface, you have what appears to be a tactical MILSIM game with both 1st and 3rd person perspectives that has a heavy focus on realism. That isn't untrue at all, but Arma 3 is so, so much more than that at the same time. The term 'military sandbox' is what the devs call it these days and I think that works best, because within a certain scope.. Arma 3 is sort of whatever the hell you want it to be. If you want to go full sweaty tryhard MILSIM tacticool badass with a group of your friends and insist you all call each other by rank and pretend it's real life, Arma 3 can give you that. If you want to join Life / RP servers and burn down opium fields while getting into shootouts with the cops, Arma 3 can give you that. If you want a specific experience of a wartime conflict from a certain era (WW2, Cold War, Vietnam, etc) outside of the modern one, Arma 3 can give you that. If you want to sit around in the editor for hundreds of hours making your own missions, Arma 3 can give you that. If you want a totally solo experience, Arma 3 can give you that. If you never intend to touch the single player content and focus only on MP, Arma 3 can give you that.

I could go on.. and on. Arma 3 has damned near limitless possibilities. Between all the DLC and mods, there's so much you can cram into this game. I love it, love it to death. One of my all time favorite games, however.. it's not something I would recommend to just anyone. You need to be a particular type of gamer to get into this game, as freeform as your experience can be.. it's still targeted at certain audiences over others. I recommend doing some research and watching gameplay.. and if at that point you seem into the idea, buy it and all the DLC and never look back. You won't regret it."
7019,"""This game is just hardcore, you don't get it""

The game is bad, it could be enjoyable but you have to looks past way too many flaws.
Want to play with friends on your own server? Get fucked.
Want to have AI that aren't either full on brain dead or (enemy) lasers you through buildings and grass? Get Fucked.
Want to get into a fancy looking vehicle? That's fine... oh wait it's actually a DLC vehicle now go buy all of the DLC's ( meanwhile the modded vehicles are free and way better ).
Want to have fun? I don't think so ;).

My own personal experience with Arma is that it sometimes (even after playing it normally the previous day)
refuses to function properly, at some point my unit data refused to be retrieved so I couldn't even play on public servers.

So if you buy this game just be warned that you will most likely run into issues out of your control."
7020,funny war crime game
7021,This game is what all other shooter/Military sim games copy and hope to be. Most do not achieve even half this greatness.
7022," Game devs in general could learn from this. This game is over the top with details from the spawn at base, the waiting on medics to patch you up or waiting for a medevac to get you out of there if your hurt really bad, all the way to the end when victory is achieved, this game has you feeling like your literally in a war setting. Packed with realism and great ideas, I give this a 5 star rating. Even if the graphics aren't top notch this is still more advanced detail wise then multiplayer games made now, in 2021."
7023,very good game but the key binds are unusual so id reccomend playing with an experienced friend
7024,"Hackers owning Flying Scoutsman and banning everyone from it for hours at a time
For the past at least two weeks, every morning, noon, and sometimes afternoon, there is a single Flying Scoutsman server operating where one or more hacker plays vs bots he commands. When anyone joins, they immediately start vote kick and this way prevent everyone else from playing. To ensure no more servers are created, they keep open slots on both teams. Today it happened for the 30th+ time, I joined a Shoots game 3vs3 with the rest being bots. Two names were very familiar, as they are usually muted and appear red. One was Bulldog, the other was Anchor, so I am positive it was their doing this time. I didn't have any time to see who the third red name was as I was immediately kicked & banned from the server. I just want to chill and play a bit, and not grind on my own with bots. Please find a way to fix this and prevent server overtaking, as it then lasts for half the day until a normal server appears."

What is fun is listening to the beluga whales cry about dying in game under their own consequences! Super loud super Explicit! 9/10 wouldnt buy again"

7094,"I picked this game up while it was on sale for 8$ (happy 8th anniversary!) and I would have been happy if I had paid 10X that amount. There are some mods that are truly incredible to play from short random patrols and firefights to full blown campaign games with a strategic overlay (Antistasi, DUWS). I've only played it for about 15 hours so far but it is a visceral experience and I am totally immersed in the game world while playing. This is the most serious shooter that I have ever played and it is a welcome change from the typical arcade fare. You really need to think and be sharp and play carefully to survive an ARMA mission - challenging to the max and I'm absolutely loving it. I love the fact that the maps are so huge here. There is no way really for anyone to memorize overpowered locations to camp out here. The amount of places you can be sent into action is totally ridiculous and the context is always different."

7125,Game runs like absolute trash in multiplayer no matter my ping... I have a GS66 stealth that can push VR with no problems. This is literally the only game ive played on my pc that runs so terribly. Its a shame because the potential and features are there but yeah just not worth doing some other BS just to get it to run as I see in many tutorials... Going to have to try Squad or some other realistic mil sim shooter.
7126,"Absolute garbage.  Spent close to an hour fighting with the game to configure controls.  Would not save the configuration the way I wanted, even though it had a robust system to make changes.  Also forces you into tutorial modes with no way to skip them, and they are long dumb tutorials, basic point gun and fire at targets and run around.  Completely pointless.  You spend more time running around a field listening to some ""bro"" tier army dipshit than you get to play the game.  The in game UI is total dog fecal matter too."
7127,Good graphics and gameplay.

7132,"My biggest complaint would be that I can't get much more than 40-60 fps on a good day, yet I can run games like Red Dead Redemption 2, cyberpunk, GTA:V, and Ark, all maxed out and with roughly 144 frames.
But the game is somehow still the best thing on the market in a few ways... FPS, tacticool team stuff, sweaty stuff, casual stuff, buffoonery, war crimes, survival, racing, RTS, diving, naval combat, urban combat, modern and pre modern timelines/equipment... This game is just absolutely stomping games like squad and insurgency IMO. Can't wait to see the performance improvements with the next release. If they offer the same sandbox/multiplayer environment AND give me smooth twitchy gameplay.... I probably wont be buying any more CoDs or other ""wargames""."

7140,"this game sucks. I bought it because my friends said it was cool so i spent my last 30 bucks on it. Now I can't get a refund from this shitty game and steam says that I played 11 hours. Dude I didn't even play it more than 3 times. I hated the game, never buying anything from these guys again"
7141,fun
7142,"It's a good game if you plan on joining one of the many groups they have. Doing the based game is fun at times but I prefer joining groups because its more organized and you get to meet new people so win, win."
7143,It's a love-hate relationship
7144,Good Game
7145,is good
7146,"Amazing game, has its quirks, toxic communities, and sometimes really annoying when you hit a tree and then your car goes flying into space but, yeah. pretty good game all in all."
7147,good
7148,"I guess its pretty good ? 
I mean u get star wars, without owning star wars.
u get Call of duty, without owning call of duty.
Also yeah everything you want this game does have it.
please download mods 
its for your own good
and I still want a crazy over the top Ac130 mod like for real, a crazy one shooting nukes ? maybe even Minecraft steves ?

7172,Battlefield vibes
7173,Greatest military game ever!

7179,good
7180,Love this game  nothing to say just play it
7181,Pro tip: don't ever use rocket launchers in pickup technicals if someone else is in the open box. Just don't.
7182,"Very fun game, you can make great custom scenarios with an in game editor, player base is reasonably steady, even better with mods. Only problem is that the base game doesn't offer a large amount of content and makes you buy dlc to access. Doesnt matter anyway because you have mods."
7183,yeah its ok
7184,Committed warcrimes. 10/10
7185,Great game
7186,how do i jump?
7187,Its the best mil simulator
7188,I was the mayor once in Altis Life. King of the Hill is great game mode. Arma is why DayZ is around today. Its a fun game just find a community that suits your game mode and style
7189,"First thing is first, do you want to know what was the last military game I played? Yes? Well it was Ghost Recon for the PS2. Yes, I played for an hour or two Counter Strike, but that doesn't even count. That ain't military in my book. Any who, as I was saying, I haven't touched a military game since the PS2 days. I decided to purchase this game, and guess what? Is hard as hell. This is a Dark Souls military game. Yes, you will die a lot. If you're expecting a crazy first person shooter in where you can shoot everybody, jump, roll, explode everything in your path and feel immortal, then you're out of luck. I tried playing this game as if I was playing any other first person shooter and I died in less than 10 seconds. I got better at this game after 2 hours. I died over 15 times the first hour. Either I wasnt hiding good enough, didn't drop quick enough, got injured and now I am slow as a turtle and I can barely do anything, etc .. this is a simulator. A good one, more like a great one. The use of common sense clicks to you while playing this game. Once you come to your senses, and see this game as a simulator, you'll end up getting good at it. The game play is very very slow paced. The graphics, the environment, and the realism is very top notch. This game runs pretty smooth on my end (56 to 60fps) very playable and enjoyable. But yes, this game will give your GPU quite a beating. 

Once again, this is a simulator, not Doom or your typical boring Call of Duty nonsense. In this game every move, strategy and bullet counts. 

I recommend this game, just be patience and don't get crazy. And make sure you can run this game."
7190,is fun even thought i got 1-10 fps
7191,Every server it's own brand new flavor of the spectrum
7192,"15 mins of walking just to shoot for 2 mins and then die 
i love it"
7193,"better than tarkov in terms of hotkeys, thats about it"
7194,"good morning im new to arma 3 and im looking for a milsim team to play with, i understand most of the mechanics but wana learn more while playing with a fun group of ppl, i do work so my hour are limited but after work i can push for 2 hours and on weekends more"

7203,Forgot how much I love this SIM. Glade to be back!!!!
7204,Get It
7205,"really good game but make sure to play the tutorial, if you don't you will not know what your doing"
7206,"Yes and no on recommendation. Everything about this game is great...except for the AI. Absolutely atrocious ad an unacceptable level of AI development. AI spots you no matter what and has sniper like accuracy even when difficulty is all the way to zero. So if you get this game ONLY do it for the online, multiplayer experience. Single player is unplayable due to the broken AI. That's the reason my playtime is so little. I wanted to play single player to learn the game sort of ""on my own time,"" but the AI completely ruined it."
7207,It's ARMA 3
7208,"I LIKE THIS GAME
"
7209,best milsim out there
7210,BEST GAME EVER
7211,This is a game I've always wanted but i was a console for years so couldn't play a game of this size. Only dislike which is obvious to everyone who's played it is the optimization is severely lacking. Hopefully if arma 4 ever comes out they can really work on that. i shouldn't be between 45-65 fps with a 3060ti and a 9700k
7212,War crimes are cool
7213,haha gun go pew pew and commit war crimes lol
7214,Every time i load into the game i cant check any other things outside the game unless i close the game down its really bugging me as if i want to check my discord or stop my music i would have to quit and leave the game and close it down to do it wish they was a way to fix this but  other then that i love this game
7215,cool
7216,pretty good and dynamic
7217,I could have started and finished a 2nd college degree with the amount of time I have played this game. I hope I die soon...
7218,"good all around 
"
7219,"Arma3 is like an old friend. Every time me or my friends hit a lull in what we want to play, we find ourselves coming back to Arma. Massive maps and countless scenarios (check out the workshop) for any size party Arma is one of the few games I could keep playing for a very long time. It is also one of the few games where you can laugh off a total party wipe, weather it was the incredible all seeing AI or you flip your helicopter over a light pole you didn't notice, it all makes you play better or differently next time. This is a game where my crew still talks about stories from years back. I have spent hundreds of hours and hundreds of dollars on multiple copies and most of the DLC and I regret NOTHING!"
7220,"Absolutely horrid, I always thought of the ARMA 3 developers as a great team, now hearing that british people are involved, im utterly shocked and disgusted at this."
7221,"i love it

7231,"I played for 20 minutes, I have PTSD and the benefits."
7232,Tbh i'm disapointed this game had literly 5 missions who was like 10-15 min long thats the whole campaign. And you pay $28 for somthing that simple if u sell a game for that price at least have a 20 h long campaign like batlefiald or COD. Really bad game. The graphics are super bad i give this game a 2/10. Don't waste money on this!
7233,"Continually impressive, and the level of depth and diverse experiences arma can provide is truly on a level of its own."
7234,"its a good game except the UAV mission,will make your head spin."
7235,.
7236,"All is pretty cool, but i hawe no idea what need to do in this game ü§£"
7237,its pretty cool
7238,"okay, ive played for eight hours this time. I love it, the community is so nice and funny, i would reccomend american servers and yeah, have fun"
7239,"It's decent, I guess."
7240,"Allows you to commit various warcrimes, with just a few mods

Very cool
"
7241,only game that is fun to play below 60 fps
7242,good but coc is better
7243,"This game looks so promising but left me very disappointed.
First off, the controls are very counter-intuitive and placed in a way that is not a natural keystroke. (Crouch is X instead of C, Entering a car is SPACEBAR but exiting is V,) its almost like every action requires you to memorize two new steps. Next, the game play UI, inventory menu and support menus don't make anything easy on you either. If you are over-encumbered, or injured, or getting shot at, the game does not display a marker or notice to make the issue easily identifiable. The Support menu, where airdrops get called in, is just frustrating and slow to use. Double clicking exists elsewhere, but not in this menu when selecting the things you want airdropped in. Also, the airdrops are always so scattered that unless your whole fire team is paying attention you might lose a drop or two.

Then you remap the buttons and take like 20 minutes to do that, just to log back in and have a teammate just kill you over and over, in multiple servers."
7244,"Absolute diehard fan since OFP was released as a PCZone demo (still have it) bought everything, then Codemasters came in and it all went a bit üí§ then Arma 3 came out and I couldn‚Äôt stop playing it, then they just turned it into GTAV with bloat for MP and spamming the player with loot boxes and making you download GBs of junk that I didn‚Äôt want. Everything they released was just MP or a standalone Single mission to highlight it. Never incorporated into the campaign. A GUI with lots of defunct tiles - because you have to buy it of course‚Ä¶. Deleted because enough is enough. Leave it for those not old enough to see a cash cow if it dropped a cow pat on their foot."
7245,"I bought this game whilst it was on sale because i thought it would be a great game as i'm looking to start Mil-Sim however i really wished i didn't buy Arma as although it was on sale i later discovered you have to buy half a dozen DLC's to play online even if you buy the apex edition. I think this should be stated in the games page. However, if it was then i'm blind or it isn't clearly stated. Asides from that it is a great game but i think that's a big factor!"
7246,"Wonderful game, but it has its flaws.
Pros:
[list]
    [*]Amazing singleplayer feel. Usually, with these milsim games multiplayer gives it the taste. But i find myself spending most of my time on the editor with tons of mods such as ACE, CUP etc.
    [*]Diverse modding community. You've got everything from semi-realistic healing (tourniques, field dressing, etc.)[ACE mod] to zombies! Yes, zombies.
    [*]Vehicles. You've gotta love them. You want to commit warcrimes with a UAV? Gun down enemy troops in your A10? Spy on your neighbors with the drones? You've got it.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*]Steep learning curve. I can't even describe how steep. I *call myself* a fast learner, took me 30h to say that I could understand the basics. Here's my main tips: If you're confused, use the ""industry standard"" control scheme and use the 4th and 5th mouse buttons for zoom in and out. Also, zooming in ‚â† aiming downsights. You'll get used to it, and frankly, grow to like it. Also, don't play KOTH at the start. Play COOP.
    [*]Rip GPU. No kidding. It'll eat your GTX1660Ti whatever, and you'll hardly get 50-60fps with that on *singleplayer*. The KOTH maps? Oh yeah, 20-30 fps.
    [*]Get some friends. No really, you'll need them. Although it's very, very fun in singleplayer which I spend most of my titme in, its not ARMA without friends.
[/list]
Conclusion: Are you determined? More importantly, can your computer (or your used-to-ness to low fps) handle it? Go for it. If you're a play-and-dump person with no determination, it'll be hard, and it'll end on you rage quitting, and, in turn, refunding.

*Fair Warning: EXTREMELY addicting.*"

7250,"Love, love, love Arma 3, bugs, warts and all. Do yourself a favor - run the tutorials (including all the ones that come with DLC) BEFORE coming online into multiplayer and asking ""how do I play this game?"" Arma 3 is not for the faint of heart. It's complicated, it's buggy and it's nail-bitingly frustrating at times. But when you get a great online multiplayer game working, it is a ton of fun."

overall a 10/10 sandbox would recommand.

7340,"There's action-packed gamemodes and mods (PUBG is a standalone mod for this game), but if you're looking for instant quick action, you'll be better off playing a game that's focused on that. Arma trades that focus on action for freedom of choice. 

It's much closer to being a military simulator than any other game I've played. That means learning how to use a map and a compass, lots of running on foot and no health regeneration in seconds.

In return, you get to 
- choose your approach to most fights
- explore a big map with no invisible walls turning you back towards an objective
- carry the gear you found over to the next mission"

realistic bullet drop, many vehicals, secenarios for singale payer and many good servers for multi.

7347,"FPS, Flight-sim, Tank-sim, all in one, what more can you ask for.
With replicas of real world islands and 100 player matches it still can bring my modern PC to its knees."
7348,i have had this game for under a year and i already have nearly 2000 hours go figure
7349,"maissi

7350,"This military simulator has great modding capabilities, which create never ending fun.

Personally, i use Arma for dedicated server hosting, which lets me delve into mission creating with the zeus feature.

The Zeus feature adds depth to this game because it lets you dynamically play around what's already given to you in the mission for your own enjoyment.

As for the community, the workshop showcases work still being created despite this game being quite dated.
This means that it is hard to run out of stuff to do in Arma, as there is always something to try.

Some negatives include the fact that this game isn't well optimised and you would need a beefy rig if you wanted to enjoy this game to its fullest capabilities.

Also the AI sometimes have unfair advantages over areas with high vegetation.

The AI can also be finicky to handle with Zeus (example being: getting an AI to go to a gunfight when they feel 'endangered' - instead they would stay prone).

Overall, the player experience is still very fine and it would be cool if other open world war games would consider having a Zeus-like feature or large-scale AI battles. 

"
7351,"Don't know what is going on, love it."
7352,"The best milsim I have ever played. This game is absolutely the best in the bread. It is not a pew-pew shooter at all but more like army simulation. Hundreds weapon types, gear, vehicles... ballistics, physics. It will take some time to learn all of it but it worth it!"
7353,"Incredibly in depth military simulator. Find a community and go to town with mods. you can literally do anything in this game with the right preperation. I personally play with [https://discord.gg/2nJWTyZ] TSB [/url] most of the time, they do missions at least daily if not more often and have a good variety of themes/concepts for those missions."

The idiots thought that screwing over the consumer who paid for the game by deleting your saves because you clicked one button and now have to start the campaign scenario again from the beginning.

7461,One of the best games I have ever played. Easy to mod the game to how you want. It takes some time to get use to the controls but it's worth it especially if you love mil sim games even if they're from 2013. It's definitely one of the games that i'll always keep coming back too (Until ArmA 4 comes out). Very active and helpful community's are around on the internet that can help you learn the controls (If you know where to look.)

7473,For a game that is eight years old it is still on of the most flexible and immersive military sandboxes on the market.
7474,"I'd seen videos on the game and as it was on sale I thought I'd give it a go. I joined a random game, no idea what is happening or what any of the controls are. I explained this to my teammates expecting to be ignored and made fun of, as is usual in most games, but everyone was really nice. They told me what to do, where to go, how to do things and made sure I was alright throughout. I wouldn't usually leave a review after such few hours in a game but after this surprisingly pleasant experience  I thought I'd share it with everyone. Check the game out, you just might be surprised :)"

7484,It‚Äôs a wonderful game there are some Dickheadz out there that like troll if you are wanting to play in the RP servers RP servers are not like they are years ago but if you want to play PVP like King of the hill warlords etc make sure you get all the of the dlc then there is going to have ads popping up which is kind of gay but I don‚Äôt know why Bohemia added that but and if you‚Äôre new and if you‚Äôre seeing this go through the campaign it will help you yes you will die a lot and you will get aggravated this is a military listing game you might get one shot from time to time  Even on the easiest difficulty so don‚Äôt get mad at me like oh my God game so hard yeah because it‚Äôs a military realist game I hope you people out buying the game in joy this game because I do I love it and there are so many mods out there for you can Play with and enjoy
7485,"I would recommend this game if you are wanting to play with a community, or a group of friends. You can play anything in this game as long as it's out there. This is also pretty utilized pretty heavily with the Zeus Game-mode. You want to play as a Modern 1st world country or 2nd world or 3rd world country and do military shit? You can do that. You wanna play as a Star Wars military Trooper? You can do that. You wanna play as a Halo Marine? You can do that. Wanna play as a World War 1 or World War 2 Soldier and get PTSD? You can do that. You wanna play as the Vietnamese Soldier or a US Soldier in Vietnam? You can do that. ArmA is one hell of a archaic game, but hella addicting, and it's fan-base is actually really chill to full-time dumb-asses based on which unit you run with, but it's all your finger-tips as to what you want to do."

7508,"Oh arma 

A development studio with a tumultuous history but able to produce somewhat clunky somewhat dated and so many bugs it's a feature massive scale military simulators.

And it's still probably the most unique genre among gaming ever others have tried but just couldn't quite match the easy to learn impossible to master formula of Arma.

This is definitely a game you're going to get out of it exactly what you put into it in an odd way nobody cares about the gameplay it's just a method of delivery for the experiences, and they are incredible.

Arma is the sandbox that allows you to be anything from a struggling merchant just trying to get by, to a veteran special forces operative dodging patrols directed by a human intelligence or done by humans themselves.

The community is the thing that can make or break your experience if you think you can just install some mods pick up and play in single player you're going to be entertained for a while but thousands of hours can be found in the wildly wildly diverse modded multiplayer community. 

And with the resurgence of the previously under appreciated Zeus mode It generates an experience that can only be described as ""DnD Dungeon Master is the opposition force in a massive scale military shooter with a backbreaking commitment to realism"" or 40k or halo or mass effect or the napoleonic wars...

You're starting to see the pattern

Now for some of the drawbacks the kind of 2035 semi futuristic setting of the vanilla assets isn't terribly appreciated by the majority of the community so mods are almost a requirement to play, performance demands are pretty substantial but significantly lessened by the performance of modern hardware, Expect to dedicate 200GB for this game on preferably a SSD or M2 drive to help cut down on some of the admittedly painfully long load times while modded.

Still that being said if you are looking for experiences you can't find anywhere else and have been sleeping under a rock for the past 4 years at 20 bucks you have nothing to lose."

There is so much you can do in it like fly planes and jets or drive tanks and boats. There are loads of missions and workshop made missions and maps. There's a large story to it with loads to complete. The weapons are very well done, i also like to use some mods when i play, especially the gun sound mods.
Great game overall!!"

7537,"Review 2021 
  
   Arma 3 is still hands down one of the best Mil-sim on the market even after 7 years since its release! No game like this can offer the replay-ability thanks to the community which is still very active and detail in realism as Arma 3 does. You want a futuristic warfare, modern warfare, maybe WWII or even WWI, heck I've even seen some mods going far back to the FIFTEENTH HUNDREDS for crying out loud this game has it. I highly recommend playing with a microphone and with the boys and not to mention a beefy PC. Yet despite this game being 7 YEARS OLD and having a high-end PC(specs at the end) it runs like absolute trash. 

   The optimization of this game is absolutely abysmal to say the least, and its borderline unplayable at times on multiplayer. To give you and idea, if you walk into a empty town or even a city, expect your FPS below 40! Surprisingly no matter what graphic settings I have it to, my FPS remains the same(especially on multiplayer). I've spent hours trying to optimize the game manual however the changes made little to no difference. The base game is pretty bland and generic at best but with a bunch of mods the community has created, that is what breaths the life into this game and gives the player a huge amount of re-play value which is why I still play this game to this day.

  In all, despite the horrendous performance and outdated graphics I still am recommend Arma 3 which to me should speak volumes for a game this old and for its problems. I want to give a huge thank you to all the community and especially the mod creators out there for carrying this game long past its life expectancy and giving us 'endless' content to the players free of charge.

7543,"I mean learning it is hard at first, but honestly it's not really that bad of a game"
7544,good game abit hard to understand at some points but so is it in the real military
7545,"Still no better military simulator for creators, editors, and players alike. Seriously, don't miss out on this experience."

7552,Super fun once you understand the game and find different units to play with.
7553,Horrible perfromance even on top tier systems
7554,"could use more content and optimisation, not enough good quality mods"
7555,"Played the alpha for almost 130  hours years ago... Haven't touched it since.
So I load it up, think ""I'll try the campaign to get used to things""...  30 minuets later, I rage quit...  You can't even aim down the sights consistently...  Never mind the questionable performance.  
"
7556,"When you create a game, it's GMod, when you join a server, it's fucking war"
7557,"Say hello to probably the single most played game on most peoples Steam Library. If you love Halo, Star Wars, Fallout, even Warhammer... all can be achieved with some mods and rolep... i mean tactical callouts. If you enjoy walking around for hours doing literally nothing then die to a sniper 3 clicks away... this is your game... if not... well its still your game cause you probably already own it."
7558,A lot of fun to be had in this game.

7572,this is epic
7573,"Best MilSim so far. 
Best in Simulation AND the amount of replay-ability due to Mods and Campaigns - unbeaten.

Yes, its an old Engine, yes it has many many bugs.
BUT! the Coop/ PvP/ Teamplay is what will keep you hooked. 
From the small quick Skirmishes - to the Grand persistent, over some weeks (capture the Island) Game-modes.
Its a blast for anyone who is tired of all the ""kiddies"" CODs and BFs.

A must have!"
7574,It is a environment in which you can do just about everything with the right mods.
7575,A
7576,Arma 3 + mods = fun

7603,"The best part is getting curb stomped

7604,"You can see that the way you want but there is no game on the market that could offer the same experience as Arma 3 does.

Yes there are certain bugs here and there, yes the shooting itself feels a bit plastic but still, modded Arma 3 with a bunch of custom coop missions is an experience that you can't find anywhere else. You can simply create any combat scenario you can imagine in Arma 3, starting from small stealth COOP night operations or SWAT police routine and ending wtih giant middle east city assault operations with lots of tanks, cars and helicopters.  

Also workshop mods give you an opportunity to improve vanila systems in order to get the most realistic weapon, gear and medical systems in combat simulation games ever."
7605,great game
7606,"Arma III...

At first I was hesitant, Arma III had been sitting in my library for quite some time unplayed. Finally, one day I decided to give it an honest shot.

And boy did I enjoy it.

Not only does ARMA III offer a nice and detailed campaign, but it's near-limitless multiplayer possibilities can make a fun time for your friends, and if you decide to deep-dive into the Eden Editor, you can craft your own missions for yourself and AI or your friends, and even the Arma community as a whole. While somewhat difficult to understand, the Eden Editor is very thorough and provides a lot of avenues for making different missions. The Steam Workshop provides hours of free custom content, and the DLC can provide even more, for a penny or two of course. 

The controls of Arma can be complex to a newcomer, however with a little practice you can manipulate them quite well. Overall, Arma provides a fun yet realistic military simulation if you really wanna feel like a SOLDIER."

7747,"My review will be short. Highly enjoyable game, even more enjoyable with friends and a few mods to go with. However, the only sad thing for me is that it's 2021 and Bohemia is still releasing some pointless DLC's for a nearly dead off hype game which is being milked to the maximum. Nevertheless, it's 2021 and Chernarus hasn't been reworked. Bohemia, how can you sleep at night with that fact, that the most iconic map of ARMA has no rework."
7748,"great military based game. very detailed in every aspect. do not get if your looking for a call of duty kid of game, arma is better because it is extreamly detailed"

7752,"Not a bad Shooter, a lot of mods, some can be a bit glitched"
7753,"I want to like Arma but the amount of key binds is just ridiculous. It takes so long to learn the game and once you finally do and want to get into a game you have to download 5000 mods just for one server... 

This game has grown so much and new players just cant learn. I recommend playing something else if your looking for that military open world experience."
7754,"eh, im new to pc so i found the controls a little strange but im getting used to it, great game if you want some semblance of realism in a shooter"

7786,"Clunky is an understatement, but ARMA 3 has all the makings of being the ultimate milsim and so much more than that thanks to mods.

Really, if you're looking for the most comprehensive milsim, this is it. But, do your research before you buy and understand that this game doesn't feel like other ""military shooter games"" you might be thinking of.

The best part of ARMA is the community, so get involved to best enjoy this game."
7787,"This game is one of my favorite games ever, there is so much possibility, and usually great people to play with. I would 100% recommend Arma 3 to anyone who wants a true military simulator experience, is eager to and has time to learn more than just the simple mechanics, as well as learn some cool stuff!"

And what is the boot camp for? it does not even cover the proper set of commands for sniping, focus on your shooting control , zooming on enemies - by the time you reach the first part of the game you look like and id**t looking for the enemy because they are so far in the distance you can't even see them unless you know to how actually zoom on them.
And the shooting and inventory controls is so bad can't even believe this got good reviews, what a total waste of money.
Did not even try to finish 2 or 3 missions, I'm out of here - UNINSTALL !!!"

7827,"The modding community has made this game into something irreplaceable imo, although it runs like watered down juice it is still awesome to play with a unit. The teamwork and ""realism"" you can get with Arma is something I really enjoy. Plus there's always bound to be hilarious or cinematic moments in this game. I appreciate Bohemia Interactive for letting this game continue to have a good modding platform, and I hope Arma 4 offers the same as this but runs and looks better :)"

7838,"I've always had an obsession with tactical simulations, and shooters. Boys and girls this one takes the cake. I have played countless first person shooters and military sim games. But I was always wanting more. Arma 3 delivers it all. From simple missions to in depth mission planning all the way down to custom load outs, even the very ammunition you carry. With the modding community the options are limitless from custom gear, weapons, vehicles, aircraft, even more realistic sound mods that make this game extremely in depth and addicting."
7839,Very nice game. Great graphics
7840,It is very fun and has a lot of options with modding
7841,ive only got a couple hours in and dont understand a whole heap of things but i already love the massiveness and the tactical thinking an all that
7842,I love the game very fun until you see all the DLC's there quite expensive.
7843,One of the best MilSim games on the market with endless playability and options... thousands of online groups to join and lots of fun to be had from those who enjoy the military sandbox life

7859,I need to peer pressure my friends to get this
7860,Boooooom!!!!! Best Military Sim Ever
7861,Best war sim ever!
7862,Several ways to actualy enjoy it. Endles possibilities. I can write a book about having fun with Arma but i rather get more hours on my favourite server.   simple rating 9/10 (10 was not made yet)
7863,"To preference this I'm using AMD Ryzen 7 3700x and a 2080 super.

The game is poorly optimized with constant frame drops and stutters. That being said, it's a pretty fun game. There is a huge mod scene that can and often does fill your ever wish and desire, when it comes to mil-sims. Just don't use more than a few or you'll watch your fps dive bomb. 

The public multiplayer is largely dead the only thing that makes this game still relevant is the hordes of private gaming clans/groups/whatever and indie devs making campaign dlcs.

DLC: They aren't bad but they aren't very good either. The vast majority doesn't really bring anything to the campaign but the multiplayer.

Prairie Fire: Location wise Prairie Fire doesn't really feel like Vietnam it feels more like Hawaii then anything else. The enemy comes at you in waves of two. Lifeless villages liter the map as well.

Iron Curtain and Global Mobilization Germany are largely lackluster and forgettable.
"
7864,"Runs like shit, doesn't matter if you have NASA Computer from the year 40,000, it will still run like if the PC was a literal Potato. Just live with 20 fps nerd. Controls are complex to hell. I have ~40 hours on this game and I still cannot play this confidently. Game is good. I love it. I also love contacts. Shame the game runs like an asthmatic Grandma but hey, it is good and I love it.
In the end I give it a 8/10. Needs power pc."
7865,"GOOD GAME AND GREAT MIL-SIM, SEEMS HARD FOR A NEWB THO."
7866,Very fun with friends. Expect war crimes if you play with friends.
7867,arma
7868,bad decision to buy this game. i dont even know how to play with other player. connect to quickplay random server and they kick me. so the community not friendly
7869,"It might be walking simulator, but it's hella fun with friends or just randoms. The fellowship of the game is on another level and well you might F around sometimes, but it's always fun."
7870,terrible game.
7871,Once you get arma 3'd your game hunger will turn into game greed. This game is only fgor thoes who love the sight of chaos of almost every minute. I recomend this to all!

We go in and clear the buildings of enemies
Just me and our only combat medic clearing a building

7877,"Best military simulator. Don't expect as many guns, gun parts, attachments, etc. as Tarkov - but that's okay! It means you can actually learn the game and enjoy shooting people in the face just as much as getting over the learning curve. Expect campers, expect to camp, play it like real life. Fun game."

7895,"very fun good stuff for WW2
"
7896,"Campaign is solid if you want realism and not your typical run and gun action and has a decent amount of singleplayer content to boot. A incredible sandox/creation toolset with great mod support to allow you to go nuts creating all kinds of military scenarios and such. The online community at this point and time is doing amazing as well with tons of public and private servers and one of the largest communities to exist outside of the game.

The only major drawbacks are that it can be a bit of a headache to learn how to use the creator at first without online help, the game can feel more then a little dated with some of its animations, textures and even voicelines, a lot of additional game play content has been made paid DLC with varying degrees of quality and lastly the game does contain its fair share of minor bugs but nothing so far that's game breaking."
7897,"In my entire steam library, this game purchase is the one I regret the most. I've played 40 hours, the last time I played it was in 2018. This should give you an idea of how boring this game is.

There is a campaign that can't keep my interest for long. I restarted it every time I started the game up because I forgot how everything works and I lost track. Story isn't interesting at all. The online experience isn't much different. It feels like there is nothing to do and there is no point of starting up the game and playing with other players. The only reason I wanted to play this game is because I wanted to do some role-playing with my friends, but boy did that backfire. No one found the game interesting enough to keep playing.

Game doesn't run too well on a mid-range system. As far as I could remember I couldn't reach a stable 60fps on low settings with high view distance, which puts you at a disadvantage if you don't leave it at high. For low-end systems, you'll have to put everything at the lowest settings to achieve a somewhat playable frame-rate.

You spend so much money on a game with no goal. That being said this is my opinion, I couldn't find anything interesting to keep investing time into this game. If you somehow find something to do that you know you would invest a lot of time in, then I'd say give the game a shot. For me however, it's a no."
7898,"Excellent military simulation game 
"
7899,boo
7900,"awesome awesome awesome . best fps milsim yet . it is worth making the purchase
"
7901,its good
7902,good
7903,"I'd prefer stable 60 fps rather than shiny graphics with terrible optimization.
If you aren't social and want to find easy coop servers you got low chances of finding perfect server.
Aside from negative I just mentioned it's best and only military shooters out there. You can be golden dron strike Obama. You can be isis. You can be civilian that gets drone striked. In this highly moddable game you can be everything including Zeus.
It's also a tank simulator, terrorist simulator, banana merchant simulator, outpost security that gets bombed by terrorists simulator. Anything that involves armed conflict simulator."
7904,123
7905,"Terroristism is fun, lol"
7906,"The buggiest sh** I ever played. Don't know why. I feel like this is some subset of Stockholm Syndrome. This game treats you wrong on every turn, and yet you continue to fight for it.
Buy it. Don't. Do it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
7907,"Arma is a waste of money when it comes to dedicated servers, I set one up, shows in the list but keeps being stuck on

This game will get you maybe 30-50fps at 1080p at medium settings DONT waste your money on this sorry excuse for a game 
this game fails to meet Mr.Expectations in all departments The guns feel fake and the soldiers feel like wimps 
You wear full body armor are as slow as a walking tank and yet for some unknown reason cant take 2 hits without dying 
arma3 and always will be a failure The only people who still play this game are nerds who play Roleplay and pretend to be a terrorist and teamkill like 10 people before the admins boot them"
7918,Thousands of hours played. It's good.
7919,It's alright
7920,"If you enjoy standing around, convoluted menu options for simple tasks, minutiae, hyper aggressive snakes  and rare combat, this is the game for you!!! Like minecraft but stupider and less fun, If this is a realistic depiction of war then it is no wonder returning vets don't want to talk about it. I have done more interesting poos than this."
7921,poopy poop poop butthole
7922,cool gam
7923,You'll either run into the 40 year old veteran or the 16 year old wannabe veteran. You will get no more than 35 frames no matter what your system is.
7924,"Hard to figure out in the beginning, but well worth the money."
7925,ok guys this was okay
7926,I have no life
7927,iT`S A FUN GAME JUST DONT GET CARRIED AWAY
7928,"very fun, play with people
"
7929,OUHIUKGFJYG
7930,I do not like this game very much
7931,"very fun
"
7932,"Tons of Fun, clunky game, but if you like tactical realism, then this is for you, better when played with friends or people who want to play in syncrony"
7933,This game is very exciting and fun it is heavily moddibal and the community is amazing i would recommend this for hardcore gamers who want an immersive experience
7934,100
7935,gud
7936,it fun
7937,"Game, yellow and brown, tree stump bannan"
7938,"arma 3 mwah brilliant ill admit im kinda a roplayer only on this game but its worth it cause with mods you can basically do anything like use a mech or climb or rappell ill reccomend rusahaf more guns the beter know what i mean
"
7939,"Reached my 2000 hours sooooo... Its a wonderful game, at times it can be kinda ehh, especially with cod kids who play it for the first time and idiots who are like ""hey zeus gimme CAS"" but if you find a good community, you'll have a splendid time. you'll get to do stuff, drive to AO's, wait on a hill for an hour and then get to go into a town only to get one shotted by an AI you couldnt see and die immediately, only to fly ten minutes to get reinserted. And probably die again, but point is. Its not a game for everybody, I'm still an idiot at it but I really enjoy it. Do reccomend, if its your thing then enjoy, if it isn't your cup of tea no harm no foul. anyway, parting word. ""Man, 100 meters, Front."""
7940,Good mods
7941,warcrime simulator 2k21
7942,Bumm
7943,"really realistic
"
7944,
7945,much warfare
7946,This game is more PPhurty than any rogue like I've ever played; it makes Dark Souls look easy.
7947,"A very ahrd to get in game. it is really taktical and for nobody who is searching for a lot of action without preperation.
you need at least 20 hours of practice till you can start to play in a good way. a lot of different short keys you have to know.

now after over 100hours of gameplay i start to be not a noob anymore xD and the game get interesting.


For someone who can endure the first hours till you know how to play it will be a good game. 
for anyone else who dont have this patiient dont touch it ^^."
7948,great game! having a lot of fun trying out some olympus server roleplay

7950,Good game
7951,All fun until being forced to play 3rd person aloud servers. slows the game down and makes close counters one sided. very limited game modes online.
7952,"With the right mods you can turn Arma into a very enjoyable and fun experience, I myself have been in Halo operations, Warhammer operations, WW2 operations and much more. Arma Editor allows you to create your own special missions and campaigns for single or multiplayer. Besides that it offers an assortment of vanilla missions. Thing that hinders my overall view on Arma is its FPS issues and complicated multiplayer service. Using DLCs so you can use tanks or sniper rifles can be a bit shitty, for me it was worth the effort tho. Hopefully with the upcomming Arma 4 these issues shall be made right"
7953,best mil sim even till this date
7954,"Good game, obviously alot of work was put in. Bugs are present, but I believe they can be fixed. In my opinion, this is best milsim game, allowing so much replayability, good scenarios, player made campaigns, custom vehicles, alot of mods. Would be great if DLCs were smaller in price, but you are still allowed to interact and use DLC stuff, which is great. 10/10"
7955,The game lives because of Dean 'Rocket' Hall
7956,"Good game, 200 meters, front"
7957,"its a great game
"
7958,Amazing
7959,fire
7960,good game. to pissed off to actually review.
7961,good game.  send me feet pics and i will buy for you
7962,Join a unit they will help you learn the game.
7963,"I ver ejoy arm frre it ver god gam fum up recomd
i ejoy optre md vr good sper fun halo recomend :)
"
7964,Difficult to get the hang of but when you finally do its hard to put down
7965,a
7966,"Have been playing this series since Operation Flashpoint (yeah that old potato) followed into arma 2, arrowhead and for i don't remember how many years this piece of shit. If not for the COMMUNITY that has gone FAR AND BEYOND with this game, is not just bad, is super like super really bad. The AI is inconsistent at its BEST even with mods, may miss someone right in front of them but pleasure you with a headshot from 400 meters in the night. But we know all that crap, has been the same since OPERATION FLASHPOINT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. Why do i write this review after all this time? Because at its core it WANTS to be a good game. Though is not a game, is a simulation, for its own crowd. BUT you BET YOUR ASS i will leave a DO NOT RECOMMEND for the following reason. Been working all day long in the Eden Creator, searching scripts etc etc... It was not easy cause its one of the WORST CREATOR ENGINES I EVER LAID EYES UPON but that is not the problem. The problem is that at some point, the scenario just broke. Just when i thought i had everything running smooth, it fucked up the artillery. Why? Don't know. Was working? For sure. Can i fix it??? Have been trying for HOURS. I got frustrated, i hit a dead end. So much for my hard work. But. I run also into another bug. When got hit, the character laid down, and almost immediately going up giving the grey screen of wounded and being IMPOSSIBLE TO GO 1ST PERSON OR AIM DOWN THE SIGHTS... AFTER ALL THESE YEARS... BUGS. BUT BOHEMIA has been MORE THAN INDUSTRIOUS spewing out DLC after rediculous DLC... Karts DLC??? Really??? FUCK THIS GAME AND FUCK BOHEMIA FOR LEECHING ON ITS AMAZING COMMUNITY. If not for the hardcore gamers behind this game, it would be DEAD ON FUCKING ARRIVAL. My trust is shattered for good. I will not go again into another Arma title UNLESS I AM SURE THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE IRONED OUT which i really really doubt. FUCK THAT SHIT."
7967,"Started playing. Loaded up the editor. In the day selection it literally tells you the moon phases (which is what I was looking for). Now, that is production value."
7968,God
7969,bad
7970,fun with friends better with mods get into a good group if you want to have fun on this game i recommend the 86th on discord.
7971,i dont know how to play the game but i make random shit in the creator and have fun with that
7972,haha gun go boom
7973,Pain..... enough said
7974,great game
7975,"Yea, fun."
7976,"Haven't played much of Arma 3 but from what i have played. Best Milsim Game that i have ever played, Everything in it is so great!"
7977,"game was kinda cring and this guy kept yelling racial slurs (runoisch ithink) other than taht pog game kinda sus
"
7978,Spectacular physics engine

7980,great
7981,very nice game
7982,its aight
7983,War Crime Simulator 10/10
7984,i cant find any server avialable
7985,i like shooting civilians and committing war crimes
7986,a
7987,my friend saddam reccomended this game and so far its great.
7988,fun shoot people
7989,This game is like crack and heroin mixed together into one mean mother fucking drug
7990,Unplayable if you don't have all the dlc.
7991,very good
7992,Fun
7993,in my opinion multiplayer is kinda boring IN MY OPINION. I really really really really really really like the editor and all the fun stuff i can do with it
7994,You can have 1000+ hours in this game and still not know half the keybinds.
7995,pew pew
7996,you ever wake up with a rock hard boner and slap your wifes fat ass? thats what its like to play Arma 3
7997,Excellent squad command strategy game and mod platform
7998,VERY GOOD
7999,amazing game honestly no words could properly describe this game its worth every penny and so is every add on
8000,very fun to mess around in editor with workshop mods or with friends in co-op scenarios ect
8001,it is easy game
8002,very good very nice very good community very interactive love it
8003,i accidentaly refunded the game
8004,You can easily squeeze a couple of hours out of it.
8005,"The best and most realistic shooter I've seen. Sure it has it's share of glitches and bugs, but for the most part, it runs smoothly."
8006,"The game is completely broken. Today, it's full of bugs to the point of being unplayable."
8007,"LOVE the game very realistic, its just a little annoying you have to buyu all the dlc's to use tank or helis etc"
8008,"It's Only fun with friends on a MP server. I mean, it can be alot of fun, and it is the only reason ill still play it.
The Overall solo experience is lacking and boring at the best of times.

The Developers cant get a grip of the most basic of glitches and exploits but seems to understand how to rob users with each DLC quite well, whilst almost abandoning previous content."
8009,it's ok.
8010,"yes its good, arma 4 now please."
8011,d
8012,<3
8013,"Very well designed game (apart from the physics that comes with it) i suggest buying this game if you have atleast 3-4 friends who will play it with you, or you are in a community that will gladly accept you. Dont get me wrong but the game is also fun w/o friends, its just more fun in a group of ppl. Strong recomendation for Milsim fans, and other realism fans. It offers alot of opratunities. Only complaint that i have is, alot of stuff is blocked behind tons of dlcs.  11/10 would play again."
8014,.............
8015,Fck my computer specs.
8016,"It's a great game, if you want to play a game that simulates reality at a high level that's the right game. It's a game where every decision matters. Fast means slow, slow means fast."
8017,I refunded the game after 2 hours cause I didn't find friends to play it with. I regret refunding it as I've found players to play it with.
8018,"7/10 base game
8.5/10 with Bohemia DLC
9/10 with All DLC
15/10 when you and your clone trooper pals start blasting Roman gladiators.

Also, I have nearly 100 days of playtime, so make of that what you will."
8019,Military sim with like minded people with the gems of Arma instances/experiences that happen at the most poignant times equals great memories.
8020,CONSUMES MY LIFE NOW
8021,Wasted 50 hours just to learn the controls. 69/10
8022,"I Happy, I do war crimes Daily. Join A3Ph now >:DD"
8023,good game also like the sandbox many things to do
8024,"Ride wife life good, wife fight back kill wife, wife gone.... think about wife... regret"
8025,very good
8026,good
8027,"very realistic, very easy to learn, friendly fans and players"
8028,A-10 Warthog go brr
8029,unique
8030,its a good game if your looking for a realistic military shooter.  It takes a little while to get used with the many controls and functions.Once you learn its a blast.
8031,Great game
8032,awesome game
8033,it guud

8037,Mod is life
8038,good
8039,"Arma 3 is a over all god game, it has MIL Sims and PVP or just plain old single player. The modding community is over all really good. i would recomend this game to someone 9/10 times"
8040,This game is great as long as you can keep it working.
8041,"I mainly play in editor, messing around alone bt i have to say, the game is pretty fun even if your alone, it ca be frustrating at some points buts its worth it!"
8042,"Arma 3 is everything I have ever really wanted from a shooter. It is a little dated as of the time I am writing this review 8/26/21, but it still holds up as a really fun mil-sim. The level of fun you have often depends on the server you decide to play on and the people within the server."
8043,gg
8044,"I've played every single iteration of the Bohemia games since Flashpoint. They just port the bad parts of the previous game without learning from their mistakes. 
I cannot count the times i am forced to go with scavenging a sniper rifle and hiding on a non-grassy knoll, just so i could see who the hell was shooting at me with perfect vision through all sorts of cover.
The inventory has been crap since their first game, is crap now, and will never be fixed.
Your NPC squad mates seem to have endless stamina as you trail behind, and you realize the only reason any of them survive contact with the enemy is that the one guy who doesn't bite a bullet is scripted in so he's invulnerable.

I loved the story of Operation Flashpoint: Resistance, and wished they'd fix those damned issues plaguing their game series. Sadly they cut the story depth and increased the clunky UI...and who doesn't love bad graphical bushes that the enemy can see right through?

compared to ANY decent FPS shooter out there, ARMA3 practically bellows it's flaws like a yodeller in the Alps. Flaws that have been repeated since 2001"
8045,meep meep
8046,"Arma 3 is really fun, and for me really hard lol. It's a game you need to spend time in to get better, but the maps customization are so nice that it had me coming back to play, even after failing missions T_T."
8047,good
8048,If you want to use a certain gun or have some fun in jets you need to grind for 10s of hours which is extremely boring. Not a game for me.
8049,ARMA 3 FTW
8050,ok
8051,An Awesome Improvement on the original. I just put in my first 6 hours and I look forward to playing more...
8052,best game ever
8053,ITS A FUN GAME CAN DO ENYTHING YOU WANT
8054,"good

"
8055,"Hell yea
"
8056,"Ok game with good mechanics with no mods, but with mods this is AMAZING!!! the sky is the limit when checking out the mods for this game. there is also dlc, but the only 2 good ones are apex and sog prairie fire (sorry for the mispelling) but if your not interested in 2035 or vietnam, just play mods"
8057,This game sucks
8058,good game
8059,like skyrim with guns
8060,"Look, no one buys Arma for Arma. They buy it for what you can do in Arma, in which case, it's hard not to recommend. If I had to describe any of the Arma games in one word though, that word would be ""janky"". Do what you will with this information."
8061,sicc
8062,"yes
"
8063,very fun game the editor is the funnest part about the game and mil sim and Rp is rampant in the arma community if that's for you.
8064,"How a game can be so bad and yet so great at the same time, is beyond me. However, every time I play I have both an awesome time and make me want to rip out my hair and pound my head against my desk like an orangutan."
8065,"Definitely a fun game. Whether you want to just play the campaigns, or play some co-op scenarios. Hell, even the online servers are fun to play. Surprisingly, for the type of game it is, the community isn't really that toxic at all. At least in my experience. Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone."
8066,gatorade should be thicker
8067,this game was absolute pain. best torture experience i ever had.
8068,"I've been playing this game for awhile now, and its a good game. It's worth 30 bucks. The community is ok."
8069,much wow
8070,very pog
8071,"Since no one reads the comments, I announce with my head held high that I am gay!"
8072,dlc
8073,This game has a lot of bugs and problems for example the horrific AI. Probably some of the worst AI i have encountered in a while. Not to mention the constant crashes and restarts. Arma can be an absolute blast to play ONLY IF you have A group to play with.  If you mostly play by yourself give this game a hard pass.
8074,nijs
8075,SZAR
8076,great mods available for what you like to play
8077,nice
8078,Just great.Learnt a lot especially helps in STEM.
8079,this game is so fantastic
8080,Great milsim that takes a while to get used to but don't let that turn you away the game is great fun especially with friends :)
8081,"The community are large enough, creative enough to uphold and push forward the fun game play. ArmA 3 provide a modular foundation that makes it easy for people to improve the game/simulation for the other players. New mod built on vanilla ArmA 3 makes for a continous growth and you never get bored. Be it you spend time in a single player environment or in open servers and in clans. Its moving forward and with a ability to captivate the user. There are no other games in this category delivering the same open world, mod friendly and stable progress."
8082,good
8083,kneecap
8084,best game in the world

8087,"imagine growing too old for online games because everyone under a certain age was raised on youtube reaction channels and they think that over-reaction and saying every thought you ever had out loud on a global channel across 100 players is how you have to play every game, including tactical shooters.

now, imagine a game that isn't a game, but a military simulator targeted to veterans and adults who appreciate complex systems for serious tactical fun; an ascension to leave the FPS twitch shooters and mature into a world that requires patience, and doesn't hold you hand. 

Now, make that milsim so clunky that modders have to fix it, and those modders get a tad carried away over time. Over the past decade They literally give birth to the hardcore survival genre (DayZ mod),  the fortnite genre (battle royal mod), and probably the forerunner of online City heist role play games (Altis Life). 

Because of these mods popularity online with streamers, the kids couldn't get enough youtube content. Developers with more resources and vision than Bohemia Interactive had seen these metrics, and raced to make better copies of these mods that are now milti-billion dollar franchises.

Have you imagined all that? I'm not done. Now, send all the serious tactical nerds to isolated milsim clans hidden behind passwords, private servers, miles of red tape drama, and 100gb of ever-changing mod packs, and replace all the cool streamers that have long since left to other games with the kids who grew up watching it: The weird ROTC kid with acute ASD whom (after waiting an hour for a mission to finally make contact) wants to PASSIONATELY argue with you over the finer points of why he is the supreme expert on [ military subject] in the middle of a firefight, then asks how to toggle walk/run while wrapping a helicopter around a power line. 

did you imagine all that? now Imagine me deleting it and reinstalling it at least once a year, and coming back again and again to chase that dragon of what potentially could be were it not for a core community of man-children who learn to script exploding chickens raining from the sky BEFORE they ever learn how to aim a rifle. There is a guy here who has been grifting servers with scripts for almost 9 years straight. never been dealt with by Bohemia. and has to be pushing age 30 by now, but has not yet evolved from his favorite childhood pastime.

got the picture? Good! then i saved you the experience of Arma3 in 2021. the golden age is over. it's best you move along."

8121,"Arma is, and I have full confidence to say, one of the best, most realistic military simulators I have played and has yet to be beaten. Everything you would expect, realistic weapons, bullet drop, fucking massive maps (nothing like I've ever seen), sanbox, mission creator, EXCELLENT community and the people are amazing but very repetitive gameplay loop, there's no real gameplay loop, so it's mostly sandbox. Unless you go onto a server and play with people. I have never had such a positive experience with any other shooter but I personally ended up leaving my unit and everything fell apart because I got bored super quick. You can get a mod called Dynamic Recon Operations which makes for some fun-ish games. Realistic map reading, it uses your entire keyboard, which can be either a great or awful thing. Jets and other flying vehicles have never been harder to fly if you don't know what you're doing, which is a good thing. Because the community mostly has dedicated crew and assigns certain people to certain roles which is amazing. This game is nothing without it's community, and to be honest, if you're looking to play single player, enjoy dying to a bot that is calculated to be better than the worlds best sharpshooters regardless of difficulty over and over. There are mods that help the issue, but never have fixed it. If you're still reading, I suggest getting a few things first. Remove sprint (I think it's called), ACEX (and associated mods) RHSF (or something like that), GRSF (again, something like that). inventory is practically a gauge that says how much you can fill to a certain point regardless of item (which I find both stupid and genius), but I'm sure if you want a tarkov inventory space you can get one.One last thing, you will have to purchase a few DLC but they don't cost much. And that's about it."

8136,After several years Arma 3 still has no rivals speaking of realism and large scale battles.
8137,"Just remember, regardless of the marketing, this is more a game, not a simulation, and Bohemian Interactive appears unlikely to ever really improve the core engine, remove most of the bugs, or add all the little obvious things everyone thinks of and agrees they should.  This includes frequent crashes and stuff that newer first-person shooters are using like not only integrated VR but, you know, the ability to look strait up or strait down first-person, move around in an natural manner over obstacles, or manipulate objects in the environment or the environment itself. 

For instance, the scope zeroing changes from rifle to rifle, as if the scopes' knobs magically change.  Arma 3 is also missing features that literally every other, not only combat but non-combat, flight sim EVER has had, too, and even Ace Combat series has.  It's all strange because BI miraculously licensed a high-end helo flight model from RT Dynamics called GenHeli600, and while the RT documentation clearly indicates RT knows what they're talking about, Bohemian Interactive clearly does not, calling the Auto Trim, for instance, a ""difficulty setting"", which it is not.  It's an actual AFCS intermediary for use with digital deflection or pressure joysticks rather than long-pole cyclics with their own mechanical trimmers or damping.  Heck, there's no reason for BI to be including the simple helo flight model anymore.  

This isn't even getting into the additional detailed fixes and nuanced features they also should have thought of but apparently didn't, either.  I've had this only a week and I have a list of like two dozen things already that aren't even the bugs, and when I bring some of this up with others in multiplayer, they often go, ""Yeah, I noticed that too, and BI knows about that.  They'll never (change that, add this, or do that).""  

Speaking of documentation, BI wants you to either pay for their Field Manual or buy the more expensive versions of Arma 3 to get it.  I have it and I can tell you it's sparse and just some little clickable menu of cursory info, like that aforementioned part is literally two short sentences.  None of the manual is thorough.  It's laughable.  I found people all over the internet looking for a long printable manual in PDF, and there isn't even enough content to put in a pamphlet.  

What does BI seem interested in doing with their time?  Apparently releasing new vehicles, uniforms, guns and sometimes just in a new color in packs of like 4 or 5 and wanting you to pay 10 bucks for it in an additional DLC.  If you accidentally equip some of that gear in multiplayer that you don't 'own', BI will shut your multiplayer session down in a few minutes during your brief instance of rare, glitch-free gameplay.  

Arma 3's controls configuration is also literally the weirdest, most awkward I've ever seen, and I've seen many, with each line of keypress or button assignment being the same as those for an axis, such that certain axis will turn into binary on/off or not have their full range and there's no way to predict which it will be.  It's just a bunch of trial and error and you have to make due with what you can configure.  You don't even get one axis per function, and instead it's broken up into positive and negative movements.  Totally bizarre.

Arma 3 is fun and addictive, far more than the eventually monotonous and boring Elite Dangerous that I also bought, but Arma 3 is not a simulation and not particularly polished or thorough.  BI has clearly been 'sitting on their laurels' for a very long time raking in the money for little effort.  Someone like DCS could start including infantry stuff and basically easily destroy BI's market share overnight.  I'm not saying that's definitely going to happen, so maybe this is as good as we'll get.

Edit: 

It can be made a bit more simmy with mods, of which there are thousands of serious ones, but it's worth pointing out that your already precarious stability is going to probably get worse with each additional mod.  As of right now, I have a hundred actively in-use.  My search for stability is still ongoing.  None of these mods substantially improve the aircraft weapon systems or sensor implementations, unfortunately, which are just plain universally goofy -- how and when you can employ weapons is worse than Gunship! and there isn't even a Field of Regard box in any of the EO/FLIRs.  So, for instance, there's no way to tell which way your turret is pointed in relation to the rest of the aircraft when you're heads-down.

Nonetheless, I have expanded from the Apex Bundle to the Ultimate Edition.  You should also know that the install size of the official entire Arma 3 is about 42GB, but with the big add on 'mod' map collections or the optional third-party DLCs that size will balloon.  

Lastly, during multiplayer you should be aware there are hackers cheating even with BattlEye requirements, so don't be surprised if you see people walk through walls, withstand multiple direct hits from rockets, seem to be omnipotent, or you get suddenly booted when you become too persistent and try too hard.  Some of them REALLY like to 'win'.  This isn't getting into the impatient intoxicated people online, the people who are just trolls that pose as the other side, or the random neo-Nazi orator that you can always mute.  Remember the single player experience is available and not bad (ignoring the stability issues for a moment), especially user-created ones and free mission generators."

8140,"I like to shoot things, so i enjoy this game a considerable amount."
8141,"I love the intellectual property of Arma 3 but Bohemia Interactive released a product that had very little content to it and they charged a premium price. The ""DLC"" adds content that was blatantly cut from the base game so they could profit more. 

Bohemia Interactive seriously released a bare-bones working title with a weak skeleton and sat back to let the modders come in and add content. When you have modders who develop a better quality of life gameplay and content that far supersedes the development of Bohemia Interactive, it really makes your company look downright incompetent and/or uncaring. 

I do not believe in Bohemia Interactive's ability any more. Profit margins and investor incentives are what they look forward to. I believe in the modders and the community who have shown themselves throughout the years to have more passion and interest than Bohemia Interactive have given. 

Thank you modding community for all of your hard work and glorious ideas.

Second, the AI is boneheaded unless carefully scripted, and yet can do things like accurately return fire against a suppressed weapon in the dark - with no night vision.  Or magically see you in pitch black darkness (again, without NV) as you lay motionless in tall grass (they really need to fix this crap)."

A must have in your arsenal of games."
8192,"It is really realistic. I can't say the most realistic one but it's okay. Environmental sounds are awesome, you feel inside the game. You will see a mention in game as ""Real Virtuality"". It is the explanation of this game. 

Tutorial is not teaching everything, so you will suffer in the beginning. But if you search on google you can find everything about game's mechanic or missions etc.

As I said firstly not the best game for me in realism category. Number one is still Insurgency Sandstorm. If you didn't hear this game check this out...

8233,Best game I've ever played. 10/10. Would recommend to anyone interested by the military or milsims. But the base game isn't really enough. Would recommend buying DLC's and you will need mods to really enjoy yourself. Mulitplayer+singleplayer are equally good. Amazing game.
8234,It is a great fun military sim. And because of the mods in the workshop there is something for everyone to make your life easier or more difficult. I really would recommend it for everyone who loves shooters and military.

8325,"SO GOOD! The developers did an outstanding job portraying 1980s East and West Germany with a TON of attention to detail. Especially tiny details like signs that indicate where gas lines run underground, or even just the menus in the restaurant. Or the news channel which is an actual Germany TV channel. Or the (well-known) jokes the West German soldiers make about east Germany. I particularly liked the last mission, fleeing from East Germany. PLEASE BOHEMIA! More games that take place in Germany!The DLC unfortunately shows the same weaknesses as ArmA 3 - terrible squad AI and even controlling your own tank crew is a micro management nightmare. Also in this DLC, the graphics look like they were taken straight from ArmA 2."

8342,"One of the, if not - the best tactical milsim-like shooter with a good degree of realism (without a single enhancement mod).

Mods are, thank to the modding community, so good and further enhance aspects of the game greatly and cost nothing.

Finding a good communicative squad to fight with is essential for maximum engagement and enjoyment.

One day i just noticed that there is a ""time on record"" and when i saw the number i was frankly surprised, i had no idea...it was like time just flew by.

I don't regret it, far from it - it is a terrific game and i highly recommend it.

_Cons_

- Low FPS
- Hard at the start
- Costy DLC`s

_Opinion_

Never thought i like playing this Game. 
Its a LowFPS like OpenWorld Shooter that, if played in Multiplayer, is ton of Fun.
Singleplayer is generic and boring. Tutorial is easy to Understand and the Game has a bit of Humour.
I feel the DLC`s are a bit Expensive for what they are. You dont really need the DLC`s though, but i recommend getting the Apex DLC for better Playing Experience. The Gameplay itself is extensive and hard in Multiplayer and
you will be absolutely rolled over at the Start."

8395,"I would definitely recommend this game if you wanted a light challenge. The campaign gets very oh so very slightly repetitive but other than that, it is very engaging (no pun intended). I think it was just repetitive because you had to keep going back to base and get sent to different deployments which I assume is the way it works IRL? I don't know and am unfamiliar as I have never been in the military but other than that, great game, I just hope 4 comes out soon as some of these character graphics could use some fine tuning."

8420,"Played since Operation Arrowhead during Arma 2. Improvement over A2:OA in every way it feels like. I run the game with a load of mods (which the community is good at). Campaign is fun for a while but does start to grind after a while (DLC campaigns are slightly better especially Prairie Fire). This game excels at light simulation for active warzones. Mostly focus on PvE though as the game is focused mostly on fighting AI as the system is not refined enough for most PVP situations. There are PVP servers but most clans and mil-sims run Zeus (player creating a story using AI with the players interacting with said story). I've logged an ungodly amount of hours on this and the other Armas on other accounts long lost. If your into light scifi, WW2, Vietnam, modern warfare...odds are there are mods for you out there. Arma is ok standalone but the Mods are what makes this game great. DLC can get you there but I don't recommend many of them since if you play with a clan they typically don't expect you to have them (most assets are mods so you don't need to bother with many DLCs except maybe PF and Apex.)"

8448,Highly mod-able.
8449,Its alright
8450,"MODS! ZEUS! APEX! look hear me out dis game kinda old but the mod community keeps it fresh and new and the community is pretty helpful in teaching new players how to mod and how to play the game. The controls are a bit complex but after a couple games or hours you will get used to them. my only issue is the port forwarding process to play with your friends in private. Its a bit of a chore when it eventually stops working for you and you have to open more ports manually do everything, That is my only issue but other than that id say this game is worth it. The Apex bundle is the way to go if you are to buy it. <3"
8451,such great game

Like a small mission even with AI only take like an hour to walk to a battle that you risk getting one shotted by a stray enemy or friendly bullet? Every gun from a pistol to a jet in an area so big you'll never see everything in.
 Just watch out for the 15 year old wanting you to call him sir."

8463,It's fun.
8464,"This is clearly American military propaganda, like wtf is this badly programmed game. Graphics like gta 4, voicelines was literally Made from a basic American military general like all of them written too by him, the controls were basically 60 mins of my gameplay went into trying to make them work, who puts both a zoom and an optic zoom in a game and replaces them it was a nightmare trying to find the correct ones. So yeah this game is only for diehard military fans since the money go directly to them anyways. 1/10 only cause players at least get to run their own servers, not like i managed to get into one of them but at least there is an option, and steam allows refunds so i didnt waste my money."

8493,It's pretty decent...
8494,love how realistic the game is.

8496,good game 10/10
8497,"Let me begin by saying that I love realistic type FPS games where it is difficult to locate and hit the target. With that being said, this game let me down. The single player is basically just running simulator with silly ""stealth"" missions where you have to sneak by a bunch of APCs to meet up with another squad that started from the same camp as you but yet they didn't have to sneak by anything. There is far less action than I had anticipated. Worth it if its on sale but I probably won't play anymore than 10-20 hours."

8519,"Shit game. Servers are all dead, and if they aren't, they're inaccessible due to a myriad of computer errors. Controls are absolutely fucked, i had to spend 30 minutes just figuring out how to remap the controls and another hour to remap them in a way the game would accept. Not even the campaigns work, all i get are error messages. My pc cost 4 grand in total and the fact this game is unable to run on this beast of a pc is pathetic. BI also flubbed my account creation and i am unable to access my account, and on that note, i really wish developers would stop requiring people to create 50 bajillion accounts just to play their games that dont work. I know ill get someone saying ""well you gotta download these 50 patches and these 100 files onto your computer"". If a game doesn't work as it is made, it is a shit game bar none.

If you want airsoft as a video game, welcome aboard. Slow movement, long moments of no action, and quick deaths that come out of nowhere are what makes this game's more successful moments so much more enthralling. Good luck Comrade."

8535,It personally wasn't a game for me but im also not a arrogant dick head that cant see its for a different audience and the people interested in mil-sims will love this game it has amazing core mechanics and so many options to explore

8544,yes
8545,AI has better aim than me
8546,"I realized I have placed an unhealthy amount of time into this game and figured its finally worthy of a review:

Its a sandbox shooter. Enjoy singleplayer games? There's a campaign and tons of workshop missions for that. Enjoy mil-sim? There's a billion communities for that, find one you like (may take a few). Enjoy more arcadey games but wish they had a little more oomph? There's game modes for that. 

tl;dr - If you like shooters, you'll probably find something you like in this. Also has a massive modding community so you wont run out of content."

8574,awesome game!
8575,I wanted this game since 2013 and the graphics are still amazing!
8576,"Very fun game. If you can pick up the DLC's on a sale, it makes the game just that much better. Lots of roleplaying potential and plenty or realistic action. 10/10"
8577,"Its not like COD, but its def fun with a group of friends. More of a simulator than a shoot em up. Can be exciting, helps build teamwork skills."

8587,great game still after all these years
8588,"It's an all round good game, a solid 95 out of 100.... gets you gripped and submersed in the game, with many options available.

My only niggle with it is that sometimes you don't know where you are being shot from and can be a little frustrating.

but on the whole I like it"
8589,"Epic game for simulations. lots of fun once you get the hang of it, community support is great too!"
8590,"This is one of the best games i have played i n a LONG time.  yeah it takes some learning and getting used to, but i love this game.  Definitely recommend"
8591,"i started off playing this on a laptop which really aint the best idea but it was still a great game and never lacked in things to do and now playing it on a proper PC the experience has enhanced so much more and the mods and DLC that i have run so much better and make it more enjoyable if you like open worlds, sandboxes and combat games this is for you even with its glitches and problems its still fun to play both single player creating own missions or online working with teams top capture objects in a realistic manner this is the game for you."
8592,This is my time capsule for when I have over 1000 hours put into this game
8593,grug like shooty game
8594,very fun bit of a lerning curve but altogether its fun

8608,Great tactical shooter with realistic feel. Played a lot of Exile (DayZ Style Mod) and 50 player+ games modes.
8609,its ight. I feel likes its unfair to give it a rating with how little time I have put into it. Ill give it another rating after a put in a few more hours of playtime.
8610,arma 3
8611,good game for sure
8612,"love the game but must have mods they are lost of fun to use i give 5 stars for the game although there are some bugs but you can get over them

8621,"All of my current playtime is from 2 roleplay servers and a modded server that is literally DayZ. I've barely begun to explore this game's capabilities and I'm already addicted. Graphics are similar to that of PUBG, but I don't even think mine are maxed, so they're a-okay. All-in-all the game runs pretty smooth with my 1060 GPU, and my CPU is pretty garbage as well.
70% of the player-base I've encountered has been toxic as hell, but that's to be expected of a shooter game.
Guns are dope, vehicles are dope, and I haven't even seen half of the game's true content.

I know this isn't helpful, but the game is good long-story short. 9/10"
8622,its a lot of fun with the right group when it's not crahsing. the game has little optimization unfortunately
8623,"Very shoot. Much kill. Get some mods.

8624,this game make battlefield look like a baby's l Lego play set
8625,it gud
8626,This game is truly epic. I like killing the bad guys.
8627,"The best part of this game is the editor. I played Operation Flashpoint and the first two Arma games for years so I am very familiar with the editor. It is not hard to figure out to build literal endless scenario of whatever you can come up with, however as you continue to learn how to use it and build stuff it is an endless wormhole. There are countless ways to get involved in multiplayer stuff but I have never made it past the stuff I come up with to play offline on the editor. The campaign and scenarios are pretty fun too."
8628,With mods Yes
8629,good game. shoot gun then die.
8630,"ee
"
8631,fuck this game i got it for 10 bucks and as soon as i played it i knew why it was the visuals look like dogshit and it has some really dumb mechanics that make the game not fun like the energy meter im usually ok with these thing but this is a energy meter on crack you cant spirint for over 3 seconds even if you have nothing equiped and even normaly walking runs a fucking   train on your energy meter it reminds me of 4 year old me when i tried to run a marathon but these soldiers arent 4 year old me no their fully grown battle hardened soldiers if someone could make a mod to remove this that would be great
8632,Fun to play with friends
8633,ITS GOOD GAME

You can really do whatever you want in editor and zeus"
8643,"Oh, you don't have DLC's, just buy them... Are you poor or what?"
8644,I was looking for a game that have a lot of buttons and I found it
8645,"Today I noticed that I have never written  a review for ARMA 3, and boy was that odd. On record it says I have 2,732.8 hours of gameplay. Now, All of that  was years ago, and I barely get in these days, though I wish to. For me there is no real reviewing of ARMA 3. Its a simple expression about what this ""Tool"" meant to me. This ""Tool"" and that is where its value is, was in what it made possible for me to do with others. ""Social"" and ""Tactical value"" is immense when you use it for that reason. Sandbox is the most accurate term. You have ""play things"" that are ""Military"" and you have ""Creative tools"" you have 'Editing tools"" and you have a ""Modding Community"" that are simply MAJESTIC. So, what you get out of using this Military Simulator tool Set called ARMA 3, is what you try to get out of it. You will succeed to get what you try to get. Over the years, one would say, it has never been truly optimized, even for high end PCs, which I have always played with. there is plenty to say about the build and the Engine used, it being outdated or this and that. However, with the ARMA experience I had, which was a lot, none of that got in the way. 

What is amazing is that there is no ARMA 4 in sight. Perhaps this is because ARMA 3, is still alive, and an amazing tool for so many to use. If this team, who built ARMA 3, had been in years of development since 2013, on an ARMA 4, and implemented work done by moderrs, making some mods, standard like ACE and so on, that product would be the greatest MILSIM one could get their hands on. ARMA 3 is the greatest MILISM experience, if one seeks out making it so, or joining with others who do so. A great deal of time I spent in ARMA was creating, and Game mastering, offering others the experience of unconventional warfare. I am not conventional, and I myself do not enjoy dressing up in Kit, and running around doing the cycle of soldiering. I did not enjoy that in real life, and so, it is not what I look for in ARMA. Instead, I was looking for Guerrilla small unit themed action, and where I could not find it, I was able to create it, and that, was grand, and those hours listed as play for me, were some of the best hours experienced with others, where I have ""Friends"" to this day, that were acquired through ARMA even though no longer active.  I do not game much. So that number says a lot. I have a strong preference for SIM, and Cooperation, and NOTHING, compared for me, to that of what ARMA made possible in this area. So much, I am here looking at ARMA and installing it today, because, I want to see what I can get out of it some more, after all these years. I would say for me, and many, ARMA is not just one more of those games in our library. ARMA is community, and I do not say this loosely."
8646,"This game is pain, yet I always find myself coming back to screw around with friends. Doesn't run the best but it doesn't stop me from enjoying cluster bombing villages and committing war crimes."
8647,nice game <3
8648,"its good it has mods

8654,realistic
8655,i am horny
8656,DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THIS ADDICTING
8657,I love shooting and war games but this was buggy and laggy. I couldn't get 10 fps with a 1070 in multiplayer with all settings on high (nothing running other than the game). The game crashed 5 times before it finally loaded in multiplayer. A lot of personal issues with the quality. I really wanted to like it.
8658,Great game if you are a fan of the military and like realism
8659,"So this game has it's up's and down's. Like hitting a bush, and your car blows up. Or when landing a heli, and your heli lands on a small rock ( you guessed it) blows up. With all that being said, the game has countless hours of fun times, enjoying playing king of the hill, and use to play altis life. I noticed less and less servers, but the arma simulation is still strong with servers that been around for long time. I recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed arma in the past."

8687,"this game is amazing, fr"

8702,i didnt play much milsim in my over 150 hours but its alot of fun if you like super realistic games
8703,Very fun for people that are in to the arma series.

they enhance the gaming experience (for example exploring more about Physics)
Worth to try it out when it is on sale"
8705,Excellent game. Makes for creative scenarios.
8706,Lots of mods and dynamic random missions to play from
8707,What is there not to like. This game is the best WAR FPS out there. Huge communities and constant updates and DLC's
8708,"game is fun very realistic smil e
"
8709,i like the realistic of the game.  i recommend for others that like combat that put there skills to used.
8710,"Its my favorite game and it should be yours too!

There are so many gamemodes and if one gets boring you can just play another so you always can do something different.
The game ist the Price totally worth and i reccoment the Apex DLC(wich includes the best PVE weapon, the all of the VTOLs and a great jungle-map) for the Start.
You need an average good pc if you want acceptable viewing distances.
The grafics are ok, but the huge and versatile maps make good for it.
The driving physics are horreble,
 not like the flying physics wich feel great and i even bought a flightstick for the game.

Made good friends, had lots of fun and raged often. 9.5/10"
8711,fun
8712,a very fun well made open world shooter
8713,i kickflipped a tank once
8714,"Base game can get boring but with endless modding capabilities burn-out is ALMOST non-existent, which is kinda scary for a video game. Really fun, I wouldn't say a it's a complete improvement from Arma 2 but nothing is perfect and it's good for a game released a few years ago. Still worth the buy!"
8715,Very fun BUT I DONT WANT TO HAVE TO SPENT $1000 DOLLARS ON DLCS JUST TO PLAY THE GAME
8716,i have no life but arma 3 is now my life please help me i havent seen the sun in days
8717,Simply best and worst game to ever exist...

8724,"fun game, but need friends"
8725,plane
8726,Haha milsim game go brr
8727,I love the ability to create ANY type of mission you like. There are endless mods that make this game even better than it already is. The only problem I have with the game is that it doesn't do a good job at explaining how to use a lot of the features within the game. A good tutorial would go a long way for the large number of keybinds used in this Milsim.
8728,I cannot pick up a single weapon because i dont have dlc.
8729,good
8730,"Arma 3 isn't a game for everyone. That being said, it is one of the most absorbing and realistic military simulators out there. Of course, it isn't perfect, but then again nothing is truly perfect. The issues the game has, in my opinion (such as 5.56 and 6.5 rifles doing very little damage) aren't all that serious, and some can even be fixed with mods. Overall, this is an excellent game, currently on sale as of this purchase iirc, and very much worth it (base game and DLCs included), even when not on sale. Though when not on sale I would mull the purchase over a bit more.
10/10 game."
8731,"If you Don't like Stratgey Games And Rage quit This game isn't for you, Expect to Die a lot, I personnely Rage a lot so I don't like the game."
8732,nice game.
8733,Amazing Game
8734,War Simulator of choice. No doubt the only choice when it comes to this genre.
8735,"As I recently released my final ArmA 3 workshop mission I realised that I never have given ArmA 3 game a Steam review so now might be good time as any.

The ArmA 3 is a very openly struct military simulator where players can do/ have many kinds of gameplay experiences from regular rifleman perspective who witnesses betrayal of their ally faction or simple platformer experience (yes someone has actually done that). https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1281184230 The learning curve is quite high when compared to other military shooter-games on market, but that‚Äôs because there are so many things player can control/ guide during a mission.
The biggest selling point (at least for those who like to make missions for people to play) is 3D editor which works well. What doesn‚Äôt work as well is Ai as it feels sometimes way dumber than for example Far Cry 2 that was released five (5) years before. Of course, in FC2 enemy Ai only focuses on infantry, turret, and ground vehicle activity but ArmA 3 Ai is something that prevents it to be overwhelmingly positive during play-troughs and mission-editing.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
ArmA 3 is made with heavy focus on open database which allows everyone to create many things and play many things. If Ai that can get you frustrate on time to time is too much for you, I can‚Äôt recommend this game but for everyone else I recommend grabbing the game and it‚Äôs DLCs at least on sale."
8736,not baaad
8737,in overall no bad.
8738,its mint
8739,"Heads up while you might have heard about this game from a friend do not rush into this headfirst, This game has a hard learning curve as in it has a ton of mechanics to go through and memorize this is not like COD or Battlefield its more complicated. The online servers are not as populated as one might think unless you join a Arma 3 community discord you'll be hoping from one server to another, that said this community has some pretty cool people some being either ex/active military members so be respectful. Overall this game is great graphics wise and Mod wise you can play mods from star wars to halo to starship troopers but again look into joining a solid community as the mod servers are typically members only, well have fun soldiers"
8740,"This game is awesome if you can get past the poor optimization and the occasional glitches. With the addons, and plethora of mods. This is possibly the most modular game you can ever buy."
8741,"There is no winner in war, only death and destruction"
8742,i literally haven't played this game
8743,"great sandbox game, but its hard in control"

8748,"*Gets my Toyota Hillux with an M2 Browning JDAMd by a jet I never even heard*

Pretty good sim"
8749,"Arma 3 is a sort of mil sim game, it's extremely realistic, you have a lot of options, it's an absolute staple in the gaming industry for how good it is along with the community, the amount of servers are endless and so are the possibilities.

The community is insanely good with all the servers and on the modding scene.

There are a few bugs, but nothing game breaking.

The game runs fast and loads almost instantly.

Overall I recommend the game."
8750,
8751,"If you want to play a Realistic Military Game which is fun and serious at the same time!
I would recommend it if you have all the vehicle DLC's cause if you don't then it derails missions and the game watermarks your game screen at random times to buy the DLC.

I rate it 9.5/10 for a military, realistic, and a shooter game which makes you talk to people even if you are an introvert (‚äô_‚äô;)

Did I mention it's huge - in area, scope, roles, imagination, and it hits the sweet spot between real realism (ugh) and gamey cartoon (ugh).  It's not easy at first, but it makes those first real successes absolute triumphs. Yes, highly recommended,"

8809,"Arma 3 is a brilliant military simulation game, with a huge focus on teamwork and coordination to achieve victory in battle. It places you right into the depths of all-out warfare, something which has yet to be achieved by any other game on the market. Arma 3 is still extremely unique in this respect, allowing the player to carry out whatever operation they so choose. Want to go behind enemy lines with a small group of elite troops? How about flying a CAS attack helicopter? It's your war, your choice.
  
As great as this sounds, there are two issues that really let the game down. The base game content, and the game engine. The base game content is lacklustre, leaving much to be desired. Uniforms, vehicles, and weapons feel mundane in comparison to the custom assets available on the workshop, which is why many servers/players decide to use the wonderful selection of workshop content to spice things up. It feels wrong to have to add 15+ mods to the game just to make it worth playing, especially when the DLC content doesn't resolve this issue either. Side note: Apex best DLC.
 
The game engine. Oh boy, where do we start? Tanks and other vehicles randomly flip over or fly into the distance, colliding with other vehicles will result in the second coming of Jesus, dropped weapons will freeze you in place if you walk over them, corpses weigh 50 tons, back-blast pressure will wipe out an entire army, shot down aircraft bounce back into the air, rockets travel at 2 mph or Mach 1, and don't even think about towing a vehicle. Ever. Arma 3 was designed on the worst engine of all time. It can ruin operations, but also make for some hilarious, unpredictable moments. It's just something you have to learn to work around.
 
Placing these issues aside, Arma 3 is fantastic fun. The graphics still look amazing, it has amazing mod support, dedicated servers full of enthusiastic people, and huge maps full of possibilities. You can even make your own operations for friends to play on. It truly is the best military simulation game available on the market. For DLCs, I recommend Apex and Jets. Zues and Malden come free with with the base game. Enjoy!"

8830,I've Had a Lot of Fun so far
8831,"this game might be 8 years old but that can be fixed with mods
i really recommend this game specialy if you like vehicle combat"
8832,"Arma 3 is a masterpiece. This does not mean there are not mistakes, as there are many, many mistakes. But a masterpiece does not have to be perfect, it just has to be beautiful.

Arma 3 is my favorite game to play with friends. There are so many things in this game, only vastly improved through mods. Zeus is one of the best additional modes to any video game ever, in my opinion. The way my friends and I play Arma 3 is like a Mil-sim game of D&D. There's a story, characters, progression, continuity, and this only adds to the fun. The DLC are pretty much necessary for Vanilla or Vanilla+ games, but otherwise you'll probably not need them. The only gripe with this game I have is the fact that you need to use teamspeak in order to use the Taskforce Radio mod, but that's not especially the fault of the game, I just wish it used directional voice chat like DayZ does. The fact the game does not come with a directional voice chat, however, IS the fault of the game, and it's a major one. Luckily mods fix this.

This game, especially while on sale for $7.49, is a must-buy for serious or semi-serious multiplayer narrative games, a must-buy for enclosed PvP or PvE mil-sim experiences, and a must-buy for creative level designing. There's so much more to this game than the marketing allows to be seen. I recommend this game completely."

8854,"For a single player experience: fuck whoever wrote the code for the AI big time. You see a group of enemies 10 miles away, you take ONE SHOT ONLY, and suddenly every enemy on its proximity knows your location and has aim beyond what a God could have. The AI in this game leave the Spartans from halo looking like a GI Joe fantasy.
That‚Äôs being said, the story for arma and it‚Äôs DLC is good. The voice acting is what bumps it up by a huge k(nut)

When it comes to multiplayer, oh god oh all mighty god. You will have a blast. 
In your team you will usually have that:
1. Vet talking about his time in the army
2. Clearly the bullshitter who has done some research into the Army life, most likely failed basic training and now talks like he‚Äôs part of it, and yet when you ask him about where has he being deployed or stationed at he gives you the shortest answers taking a lot of time to speak up 
3. The foreigner. Oh my god, my favorite people. They will say the most random funny shit you‚Äôll hear on any online video game. And not mean stuff, but just funny things. 
4. The try hard. Always has to be a try hard
5. Heavy breather
6. And my second favorite. The dude who flies helis like he‚Äôs being paid. You can tell he‚Äôs most likely got a whole setup, multiple monitors, and maybe a few beers by his side. This dude straight up DOES NOT FIVE A FLYING DISGUSTING DISTURBING MOTHERFLYING UNHOLY GODLY SATANIC UNDER THE HOOK, TIDE UP, WRAPPED AROUND, I DONT CARE IF THE ENGINE IS BLOWN- I WILL LAND THIS BABY WITH A SINGLE BLADE ATTACHED TO THE ROTTOR, FUCK. This dude will have high quality songs playing through his mic on the vehicle-only voice chat in-game that will make you have flashbacks every time you walk into a target or any other store that has music playing in the background. And the best part? They tend to sound like old good American red necks or just straight up non-English speakers, but also tend to be the nicest dudes in the community. Don‚Äôt forget to thank your help driver every time you hop off one. 

The amount of memories you will accumulate will leave the national library look like a dumpster. Even though Bohemia or whatever doesn‚Äôt care about updating or optimizing their game, the community makes it worth playing and sticking around. Def buy everything when in sale."

This game has a learning curve that may seem steep at first but once you start understanding that it's mostly fucking around and experimenting until you decide what kind of player you want to be. THEN the real fucking around starts. 

Get this game. You need to experience it in your lifetime."

"
8864,"very good game. its got everything i love about gaming. fps, rpg, strategy and more."
8865,"Amazing game, while considered a Military Simulator, it also fits into the Sandbox category. The latter of which is where this game shines. With great server admins and dev teams, each server can be vastly unique and offer something appealing to any game enthusiast. Whether it be Hard/Light Roleplay, King of the Hill, Wasteland, and the unlimited amount of mods the community has created, there is something for everyone. 

That being said, while the combat stance and bullet tracking system in the engine is amazing, it is also full of bugs. Bodies getting stretched out,  vehicles exploding or flying from light impact. But that honestly just adds to the ARMA Flavor."

8871,Great mil sim game. Biggest suggestion find a community on here to play with. Having that community makes a big difference and you will have a lot of fun bonding over the suck.
8872,"The game concept is good but oh dear, the glitches, bugs, useless button combinations to get anything done is frustrating and your dead by the time it decides to accept your input, likewise, if you stop to look at a map, pick up ammo, heal someone,  your shot at while unable to move or retaliate the same thing happens when you try to heal yourself.  Would I recommend this game, not a hope in hell."

8886,"Arma's base game is very good at what it does, it's a combat simulator.  But that isn't where the value lies, that honour goes to the community.  I have played this game on and off for a little while now, and from my experience, the best times I've had is finding a group of players that a similar minded then pushing the Arma engine to the limit.  
Bohemia have done an excellent job at giving you a ""blank canvas"", but each and every community brings a little more.  Arma is one of those games that whatever you, the player wants, has.  
There are communities that are full-on sim, to others that are PvE only.  Whatever your tastes there is a community out there for you, If you want a hardcore sim where you have to go through basic training just to be a pilot or medic; Arma has got you covered, or maybe a fully modded zombie horde base building experience is what you're craving, perhaps even a full on role playing game where you have to get a regular 9-5 job gets your blood pumping; you guessed it, Arma and it's community has it.  
This game is totally worth sinking your hard earned cash and free time into.  I've just downloaded Arma again, it's time for me to sink another couple of hours into."
8887,is good
8888,"Tough and challenging Military simulator, unlike simple arcade style FPS where you shoot the enemies and they drop down dead and you feel like a super soldier XD !!! This is the real deal where the enemies are as cunning as a fox and you have to apply tricks and strategy to win over. The firing of the guns feel real, the recoil will make you miss your targets and like a real soldier you will be drained out of stamina if you sprint for too long, and the stress in the battlefield feels real when you get shot, the aim will stutter when you are hit or out of stamina.Besides this there are a lot of community made mods which will make the gameplay more immersive and fun. Thanks to BI for this challenging stuff."

8897,"A terrible hot piece of garbage. Horrendous optimization, laggy, and buggy mechanics, very lazy dev and coding apparent, pay to win features are in your face and the game is an extreme chore to enjoy. Each ""update"" sends the game back 10 steps with all the bugs and broken mechanics it introduces. Previous save files also become corrupted and crash your game. I do not recommend this game even if you are paid to play it. This installment is such a disgrace to this franchise. The creators of this abhorrent game should be barred for life from making another video game. The only 10/10 Arma 3 gets is for its repugnant, nauseating, and contemptible experiences it brings to users. Horrible"

8921,Absolutely horrible multiplayer system. Avoid if you want to play with friends.
8922,its so fun on its own but find yourself a community to join and youll have even more fun and play with people from around the globe
8923,"Grate game and very fun to play with or without friends there is so much to do in this game and it can get stressful in certain 
scenario's. The steam workshop is full of content to choose from that makes the game even more fun i would highly recommend this game to anyone i would rate this game 8/10.

Reason being because even though it is a good game it does have some flaws for an example the graphics on some maps look pixelated like if their from the mid 2000s and it has lag here and their in certain areas of what maps you go on.
Other than that it is a fun game to play with friends"
8924,"Absolute military simulator. Insane number of military systems from both the vanilla, but the modding community has taken it to the next level! Lots of fun, especially if you have a dedicated group to play with. Highly recommend if you're a military nerd. If you're looking for a Battlefield/Call of Duty experience, look somewhere else."

8936,"Uhh, where do I start, Arma 3 is one of the best games I have ever played in my life I love the game it's exactly what I was looking for about 2 years ago. The DLCs are fine but there's no point in buying them if you're not going to be playing vanilla a lot instead of the DLCs you can download mods and get the exact same things but for free. The number one thing I recommend is to join the Arma 3 discord server and find a good solid community where you can play and have fun (I will leave a link to it at the end). One of the best Communities I am a part of is Project Odin I will leave a link to it at the end again. To wrap this all up I love this game it was worth 28 bucks I totally recommend Arma 3.

8941,great game
8942,REALLY FUN WITH FRIENDS!
8943,Game is super fun but just remember there are lots of trollers and scripters. This has nothing to do with the game as though everyone inside the game votes to kick trolls and scripters out and if theres a hacker a admin of staff may hook you up with everything you lost and maybe even more. Ive wanted this game since i first came out and i bought it 6 days ago and im so glad i got it. I rate this game 10-10.
8944,Amazing game aside from making you buy DLC
8945,"Depending on what you do, it's either a bore or an insane amount of fun.

~Be a pilot and preform ""tacticool"" insertions at speeds many consider ""dangerous""
~Crash a helicopter in KOTH and be sworn out
~Die
~Obtain PTSD from Navid spammers
~Somehow fly backwards
~Fly backwards and crash, again
~Kill rice farmers for a small price
~Die from the icky brown-camo wearers in the campaign
~And more!

It's and aged game, but it's like a finely dry aged piece of beef. If you use it right, it'll be absolutely amazing.

8969,ok
8970,"After hearing this game get talked up for a few years and seeing footage on YouTube, I had to give this game a try.  With Arma sales every few month made it an easy purchase, especially for new players, IMO. 

It's as good as others made it out to be! It was an adjustment playing strictly on keyboard, but it's understandable why that is. Hopefully one day I be good enough to play in co-op/unit events and missions."

8975,"played a lil bit of it, idk might need more time invested b4 i have a good review.
(but in all seriousness, this is my first game with 1000+ hours, i highly recommend if you are into more serious shooters. this game offers so much fun and versitility with the mods. half the time its just fun to sit in a zeus server and chat ab random shit. i love this game and i hope i find more people to play with.)
"
8976,"Its a very good game, even though I didnt have it for more then a week im more then satisfied with the game, you should try it"

8982,"fun
"
8983,"its cool
"
8984,"Very very fun game! it is very realistic, the map is huge, the bots play like real players, and not like braindead players, the maps has lots of awesome cities, towns and villages, where you can go inside every building, there are mountains, hills, forests and deserts. You can play single player campaign missions, or play different scenarios, such as playing as an infantry soldier, or providing air strikes as support. There is also a multiplayer mode with other real players with many different game modes, it is a brilliant game i would 100% recommend it to anyone who is thinking about buying it, plus it is on sale!!"
8985,nice
8986,VERY NICE MENS
8987,hi

there is a lot of things to do here

8991,yes
8992,"After playing Arma 3 for many years, running and being apart of milsim units, my love for the game has always been strong. Even though its few years old now it still holds its own, credit to all the mod creators making the game what it is

8993,"It has a good range of activities from basic level editing to a whole campaign and multiplayer, that's not including the DLC too...Highly recommend for those that enjoy realism FPS and battle scenario FPS."
8994,Too much lag server dead controls bad
8995,No need to describe. Excellent
8996,"confusing, tutorial is useless. the only thing it tells you is how to play a fucking fps game. the single player is shit because you dont get help with how to use the guns 4867730 diffrent aim modes and positions and player stance. then you have the shitty mine field mission where its equal to making a blind person walk 2 miles with random patches of razer blades soaked with hydrocloric acid and salt. then you got the multiplayer browser is confusing, bare and not new player friendly. most servers use the dlc's and not everyone has tons of money to throw at a couple dlc's just to play on a server thats full of multiple K hours. its boring and really fucking confusing for anyone looking for a new casual game who isnt in the military for any period of time. not to mention you need like 80 diffrent dlc's, 4000 workshop addons and a extra damn keyboard because there are more ways to position yourself than keyboard keys i have"

9002,yes. just yes.
9003,"Great game, realistic mil sim"

It's unlike CoD or Valorant or CSGO where you could just jump and run and shoot, this is WAYYYY more complex.

9015,"The game is a really game simulation game for people that know what to do in my opinion this game is great.

9016,"The singleplayer is shit, but the modded multiplayer experience with custom-built missions is something special and exciting, even through all the jank."
9017,Amazing game but there's way too many complicated controls. 8/10.
9018,GREAT GAME
9019,I really liked the game
9020,"i agree

9027,very good
9028,I have played this game for a good few years. i have met good and bad people. i have met really autistic labour-party members and a host of really retarded swedes. but ive had many good hours and experiences getting ARMA'd. i would hearily reccomend if you want an experience that's equivalent to CBT. heavily punishing and autistic but some people are into it.
9029,Really nice game and its even better when you have squad to play missions
9030,"i got this game thinking it would be a military sim game, and its anything but that, first off the game is poorly optimized so goodluck having a fun mil, sim expericence because your game will have frame spikes constanltly and the frame spikes give the game way too much screen tearing, i hate it, think it looks gross, my pc is currently a Dell g15 lap top with a 3050 gpu in it. it should run this old game smooth like butter right, WRONG, The game is simply poorly optimized and it can never create the mill sin experiece because frame spikes are always an issue, no matter what. also the conrols in this game are trash. (dont buy this old glitchy game) not even worth 7 dollars."

9033,"Im brand new to this game, Im a huge milsim shooter fan. Decided to give this game a go and I must say.....wow. This game is definitely in a spot of its own. There is a HUGE learning curve and even then I feel thats an understatement considering the amount of things you can do in the game being that the game is very intricate. If you take the time to learn and get use to the mechanics, the more you will love it. Truly an amazing yet infuriating game. ***you will use every key on the keyboard btw lol

I mostly play this for the zombies, but the scenarios and mods that get installed, added are so unoptimized, even though the makers of those mods say they are. As a whole, it is a sandbox, but it feels limited in a way. There's bugs where I open Virtual Arsenal and after that I couldn't look left or right. There's gotta be fixes for this man....

overall... there needs to be an improvement."

9049,"In short, it's a good game everyone who loves military tactical games should try.

Before I bought this game I used to play Wargame Red Dragon and I was always curious about what happened on the ground level. When I deployed my spec op team for behind enemy line recon mission. They usually come back to base in bad shape or sometimes just empty helo. Arma3  gave me the answers and feeling, ""IT'S HELL SIR"""
9050,"is good
"
9051,"It's overall a really good game, plenty of fun. It'll hook you in for long seshes. There are a few issues, has to be modded, no way around it. It's borderline awful compared to a modded form but luckily it's all workshop modding. Also, DLC shoved into your face. You can use a few things even without the DLCs if you're spawned with them or spawned in them. But the watermarks are in your face and frustrating. So, if you play the editor download insane amounts of content mods and don't even think about touching anything DLC if you wish to remain happy. Of course you can buy the insanely overpriced DLC in some sick and twisted SIms 4 esk crap. But just use mods."
9052,1
9053,"played a bit, not great"
9054,"Actually very fun military simulator

Very entertaining to role play with friends
Me and my unit were stationed in Benghazi and we were getting paid to protect a C.I.A base camp 
I spotted a suspicious looking person who was crouching in front of our outpost. I went out there to go have a look and he quickly sped off on his motorcycle. There was a litter of trash on the ground where he was crouching with red wires coming out of it. I quickly shouted over radio that we have an I.E.D by camp and ran to the side thats when Matthew Johnson, a watchman and close friend, came to have a look and it blew up near him and he and a civilian was killed by the shrapnel from the blast. I had to put him in a body bag. You will be missed Johnson."
9055,Game too hard
9056,I havent played this game much but seems fun so far.
9057,Shoot things so yeah
9058,.
9059,the gunshots are so sacry sorry typo i mean scary
9060,"Worth. Every. Cent. While the base game provides a decent engine and a campaign that serves as a tutorial at best, the mods will hook you. Find a good server with a mod that suits your playstyle and taste, and you will sink hundreds if not thousands of hours into this game. It is unfair. It is complex. It is hilarious. It is pure joy. And up until the release of ArmA IV it'll be the best military shooter there is."
9061,I can not express in words how much I love this game.
9062,Dang Fine Military Simulator!

9071,"Arma 3 is something between a battlefield simulator and a computer game. I've been playing since 2013 and I wouldn't expect you to learn so much from it. Coop and pvp are my favorite game modes. The number of modifications that enrich this game is countless. The only drawback is the game engine, which today strongly limits its potential compared to the competition. If someone is looking for a break from shootings like Counter Strike or Battlefield, he will find comfort and realism in the Army. It is worth joining the cooperative group because Arma 3 is, above all, a team game that will provide many more positive impressions and invaluable experiences :) I recommend it to all lovers of the army and not only. This is a game for people who can use their brain :)"

9088,"I love this game, I am having trouble doing scripting, but I am still learning how the system works. Some downsides are that the ai can headshot you with a pistol from 400-500 meters away, arma's vanilla ragdoll sends you flying(I'd recommend using a ragdoll mod if you are to use ace medical)"
9089,GREATNESS
9090,cool
9091,I have no problem with this simulation.
9092,"I absolutely love this game. Do keep in mind, if you want to play online in hosted servers, you will have to buy multiple DLC's, it will cost you about 100 gigs on your hard drive."

9099,shit game
9100,"I bought this game somewhat recently and honestly didn't know that i would enjoy it as much as I do. It is at its core a sandbox and with mods to add whatever content you want, it can be whatever game you want. I can't say enough about it. I sometimes load into single player zues and just simulate a random scenario."

9110,super realistic military sandbox where you can do anything almost. great to be immersed in immersive and organized missions with many passionate and communicative team working players.

9130,within 12 hours of playing the game broke and said can't start because of *blank*. literally that's what it said so i went to YouTube for help and found out that it's happening because i modded game files or something like that even tho i haven't downloaded a single mod or changed anything. otherwise a fairly well game but it's a shame and it's annoying that i get a game breaking bug within 12 hours of play time.

If u buy this game for multi there are almost only 2 modes on every server koth(king of the hill) and rpg.King of the hill is often unplayable because stutters lags etc. you try zoom and lag, 30 fps or less is normal here if u dont mind about playing smoothly u can buy this but only then."

9204,"Content-filled, military sandbox game that has endless opportunities for you to break international rules on war and the Geneva convention"
9205,This game is good until you get to aircraft carriers (or) just aircraft to begin with i don't expect the aircraft to work like (DCS) but you cant even hit deck smoothly without blowing up the dam devs work on the game and then stop working on aircraft i swear this needs to be fixed if ya'll can make a game like this you can fix aircraft (NOTE) - if anyone reading this wants anything to do with the aircrafts your better off spending 80$ on a jet in (DCS World) trust me
9206,The games good takes time to learn the controls but runs smooth
9207,"If your in to tactical army/ sandbox games this is the right game for you this game is great. My favorite part is Editor were you can make your own missions battles with ai fight in battles with the ai and you can make scenarios yes they might take awhile to make depends on how much work you put into them but in the end its worth it. But i wish they would add more maps that don't need Dlc,s for them so there can be a Variety of maps at least about 5 new maps. And a hope the eventually add a feature were you can make your own custom factions cause the players wouldn't have to go to the workshop for help and for players like me it could be a lot easier to make them cause I can't even make them yet so please add a Custom factions maker."
9208,"awesome

9225,A decent Mil-Sim game. I'd recommend for someone who does not like fast paced shooters. Beware that there is a steep learning curve. Not many games come close to the detail that they Dev's put into it.
9226,the
9227,"It's great and it's awful, it has many bugs and problems but in a way that's also why I like this game. When you're trying to properly breach and clear as an american task force of elite soldiers only to get gunned down by some insurgent with a PKM, it's funny. But there's also the moments where you just feel badass, like doing a successful strafing run with an A-10 or flying over a burning wasteland in a blackhawk while blasting fortunate son. It's a great game if you have some friends to play with for some KOTH or a unit to do some ops with."

9229,This Game is the best Military Simulator by far.
9230,Confusing Game
9231,"Amazing game, amazing modding community. Perfect for large communities who enjoy tactical gameplay being spearheaded by players."
9232,"Aside from the various 'features' of Arma, I strongly recommend it. Make no mistake, it is not a game (yes it's a game- not a simulator) for those who will not invest time into it. If you are willing to learn the intricacies of advanced marksmanship, ACE or Kat Medical or how to start up a MH-60 Blackhawk that is so close to the real thing with individual startup and shutdown sequences carried out by interacting with the cockpit, then this game is definitely for you. If you're not then don't bother. I also strongly recommend joining a Milsim unit (you can find one through Steam Community or any Arma discord server) as they will teach you the ways of the game and you'll make some great friends along the way. At just over 1k hours sunk into the game at the time of writing, although I know there are people with way more hours than me, I am still not bored of the game and I'm still finding new things- whether bugs/features/equipment/mods/videos/screenshots/locations/tricks/gamemodes/servers- every day. 
I hope this helps and thank you for your time."

9234,"Nothing quite gets the heart pumping, eyes straining, and years falling off the end of your lifespan faster than that callout your character makes in the middle of a dense jungle with less than 10 meters visibility in every direction...

""Rifleman, 20 meters, Right.""

Otherwise, great game, love it a bunch, got a couple hours played and think I'll play it a couple more hours... or more, I dunno.

Kinda on the fence about it given just how many mods I have to download every time my unit wants to try a different setting."
9235,"i would highly suggest this game for the ones who loves RP, Action War Games, team work, and etc,
Arma 3 gives you the opportunity to create missions, if you are creative enough, arma is capable of giving you a lot of scripts and codes, objects to put in your game, and for the player again, you can play basically everything you think of.
for the bad subject of arma, sometimes it has bugs, specialy when creating a mission which is a big part of arma, and it has its own bugs :D, for the mechanics point of arma, you need some experience, if its playing or creating mission, and i just talked on the private servers such as the clans and the teams and etc, there is public servers that plays different of game modes such as king of the hill, and etc.
i am sure i missed a lot of points in arma but to basically know it all, you need to play and choose your own path in the game, I hope my review helped you guys, let me know if it did :) or it didnt"
9236,One of the best 2013 game ever played
9237,Good game with plenty of mods and a sweet map editor.
9238,Love IT so much!!!#
9239,always fun
9240,Very fun game
9241,With good friends? It's hella fun.
9242,"It‚Äôs pretty realistic,I like it"
9243,shooty
9244,"If there was a neutral option i would have selected it. Objectively speaking its a fun game, however this assumes your willing to fork over an extra hundred dollars to buy all the DLC. Otherwise you risk running into a vehicle in the middle of a battlefield just to be greeted by the magical ""throw more money at us so you can use this tank"" message pop up. 
I know it's pretty standard these days for the real cost of a game to be well over the initial price tag, but that won't stop me from being disappointed whenever i run into it. 
The game can still be fun but it feels like your playing a demo half the time, a $30 demo."
9245,i drink my pee daoly
9246,Its a slow Start and boring at first but if you get in a milsim group its totally worth it
9247,this is fairly enjoyable
9248,its hard to find a good public match but fun game
9249,"This is very realistic, and i love it! It also runs surprisingly well on my crap computer."
9250,"I haven't played the single player, but if you have a group that loves to play mil-sim games this is a very fun game to try. you can look for multiple units online and they're always looking for new players to join them. its very unique experince to try"
9251,good game
9252,best and most realistic military game.......... PLAY THE SANDBOX/EDITOR
9253,"Most of my time in Arma 3 has been dedicated to either Altis RP or being killed by my friend playing as a god in the Zeus game mode as he either sends massive groups of enemies towards me or he zaps me with lightning for getting in a pickup truck and driving away from my objective, disobeying his orders. The gameplay possibilities are endless with Arma 3, but at its core it is an incredible military sim. This game is a must-have on any PC that can run it.

However, Arma 4 when?"
9254,Simulation style game not really for the casual player but still fun when you get the hang of things.

9262,good
9263,"Tbh the game can be fun at times but half the weapons are locked behind dlc, there's a large learning curve to how realistic the mechanics in this game are, and it can be pretty buggy at times. I don't want to have to buy every damn Bohemia dlc just to pick up a decent gun in a server. I'm just lucky i got it on sale for 5 dollars instead of the usual 25, because then i probably would've felt scammed"

If Bohemia actually fixes these issues the game would be far more fun to play, until then dont bother wasting your money."
9276,"Arma 3..this is my first review in a very long time and I don't have a ton of hours in the game due to the fact I barley could run the game at 30 fps on my old gpu! Now that I am all set up and can enjoy the game properly and I have to say I have NEVER gotten pulled into a military style experience as hard as this and I barley do PVP. Im more of a Pve, scenario type of person and just the sheer amount of content just from the base game all the way to modding its insane!!!! Sadly it does get a bit lonesome if you don't have friends to play it with and none of my friends really like or can stay immersed in games like this so definitely recommend if you have friends who like this kind of gameplay. Now if you have actually read this far this gameplay is very Tactical, Realism even and depending on if you have mods like ACE3 which revamp so many of the base game performance and gameplay mechanics. Trying to figure out where you are getting shot from finally finding the f**ker only to realize you left your safety on and then pass out due to blood loss as you wait for your medic to come over and try and revive you, only for you both  to get blown up. Yes I recommend it I think for me personally it mixes games like Tarkov, Pubg, Squad into this one bundle that makes me enjoy it so much. 9.5 out of Man, 75 meters front"
9277,Love this game!
9278,p
9279,"If you want to get a mil-sim type of game, get Arma 3."
9280,"Amazing gameplay.

I cannot understate how good of a game this is. I've only played for 42 hours, but I need to grind much more on the hours because this is just amazing.

The fact that you can buy DLC's is a lifesaver, because I didn't think I'd want to be infantry all the time, but when I saw the 2035 version of the F/A-18, I had to buy the jet DLC. It's so fun to use as well! Very awesome!"

9348,(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)--Ô∏ª‚ï¶‚ï§‚îÄPEW PEW
9349,"the story and atmosphere are really cool, the open world is super impressive visually, but the parts of the gameplay that actually matter are really frustrating and just.. i don't know what's supposed to be fun about them. definitely do not recommend.
it seems to consist mostly of running around and shooting at the same guys in the same scenarios. it feels monotonous even 2 hours in. i guess it's pretty accurate to real combat, but.. there's a reason i'm playing games instead of joining the army."
9350,"This game is amazing, it is hands down the most realistic, fun military shooter I have ever played. However, if you want to play multiplayer, it leaves it entirely up to you to make things happen, no instructions, no pre-made content, nothing. The only way you can really have a continuous open world experience where there are actual enemies is if you play zeus. And I get it, this game is made for many people but I don't have a lot of people to play with so I need at least 3 people to be able to play zeus properly. Once all is said and done this is one of the best games of all time and the best and most realistic military shooter so far."
9351,FART 3 xDDDDDD
9352,"you can never go wrong with arma 3.
 literally playable any way you like it.
 do you want russians vs americans? there are servers for it.
 do you want a dayz zombie pvp/pve game? there are servers for it.
 wanna be a cartel member and do dumb shit in altis? there are servers for it.
 so much customization and replayability makes it hard to not sink in hours without even recognizing it.
 most of the dlc's are required for some servers and most in game items  but nabbing them is actually pretty useful, especially when you can get them bundled up with the game for a decent price on a sale."

9355,THE  ROLEPLAY SERVERS
9356,"spent about 700 hours in zeus as if i was playing with toys as a kid, just throwing units at each other because i didnt have any friends to play with. now i have friends and play coop missions with them. yay

though i like the game for the pretty good simulation/immersion"
9357,fun to troll the people who take the game too seriously
9358,"I killed alot of civilians in the sandbox thing, very cool!"
9359,the gameplay you can get from this game is butter planes takes time to learn how to fly but is worth the training tbh it is a must get for mil sim people:)
9360,i walked around for 4.5 hours and was constantly sniped from over 500m with no sight of human life apart from the majority of the time when i was sniped from over 500m away then walked further and died again
9361,good
9362,"Very enjoyable, even if the physics are weird as hell. Shame with all the DLC I needed 5 hard drives to play it.
7.5/10"
9363,great game
9364,"420 Hours and counting, it's a great game"
9365,"Great replayability, awesome community and lots of workshop mods makes this game still enjoyable years after its launch. 10/10"
9366,"Ultimate military sandbox on the market! With having extra DLCs being annoying from time to time the Eden editor along with the steam workshop allows for the best mil-sim, role-playing and open world ish (cause of the huge maps)  game out there to this day! Can't wait for Arma 4!"
9367,"This game is a kind of game that is incredibly rare these days. It certainly is a lot harder to get into for first time players, but once you get past the learning curve, this game has limitless potential. Aside from a compelling main campaign story with some eerie parallels to real world events, this game offers a limitless variety of multiplayer modes that allow you to play this game however you want to play it, and if there isn't something you were looking for in this game, Arma 3 gives you the tools to make it yourself if you so desire. There is an endless sea of community-made content with some outstanding mods such as ACE, CUP, Unsung, Iron Front, There Is Only War, etc. that completely change the gameplay experience. Despite releasing back in 2013, this game is still going very strong, and will remain that way for a long time to come. This is the sort of thing PC games were meant to be, the ability to craft your own experience backed up by an extensive library of both official and unofficial assets, and is set to have a long lifespan that can continue long beyond what even their own developers anticipated."
9368,It's OK I guess.
9369,Awesome
9370,"
Really really fun game to play with friends, also a great community and helpful people!"
9371,"As long as you stay away from the really un-fun try hard milsim communities, this game is wonderful. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of great milsim communities, but some of them are just plain un-fun. That said, I love the Eden editor and making missions for people, and the gameplay itself can be fantastic. I also love the modding community. I do 100% recommend."
9372,good game
9373,yaaa
9374, love to crash the game by adding every possible tank in one single place on the editor
9375,Physics go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
9376,I would recommend this game for people looking for a mostly realistic simulator of combined arms warfare. Keep in mind even after 8 years its physics and some of the AI is still glitched. Most probably you will also use up to 150 GB of space due to mods and just the base game. One of my favorite parts is that just by downloading a few mods you can completly revamp the game and make it completely new adding replayability even after 800 hours+1000 hours on another account I still have not run out of stuff to do.
9377,0_0
9378,"I bought a tactical shooter with 70% of content locked, like literally 70% of all guns are part of expansions and they cost too much to compare with the game price."
9379,"Arma 3 Is one of the most customisable games I've played! Being able to play with your friends by creating missions and using Community made Assets and maps is by far the greatest decision made by any games company. The reason this game is still played on the masses today is down to it's community and the Dev's willingness to provide content and allow customisation to their game.
If Bohemia didn't allow community content, I would've only play about 7 hours of it; however, I have almost 100x that playtime.

Can't wait for Arma 4"
9380,10/10 I'm sure people have issues with the game whether its bugs or mods not working but it all comes together enough for a community of people to make it something even greater with their inspiration and their love of gaming

9389,yes all you need to know is yes
9390,Arma 3 gives me so much joy and pain all at once
9391,"this game is great, love it"
9392,great military game
9393,Fun game. I mostly play on koth and some ops it can be slow at time and does require a good pc despite being 8 years old now. It has its fair share of bugs. Over all though it provides a fun and comical experience at times and can also be very hard core at other times. It offers a unique and enjoyable experience that at time could be compared to gmod. The dlc can be annoying at times but All in all it is worth every penny.
9394,Arma three is an online military simulator that is based on capturing the realism of actual warfare. I feel that the game captures that extremely well because there could be me and one other person on the entire map and I would still be checking all of the surrounding buildings or hills for that one person. I have found that the single player mode isn‚Äôt the best and could be better but it is very good for figuring out the controls and other important aspects of Arma 3.
9395,Played this game for 8 years. Played in the arma community for 10. Look at my fucking hours.

9411,"Arma 3 is a great game if you're into milsim, but if you like the type of action COD and other similar FPS' give you then this is not your game, the game is supposed to be realistic so its not always fast pace action, but if you're looking to spend the time on a milsim game and get to learn it, then this game is probably for you."
9412,"A nice change of pace from most shooters, slow, methodical and very challenging. Highly customizable too, so you can absolutely be rambo if you want."
9413,"Game is fun. 
This game is fun, I had survived a helicopter crash within an inch of my life. I managed to regroup with my squad. We shortly began to be fired upon and ran to a nearby house and took cover. 

We held out for a while before getting taken out by mortars.
10/10 game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, but it looks fun.

9432,"A near unbearable mil-sim where the goal is to try your damn best to enjoy yourself while fighting against the true enemy, which consist of various forces composed of crashes, bugs, clunky controls, low framerates, outright bad performance, and a generally bad engine. 

You and your group of friends, involving that one whiz-kid who can eden up any magic in the mission editor, will battle floods of questionable AI that require mods to make them resemble a human in missions that YOU make, god forbid you play anything official alone, in a game mostly built and ran off of so many community made mods and patchworks that make the original game  barely recognisable.

Frankly, it's hell. 

10/10, one of the best purchases you'll ever make."
9433,great game with endless possibilities
9434,"Hey Everyone! It's time for me to Talk about Possibly my Favorite Steam Game of All Time!! 'ARMA 3' is a Very Realistic Military Simulator, but before I go any further I should mention that I have spent All of my Time (207.3Hrs at the Time of Re-Writing This) Playing the (Offline) Eden Editor and with All DLC Enabled so that's what my Overall Opinion is Based on... and... I am Addicted!! I Love setting up my own Battle Scenarios and Playing them from different strategic Positions on any of the Games Huge Maps while using a wide array of vehicles including Jets, Heli's, and, Tank's and so much variety when it comes to small Arms Fire. Dude seriously ARMA 3 gives you the ability to Play the way you want!! (Not Following Anyone's Orders But Your Own, If that's how you Decide to Play). If you like Realistic Military Shooters it doesn't get any Better than the ARMA Series, Also if you want a Bigger ARMA 3 Experience Check out All the DLC on the Store, There's Tons like turning ARMA 3 into ARMA Vietnam!! So!! What i'm sayin is... I am a ARMA Super Fan!! and I think you could be too, (maybe) if you don't mind being tookin down by a Single Blast or a Single Bullet... So you can take my word for it and Buy it or Don't!! Just Watch the Trailers and Decide for Yourself!! It's all good bro... Thanks fro the Read!!"

9483,"Tired of buying games over  multiple genres and making a burning hole in your wallet to scratch the itch for your diverse gaming wants- fear not because we have a very dense game which consists of multiple other games, each with its own distinct set of rules and enjoyment. Just be ready to play on 30 fps from time to time because the game is so mil-simmy that even the game engine is straight out of a M1 abrams."
9484,this game has me addicted
9485,You can tactically roleplay as Seal Team Six commiting mass genocide without going to jail.
9486,Great graphics and the moding community is great.
9487,really great
9488,"I couldn't get into Arma. The gunplay wasn't there for me. I never got to try multiplayer, so take what I say with a grain of salt. Even with its lacking singleplayer, this game still amazes me with its vast render distance and beautiful landscapes. Good job Bohemia for allowing Arma to have a several mile render distance, without exploding my PC."
9489,Its fun and you can get a mod called ace which make the wounds realistic
9490,It's Arma. I love Arma.

9504,"Other than the Lack of Servers, Best game I own...
Mods are everything"
9505,Very different from any other fps shooter. Very fun with friends too!
9506,i like this game but i dont know why. there is no single feature i can say is my favorite or my least favorite.
9507,The best game in its own style In this game you can experience war and mission and design a mission for yourself!!.
9508,"Nice Photo mode, many keybinds, very active mod community"

9513,"The gameplay is really mediocre and some times even boring, being clunky and unintuitive. But the community, scenarios and the shared experience with friends, make it a really good online game."
9514,"Not Recommended

I did not like the game and I tried talking to support, but only got a response from a bot. Not much help.
I tried playing, it took me more than 1 hour to find an active game and, when I found one, there was no one in it.
After two hours, I got tired and exited the game. Another day, I tried again but without much success. I tried getting a refund, but the bot said I played (right) for more than 3 hours.

Anyways, no luck finding an active game and terrible support service from the developer... NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
9515,best game ever
9516,DLC Policy
9517,Gaming is totally different now. This game is behind the curve with everything.  Wanna have fun where RP originated?> Then buy it. Still a lot of RP servers and squad based military esk servers. I have more than 1000 hours not sure why its not there combined with Arma 2 roughly 2000 hours. Don't expect AAA controls and movement. When Bohemia moves to a new engine then Arma will be relevant again.
9518,good game
9519,"I absolutely love this game, though I would not recommend it to everyone. It takes an iron will, Scottish stubbornness, and a certain level of self-hate to get through this game, your average FPS player would break down and need psychological help after the first mission. It is incredibly intense, and if you make one wrong move you're buggered. But unlike CoD or Battlefield when you accomplish an objective (let alone a mission) in this game you actually feel like you've achieved something. What I would love to see is a DLC about the South African Border War (1966 to 1989).
I would love to see more content revolving around past wars, there is so much you can do. Ranging from WWI to the most recent wars being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. I will pay for anything these guys create."
9520,"Made the switch over from PS4 to PC recently. Basically only ever played Battledfield but wanted to try something a bit more realistic. Instantly fell in love with the multiplayer mode ""Invade and Annex"" and the ability to use mods to enhance the audio as well as to customize my characters uniform and weapons. Amazing game and I can see myself being a member of this community for a long time to come."
9521,most tactial shooter i ever seen and its the best (with steam workshop) i don't think there will be a more tactical shooter only if the next part gets realeasd then yea it will be better
9522,if you like hardcore tactical shooters with huge maps like battlefield but times 10 go for it but it is hard to get into
9523,"Best Military simulator of its time (Yes, now, the game is getting old)
Can be modded to the extreme
An almost infinite amount of missions, scenarios, mods available which extend the life of this game

I spent hours playing single player and multiplayer and both experiences are fun, deep, interesting, etc.

Cons:
Performance -> contact NASA to get a computer that delivers more than 30FPS when flying over a town 
Physics -> the physic model is broken sometimes, it's possible to get used it, but sometimes quirky collisions, weird impact management, etc. can be annoying

"
9524,"Too many bugs with the campaign, it has been released for over 7 years. Avoid it if you want to play it solo."
9525,"Between you and I. This game sucks. 

[b] However [/b]
It has the best community I've ever seen, Making mods, Missions, and welcoming new players in a way I've never seen from any other community. 

With just the right amount of Serious attitude, Mods, Buddies, and weekends, You will have an experience like in no other shooter you've ever played. 

If you're someone who likes non-stop action, and has no patience, this game likely isn't for you. But if you can slog through the modding (Which is fairly easy, With their great launcher) and learning the key-binds, and slotting yourself in with a nice group of people. You will find yourself spending hundreds of hours standing side by side with guys you've never met, treating them as if they're your best friends.

This series has been around a long time, and the void that it fills in the gaming atmosphere is Unique. But very needed. 

You should play ArmA 3."

9566,"Wonderful game

9567,"Vanilla Arma: Awesome. 

Vanilla Arma + Mods: AMAZING!!

This game honestly has limitless possibilities, whether you are a hardcore milsim guru or just wanna blow shit up, there is something in Arma for everyone and the mods to make it happen and let you play the way you want to. 

Don't let all these hardcore milsim nerds tell you otherwise, you DON'T need to be a hardcore milsim nerd to enjoy Arma with your friends. 

Some mods I would DEFINITELY recommend: 

Firewill's Aircraft - Pretty on point, several to choose from and they're all great. 
USAF Mod - Absolutely amazing mod around the USAF - several aircraft with EXTREME fidelity cockpits.
CUP - Community Upgrade Project - Amazing weapons and other items that will improve your gameplay drastically
NiArms - INCREDIBLE but big weapons pack (the all in one especially) but VERY worthwhile, super high fidelity awesome handling weapons.

Overall the game is a little hard to learn but is SUPER satisfying to play especially with friends, highly recommend this."
9568,Addicting as hell once you get into the game!
9569,great combat simulator with all the bugs youll learn to love.  altis life mod es muy divertido

9582,"Right before i get started - I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10+ years, it is the reason i bought my first gaming PC.

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field. 

You never know, if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :)"
9583,"I would recommend Arma 3 for either Serious or Jokester friend groups as it gives options for both you can range from being elite paratroops to civilians with dinky little pistols and the mods for this game only enhance this experience, while the game sounds so great it does have some bugs here and there but a lot of the time the janky physics aren't really harmful as they are hillarious"
9584,"i played this game so many times and i think you should buy this game, its worth it trust me. there are some bugs but that's rare, even after the bugs you can have fun with friends that you make in game. also the community is vary helpful (to me at least) and will help you if you don't know how to play. sometimes it can get out of control, but that is the joy of it. If you like-FPS/ realistic sim then ARMA is the game for you :) hope this helped you make up your mind if you should buy the game or not, see you out in battle."
9585,Fantastic and in-depth military simulator! highly recommend to anyone that's into realistic shooters :)
9586,Amazing game. If you are here for military stuff I suggest finding a unit/faction to do this simply head on to r/findaunit or the #communities_arma channel in the discord. If you are here for random gamemodes like Altislife just open your ingame server browser and you will find many different servers.
9587,"It's honestly one of the best Military simulation games that exist at the moment, with a lot of freedom in mission creation & mods."
9588,Amazing Simulator but far too many dlcs that clog the game

It's unfortunate that it didn't reach it's fullest potential like ArmA 2 OA did which (With mods) was one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion.

9653,"Very fun game. It‚Äôs really up to the player what and how they wanna play the game. 

There are thousands of mods which can help fit the type of game you wanna have.

Overall this game is a must have. Only issue is that the game is very resource intensive and can often be laggy if you have a bad computer."

@ Extra Notes @
Great game, most servers ran by 50-year-old rednecks who think they've just toured Vietnam for the sixth time in their non-existent military career. Overall beautiful game, fully worth the price, however DLC is required for most things, such as gamemodes and maps, which can sometimes make the game unplayable. However, very worth-while game.

64-bit modern tech verison of OpF/Soviet 80s European conflict good. 
Just add deformable terrain/buildings and not 3-part asset ""destruction"" and all is well."
9691,I love the game
9692,I've put all these hours into a single server playing modded Arma.
9693,"It's a good game. Even better when you get it on sale.

The versatility in what can do, and play in this game has truly made it one of the most replayable games in my catalog.

Between the campaign & mission editor, and the plethora of different game modes like Altis life, king of the hill, and at one point PUBG -- you will find no shortage of things to do. 



That being said, the DLC's are the biggest pain. So many DLC's and not nearly enough money to buy them all."
9694,very good. Buy it

9700,"while i recommend this game, i make this with the knowledge that i play with upwards of 20 people on a modded server
your fun with this game will very based on what groups you can play with."
9701,"At the time of this review, I have over 5000 hours in Arma 3. A majority of that in mission building and SQF scripting. This game offers endless replay-ability, especially if you have a knowledge of programming. I have no programming background and started this as a hobby when the game was first released and learned along the way. I watched this community grow, the mods and frameworks be built and still to this day, this game is still my favorite game. If you like community content, joining groups and messing around, this game is for you."
9702,dope asf
9703,Almost 10 years later I actually have a PC good enough to play it
9704,This game is slowly but surely sucking up my soul.....10/10
9705,game from 2013 that runs like absolute shit in 2021.
9706,Is good va.
9707,"Good :D 
"
9708,"Lovely game if you like military simulations and tactics. Albeit not easy to learn at the beginning, the possibilities it offers and the depth of the simulation is stunning. Amazing what the modding community has managed to achieve as, with the list of most commonly used mods, the game looks like what could be Arma4 or something, a much better experience.

Graphics are still holding after so many years (the game was released in September 2013 and I am writing this review in July 2021), the engine not so much as it has not been updated to modern hardware and standards (e.g. optimal use of multiple cores and threads, among others). The game also has some bugs (mostly graphic glitches and random behaviours) but they do not seriously hinder the playability.

I definitely recommend this game and I am looking forward to Bohemia Interactive to release Arma4 (or Squad maturing to match it in terms of possibilities and improving it tech-wise)."
9709,Good gaem
9710,"What do I say in ARMA is like you are playing Battlefield 2 or such a great Squad. This is the most tactical game that I ever seen. Every enemy has a capable in ambush you at the open.

This game is something else, I will recommend 10/10"

9717,"After almost 800hrs in this game, having played almost every major mod and having joined multiple groups during that time I feel that I have experienced almost everything Arma has. I genuinely enjoy the game and can definitely say that there is fun to be had playing with a handful of friends. The main problem I have with this game is the polarised extremes of the playerbase. On one hand, you have people who larp as special forces and will spend hours in silence because they have been told to be quiet by some armchair soldier on Teamspeak and on the other, you have a community of players who have nothing better to do than teamkill anyone spawning into a public server. 

These two groups make it almost impossible to join and play multiplayer in public servers and groups alike as there is basically no middle ground. You are either forced to join a group whose idea of fun is a compulsory parade every week or play with randoms in public servers with no coordination and awareness. I don't particularly care if people want to play in milsim groups or if they're one of the aforementioned randoms but because there is no alternative it makes the game un-enjoyable for anyone who is in between the two extremes.

My other issue is Arma 3's terrible way of handling DLC which means you either have to play on strictly base game servers or be subject to constant watermarks displaying some garbage like a popup for the karts DLC. This doesn't make anyone want to buy the DLC any more than they originally did but instead makes it actually aids to play, I won't even bother talking about the cesspit of contact and the other garbage that the devs roll out to flog money out of the corpse of this game.

TLDR: fun with friends, bad otherwise"
9718,"game made me cum instantly, was not expecting it, but a delight none the less."
9719,the game is a lot of fun and with mods has a ridiculous amount of versatility
9720,"very good! all you need is a pc above a 1060, at least I think. this is smooth as butter on my 1660 Super"
9721,"Great game that takes a chunk of time to learn but entertaining,great for people looking for realistic gun fights."
9722,nice
9723,Its really fun once u get used to it
9724,"yes, buy this and regret but still play because funny terrorist man blow up car"
9725,You like to game at all? Play this game for at least 6.99 a month and you'll experience the amazing potential there is in modern detroit.
9726,greatest war game out call of duty will never be this great
9727,"quite a lot of controls, however very fun with homies."
9728,"Played it since the alpha, very fun game"
9729,very fun
9730,its good
9731,"war crime sim
"
9732,I love this game and it's a great experience. It great to see a game that's sole focus is on realism while still being entertaining. The only thing I dislike about it is that the AI can be quite unrealistic at times as they'll do a 180 and start shooting me as I'm sneaking up on them. Besides from that it's a great game and I enjoy it. 9 out 10 for me.
9733,back in my day...
9734,"Great game, its even better with friends/team or clans"
9735,Great game
9736,game fun
9737,Graphically a beauty but other than that this isn't really a game... Meaning everything you play someone created because the basic game modes don't have any players. If you buy this beware you need to learn to create your own scenarios just like in Roblox.
9738,great game 10/10 lots of good moments
9739,"One of the best milsim games if not the best

9755,this game is a banger for the era
9756,One of the greatest milsim games ever made
9757,Zeus is a very good game-mode in this game and it complements the rest of the game very well. The rest of the game and the SOG dlc and very well done even if they are very old dlcs!
9758,What are they arming

9769,"Definitely worth it for the Military Simulation, amazing. Word through experience (the hard way) Your files are stored locally and not Cloud backed, so this might be one of the games you might want to save to the internal drive, special location, what have you. Mind you thats more important for Single Player. Other than that mod your Military dreams or nightmares to life."

9780,"boy oh boy, I sure do love being one of 10 people inside an armoured truck going with one other truck on the same road likely with the same amount of people headed for an active warzone. It sure is fun being the reinforcements of another group of individuals who are barely holding the point, who most likely will perish if we do not arrive and will surely cost us the game if we do not get there in time. I sure do hope we don't get brutally carpet-bombed 15 kilometers away from the objective, that would be quite unfortunate.

9800,"This is fun with friends, good modding community and a MASSIVE RP community. I don't care for RP but if you do you'll love this. Controls are too complicated for my pea-brain and I wish there was a simplified control scheme, other than that this is a must-try. DLC's kinda suck though, not the content just the fact that they LET you use them but then cram it down your throat that you should have paid, also covering your entire screen in DLC icons. Like wtf just don't let players use a DLC item they haven't paid for devs"
9801,Life is complicated and hard. Games should be even more complicated and difficult. Such is Arma.
9802,"if you find a server that you enjoy or a group that you get along in, from my experience it's enjoyable even if you don't know what you are doing. I was new to Arma and didn't know most things about how the game worked but I got lots of help from regulars. so my review is that if your new or if you just want an other military sim game Arma would be a safe bet"
9803,Amazing military simulator! Can play in 1st and 3rd person views. Really accurate physics and ballistics. Great for single or multi-player! Totally addicted.
9804,Yet just another pile of hot trash game with shitty graphics and no realism whatsoever. Game is unoptimised asf and is filled with crappy servers that don't make any sense.
9805,"I got PTSD from the game 
Fuck yes it‚Äôs worth it"
9806,It's a great time.
9807,"You want a realistic mil-sim? Arma 3 Is one of the best around, only problems are its terrible optimization, physics engine is quite wacky, if you use something from a dlc you don't own your game is plastered with ads until you stop using it. But hey, its one of the best around and there's not much else to play that features mil-sim.

Overall Score:
7/10"
9808,hard for beginners but fun when you get the hang of it
9809,"This game is dope. Used to play Arma 2 way back when. Came back to PC gaming last year.  Though I couldn't be bothered to re-learn that styel of  gameplay. Then one friend kept on and on about Arma 3 and I gave in. I bought it along with the DLC, and I am thoroughly happy with my purchase."

9837,"The best Military autism simulator on the market, I checked the stats and its still got more active players then Fallout 76 (not that big an accomplishment, I know). But with an active community and more scenarios on the workshop then you can poke a stick at, (trust me I've worn down 4 sticks to the nub trying) you'll spend hours playing. 

Heck I even learned to read a map because of this game, something 5 years of geography failed to do."
9838,"ARMY GAME GO BRRR
"
9839,I like the game and all but the addons are very complicated so that all.
9840,awsome
9841,this is a really good game but people take the fun out of it they think it is real life lol when it is just a game
9842,"This game is alright.  It's no Frontlines Fuel of War, but it is alright.  Call of Duty is more realistic as you get to pick perks like in the real military but this game is a good honest try.  I appreciate that there are a couple dozen vehicles to drive.  Fair warning though, there aren't any quick time events or wall running like the games we truly love.

If you are alright with a steep learning curve and punishing game play then this is a good game to consider.  However, if you are looking for repetitive gameplay and 12 year olds cussing you out you may not like this game.  I wish the developers would add some purchasable loot boxes and this game may be a 5/10 but as it is with no quick time events, angry children who shouldn't be playing violent video games letting you know you're a 45 year old living with your mom it is a solid 2/10.  Only purchase if it isn't on sale!"
9843,"Rogue Lineage is a fantasy game with rogue like elements. The game revolves around a permadeath mechanic, where each of your characters will have but a few lives before they die forever. You'll pass down some pieces of yourself to your heir, who'll become your next character.

Players will progress by learning new abilities and trying to best their previous characters. Forge houses with your friends to take control of cities, or stick it out alone. Tackle injuries, diseases, and trauma as you struggle to survive in this testament to pain.

9879,"I've had good times, I've had bad times, Arma is a life style not a game.
it can be a future warfare game or a modern shooter. It can even be a life simulator. 
From Warhammer 40k to WW2  it is a game that can be what ever you want.
Plus its not even that hard to find people to play with if you have 2 brain cells. however some people in this game lack that quality. Also bind your grenades to 2xG, you'll thank me later."
9880,Gmod for war criminals. Absolutely recommend. (w/ mods + friends)
9881,"First 20 hours of gameplay is getting used to the controls.After that, a true solider hops on hardcore King of the Hill and fights to the end."

update, battle eye has been implemented, but the launcher is still borked"
9896,"If you really want to waste away playing a military game that most of the time your not even playing the original version because all of your friends told you to get mods for it and completely fill up your measly 2TB drive with only mods and MAYBE Spiderman then you should get this game.

If you are looking for a game that has great game-play for war games and isn't glitchy in the slightest then this isn't for you and you should run before you end up playing this game for over 900 hours and realize that there isn't a mod that makes you get your life back."
9897,"It's alright. Although, I've only played a little bit."

9900,"After 10 years the developers still refuse to fix trivial bugs like frequent crashes, rocks exploding vehicles, you need to reboot the app if your headphones die, and more. Basically if there was any other game that offered this functionality I'd be playing it instead. But nobody else does. So here we are, thousands of hours later. Hopefully someone competes with them and forces them to care about their product."

9911,"ARMA 3 is a perfect example of one of a poorly programmed game engine sticking to the early 2000s, but still managing to run despite most of its ideas being outdated. It is insanely fun when you have a group to play with, but aside from that, it's not really worth the money anymore."
9912,"good stress reliever while hearing dudes take this game up the ass, and then i come in with a pistol and cap them against the ROE"

9917,"Never tried any milsim games before but this one addicts me so hard with a bunch of mod varieties so you could have a better immersion towards the game, totally worth every penny I spent."
9918,This game is so much fun I to play it when my PC is not having a hard day or when I just finished off some work.
9919,get it if you don't have it!
9920,"Fantastic Military Sim! Single player and multiplayer are both great, and there is a large amount of support for modding. There are glitches however, especially in the single player campaigns, they are not broken, but some levels when they glitch out have to either be restarted or finished with console commands.

However, I would recommend this game over any other fps/military game out there. 8.5/10"
9921,Just like real military man shoot bad guy.
9922,"Arma 3 is set in a world where a deadly virus known as CROVIS 18 kills millions of people. Later the military tasks Bohemia Interactive to make a pretty half baked Military Sim game known as Arma 3 where they promise to release payed DLC that sucks a lot of cock, but don't worry, you can play them with a fat ass watermark on your screen or after your game has ended.  But there's no reason to buy the DLC since the Modders are better at making content then the actual Developers. In short the game is really bad if you don't download about 76 GB worth of mods."
9923,"This is hands-down the most realistic milsim I have ever played, and should be on ever military nerd's list (along with DCS of course)"

9958,You can do brrrrrrrrrt without paying so thats a yes recomended
9959,"Having played over 90 hours of this game I supposed I should recommend it but it was a love/hate relationship. I played ARMA 2 ages ago and remember enjoying it in spite of its ""clunkiness"", so ARMA 3 has been on my wishlist for years. For some reason I bit the bullet at the last Steam sale and spent ¬£20. That got me the APEX package plus Contact and the Marksman DLC. I'm only interested in single player mode so I ran through the tutorial which was where I realised that my old PC (i7 2700K with 980GTX SLI) was struggling to run this CPU-bound game. The tutorial seems to be more a series of rendered cut-scenes than actual gameplay and the fps went through the floor. A bit of research later I configured the game to be playable and set about running through the showcases - which I would recommend for new players.

Finally I felt that my PC was running the game well enough and I could remember enough controls to survive so I played the original single player mission East Wind. That's when I realised how buggy the game is. Enemy soldiers teleporting about was annoying enough but the real PITA is when tasks can't be completed and it is necessary to revert to an old savegame. But I also didn't like the close-contact style and was irritated that I couldn't use the marksman DLC, so I loaded the single player cheat mod. Now with a sniper rifle I could play more in the style I wanted and could make adjustments to compensate for the bugs. The scenario was longer than I expected and the storyline fairly strange but I had fun.

So next I played the APEX single player mission Old Man. This felt less military simulation and more Far Cry to me, but not a very good Far Cry. I mostly ignored the sandbox opportunities and played through the mission task by task, putting up with the bugs. Part the way through the game I completed a new PC (5900X with RTX3090) which could run the game smoothly on max settings. This made it look and feel better, but still old. There was a bug that prevented me from completing the game or exploring the other endings but luckily I have a home server and was able to restore an earlier savegame from backups and finish it - although it seems that one ending has an unavoidable bug.

By now I was feeling neutral about the game and doubting that the ¬£20 was worth it until I started Contact. I really liked this mission even though it still uses the buggy ARMA 3 engine. Shame that the developers couldn't have given it more depth and increased content - the sandbox potential was underused in my opinion. I certainly recommend Contact for single players, and APEX (Old Man) not so much. I finished off by playing some content from the Steam Workshop but whilst I applaud the authors for their efforts they all felt unpolished and after a while I got bored of them."
9960,best military sandbox out there!
9961,it is good
9962,"It ain't the perfect Military Sandbox, but there isn't any better that I know of. If you or a friend knows what they're doing, you can make just about anything. The modding community has so much content; you can turn this game into a War simulator in any setting under the sun : Halo, StarWars, World War 2, Vietnam, Starship Troopers, World War 3, Ace Combat, World of Tanks, SCP... The only limit it has is the creativity and drive of you and your friends."
9963,This game is a lot of FUN. I was lucky enough to have experienced friends show me the ropes.
9964,"multiplayer is a little boring, you travel like 10km just to get blown up by a mine. But a fun game"

9968,"great game so far worth a play if you enjoy military games. graphics aged very very well, there are a few major (nothing that totally breaks the game but a few come very close, tipping point is the worst bug by FAR save often and dont let team lead 1 die on that mission, he is set as the mission trigger and when he dies there is no script to make anyone else the trigger so you will end up in a loop and there is a SEVERE lack of teaching in the game (READ THE FIELD MANUAL IN THE MENU) and stealth is not very good, some times you will be right in front of a badguy with no problem, and some times they will see you 400 feet away out of the corrner of their eye while you are laying down in tall grass behind a tree. later in the game you will control a small to medium size team, command is kinda clunky your guys must be on hold fire at all times or they will engage a fucking tank with a 5.56 rifle, essentially they are dumb, they dont take cover well on their own, and are just really a fan of being shot to death repeatedly (ive given up on trying to keep them all alive) they will shoot a grenade launcher at a single man but will fire their all powerful 5.56 at a tank till they get blown to hell. moral of the story is... the AI on your team is not great, but just like stealth its unpredictable, every once in a while your team will MOW the enemy down like fish in a barrel, that is kinda the consitent problem sometimes you will get your face blown off going around a corner, and sometimes they will fire 50000 rounds at you and not hit you once... overall its good if you get it on sale even better, or if you have people to play with online, but be ready for bugs, and derpy mechanics from time to time, this game is a very powerful simulator if you want to invest hundreds of hours into it, you can make any custom battle go down..."
9969,Great with friends!
9970,8 years old and still a benchmark of what PC gaming can be.
9971,Dont buy it
9972,i don't know what i'm doing
9973,"I'd recommend this game for other people, especially low-spec monitors because you can run at an easy 30 FPS with a not-so-good monitor. But 1 thing i'd like to suggest is to lessen the amount of DLC's that need to be bought in order to play in public servers, and just maybe lessen the amount of the actual DLC's, because they're about $10, and the game itself is just $30, or just allow access to more guns and turrets and tanks etc. to be played in scenarios."

9975,good

10009,"+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield
+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several

-not that well optimised, even high end PCs wont get that high fps
-The A.I isnt acting real humans which they should, the A.I Tanks for example are just ridiculous good oneshotting you from 2.5km on the easiest difficulty
- Learning curve for new players, with advanced controls and confusing FPS mechanics at first
- Small DLC packs are required for improved content that you will eventually want to use

10018,"The king of mil-sims (Military Simulators). Launched in 2013, Armed Assault 3, or, for short, Arma 3, was, from then to now, the king of mil-sims. The realism in this game is overwhelming at times, making it a hard game to master, people having over 3000 hours in the game, and saying they still feel like a noob. Note that DLCs are necessary to buy for a better experience, but not needed. Will need a pretty powerful machine to run this game at times. 9/10."
10019,Realism
10020,First I bought this game a While back and I could not figure out what the point was.So I refunded it but I decided to try it again and got to see the game for what it really is. To play this game you need to learn how to be patient.Most of the time you are being shot at and you dont even know where you are being shot from and this gets worse with PVP. Not to mention you spend most of your game traveling just to hit and IED or get bombed by a A10. I have put alot of my time into this game and I really recommend it there is just so much to do in this game and it keeps me coming back to it for more.

10040,"ArmA is:
- [b] GREAT [/b] military sandbox for role-playing, modding, scenario building, tacticool soldier dress-up, shooting range simulator
- [b] HORRIBLE [/b] military action FPS/3rd-person shooter with vehicles

The BAD:
[*] [b] Optimization. [/b] Frequent hiccups and frame drops no matter how good your pc is or how low you set the game's options.
[*] [b] JANK. [/b] You'll die walking up a staircase b/c your legs clipped through the ground. In-game Interface is dated and clunky. The control scheme is complex, uses your entire keyboard, and the interface makes it worst.
[*] [b] A.I. [/b] Is worse than that of many 90's games. Enemies act like robocop, looking at one direction, moving towards another and shooting towards another one. Their movement speed and trajectory changes non stop in the most uncanny and unpredictable manner. NOT in a realistic challenging way, but in an irritating inhuman way. [b] Playing as a sniper/marksman against A.I. is just a sad experience [/b] because you don't get the joy of anticipating the target's behaviour and landing a brilliant intuitive shot.
The A.I. also sees you through buildings, objects and high grass, even when not looking at you, walks through walls of buildings w/o using the doors (like Homer Simpson going through the bush meme), have bad path finding, bad driving/piloting and frequently ignore commands.
[*] The complexity of the player's movement set does NOT work for action gaming. A clear example: You can crouch, crouch lower, a bit lower, prone, lean, lean more and more to position yourself firing from cover. Problem is, you'll still lose the fight against the player that simply strafes in-and-out of cover like hes playing Counter Strike.

The GOOD:
[*] Visually great all around.
[*] Playing soldier dress-up and practicing shooting at the gun range (virtual armory)
[*] Full 3d editor to create and play whatever scenarios you want (most of my playtime is from there)
[*] Outstanding modding scene. Devs are very friendly to mods.
[*] Dedicated servers
[*] Plenty of complexity regarding weapons/attachments, ballistics, communication, vehicles, maps and coordination.

Do not buy it if you're searching for a fun ACTION 1st/3rd person military shooter with vehicles. Get anything else for that.
Buy if you want the military role-playing/simulator aspect of it."

10046,"Well, it's been roughly a year since I got this game. I originally got it to play with a couple of friends, but we hadn't been very active on it. After a while, I met a good friend of mine on another game, and they had invited me to their unit -- The 5th Rangers (5R). I was a bit nervous at first, as I had literally no knowledge of anything in the game. I figured I should give it a shot. Slowly, but surely I'd been playing. It was fun, and I had met new friends. A few hundred hours in, I began to have an attraction to Zeus. I started out just using Zeus, as I didn't understand the Eden Editor.
I then took a small hiatus from the 5th Rangers, and started my own unit. I called it Tau-14. Knowing little to nothing about management, I tried my hardest to remain organized. Originally, I was hesitant on inviting people, but slowly I began releasing operations, and inviting more people. After a while though... nobody was active, and I had disbanded the unit. As all things do, it had come to an end. Earlier than I had wished. I may try again one day, but I'm doubtful.
I returned to the 5th Rangers in order to regain my traction in the unit. Now I've met some of my best friends on this game, and make operations for some of the nicest people I can relate to. After my return, I learned many more terms used by our military, and I have much more knowledge in some fields. Arma 3 has had me meet my best friends, and to learn. It's been the greatest thing that I've played in a very long time. Although I only have 2,000 hours, it's changed the people around me, and it's changed the way I view certain things.

Get this game, and enjoy it. You'll have your ups and your downs, but in the end it's so worth it.

10064,"This game is very fun as it has kinda realistic physics and it has very large maps and it takes time to get kills and to get places. the community is also very good on the AU servers and the lads are always in for a game chat and a good game. but this game takes hours to master and even learn, I've just started to get decent kill streaks and high K/D ratio (I've played 137 hours), but when you have master and learnt how to play it can actually be very enjoying and having the lads on the AU servers makes it even more fun as they are willing to have a chat and a good game.
I recommend this Product"
10065,Very good yes
10066,Best games ever
10067,good
10068,"The game is attractive for those who like real battles, but it need patient to understand how to play.

Advantages:
Huge maps for players to explore.
Mission editor for senior users to create their own missions and publish it.
Good guns and equipment design, and good shooting feeling for most.
Emphasize players to cooperation, advanced AI control if in single-player missions.
Great steam workshop, always have mods and maps developers to publish new compositions.

Disadvantages:
Takes long time for new comers to get familiar, most of new players gave up in less than 100 hours.
Bad performance, low FPS in most devices, even more acute in multiplayer mod.
Lack of development in the game nowadays, put all efforts to develop DLCs.
Lack of good servers, most of them use some missions that made by others, official server lack management.

Overall:
Good game for military fans but cost a lot (NOT ONLY MONEY).Players who are not familiar in certain areas might learn a lot of knowledge if they are willing to. Students in holidays are recommended to have a try. High performance computers are not needed cause that will not help to improve the frames.

10106,"Good game with a wide variety of modding and other features. The wide features of the game is quite difficult to learn because of all of the keybinds and general stuff about different types of weapons and vehicles. That's where the field manual informs you about ways to react in different situations e.g using flares to dodge a missile. Although the dlcs can be a bit pricy, I highly recommend bying them (first contact and the creator dlcs doesn't really matter in my opinion). The dlcs makes the game so much more enjoyable than it already is with larger varieties of weapons and vehicles for your usage. I wouldn't say that Arma 3 isn't a action packed game, but I will say that it isn't the same kind of action that you would experience in a first-person shooter like counter-strike. You do a lot of moving around and it takes time to arrive to places because the maps are very large and have alot of places to explore and use as a tactical advantage. The gamemodes this game offers you are very nice, I think that theres something for everyone who are ready to put some time to learn the game before giving up. For example the Warlords gamemode is very fun and is basically the mode you'd want to play to learn the game. The singleplayer campaigns are also greatly planned and creative and there are many of them, so there is much content that gets included in just the base game."

10128,"This is a really good MILSIM game, or a nice time to mess around with friends"
10129,its a good feeling to have no bloody idea where you are being shot from.
10130,"I've really enjoyed some of the single player content in this game, there is really nothing like it that I have played in terms of realism - the maps are huge, there are plenty of weapons, vehicles and aircraft, and some of the campaigns and missions are great fun to play, as well as having a pretty good story line. Overall it has been worth the purchase. However, multiplayer is where the fun stops for me, it's an absolute headache to try and set up a server to play with friends, having to fiddle with settings on my router is not something I expect to have to do to simply connect to a server. Also, the learning curve is so high for this game, playing on public servers is a real gamble - even in player vs ai modes like escape.

All of this could be forgiven for the massive potential and scope of this game, but recently I have been experiencing repeated crashes to desktop without any warning or error messages. Until this major bug is fixed I simply can't recommend the game.

Bonus:
If you're looking for a multiplayer military simulation game focused on team play and realism check out SQUAD. There's a great community and it retains a lot of the realism without sucking the fun out of multiplayer play. Still a bit of a learning curve, but you can pick up most of the game mechanics in a few hours and everything is focused on team work and strategy."
10131,"if you like sim games, this is the one for you"
10132,"its a awesome military game, instead of all the others where you take a hit and keep on running, you have to treat your injury's, so that adds a level of realism to the game"

It's so vastly unique and janky, in it's own right that every time I pick it up, i'm coming back for more. ARMA has so many mods, modes, and the community is something else. It's truly something."
10135,"If you can find a server you enjoy, this game is absolutely awesome. The ""campaign"" is good, but it's mostly a tutorial that won't help you if you play on a server with mods as they drastically change the gameplay in msot cases."
10136,fuckn' mint game if you play it with friends
10137,10/10... realistic combat. VERY fun
10138,"Now, let me clarify. You will *not* have fun in this game if you aren't looking for a milsim, or when you are first starting off. This game is old, clunky, and hard as shit to play. HOWEVER, once you get past that, it's a not-so hidden gem. There's a reason why Arma is one of the most popular milsims, and it's because it is GOOD AT WHAT IT'S TRYING TO DO. I don't suggest buying it, unless you are specifically looking for a milsim game, with very fun vehicles (except for the fact helicopters are hard as shit to use starting out), ignoring the fact the game puts ""to use this vehicle you have to have DLC!"" every 5 seconds. ANYWAYS, I personally enjoy this game, but a lot of people WONT. Unless you are looking into milsims, I wouldn't suggest the average call of duty or halo fan to jump into this game blind. also stamina management sucks!!!!!"
10139,Arma 3 is a highly addictive game that would be perfect for competative gamers who enjoy realism and military tactics. As a veteran of the United States Military this would be a perfect game to own.
10140,good game played it before
10141,"I've had this game for like 3 months and already have over 550 hours in it so, I think I should recommend it."

10147,A great game for military fanatics and roleplayers. So many options to change the gameplay and improve to your liking. The only downside is how much the addons can cost.

10151,its like gmod but you talk to people that arent on drugs
10152,i like this game bc i love military aka army so if you like army this is the best game i also like it bc their is barley any army games.
10153,Where did my time go
10154,yes
10155,This game is good and very realistic. I love it
10156,i hate the poo heads they do not lie to be bombed (i have commited several waR CRIMES in this game)
10157,"Ive been playing Arma 3 for a couple months and gee, this is a awsome game."
10158,i touched tanks with another person and now my tank has traveled 3 kilometers in record speed
10159,"Game is a buggy mess that still runs poorly nearly 8 years after release, only good thing about the game is the ballistics. Wouldn't bother with this, many other better games."
10160,"A significant step forward for the simulation of war and the military genre. However the performance of the game needs to be improved and the developers need to pay more attention to bugs or an engine replacement. (arma 4?)

The game allows creative developers to make a variety of mods and workshop content to boost the experience of other players. The ambition that the community has toward the game in re-creating so many elements of modern warfare will astound you. I highly recommend this game if you seek ground, naval and air warfare."
10161,Unoptimized but fun af. esp wit friends.
10162,yeet
10163,"noice 5 star
"
10164,joe
10165,"the most part of this game is multiple dlcs, the game itself might be kinda good.... if there weren't so many bugsit would maybe be enjoyable... but its just one big dlc locked glitch.
"
10166,Played this and still lost in airsoft. HOW
10167,"Very fun game for tactics , also fun if you know what you're doing! Would deff recommend it."
10168,"An old and buggy game that still offers a different experience to the saturated market of constant respawn first person shooters and is worth for it alone after you get destroyed by cheaters in csgo and don't want to move to valorant/cod/bf.


In game you play as NATO but this game runs like communist software ""It runs poor on everyone's PC!""(like, seriously you could have a newer gpu/cpu it doesn't care.. set your expectations to as low as 40 fps and you'll be good .)


DLC prices are kind of a scam(EA is that you ???)...am that's it...

Only played the campaign so far and enjoying it...(after 20 years of gaming i just learned you could play as someone other than John Rambo in games :O )

"
10169,It's fun and scary

10183,Haha war crimes go brrr
10184,"Oh yea, so realistic. So many servers, also you can play modded servers, some have role-play, it has endless possibilities, Single player campaigns, multiplayer, coop, everything...it even has a Zeus, you press Y and it pings you to him and you can ask him for anything pretty neat in Zeus enabled servers. It has so much more than I thought. It's more than you can imagine."

10197,"the definitive milsim on the market, just wish they would work on the lighting lmfao"
10198,nice
10199, is good
10200,"Arma 3 has its up's and downs but once you find that group of people you enjoy playing with, wither that be from a steam group or just finding them in public match, the game becomes enjoyable and fun to play especially with friends to enjoy them with. now the public is toxic but what multiplayer game isn't toxic, ya know? i recommend this game to everyone as you can have hours upon hours of fun in it, just be careful with the DLCs the gear from the dlcs are nice but the story is eh."
10201,yes
10202,really love the game it has lots of game modes like altus life for rp and king of the hill to just kill people and have fun listening to the banter of other players on voice
10203,"BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED, If your a fan of Unturned, or R6, Pavlov, ETC, You will LOVE THIS GAME."
10204,Lots of glitches but they're clearly features
10205,these game takes so long i could lern to drive a helicopter in real life
10206,fav game
10207,"tons of fun with mates, the voice chat definitely adds to this game wither thats intense gun fights or messing around with the passengers in a chopper the game is great"
10208,Great Game even with its age just has a little of a learning curve def worth it if its on sale
10209,"good game, a-10 really do go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt"
10210,Really fun immersive army sim game
10211,it will consume your life
10212,"Arma 3 is not without flaws but it is overall an amazing game to experience all kind of combat experiences: Infantry, tanks, humvees, planes, ships, helicopters. PvE, PvP, SP, Coop. Mods, scenario editor. You got it all here."
10213,"This game, to put it simply, is orgasmic. Satisfying to the mind. After a long hard day of work, ARMA 3 by bohemia interactive, soothes my brain. Playing with my buddies is so much fun!!!!
Defo would recomend to my fellow gamers!?!?!?"
10214,no
10215,"Arma 3 is an awesome game, I've been playing it for years. When I got my new computer, it was the first game I made sure to download, and the first game I played. The game can be as intense or as casual as you want it to be, with games such as Life Roleplay, King of the Hill, and PVE. I will say, the only downside is how much it takes to run this game on high graphics, but that isn't a huge deal as lowering the graphic quality does not make the game unplayable."
10216,The lack of being able to get on a team (squad). Really hinders gameplay. I wouldn't recommend
10217,by far the worst experience i ever had trying to play online on this game error code after error code with this game on top of that forcing u to pay for bullshit ass dlcs when the game won't even run right prime example of what half ass not caring looks like. waste of 100$ spent on this awful game
10218,k
10219,its ok
10220,its good
10221,it ok
10222,Very nice
10223,get a i9 and this game just works
10224,If u are young and want to play altis life it really fun. But u need to make sure that u get some ppl to play with
10225,"Kind of a buggy unoptimized mess with a horrible physics engine that hasnt been fixed in years, can be fun in certain circumstances but most of the time is extremely mediocre"
10226,good
10227,What should I say... It's a military sandbox game. You can do what you want basically and that's why its awsome
10228,"Fun, action packed, trolly, Weird Physics
Get it, its great"
10229,good
10230,69 hours nice
10231,THE GAME IS THE BEST!
10232,"Tired of bots?? Then this is the perfect game for you where even the lowest tier bots can snipe you from 1300M while you are showcasing a sick a$$ dance u made in Eden editor. 


Bored?? Dont u worry!!!
All u have to do is to login in to another tdm server and heli kamikaze the opposing team just make sure to turn VC off 





TLDR: 69/10 just buy it already"
10233,VERY
10234,"Really an excellent game! Though I've only played for 13 hr, this is not the first time that I've ever heard about this game. As far as I can tell, this is really an excellent game. 
Well, it's gonna cost you a lot to buy all the DLCs, but don't worry, it's still gonna be extremely playable even without all those fancy DLCs.
I hope this review can help you, and sorry about my poorly-spoken English."

10238,"very good
"
10239,good game
10240,Good game!
10241,"Possibly the best and most fun ArmA game yet. The gameplay is a dream compared to any ArmA game before it, things like controls or switching weapons have been streamlined, and the inventory system has been expanded greatly. The only issues I have are the occasional bugs, weird AI and generally off the walls optimization (especially on multiplayer), but besides that, this game is amazing."
10242,good
10243,"yea its all right, guess."
10244,"Previously I had complained about the low framerate, but I have now embraced the stuttery, glitchy, mil-sim. Probably the most advanced, in-depth game I have ever played. Like Squad's uglier, but more capable older brother."
10245,I have played the crap out of this game. Spent most of my time in editor as I enjoy scripting missions. Would buy again.
10246,Pretty much speaks for itself at this point.
10247,Good Game
10248,i liked  arma

10257,"yes
"
10258,"Got it for the summer sale... reckon it's worth it if it's on sale, but the full price is a bit much these days.
Runs on my surface pro, and has a few bugs but nothing that has come close to crashing the game."
10259,"sir! Yes, sir!
If you like realistic physics, teamwork, and every form of warfare, this game is for you. but it's a very harsh experience alone. but what an amazing when playing with your friends."
10260,"I was looking for a shooter that required communication and Arma 3 satisfy it. I was looking for a shooter that was realistic and Arma 3 more than accomplishes this.I like Arma because you have plenty of tutorials, many different game modes and the mods from the community will keep the game fresh. If you are looking for people to play with add me to your friends list and maybe we can group up and do some co-op missions."
10261,gud
10262,Pretty good sim of military combat. I'm a USMC Veteran and along with squad and battlefield i must say i enjoy the immersion.
10263,"This game is very good if you want a fun, mil-sim type of game to play. I highly recommend you play with friends, maybe even get a server with mates to play on. Some of the mods for this game are phenomenal, and are extremely fun to play with. The physics are a bit janky, and the AI can be a tad clueless at points. However, there are many mods that can change and improve the AI! Aside from that, this game is very fun and I'd recommend you play it!"
10264,its ok
10265,that is one of my best game
10266,This was a very good buy and with mods is even better.
10267,"Very fun game, realistic, played with some groups that tried to simulate a real army, it was a unique experience, and a good one. 
The game graphics are very good, the price is great and at the moment on  a great discount of 75%.
I recommend the game, at least to give it a try."
10268,it gud
10269,Not very good
10270,"Arma 3 is probably the best sandbox military shooter, honestly vanilla is not so bad but the mods are where its at. RHS, CUP, ace (if you like realism) and even missions like Antistasi or gamemodes like Warlords, Wasteland and even fucking Altis Life can still make the game enjoyable. 10/10 must experience driving to an objective for 40 minutes to get sniped by insane AI aim, and then doing it again because its somehow fun."
10271,"Absolutely amazingly excellent to a type of fan, and extremely decent the others, I am that type of fan and I hope you will be to. I had problems with the game randomly crashing for no reason but I fixed this just by setting it so that it runs as administrator every time I open it and it runs perfectly."
10272,good game
10273,I want to like the game but damn it's buggy.
10274,Amazing realistic exp! Would recomend!
10275,PENIS

10293,good modifiable rp and fps/tps
10294,very imersive
10295,"I have a love hate relationship with this game.  It is without a doubt the most immersive and sophisticated military sim in the series brought down with clunky, bizarre controls, dated graphics and legacy mission scripting. 

Don't waste your time with single player, multi player missions are where it's at. It is also vastly improved with the truly massive and game changing mods available for it like ACE3.  

Better still, join a group or clan and play endless hand-crafted missions with your mates."
10296,The best game you'll ever play!!!
10297,awesome game love creating my own scenarios
10298,–≥—É—Ç
10299,"Thought I'd right a review on how shitty this game is. You log on. Realize most of the servers that are available to join are dlc only so you finally find one that doesn't and it ends up downloading random bullshit for 5 minutes and then it just gets stuck on the loading screen. Terrible ass game. Even on sale I feel like I wasted the full price of this garbage. Learn how to make a game. Now I'm gonna refund this $5 and buy something.. ANYTHING and it will still be better than this. I might even buy a burger from burger king with it and it would still be a better investment and an enjoyable time then this trash. Before you morons say ""You""Re Pc Is BaD"" Nope thats not it. RTX 2080 and an I7 8700K 32GB of ram. See ya"

10305,cool and fun
10306,10/10
10307,the maker of this game did not care that the game is dead.
10308,Little to no explanation on what is what and how to use it. Poor optimization with a very clunky UI. This is just a base game... DLC are required for anything beyond the basic beginning. Multi player servers are private... good luck with that!! This game is NOT for casual players.
10309,epic
10310,water proof
10311,"fun
lots of things to do, lots of things to learn
it is the best milsim of which I know"
10312,"POSITIVES:
- Very realistic
- Very rewarding experience when successfully completing objectives using tactics, good aiming, tools, etc.
- Fun with friends
- Arma 3 Wasteland is like Day Z without the hassle and just straight combat with vehicles and infantry (play my server IP thepublic.community)

NEGATIVES:
- Learning curve for new players, with advanced controls and confusing FPS mechanics at first
- Small DLC packs are required for improved content that you will eventually want to use
- All the maps except Tanoa feel the same just with different shaped boundaries
- FPS goes down to around 30 when a mission has been running for at least 2 hours if there are lots of entities
- Avoid the RP servers"
10313,can someone tell me how to do a wheelie on the dirtbike
10314,"Since it's excistens the best game I have. Enjoy!!!
"
10315,I would recommend this game to other players even after all these years.
10316,Its very fun if ur teammates work w u
10317,great game tons of content
10318,"Game was released 8 years ago yet still so buggy you can't even play the campaign. Pretty disappointed with the fact that enemies will literally disappear as you are aiming at them. All settings set to ultra yet can't keep models loaded in. Make's Sense. Thought it was going to be cool, turned out it wasn't. Takes 5 minutes to get through an engagement with 4 people just so you can get shot 10 minutes late by an invisible enemy and have to load all the way back to 15 minutes earlier. Do not buy unless for multiplayer."
10319,deez
10320,One of the better military FPS
10321,Runs like a can but it makes you feel cool when you dome someone. The drawback is that when you get domed you're gonna be pissed because it is most likely from nowhere. The controls practically take up two and a half keyboards. Would recommend if you can actually run it and have the patience to learn the game.
10322,"Very fun game, always getting into the mess and out. Even better with friends!"
10323,love it
10324,Very good.
10325,fun game very cool have virtual PTSD now

10327,"If you want a military sim for multiplayer and mission editor, then this is a pretty okay game. But the campaign.. oh God. The campaign feels like it was slapped together with minimal effort. 90% of the time you're alone taking out waves of enemies that are shooting at you from like two thousand yards away. And when you finally DO get a squad, they all die the moment you get into your first firefight. Leaving you, yet again, alone to complete the mission. It's an absolute joke. So if you're looking for a military sim that has a good campaign, absolutely SKIP this and get something else."
10328,"i fucking hate this game, i dont know what am i doing even if i played over 5 hours of tutorials, fuck this game, i wish i didnt buy it, its really not worth it."
10329,"This games Campaign is good, Multiplayer is Amazing with certain servers or with friends. i does take time to learn the Controll's and maps (bearings and all that) its really fun I Totally Recommend this game to veterans and just the normal everyday people."

10345,I very suggest it very much milsim i like
10346,Yes.
10347,"
Arma 3 is a ""old"" game but that by no means mean it's bad, this is the OG Mil sim game whether you want to play custom community generated scenarios or the pre-made campaign missions you are covered the community content is fantastic and allows for a wide range of play style!"
10348,"The game is great ofcourse if you like FPS games.It has a variety of things like tanks,planes and other things.
The game's campaign is great.In my opinion i recommend you spend your money on this or just wait for ArmA 4."
10349,i still don't know whats even happening
10350,its bad but good
10351,veri god
10352,"After over 800 hours, 100's of mods, and probably thousands of ops I would like to say this game was the best milsim game I could have ever hoped to play. That being said....it's time to stop milking the community with DLC and start talking about when we can spend our money on Arma 4."
10353,"I played once and forgot the controls after the tutorial finished
10/10"
10354,all the servers are private and so none for casual gamers
10355,so motivational game
10356,"brilliant game, with both extremely realistic and hilarious aspects to it at the same time"
10357,"I really enjoy Arma 3, play it with a few of my buddies. id recommend it to other for sure!"
10358,your not going to know how to anything
10359,"The bugs and glitches in this game is part of the intended gameplay, DLC are not necessary to buy. Just use the mod packs in the community. GREAT!"
10360,"mmmmmmmmmm
"
10361,"very realistic military sim. You can play against people with you're friends or. Play numerous campaign like dlc.
"
10362,Worth for the editor alone
10363,"realistic and semi open world, good graphic and sound design but with some minor bugs but that's alright. can be a little bit frustrating"
10364,Echaremos fuera al yankee y su lenguaje siniestro. con la unidad popular ahora somos gobierno!
10365,"!!
"
10366,"Definitely a recommend. Prove yourself in simulated combat and tactical maneuvering, be it on land, air and sea. Be the complete soldier. 

Reminder: no Rambo run n gun style of play here. Do it at your own peril. If u have a squad leader obey his commands, if u are the leader, use your wisdom. Do these things and you'll be fine, soldier."
10367,Solid
10368,yes good gam
10369,"Haha war crimes the video game haha

too many buttons

still fun"
10370,its ok
10371,nah
10372,"Still one of the best Mil sim(s) out there
"
10373,Great game!!
10374,love it
10375,"My first military sim game, it was a change coming from Call of Duty, Halo, Titan Fall, etc. But honestly I love the change of pace, the realism and the massive world and the community! It is worth it 100%"
10376,Good
10377,One of the OG games

10388,"I actually have been meaning to play the game for a long time, did not disappoint!
"
10389,you can shoot at stuff
10390,jesus nuked it
10391,Don't look at my account
10392,"Got a bit of time playing this at this point, so I guess I feel comfortable reviewing it. Singleplayer content is mostly dead content, but if your friends have Arma 3, you'll probably have fun. Don't be a cringe MILSIM. Don't be a cringe roleplayer. Kill stuff, fly jets, blow things up. Most of the AI are aimbots."
10393,fun and realistic
10394,"i am not a gamer at all, tried plying once with my husband and now i am hook... Awesome Game.."
10395,ey
10396,"War crimes? Yes.

I think that's enough to make me recommend it."
10397,"fun adn hard
"
10398,"Played it for a bit. ""fun"""
10399,"this game goes pew pew and boom boom 
"
10400,"yes, fun game, has its glitches but every game has some of those"
10401,amazing
10402,"this game is very good, it follows the arma tradition of being buggy as hell with weird glitches in the systems. But it has a good story. a great player base and is welcoming to players of all skill levels and abilities."
10403,"yes
"
10404,Don't expect a fast paced game a la Call of Duty / Battlefield. This is a thinking mans military simulator. Top notch. Highly recommended.
10405,"I'm 72 years old and can still really enjoy games like this one because it is realistic and not just ""jumping and shooting"" like so many kiddie games these days.  This game is very intricate but that's half the fun of it and the game is definitely suited for the more serious-minded of gamers."
10406,"Great fun, especially if you join a proper group.
Can have some janky physics but that's part of the ARMA charm
10/10"
10407,Great game for some people.
10408,Astonishingly good war simulator and the community are amazing at adding new content and changing existing content to be more entertaining. Love it every PC Gamer should have this.
10409,:D
10410,This game has been the best simulation style game that I have ever played.  I always have something new to learn while playing this game.  Very  likeable for me and I'm sure others.
10411,"Overall, good game. Some bugs but I can forgive, as launching into the sky at 150mph in a 72-ton tank after being rammed into by a buggy never ceases to make me laugh.

There's a definite learning curve to figuring out the controls. Playing the game, if you find public servers to be not your forte, you can make your scenarios and scenes with lots of flexibility. Scene creation is highly expansive as there are many options for you to choose from. The user has access to pathfinding, triggers, 'scripts', and all sorts of props and AI. The community has an overwhelmingly large amount of mods that can provide many different experiences."
10412,cum
10413,Excellent game. Shame the engine is so inefficient though.
10414,"The game play is realistic, but the missions are confusing because there aren't good descriptions about how to accomplish the objectives.  Overall a good choice if you're into simulation games that have a bit of a learning curve and can require extra googling to figure out."
10415,Pog
10416,good like game ride tank worknt
10417,the game is ok
10418,brill
10419,"This game, although its a older one, is lots of fun. I thought the campaign was dynamic and entertaining, and the multiplayer was a hit or miss, depending on the server. Overall I have very little complaints, and I highly enjoyed this game. Its worth the price."
10420,NICE GAME
10421,"Amazing game since it's introduction.  As a member of a large ""realism unit"", I was able to enjoy creating an ongoing campaign spanning nearly two years of real-time.  Current mods allow this to be done without much human interaction, allowing more game-play instead of game-setup.  Honestly, I miss creating missions by hand.  :-\"
10422,You need A hydra to run this game

10427,I play ArmA seriers for 13 years and I don't regret it . Shut up and take my money
10428,helicopter flying is cool
10429,yes arma 3 is a very good game if you are into misim or military games now the engine is kinda weird so there could be a few performance  but overall get it if its on sale if not be more carful
10430,good game yep.
10431,10/10 would run 10km to the AO only to be killed by a friendly UAV missile
10432,this game is awsome
10433,Amazing game. Realism
10434,"The game was made in 2013 and is still relevant, fun, and full of content. It's updated regularly and has plenty to explore. It is simple enough to play casually but if you want it to get intense and real it can do that as well, and with mods it can become a completely different experience. Could not recommended more to those sick of the standard Call Of Duty/Battlefield fast paced non-stop action first/third person shooters of today."
10435,it's ok i guess.
10436,bro its arma
10437,"Its fun to mess around with and have fun with friends or alone, just dont milsim here some people are serious losers from what ive seen in a few videos"
10438,yes
10439,"Bought before 2.0.

+ Realistic
+ Gigantic maps
+ Various online servers

- The game optimization is completely wrecked.

Final note: 8/10
If you like military simulation, Arma is perfect. Get ready for tactical suppression in villages, towns and in the open... at least if your rig can run it."
10440,.
10441,"If you love a good Milsim tactical adventure, arma 3 is the perfect game for you, the eden editor is my home for this game, I have over 100 hours in the editor and created plenty of operations to share with my beloved milsim mates, lots of enjoyment: bottom line : buy it"
10442,"Very complex game. Once you get the hang of it, it is super fun."
10443,cool  cool
10444,hello
10445,great game
10446,"If you want an realism based milsim Arma 3 is for you, it may be complex at first but Arma 3 has brought me countless of hours of entertainment. The unending amount of things to do with immersive and realistic experience leave the player awed at the level of detail this game has to offer. The flight and vehicle mechanics might not be the most accurate but it definitely makes it easy for a beginner to learn and get used to the controls."
10447,nice
10448,iz gud
10449,better
10450,"Never been pinned under fire, thankfully but in game the sense is quite realistic."
10451,wait i dont have this game anymore why can i review it
10452,.
10453,"its arma baby
"
10454,good game but I needed money so I refunded
10455,"pretty damn good, slightly frustrating game"
10456,Pretty much all my hours on this game have been spent crashing into people in Altis Life RP servers.
10457,its realistic

10518,"Task Force Spartan - SOF DEVGRU Semi-Milsim (EST)
Special Operations Task Force Spartan is made up of three military units which were selected by the unit creators. These units are as follows: 

DEVGRU Blue Squadron: This is the backbone of our unit, Blue Squadron is our main force for our operations, and where most of our recruits are transferred to. Their goal is to perform HVT captures, assassinations, recon, hostage rescue, counter terrorism, and much more. Blue Squadron will sometimes join with friendly forces and work together in order to secure any objectives given to them.

Black Squadron: In many ways similar to Blue Squadron, these guys are the best of the best. Comprised of our most highly talented members, Black Squadron are the first ones in, and the first ones out. These men operate secretly in the AO for special purposes that our Blue Squadron cannot complete.

160th SOAR: The 160th SOAR or Special Operations Air Regiment is responsible for all forms of air deployment for the other divisions. Not only are our pilots responsible for transport, but are also responsible for aerial drone reconnaissance to provide our ground forces with ISR or Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance. This is to help our units with extremely delicate missions such as hostage rescue or HVT takedowns. Last but not least, the 160th may be required to provide CAS in the form of a light attack helicopter or with a drone. We value our pilots greatly and always treat them with respect for their talented flying capabilities.

With each unit comes with unique training and tactics. We believe within TFS that this will bring some unique game-play to Arma with the diversity of our Arma Unit. Now, very much like joining any Arma unit, your division or military unit is not set in stone and you can transfer.


Training/Operation times: Friday and Saturday 2000 (8PM) EST

10525,Good game.
10526,When I bought this game I had a high interest in joining the military but after playing this and witnessing the slaughter first hand I have singed up straight away. I was so amazed that there's actual porn for this game and becoming the first trans soldier was my greatest aim in my life. After I have been to Vietnam and lost both my legs and arms I created a virtual computing system I could manipulate with my mind and become the ultimate Arma 3 warrior. I'm so amazed that I can play this game finally at solid 60 fps. I was never so proud of being not fucked on 30 fps in my real life. This is the future. This is the way.
10527,HAHAHA I KILL ALEC WITH MY BIG GUN AND ANDREW LAUGH LOL XDDDDDD

10560,balls
10561,"I have known about this game for a very long time but never had the opportunity to purchase it until it went on its sale. All I have to say is the game is amazing. Definitely on of my favorites. If you are into semi realistic/roleplay games this one is for you. It has the right balance of combat mixed with realistic downtime. The only thing that is a problem is the fact the game is almost unplayable due to the fact that you need the DLC for almost everything. However, you can purchase all the DLC and the base game for little over $40 bucks if i recall. Honestly a very good deal in my opinion. Other than the needed DLC to play and some bugs here and there, I love this game and recommend you give it a shot if you are curious, especially since it is on sale right now."

10579,I have One Hundred and a Half hours in ArmA 3.
10580,"Arma 3 is one of the top games on Steam by concurrent player count, despite being released years ago. It‚Äôs an open world, military sandbox shooter that gives you the reigns and allows you to play as you‚Äôd like.

Arma 3 aims to simulate real military combat, and it does so quite well. Using bullet trajectory simulation, tools like compasses, range finders, and scopes, all of the military devices and vehicles you can think of, and a massive map, Arma 3 is even used for military training simulations.

Unfortunately, the complexity of the game makes it incredibly demanding on gaming systems. Running Arma 3 is hard enough, and trying to do so while hosting an Arma 3 server on the same PC is pretty much impossible. This is especially the case if you‚Äôre hosting a large slot count server."
10581,Best game ive every played

10626,"i like this game in general but
i enjoyed it more when i played World War II workshop mod
called ""Eastern Front"" if anyone wants too try it out i highly recommend it
"
10627,"This game is perfect for being in an immersive combat experience in almost any setting, with or without mods."
10628,This game is something else
10629,yum
10630,warcrime simulator 2021
10631,"This game is really fun if you find a group of people that will help you get started. Also, mods and DLCs are very important to get the full gameplay experience out of ArmA 3."
10632,"Base game is a blast, but with mods....woah, boy. I'm glad I got all the DLC when I did. I had Arma 3 since Alpha. Unfortunately, back then I had a not so great computer and....game kept locking up, but once I got a better computer, much better frames, and I spent more time in the editor than anything just screwing around. I would definitely get the game and the DLC's during sales if you're interested. Latest CSLA DLC has some problems, but the only way the developer is going to get better is if you show them support - they'll keep updating it, I'm sure. 10/10 with mods. 8/10 without. AI and performance problems, mainly like others report. I've been playing the series since the first game. I am looking forward to later installments."
10633,Finally bought the steam version.
10634,"One of the best military sim/ sandbox games.






"
10635,"This is a very good MILSIM. Base game runs pretty smooth, really well done missions and really well designed games. I played one week of vanilla and then tried mods out. I find the mods to add quite a bit of expanded experience that works really well. I found a really good Discord to play Antistasi with a really good guy. I've ha a great time playing multiplayer and have found the NR6 mod to be really cool for creating firefights with the AI and found the game to be really well done."
10636,its alright
10637,best game please everyone buy this RIGHT NOW EVEN WITHOUT A DISCOUNT THE RP SERVERS ARE UNBELIEVABLE THIS IS CRAZY EXPERIENCE I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH GREAT CONTENT OPPORTUNITIES !!!!
10638,it is good
10639,"it goo

10640,"Before I played this I had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good"

At this point its beginning to feel outdated in terms of gameplay feel, and the performance has been and will always been atrocious regardless of your hardware (Engine CPU threading limitations), but there is no competing product on the market still!"

moving on, dababyland will be free for the people (for the most part) and will have a stable economy and mass exports dso the worlds will love us and our glorious dictator yode, who will be high on kentameen while he rules over his great nation.
we will leabe monco as a nation, infact we will give them nice for nice big burgir deals.

dababyland will enquire that many youths sighn their name in cursive font and privacy will be commited by removing the top falf of the writing to make the words a convirsatabile. moving on
look up the coldest place in the universu and go to imaged (on google) it's a funny haha (spoiler: nerf name for pig)

Left testical jokes aside, this is a solid 8/10 game.
There are somethings that I would change but that's personal preference.
I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it.

(P.S. this whole thing was written while I was re-installing the game.)"
10649,"A Great game with great mods and an amazing and welcoming community.
It might have somewhat of a learning curve but once your past it its a blast, whether your playing single player campaigns, scenarios or just messing with the Eden editor and Zeus, its difficult not to enjoy the engagements. while some campaign missions can have tedious objectives, all of them have their moments, and really immerse you into the war.

on the multiplayer front, you'll want to have a better PC if you play with mods and want to get above  30 fps but, if that's not a problem for you i highly recommend finding a Mil-sim unit (with the right vibe for you) and playing with them, while single player is fun it can't stack up to you and 10-100 friends all working together to complete dynamic objective set by a game master (Zeus)"
10650,"Fantastic game, two many memories on this game."
10651,been playing this game since before the actual release and gotta say its among my favorite games of all times. it has its quirks and steep learning curves but been playing the arma games since 2001 with the first game being operation flashpoint cold war crisis which is now known as arma x cold war rearmed i believe. but back on target i still to this day really enjoy this game and the modding community will keep this game alive for many more years to come even IF arma 4 gets made i believe arma 3 will still be going strong
10652,"Realism, Military, Multiplayer. What else can i ask for."
10653,you need to buy the dlc to have an enjoyable experience. the base game comes with one campaign story which is cool but if you want to play multiplayer it is necessary that you buy the ultimate edition bundle. i got this game for 10 dollars  on sale and got the dlc for 45 dollars so wait for a sale. if you want to get the base game and dlc without a sale in my country it is about 200 dollars
10654,"It keeps crashing. It said the game is running, but nothing is running on my screen."
10655,is gd
10656,"for starters, this game can be cool at times such as the roleplay but usually for me its extremely boring with all the travelling i would have really loved this game but the problem is, sometimes you can't call in vehicles which would've been really fckn cool, i don't know if there are servers for this but for some reason there are no civilians i like the game but for a military sim it's very strange, thats all but one more thing it is very boring i get that it's a sim and a sandbox but out of all the servers ive joined only 1 of them were kind of fun, overall the game is boring and the fighting is kinda trashy cause the ai sometimes stare at the wall so i think i will just stick to rainbow six siege for realism"
10657,good
10658,Good
10659,One of the best millitary simulators out there. If you want to get a feel of a real war and participate in the millitary operations without getting hurt this is the best game for you. ARMA has also a great 3D scanario editor which allows you to create any kind of battle scenario. 10/10.
10660,"One account bought all the dlc's non sale, put over 1000 hours and lost the account. This account bought all the dlcs non sale, going to put over 3000 hours into the game again, 10/10 would play again"
10661,really good game and the mods are nice
10662,fun
10663,I never could get the game to recognize my steam password so I can link accounts. So it never ran. Support says they can do nothing about it. So I refunded game. Yet another great experience on the steam site...
10664,it is good
10665,fgv
10666,"To say it simply: the opinions are rather mixed, but more positive.

On the plus side, it is a one-of-a-kind game (along with other Arma games on the series) with so much free-roam, sandbox capabilities. It's a game you can adapt to yourself to best possible extent, and a lot of things can be done here - starting with serious, as-realistic-as-possible milsims to complete sandbox, minigame experiences. Let's not forget, it's a military-themed game, and Bohemia is actually working on interactive projects that are used by literal f*cking militaries, so there's much to expect, and if you're looking for the game that has bot the realism and the endless capabilities, Arma's for you.

Now, the thing that catches one's attention when observing Arma is the finish of it. No other milsim game on the market has such a variety of weapons, vehicles, uniforms, terrains, and a lot of other aspects. Sure, the initial game may feel a tad bland at first, but as you start to acknowledge the full potential of Arma 3, it's more than enough. Although like 60 percent of content is DLC-based and not all high-end material within the game is accessible for free, you're paying quite a small price (if buying during sales) for a clean canvas for hundreds of thousands of community-made addons and mods, so, I guess, if you don't have 90 dollars just laying around for all the downloadable content to be bought, I believe it's still playable to full extent, as legendary mods like CUP series, ACE3, or RHS series got your back.

After discussing the contents of the game, it's worth to mention the actual mechanism of Arma 3. If someone asked whether Arma's a FPS, or a simulator, or a mislim, or a RPG, or whatever else, a clear answer couldn't be given, because Arma is all of that, and much more. However, what Arma is remarkable for is its campaign mode with about a dozen of possible story modes, a showcase mode with different aspects of the game given for the players to experience, and of course the mission maker, where all your imagination and strategies can be put into practice. To put it straight, if you're looking for a quick round to play (like playing an FPS), or looking for a straight-up day-long milsim, you can get all of that from Arma, as it's almost like several different games with all of that.

I could go on and on with the pluses, but I wish to leave it for the newcomers to discover themselves. I believe it's necessary to mention the hardships with the game. Those who come from older Arma games know how f*cking difficult it is to learn all the controls. Like, seriously, I doubt you could find a button on your keyboard that is not bound to some specific action in Arma. It will take a considerate amount of time to learn, but eventually it will work out on its own, without much thinking. The next thing is the bugginess. The game is quite old by now, about 7 or 8 years old at this point, if I'm not wrong, and it takes quite some time to catch all the bugs, software issues, and incompatibilities that raise from the game. The Bohemia team, especially recently, doesn't find much time to solve them as their focus now is the new gaming and simulation engine. In the end, you are remained to adapt your computer around the game, not the other way around, in order to make it work. Talking about the computer, despite having quite basic minimal requirements, you'll probably need more than that in order to have Arma run smoothly, not decently. The good, well-working CPU and GPU are a must, there should be quite some RAM with some to spare for hardware needs, and have a considerate amount of free space for all the addons you'll be downloading. Simply, Arma 3 is a demanding game, and if you wish to see the true potential of it, your grandmother's old 2005 Dell won't do the trick, sadly.

TL;DR: an extremely broad and interesting game with millions of capabilities that is enjoyable even without DLCs that is quite demanding in terms of hardware and sometimes bugs out. Worth the money and time, though.

10749,"When the game actually works, it's fun"
10750,"A really well-made Milsim game with a massive amount of mods and a very in-depth map editor for customizing everything, building a mission or AI battle or simply messing around in a sandbox. 

Bear in mind that most of the game's functions, such as tanks, helicopters and jets require you to have the official DLCs in order to be usable so always wait for a sale and get the Ultimate Edition so you can have all of the essential DLCs, and the game would also require a huge memory storage space and a good RAM as you would need many of the community-made mods in order to fully enjoy the experience."

I looked up how to resolve this, and every time I thought I fixed the issue, the game crashed again. I looked up multiple fixes, and the game still crashed. My PC is strong enough to handle everything, and I even lowered the graphics and all the settings. THE GAME STILL CRASHED! Was really looking forward to playing this game, but I can't get passed the first mission. Every single time it crashed! I do not recommend this game to anyone. Look online, there are multiple issues with this game, and a lot of people having this issue, with no fix. Gotta find a new shooter game."

Or maybe they don't like you're interested in using armor, and start to kick, flip and sling your vehicle you just drove 7.5km in.

10876,A nice milsim game
10877,"The graphics are quite nice in this compared to Arma 2, although still having it's limits, and i could pretty much run it at full settings without my (somewhat) low-end graphics card having problems with it.
My CPU was also only at 50-70%, so the game ran smoothly at a stable 10-20 FPS! How lovely.

So apart from the terrible optimization (i guess?) the game looked beautiful compared to Arma 2.
If you put the graphics to the max you can even see the small rocks on the ground rendered properly, in low detail, but they casted small shadows on the ground which looks very realistic.
The sun also lights up everything, especially when you look at it you have little to no chance shooting someone with sun in your eyes. It doesn't look as bland and boring as Arma 2 somewhat did.

And that's about it really, they do have new animations, although they look terrible.
Editor is the same, engine is the same, scripting is the same.

After playing the first mission for a little bit, just passing the checkpoint, it crashed the game.
And no, it didn't just crash the game, it was still there when i opened Task Manager, but only in the processes making me still lag.
It also reset my resolution to 1024x720, even though my game resolution was maxed, and i couldn't click on my taskbar.
Then i realized that the Task Manager said my RAM usage was at 0, and that it was chinese? It crashed shortly after, where i opened a new Task Manager which was completely fine.
I put my resolution back up to 1440x900, resulting in the taskbar becomming completely black, and all my icons to disappear from the desktop.

So i restarted Windows Explorer (explorer.exe), which didn't help much, so i just decided i had to restart my PC just because of this amazing(sarcasm) game, which is apparently 35 euros! And it doesn't add ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• new compared to Arma 2!
I know it's on a discount, but still owning Arma 2 which features just about everything this game has to offer, that's still bad.

I just sat there and watched windows saying ""Please Wait"" when i tried shutting down my PC.
So i had to force-shut it down, everything was alright when i started it up again though.

You can get everything i just mentioned for 35 euros, luckily i just tried it for free."
10878,PTSD and cornflakes. This is what I love.
10879,"Yes, it's very worth it. A must-have for any milsim enjoyer.
ArmA 3 (with mods) offers infinite replayability with a massive amount of content. You can probably recreate any 20th-21st century armed conflict in this game, since there's so many mods for everything. The game has its own flaws, so be prepared, but it's so much fun when you get everything right."

10896,"Extremely janky at times, but genuinely fun if you have friends or can make some friends playing it."
10897,"Arma 3 is a realistic military simulator which offers hours of fun and has tons of different scenarios you can play and complete. Arma 3 has a lively player base and has plenty of servers so you can find the perfect game. Arma 3 has great dlc which usually consist of vehicles or map expansions. Arma 3 already has 80+ vehicles ranging from air to land to sea and hundreds of weapons and attachments. Sadly though Arma 3 isn‚Äôt for the typical player. To properly enjoy Arma 3, you would have to like heavy simulation (like dcs) as there aren‚Äôt any arcade modes. Another bad thing is the AI. Arma 3‚Äôs ai is so good it can spot you from hundreds of meters away and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see them. It is also very easy to die and driving vehicles can be a pain at times. Overall, good military sim but could be slightly cheaper. 7/10"

10905,"ArmA 3 is easily one of, if not, the best shooters i've ever played. Despite the fact that it runs like hot steaming garbage, I have consistently had fun playing both the single player and multiplayer game modes, and it has single-handedly gotten me back into the FPS genre, and introduced me to a genre I find even more fun - MilSim.

ArmA 3's gunplay is at its core more interesting and developed than the typical FPS I tend to get my hands on. This is due to how methodical and slow the combat can be. Everything from look and feel to range and bullet physics is here, and it's awesome. Combat is so much more engaging when you can die in one or two hits, and you're keeping track of everything from fire rate to how many bullets are left in your particular mag. For a genre based solely on combat, this is a huge boon to be able to engage the player in real risk reward, tactical combat without feeling genuinely unfair. 

Which brings me to my second point - ArmA is NOT just combat. It's traversal, resource management, and in many cases intense problem solving. The AI reacts much how you'd expect real humans to (although not without their own faults and exploits), and the world is built with a level of care and detail rarely seen in the genre. 

Of Course, most people will be playing the game for multiplayer. You won't be finding much COD style team deathmatch here, but it's to its core most enjoyable throwing commands and working as a team to overcome your enemy. Laying down mortar fire on an outpost as your friends spot for you is never a dull experience, especially not when a squad of soldier rolls up on the mortar, and you're forced to engage a squad of enemies in a split second where one shot can end your whole operation.

For anyone who wants to play a realistic shooter, or experience an immersive, engaging game with a focus on player control (12 different stances and all that), I recommend ArmA wholeheartedly. An easy 9/10, despite some glaring issues with the game engine. I've yet to find a game like it in the genre(s)."

There is also a graphic bug, where you, if you look down you see your feets too big and it's too much zoomend in.
And as last point: i have bought Arma 3 about Steam and why ever the game has given my main character my REAL name and i cant change it, please change that!"

11052,"An amazing game, with it's highs and it's low. I would definitely call it the ultimate and king of role playing. Which conqueros many of the attributes which other programs such as fiveM and other role play game have. The experience of the role playing, due to the well organized servers and admins it creates a nice environment which makes it fair to play in and be part of. As I mentioned at the beginning this game does have some disadvantages, which in comparison to the advantages and the games functionality don't decrease playing scenerios. Some of the disadvantages which i found was the high utilization of hardware, making it really hard to get a really good performance with low end hardware. I also found that the physics were abit odd, creating funny and weird experiences but can be really annoying at times. The physics make it feel as if you're vulnerable at all times and most actions are some what delayed on multiplayer servers. By this I mean that in a role playing server and you crash into another car and defying all of newtans law your car could go flying and you be the one injured although u where at a lower speed than the person crashing into you. However, I am only experienced in the role playing side of things but that is also a small piece of the pie when it comes to the content in the game, there are so many other severs such as war gamemodes, battles, pvp and you can create any scenerios which u could ever thing of in single player. In conclusion, i would definitly recommend this game, especially when u have commited friends to play with as you will have a laugh, and feel rewarded after you complete a drug run successfully."
11053,Good Game but being Zeus in multiplayer scenarios is a pain
11054,meh
11055,"great for recreating historical conflicts and or hypothetical conflicts, but worthless without mods, thankfully the modding community delivers"
11056,I liked everything
11057,gud game
11058,"Im sure this game is great for the fans it has and is very impressive. I truly wish more games were like this. Issue is, this game is old. Like old old. The graphics dont automatically detect your hardware from what I can tell cause my first impressions were PS1 Hagrid levels of bad. However you can manually change that and it looks great. Some people report FPS issues which I didnt, your mileage may vary.
Now, the main issues that arent just annoyances are the 'campaign' and the multiplayer. The single player missions are pretty broken in places where changes have been made apparently, but when youre playing I can only describe it as like leading a group of monkeys into combat. Any mission that relies on the AI being competent is immediately gonna be hard or impossible. This is fair since Im a sucker for pain apparently and just keep trying but I cant honestly recommend most of the campaign. 
The multiplayer isnt the devs fault. This is a community that has lasted for years. Getting into this game now, for the first time will mean either playing with experienced friends that are willing to explain things (the ideal situation), bumbling through with some friends or alone or you can join a clan. Most of these clans have people that have been playing the game for years and know exactly what theyre doing. They also often have a long list of mods that they use that you will need to learn how to use and that will likely change between clans if you move. I have noticed that the people who run the clan are people who want to help and bring people in, but the average squaddie doesnt have time for you to be clueless. This has to be one of the least accepting community for new players I have come across. Personally, it feels like work to play this game with other people and I dont quite want the level of realism where I want to be paid a wage for turning up. 
Arma 4 may be a different story thanks to the influx of new players it will likely bring but if you dont already play Arma 3 I cant recommend you buy it"
11059,its meh
11060,"Ok so do you remember the arma 3 meme back when this released?
well... ive been looking for the perfect modern day fps and i thought id found it. but:
the graphics when people move and talk look like they belong in 2009 the way everything controls belongs back on the ps1.
fuck halo 1 controls so much better than this.
it has great depth but the execution is terrible. after 8 years i finally decided to throw myself in. i love games where i have to learn and do research but this isnt the right game. nothing makes sense and just expects you to know what to do (the drone mission) 
saving your game means nothing! it will revert to 3 missions earlier with no way to load into it. 
Seriously just DONT BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY. and this shouldnt be a free to play either. 
stick men would be a better choice because as far as the game plays - shooting at guys that disappear and reappear meters away- transports control like bricks on skates- and the fact you can fly helicopters and quad drones upside down-  the keyboard bindings are backwards and yes you can control using and control pad but you cant customise the layout from what ive tried.
just no. wait 5 years fuck off cod and battlefield and wait for the perfect game to be announced by some miracle"

11075,"I have almost 400h of playtime and I still wasn¬¥t online on a server. I think I played around 200h vanilla and then, about 100h ago I got my first mods. I decided to start playing online when I finally have all of the necessary DLCs, but I don¬¥t have money right now so I still need to wait... I look forward to playing online because it is one of the best games I know and probably one of my favourites. I hope that they will somewhen in the future fix a few bugs and make the AI better, but I am a patient person. 

Well.. for the ppl who have a bit of money and are interested in these kinds of milsim games I would definitely recommend it. The AI can make you angry and the physics are sometimes a little bit strange, but it¬¥s okey I think. It get¬¥s even more interesting with mods."
11076,realism at it's finest
11077,still worth it in 2021
11078,Tinnitus Simulator
11079,"Game is not that well optimized and will have troubles running on weaker PCs. The base game alone is boring, even with some of the DLCs. But to compensate the game offers a large selection of mods and addons from the community, which by now very impressed me. Made the game more fun to play, especially with friends. 

In the end, I would give the game 5/10, it's not too bad, but certainly not too good."
11080,Best played on the weekends. Some missions require time.
11081,should have been named LARP Simulator 3
11082,"Whenever I see a friend of mine buy Arma 3 one of two things tends to happen: Either they play it for 30 minutes and never touch it again, or they fall completely in the hole and spend hundreds and hundreds of hours on it. There's no in-between. If you're someone who is looking for an easily approachable shooter that you can just have a good time with out of the box, this is a decent game for that, but there are many better options out there. If you're someone who is interested and willing to put in the time to customize the game to what you're looking for spend time getting good at the challenging combat, then there is almost no better gaming experience out there. Arma 3 shouldn't be thought of as a ""game"" Arma 3 is a toolbox for which you can build or piece together the game you always wanted. If you can find a couple friends who are willing to share tat obsession for you, this becomes the ultimate ""game night"" game, where you can spend countless hours accomplishing your goals while chatting about the week. If you're someone who's comfortable with the workshop and making small tweaks to games to get what you want out of them, this is a no-brainer must buy, especially at the sale price it has once a month or so. You will find few better values in gaming. If you're just looking for an easy military style game to play, you'll have an okay time with it, but your attention is better directed elsewhere."

11121,"its just a really good game

11122,"This game is trully something else. There's nothing quite like crawling for 200 meters to the objective then immediately getting shot and dying, as your body falls and slams on the pavement like a bad of horse shit, you wonder what you could've done differently. That's the true Arma 3 experience.
Arma 3 is a game meant for ultra realistic simulation of combat. So realistic in fact that the U.S military has used it to run infantry drill training. That's what makes this game very interesting.
Arma is extremely expansive, even in plain vanilla you can still get sufficiently good enjoyment out of it, specially when it comes to multiplayer modes. The game's ballistics are top notch and the guns feel okay, nothing Call of Duty Modern Warfare, but good enough.
Much like Garry's Mod, this game shines through it's mods and communities. With varying degrees of seriousness, it can be a highly accurate Afghanistan U.S Army unit with actual veterans, or a goofy time in WW2. Doesn't matter, the fun is there.
The mods are true best part, and add soo much into this game. The first mod that is a must have is ACE3, simply put, the best mod around. And it is compatible with most popular mods too, you can completely convert your game into a WW2, Modern setting, Star Wars and even Halo if you're into that. 
Paired with mods, the Editor lets you make your own missions which you can use for anything, wanna try piloting a helicopter/plane? (good luck, prepare to crash, MULTIPLE TIMES.) want to make a skirmish to fight random enemies? Go for it dude. Want to make a very elaborate operation with multiple distinct units and objectives? That works too. 
The maps are also fucking enourmous, not much to add about 'em, go explore.
Now, this game has a few short comings. Even for good computers, performance might vary significantly, it is not very well optimized even for lower ghraphic settings. It also has many bugs that may one time be funny, or fuck everything up and be a pain in the ass. AI sometimes is absolute dogshit, others, it will kick your ass mercilessly, there's no in between.
Also, the mods are gi-fucking-gantic, I'm talking 3+ GB and the Arma launcher takes ages to download anything, doesn't matter your connection speed. So even though it says I got about 300 hours, most of those are waiting for mods to finish downloading. 
DLCs and other content is pretty fucking pricey, and some like Zeus or Apex are pretty necessary as most servers require 'em to work. So, yeah, be ready to dumb some cash at this. 
this game gets a 8.5/10 for me. It is very much worth buying, just know of it's short comings."
11123,Arma 3
11124,"This game isn't perfect, it will bug out sometimes or glitch you into a wall. Nevertheless this is a very fun game to play with friends, and is probably the best in its class at providing a mil-sim experience."
11125,Fun but requires time to play not an average fps its a milsim
11126,Arma 4
11127,Good Stuff.
11128,"At first it can get a little confusing and overwhelming but once you get the hang of it and play with some friends it is so much fun.  oh ya and also GET MODS, trust me they make the game more fun to play and less of a nuisance."
11129,jo det er flot du!
11130,just good
11131,very good
11132,One of the best simulators out there. The only downside I have to point is the poor game performance at times due to its old game engine.
11133,Best military simulator in my opinion.
11134,Amazing great but you need mods to have a even better game
11135,"Well seeing as its the Arma franchise's 20 yeah anniversary i should probs write a review. So here goes:

Pro's

The sheir amount of teamwork in this game is unrivaled. From just 1 squad working to capture 1 objective. Too a  commander making several squads + 2 transport helicopters and a tank platoon work together.

Its a sandbox combined with a FPS. This is great because you can make literally anything in this game. If you can script in this game then the sky is the limit.

The sheir amount of mods that have been built up over the years. For example want to play DCS but dont have the money? Just download a the F-18 super hornet with a almost fully modelled cockpit. Or the fully modelled Apache and Blackhawk. 

The game engine is a funny of its own. Ever wanted to kill a tank by sending it to the stratosphere? Well just grab a quad bike and go full speed ahead.

Most computers can run this game. Yes i said it i do not care about the FPS argument, just turn ur render distance down. Someone in the community that i play with uses a 5 year old school laptop to play the game and he can clutch with his machine gun like a god. The only thing that will be bad is ur frame rate and graphics but hey who needs frame rate, its Arma after all.


Cons:

Your experience in this game heavely depends on the community that you find. Do not go for one of the hardcore milsim units is my advice, go for one of the casual or semi realism units. These are usually the best. I myself have found a nice casual unit that is the most fun experience ive had in this game.

Its a large scale game wich can make new players feel quite lost at first.

If you want to have a heart attack then try to open the controls menu. Although all these controls can be nice for experienced players, for new players its the number 1 complaint. 

Good luck and have fun!

11136,With all the mods and servers. It's hard to get bored.

11152,"dll not found arma 3, FIX THE F*KING MISTAKE"
11153,"The Arma series(And its predecessor, the Operation Flashpoint series)are not tactical games: They are infantry and combat vehicle simulators. Totally focused on co-op games(either PVE or PVP) and tactics, the overall experience goes far beyond anything else in the first person tactical shooter genre. The outstanding work done by both Bohemia Interactive and the Modder/Designer community keeps this 2013 release fully up to date. Be it mods or Creator DLCs(I¬¥m absolutely hooked to SOG: Prairie fire at the  moment) the quantity and quality of content available for this game is almost limitless. The scope of the game is still one of the largest on the market with hundreds of square mile-long maps, tons of weapons, vehicles and editable objects ensure hundreds or even thousands of hours of playing, providing Arma 3 with one of the longest shelf-life in the gaming market. An absolute must play if you like no bs military simulation computer games. 

The only drawbacks are the outdated AI(getting stuck everywhere, being complete killer bots or useless moving targets with little in-between ground) and some textures ""swallowing up"" dropped items. Apart from that, the game is awesome."
11154,"Let me start off by saying that I love this game, but that doesn't mean that if doesn't infuriate me. For the most part, the movement is straight forward with no issues, but then you'll be trying to get to an overwatch position and get launched into the air. You will spend a lot of time in this game as long as you have friends that enjoy it too. Most of my time has been playing the Antistasi mods with my buddies. If you enjoy modded play, this game is a great choice. Just don't pay full price."
11155,gud
11156,"I have alot to say about this game but i will keep it short. Arma 3 is my favorite game ever,it is very realistic with amazing scale and a great milsim community.The modding is amazing and it has kept me occupied for hundreds of hours and will keep me occupied for 100s more.10/10"
11157,Yes.
11158,Some rounds can be fun but with that being said most lobbies i played were full of people who were just a little to much into the mil-sim side of it. Wanting yes sir no sir like proper armies. If your a casual gamer like me this isnt fun. If you have time to be hardcore then it could be alot of fun.

What makes arma fun is so much more than the game alone. I see the game as a catalyst to everything that happens around it. The most important feature in this game are the communities. I have met some of the bst friends I have from this game. I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone that wants to meet some cool people and genuenly have fun with military simulations.

11170,Good shit ngl
11171,This game has a lot of potential. The big killer for this game was the enemy a.i. They spot you from a mile away even if you are crouched and moving slow. They shoot with pin point accuracy and will hit you even if taking cover behind rocks. They don't even take time to work out where the shot came from or take cover. They just turn on the spot and start shooting straight at you. If the a.i was fixed then I would give this a go again in the future.

11179,"Once you take the time to get use to the controls, and customise them to your liking the game is absolutely amazing! It could use some optimisation, but the only game that rivals your freedom of movement in Arma is Tarkov. Escape from Tarkov is too much of an MMORPG for me to enjoy lately, and the armour system needs some work, but that's where Arma fits in. Something realistic with a good movement system. I have only played singleplayer content so far, but the squad mechanic is very good. Reminds me of Operation Flashpoint. Also, do recommend the Vietnam DLC"

11184,Best and only war simulator! Since ages.
11185,So good
11186,realistic
11187,aesome gameplay
11188,Great military role-play game or other game modes if you would want to play that either way it's way better than squad.
11189,gg
11190,i shot a dog
11191,Yes
11192,realistic
11193,good sound of bullets passing by
11194,d
11195,Really fun. Recommend the game.
11196,"i have an addiction to energy drinks, pizza, and flying helicopters in arma 3"
11197,it's the community that keeps me play this game. You will find many new friends or you can take your friends to play together. I recommend you to buy this game especially when on sale. DLC is not a must if you want to play only MP. Mods by community is enough imo.
11198,"you will play this game for 60-100 hours, not touch it for a bit, and come back to a list of mods and modes that are so extensive they almost sound fake, modern warfare, vietnam, aliens, covert ops, spec ops, gaming clans, and such an active community for such an old game. server hosting is easy af, and its a great game overall. a little clunkly at times, arma can make a night or break a night, when doing anything from coop missions to antistasi you will commit weeks of your life to this game, and not even realise it. almost endless entertainment, ARMA is a complete experience that, while clunky at times, is a must have for any steam users library, but pro tip, dont pay full price, it goes on sale all the time"
11199,Mil sim with a-10 go brrrrrrrrrr
11200,I finally made the switch from console to PC and this was one of the first games I purchased.. And its alot of fun between the mods and the vanilla game its just an all around blast and definitely worth a buy ..
11201,"An amazing game if you have a friends, or a group to play with. Highly recommended if you are looking for a MilSim experience."
11202,gun go pew pew
11203,Very Fun with editor
11204,Realizm !!
11205,"The players are assholes, the controlls are worse, but if you ever manage to get into a proper milsim and you dont have to wait 8 hours to be deployed this game can be kinda fun."
11206,"Played the game for a while, game is big. Game is not the type of game I can see myself enjoying in the long term.

5/10, I can see why some people absolutely adore this game, but if you enjoy gameplay of shooting and flying rather than slow movement and a lot of walking this may not be the best game for you."
11207,.
11208,after 3713.3 hours i wanna say i love this game and i hate people who cheat on this game..
11209,good game
11210,"A great game design, works perfectly and really enjoyable, but i want to say that if you want to delete a mod, you'll have to wander into the files and delete them"
11211,"To be completely honest i'm not exactly sure what i'm supposed to be doing, and the game runs bad in cities.
The graphics look nice, and I got it on sale.
The game seems fun, i will try to learn it eventually"
11212,If you like milsim this game is probably for you.
11213,Easily one of the best games of all time
11214,beautiful piece of s h i t
11215,best war simulator ever made
11216,fd
11217,i really liked this game it is the most realistic game i have ever played i recommend this game to everyone.
11218,i enjoy the realism and yet the fun goofiness you can get from it.
11219,"This game has violated me so much, I am starting to mistake it for love."
11220,fun with frends
11221,"Arma 3 isn't a game.
There are several reasons why people say that expression sums it up.

First, the game is intended to be a military simulation, the game offers a great deal of missions and scenarios that need to be executed with military precision to be successful.
It covers most if not all specific weapons in a modern army. The game modes on a single player level train you for the multiplayer game where all that exercise can be put into action for a more challenging opponent.

Second reason, Arma in its ambitious goals to be a milsim, created a platform where players can create more content in-game and/or dive into the huge mod community.
Here the game opens up and gives most players the main reason to play arma for a prolonged if perhaps interrupted time. It kept and still keeps giving us amazing new game modes that have sometimes even have been developed by third partys (palyers)  into standalone variants like DayZ, PlayerUnknownBattlegrounds and several others. 

Last reason why arma isn't a game, Arma isn't just ""a"" game.
And why I've kept coming back to arma and finding new ways of enjoying it.
As a veteran player and a terribly bad shot, I still have a tremendous amount of fun. Where in other games secondary tasks in the army can fall behind in satisfaction, arma shines in offering essential roles in tactics and vehicles.
However you enjoy your arma is up to you."

11229,"love it the community is very nice so far
"
11230,"goof mechanics, don't expect good fps in multiplayer tho"
11231,Love the immersive gameplay.
11232,Very fun and tons of guns. Get your war on!
11233,"pretty good game - runs like absolute dogshit no matter ur specs because of the engine, if u wanna play those multiplayer events youll mostly get around 30 fps max. no overheating though, and great community. would recommend buying on sale for 11 dollars, but get apex edition - not having apex gets annoying quickly."

Here to recommend this game purely for the ANTISTASI mods from the workshop, amazing on multiplayer!

11257,Trash
11258,"I'd really love to play this game in full, but I can't get into any DLC's that I bought, they are installed, but when I click on say ""karts"" which I own, I can only try before I buy."
11259,"By far one of the best near-future mil-sims that I use for LITERALLY anything else. Things like:
-Bombing civilian targets with nuclear ordinance
-Commanding columns of Leopard 2A7s against entrenched communists and their T-34s
-War crimes
-Using Han Solo's blaster to defend Polish resistance against Modern Russian infantry
-Pretending to be a civilian about to be bombed by nuclear ordinance
-More war crimes
-Shooting medics on the beaches of Normandy with a 12x7mm anti-materiel rifle
-Overthrowing occupying NATO forces
-Engaging enemy infantry with hollowpoint and explosive incendiary ammunition
-BBQing any and all ground targets with a flamethrower
-Did I mention the part about violating the Geneva Convention and ultimately disregarding the laws of war entirely, all without consequence?

tl;dr If you want to savage crimes against humanity in a safe digital environment, I'd definitely consider Arma 3

11340,"Arma is a Game you'll find yourself slip into before you even really get into it.  Finding a group to play enhances the game ten fold and with modding for every era of war from the Zulus to Warhammer 40K you'll be hard pressed to not find an era you enjoy playing in and a group that plays solely in that area.  Groups can range from a few friends messing around to entire platoons of players doing map wide operations and combined arms.

11366,good game
11367,"Very good and there are mods that make the singleplayer experience really enjoyable (Dynamic Ops/Combat). So if you're worried about needing to play online, don't! 


The game honestly isn't as complicated as people make it out to be. Like sure it's more complicated than the average shooter, but you'll get used to it after a short while."
11368,"It's pretty fun with mods and friends. Vanilla is meh. AI see you through trees and the dark, but sometimes they don't. Directing friendly AI is annoying. Vehicles are made of aluminum foil or titanium depending on how you roll. Sometimes ground vehicles go to space. But it's still fun. You just need someone to show you how to play."

Plenty of laughs, and fun times. However, the game doesn't run well on quite frankly - any system. That's just the nature of the Arma games, but you don't play them for the performance. You play them for the experience it delivers with many different servers and aspects to the game."

Now im waiting for Arma 4 becuse when Arma 3 came out it was ground breaking for maps size and Sandbox element! many thx to the devs for making this game a fun experiense.

Only negative i have to say about this game is engine is not very optimized and can cause a headacke to get better performance."

11393,"great game to make it your own story, as well as memories with friends!!!"
11394,"Overall Score:   6.5/10
This game will run at 20FPS and you will like it. Apart from that it's a pretty good war crime simulator. You can definitely feel that it's getting on in its years though and the physics are as stable as a depressed crackhead going on a bender with five pocket knives in his hands. Unless you're good with handling all its kinks just get Squad or something tbh, maybe come back when Arma 4 comes out if it ever does.

Positive(s):
+++  It's Arma baby
++  Notable workshop/modding community
++  Varied community that can cater to your rp/casual preferences
+    The jank is part of the experience tbh
+    [Obligatory war crime joke]

Negative(s):
--  Better get some friends and a lot of them, 'cause playing solo is madness and playing with randos is a about what you'd expect
--  Hope you like a good ol' kraken every now and then
--  Loading times are notable if you don't have it on an SSD, and god forbid you don't have space for the game AND the mods on it
-    You can still use equipment and vehicles that are from DLC's you don't own, you just regularly get a screen-wide watermark that obscures your vision and is very distracting. Not good for ops or anything that demand stuff from DLCs you don't have
-    If I get friendly fired one more f***ing time-"

11401,"It's come a long way from where it began. Much easier on system resources V. earlier. Though, it still has quite a way to go. It's fun, in depth and offers a little something for everyone. It can be (with mods) as easy or difficult as you wish. All in all I'd rate it a 8 out of 10. definitely worth the purchase, even at full price although I'd strongly advise you to purchase the base game with all DLC for the most complete experience possible."

I have never spent so much money on a game i haven't actually played before buying it (around 120$) and ive never resented any of those decisions. 5/5 -a rare perfect game."

I keep dumping hours into this game learning new things everytime I play. Whether it's how to command a tank squad, properly take off from a runway, or how to accurately use AA, there's something new waiting for me. I've begun using it for photography as well, and already have a folder dedicated to exactly that. I'm still learning on the mission making side of things, and I cannot wait to see what cool missions I can make with this games amazing editor mode. I definitely recommend this to someone who enjoys the milsim sandbox experience and wants to get away from the Battlefield style game that seems to be everywhere these days"

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ[b]Gameplay[/b]
‚ÄÉTo start off, my gameplay is based off of hours
‚ÄÉand hours of clan operations.
‚ÄÉMost of the missions that I've played we're
‚ÄÉimmersive, realistic and long. Like in any long op,
‚ÄÉThere will be alot of pass-time, which isn't such a
‚ÄÉbig of a deal as it adds to the immersion. And non-
‚ÄÉstop combat isn't realistic either. I performed
‚ÄÉdefences, attacks, recons, convoys, patrols,
‚ÄÉbomb defusals, medevacs, and just a lot.
‚ÄÉThere is really a lot in terms of gameplay and
‚ÄÉit lies in the hands of your mission maker and
‚ÄÉmod list to shape your gameplay. For example,
‚ÄÉModern day op's are different than Warhammer 
‚ÄÉones, however the realism and immersion still stays.

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ[b]Gunplay[/b]
‚ÄÉThe gunplay is like stated before is realistic.
‚ÄÉIt sometimes feels like recoil is absent, but
‚ÄÉwhen you try to attack distant enemies it becomes
‚ÄÉhard. The stamina system has a very large impact
‚ÄÉon your weapon sway and may make it hard to take
‚ÄÉprecise shots, requiring you to take short stops, or
‚ÄÉnot run like a bloody monkey all the damn time.
‚ÄÉIt defnitely doesn't feel immersive from te get go,
‚ÄÉbut mods can help you achieve some immersion.
‚ÄÉAlso, rifles aren't your only means of weapons.
‚ÄÉYou've got AA and AT launchers, stationary
‚ÄÉhigh-calibre weaponries, vehicle armaments,
‚ÄÉmines, IEDs, bombs, traps, grenades, glowsticks
‚ÄÉeven. And even more with mods. Basically Arma
‚ÄÉwon't make your pants fall off like in Tarkov, but
‚ÄÉit still works well, and can quite be the experience
‚ÄÉwhen you use certain mods.

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ[b]Features[/b]
‚ÄÉIn the base game there is already plenty to do.
‚ÄÉIt's basically a military sandbox simulator, allowing
‚ÄÉyou to do basically anything. Stealth ops, Night ops,
‚ÄÉConvoys, trainings, full on battles, armoured
‚ÄÉcombat, naval combat, air combat, recon ops.
‚ÄÉAlmost everyting is achievable, the tools are here
‚ÄÉfor you, but you have to learn to use them.
‚ÄÉMods also add more features, more equipment,
‚ÄÉmore everything. The possibilities are truly endless.
‚ÄÉThere is something here for everyone and every
‚ÄÉsingle piece of that is given equal amount of love
‚ÄÉfrom the devs.

‚ÄÉThe graphics are quite mediocre, they work, but
‚ÄÉare aged. The game is quite old, so graphics aren't
‚ÄÉa huge factor anymore, considering how the game
‚ÄÉcompensates in immersion and fun.
‚ÄÉYou can definitely make the game look great, but
‚ÄÉthe engine has it's limitations.

‚ÄÉNow, this is a major problem of Arma 3, it sucks.
‚ÄÉThere are times when you may get good fps during
‚ÄÉmissions, but my clan isn't quite the lucky ones.
‚ÄÉEnjoying missions at 30-40 fps, or even less during
‚ÄÉfights is the standard. It definitely needs
‚ÄÉimprovement, better so, a new engine. DayZ
‚ÄÉproved that a new engine would help a lot.

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ[b]Price[/b]
‚ÄÉThe game itself, has a reasonable price, but the
‚ÄÉway they implemented DLCs is a joke. You get
‚ÄÉtaunted every time to get these DLCs in-game
‚ÄÉand some are even required to use simple things,
‚ÄÉlike vehicles that you already can see and spawn.
‚ÄÉYou can use the gear and weapons though, but
‚ÄÉyou'll have to enjoy a watermark quite often that
‚ÄÉoccupies your entire screen. Basically if you don't
‚ÄÉown the DLCs, the majority of them is dead weight.

11516,"A very fun game with a strong community, campaign and gameplay. Its definitely something for people who enjoy that Milsim feel or who those who enjoy an online or solo experience. Add in mods and you can even enjoy playing in WW2 or even WH40k"

11561,its a good game
11562,"SOG Prairie Fire is an amazing time.  The learning curve is a bit steep, but well worth it and some completely badass visuals at times.  Very fun and unique."
11563,"One of the best game's of all time. A little hard to unserstand at first but after you fuck up enough times (crashing vehicles, not knowing hotkeys, Tking, etc.) The very vocal community will express to you how to correct yourself in true Arma fashion. Amazing game with many different game types, this  is a must buy for anyone with steam."

11571,"base game is still good, but it is alot better with mods and other people."
11572,good
11573,"Its a solid game, Sadly almost the entire community is super toxic and/or super racist. this tends to put a damper on the game no matter what kind of server you join. the single player and actual gameplay aspects however are very well done, and the ballistics are good. But sadly like i said before the community kind of ruin this game."
11574,the game is lots of fun
11575,Shooty Gun Game Good
11576,With the new SOG Prarie Fire dlc it plays like a new game. I'm really enjoying it.
11577,"Horrible paywall simulator with terribly coded AI. Not only that, but the campaigns are literally painful also with little to none even existing as if any were that interesting. And the controls are more than unnecessary and garbage. Really don't know what they were thinking. 

Ontop of that, some of the controls don't even work. Especially the one to hold a sniper steady, and the devs had the nerve to not include any good harmless features for no good reason. (Shooting from ATV, jumping etc.)

There's way more to this, and its all extremely sad to the point where literally sandbox mode is the only fun you'll get out of a ""Military Simulator""."
11578,"yes
"
11579,it is a very good game ive played it for years i aspeshaly love that you can run mods
11580,come on then greece put them up (‡∏á Õ†¬∞ ÕüŸÑÕú Õ°¬∞)‡∏á
11581,"Good game, a little complicated, but worth the time to pick it up"
11582,"1 of the best relistic shooters i have played
sad thing is that there arent any popular servers in asia esp subcontinent where i am from , i would give it a 8/10 tbh because of some things
fun gamemodes are like coop,sandbox,survival and warlords (  which are kinda my favs some i havent tried yet but i have seen like survival)
welp thing is would i recommend it rn to buy
if you are middle class or rich buy it but i wouldnt recomend this to poor people 
i myself are semi rich"

11607,It's fun once you get used to the controls. I haven't even scratched the surface of this game due to me being a new PC gamer.
11608,"Arma 3 is by far one of the best games I've played. It is like the military version of Garry's Mod, The modding Community is so great and massive for Arma 3 that if it isn't in the game already you can bet that it will be made eventually. While the game was released in 2013 it still holds up and the Creator DLC definitely brings new life to it, (Unless some Creator DLCs aren't good like CSLA Iron Curtain). I'm looking forward to seeing how Arma 4 will be and hopefully will continue the legacy of Arma 3."
11609,Great game

11624,"Arma 3 is the piece de resistance of milsims, from the incredible detail of the maps, vehicles, and weapons to the incredible customization with mods and DLCs. The gameplay takes a while to get used to, since it's not like any other military shooter, there's full radio and squad commands, a day and night cycle, and a weather system, there's a variety of boats, planes, and tanks, and cars to use along with dozens of weapons in the base game, but with modifications you can get even more. Overall, Arma 3 is among some of the best games ever made."

11632,"Dude, it's Arma. First Steam game I bought after Garry's mod."
11633,"This game made be ancient, but it still is the best in class for milsims. The graphics are dated, and the physics are janky but the game play is top of the line and makes up for all of that. The DLC more than makes up for the age of the game adding all kinds of new content and features. I would highly recommend picking up this game and its DLCs once they are one sale as it is more than wort the money at sale price!"

11639,Very in depth military simulator. It is great if you have the time to learn how to play.
11640,"fair decent game, ""Tactical"" is a loose term with it though"
11641,"Even after almost 8 years since release this is still the king amongst army related shooters. With plenty of mods, a variety of game modes and perhaps the best ""make your own mission"" toolkit this game still have plenty to offer. But its is getting more and dated. Plenty of bugs, broken netcode, stairs and ladders are deathtraps, AI that have superaim and still bounce into walls - but I have adapted to this fact, and I still, after close to 8 years, immensely enjoy this game.

I still recommend this game to anyone interested in these type of games.

But I feel it is time for something new BI. Give us Arma 4 with an updated game engine, stairs that not kill you etc."
11642,Massive replayability
11643,awdefdghjk.
11644,gg
11645,"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a game this much. For a second I thought I was losing my edge, I just needed a different experience."
11646,"many many fun make sure you get mods tho, just make sure your computer dont explode"
11647,"I bought this game about 2 years ago, and maybe played it for a grand total of 30 minutes.  The game just seemed overwhelming jumping straight into multiplayer servers.  I watched several videos over the 2 years since I purchased the game that made it look amazing, so I decided to give it another go.

I ran through the tutorial and campaign, and by the time I started multiplayer, I had a much better grasp of what to do.  It's also important to direct your play style toward your preferences, there are several variations of PvE and PvP, with all kinds of scenarios to play out in them.

The players I've encountered so far range across a broad spectrum, of course.  Even the most meme worthy trolls still usually prove helpful though, allowing you to properly play the game while they tell you how they slept with your mother.  The bulk of the community really has been fairly good, though.

I started out with just the base game, I played using that steadily for 2 weeks.  The mods went on sale about 2 weeks into me seriously playing, and I didn't hesitate to buy them up.  Note, the base game is worth the price as it stands, however I would NOT pay full price for all of the add ons; you also run into quite a few restrictions in game if you don't have at least the Apex expansion, your weapons and vehicle access are handicapped.

If you want to play a mil-sim that's probably not as daunting as it may seem, I would recommend Arma 3.  If you want something beyond the run-n-gun style of games like CoD or the Battlefield series, I would recommend Arma 3.  If you want to buy a game with all the features included without paying out the ass for expansions, I would not recommend Arma 3."
11648,"great game, lots of fun. if you have a slightly older/shittier AMD cpu you probably can't run this game so if you have intel you are fine but if you have ryzen good luck."
11649,"From vanilla to Star Wars to Halo. This game has mods and a community for everyone, controls are a bit weird at first but with a little time put in they become easy and shouldn't be a put off. Find a community that fits your style and you'll sink hours in."

11693,Fun when playing with friends
11694,cool
11695,good game
11696,I doubt there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said about this game. I think it's one of the best games of all time. There's so much content for this game you could only play this for literally the rest of your life and not get bored. Not to mention the enormous modding scene and missions on the Steam Workshop. $30 is a bargain.
11697,Honestly I had been waiting 8 whole years to play. as soon as I had a PC strong enough to run it and it was on sale (just in time) I picked it up and put 123 hours on it in less then a week. Love it <3
11698,nice
11699,its a terribly great game. the bugs and glitches and freedom all pool together to make it an experience worth having.

11702,I find it a little enjoyable.
11703,Its pretty good.

11727,fun
11728,ummmm Realistic U SHOULD BUY THE HELI AND JET DLC WITHOUT THEM GAME IS PRETTY BORING
11729,"yooooooooo
"
11730,"Xtremely good game to play especially the campaign and the eden editing mode.
Very realsistic makes it more fun.
9.5/10 overall"
11731,"Good but some things to note.
-Lots of keybinds, but not to hard to master as only a small group are 100% needed.
-DLC is all very good and often times cheap when on sale.
-Good game modded, but mods are fantastic and needed for higher play.
-Multiplayer is awful unless you are skilled, very patient, or have a group of people (unit) to play with.
-Game functions well, but expect your fair share of bugs considering how many interactions this game has.
-Learning curve is... odd to say the least, with so many sections to master.
-Hearing from other players, joining some form of community and simply playing is the best way to enjoy this game.

TLDR. Game is fun but has poor learning curve. Mods are a must have to experience fully. Join a community."
11732,This game rockssss
11733,this game is one of a kind.
11734,"boring game,half of the time you are just finding a game, then trying to find players,end up getting killed from 1km away ,dont buy, if you do ,my fav keybinds are alt+f4"
11735,I have 24 hours in this game yet I feel like I did nothing in it lol
11736,Yes
11737,"I love this game and i think It has not aged the best, but is one of the most special in gaming"
11738,"Its pretty good
"
11739,pee pee water

11749,Fun
11750,A must have game
11751,"Farted on the radio, got a airstrike called on me. Fuck this game!"
11752,"How can you not love Arma? The only downside I can think of is the performance/fps if you dont have a decent rig. Otherwise, Arma is beautiful. And with mods, the possibilities are endless. There are community made maps, weapons, vehicles, planes and heli's, and much more!"
11753,Absolutely love it. Wish I started playing it years ago yet it still feels ahead of its time.
11754,RealTime War Simulation. <3 Love it!!
11755,"Realistic war simulator, bit old but still good"
11756,yh
11757,Very good game
11758,Honestly don't know why I slept on this game for the longest time. I have finally found a community to play with and have found one of my new favorite games. I will probably find myself sinking hours and hours into this gritty milsim we all call Arma 3.
11759,"This is  a Mil-Sim,Spec-Ops and a Soldier's wet dream, Amazing Community,I would 100% recommend this fun game!"
11760,Arma is Arma

11771,"Arma 3 is an extremely versatile game capturing the audience of a variety of type of players.  The DLC's and mods make the game last in the years.  Although, we are sure ready for the next one!"
11772,"I have sunk almost 2000 hours into Arma 3. Would I suggest buying it at this point, in 2021? No.... 

Wait for Arma 4. Multiplayer runs so poorly on this system, I have a 3080 RTX and a 10900k and I get about 30 FPS on multiplayer sessions. Like I said, just wait for Arma 4, save your money. I loved Arma 3 for many years, but it is getting super dated anymore and is not fun."

I tried joining some server an this mega virgin glasses wearing braces having 33 year old shitter started screaming at me because I broke rp rules. Like bro, its war I do what I want pussy. So yeah this game really needs you to grind to have fun. You also need to have never gotten your dick touched to own an rp server."

11782,Best shit ever love this game!!!!!
11783,"This game by a long shot is the best $30 ever spent on a game! the content is endless. If your contemplating purchasing this game just do it and you will not regret it. the servers sometimes lag and have multiple bugs. But the support and the community is fantastic. From PVP, PVE, and to even role play server. You can build your own scenarios , missions, maps and overall have a wonderful time on this game. Overall the most amount of content a game can have for the price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
11784,yes
11785,"Even if you play till you get burnt out, give it two weeks and you'll be back again, like a crack addiction out of control."
11786,"I got sniped with a LMG from 500m away, while prone, in a field, behind a bush, wearing a ghillie suit. 10/10 would recommend"
11787,"Arma 3, sometimes you'll love it, sometimes you'll hate it. The bugs and glitches might annoy you to hell and back, but the people you will meet here will be amazing. The community mods are even better, and each minute spent in this game will be worth it.
If you're thinking of getting this game, make sure to get the Apex DLC at the very least, and check out the Ahoyworld Arma community (their website and discord)."

11794,"Great fun, really realistic, grenades ACTUALLY work like they should, unlike in most games (fragmentation). 
ALL vehicles have realistic physics, and frequently take training to use properly, which adds to realism.
Besides the cool stuff, there's always plenty of shenanigans and frequent funny.
(if you don't have a good pc though you're focked)"
11795,OK
11796,"amazing immersive game
"
11797,"needs dlc and mods to be fun, its okay"
11798,"Its *ARMA* 

A completely unique military sandbox. An endless variety of ways to make your own fun.

The total opposite of the modern AAA industry video game.

A must play. Just a must."
11799,good
11800,"I discovered the game recently and it's awesome simulation. All the details, all the interaction and total inmersion on the game. As a airsoft player and shooter games player I appreciate the realism of the mechanics of this game. The Workshop content is awesome thanks to all developers and players for make this game big."
11801,"Incredible game, my only 1 wish is that those fresh af ships could move more easier - would be nice to have a moving ship base for sandbox."
11802,its good
11803,GOOD
11804,"DONT BUY unless you have a group to do modded stuff with, its not a game you can buy and join a game, rank up, and find different maps. its not like squad or hll, movement is sooooo clunky feels like you are moving your  character based on two strings like a puppet. the control diversity is nice to an extent but getting into a vehicle is a different button than getting out. seems like you need to click 5 different things just to lay down and fall inside a rock or get your bipod to not. work. and worst of all is you spend 90% of your time waiting at base for a heli to fly you there just to have it crash 95% of the time before every shooting your gun. it just sucks"
11805,Best game
11806,"Most realistic military game you can play, and the mods make it even more better and immersive."
11807,"verry epic join milsim clan for maximum splendidness
"
11808,"Why are you still reading reviews instead of playing it. Even in 2021, if milsim is anything you like even remotely, it is a must have. Also: mods are key to a better game. Go and check out the bigger mod packs, Robert Hammer Weapons, units, whatever, tons of maps and whatnot - you will have endless fun. 

Do however expect a game that is both beautiful and by today's standards old. You will notice, but still like it. 

Good luck."
11809,"if you play this, im sorry"
11810,really hard to get into but its worth it
11811,fun game to get into bit hard still trying to get the ropes but is still fun with friends
11812,Best play with friends and groups plus the 7 years of Workshop made by the Community.
11813,love it
11814,loving it
11815,"if you don't have 40+ mods loaded in when you play this game, you ain't playing it right"
11816,"FUCKING TERRIBLE SERVERS ARE PEOPLE WITH HIGH POWERED AUTISMO RIFLES FUCKING FUCK YOURSELF FUCKING STEAM AND ARMA DEVS THIS GAME SUCKS MEGA MEGA FUCKING AAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLEEEEEE
"
11817,very good yes
11818,I fucking hate rocket league
11819,Good game. Recomand this game
11820,would recommend 9/10
11821,VERY EMERSIVE
11822,"Sucks fart, c*m and a little bit of balls. Games dying, its been 7 years. Good luck finding anything populated that isn't KOTH, Altis Life, Exile or private MIlSim servers. Spoiler 4/4 of those game modes are like sucking up a piece of ice that seems suspiciously like a spider up your straw. It makes you wonder why you even play the damn game when you either have RDM'ers, FailRPs or sweats on Altis life, hyper militarized Exile with zero survival elements, KOTH where its 30 dudes with 10k hours stacked on opfor, or lastly big for their britches MIlSim gobblers who failed JROTC and decided the next best thing was powertripping on a dutch basket weaving simulator. Buy it if your friends don't f*cking suck and don't play with you, making missions is fun when you have 4 or 5 people willing to play them, but if you want a good solid, healthy game, go play Minecraft, let this game finally fall into a medically induced coma with that delightful old person smell. Bohemia, give us ARMA 4 i beg you, mix in ACE, RHS and some better AI/Gunplay and I will rim you."

11852,"I accidentally got sucked into the world of Arma 3 and now I can't stop.

This game has too much. You have too many options in terms of weapons, vehicles, locations, factions, and the list goes on. If you have any interest in virtually any aspect of military sim, then this game has it, I promise.

(+)I spend most of my time in the Eden Editor which gives you the ability to create your own wartime scenarios. From dogfights to hillside ambushes, you can make it all. Maybe one day I will actually upload something I make but for now its all in good fun.

(+)The multiplayer is what I feel most people come for when it comes to Arma 3. Playing with a squad of friends definitly is the best way to experience what Arma 3 has to offer, but you can still rely on the community to play a fair game and that leads me to my next point. 

(+)The community is one of the best I have ever encountered. I don't know what others have experienced, but I was quite surprised at how helpful and fair the majority of my encounters with randoms have been. This to me is a huge plus.

(-)This game has its negatives however. Graphics, for start, have the ability to look ""pretty"" from afar or in some situations, but overall, the game looks dated (but you have to remember that IT IS DATED). I wouldn't have much of a problem with it but the issue I do hold against Arma 3 in regards to graphics is that the game runs like shit. This game is notorious for the god awful frame rates and this really holds true once you get into large scale battles. I have a pretty good rig and I usually hold 60-80 FPS out of combat, 40-60 in combat, and anywhere from 10-40 in very large scale scenarios. This is unfortunately a reality many of us Arma users have to face. To give you an idea, I have seen a $1650 computer run this game and only go below 60 FPS in those crazy large scale battles.

(+/-) This one can be seen as either a positive or a negative depending on what you are looking for. This game has a stupid number of controls. You have the ability to go as deep or as shallow as you want with them depending on how complex the scenarios you get yourself in, however everyone who starts out playing Arma 3 usually makes or breaks during the ""control learning phase"" which can easily take anywhere from 10-30 hours to get muscle memory for.

Overall, its a good game and I think you should make the purchase. What? That's not enough? Isn't this why you're here? So I can tell you whether or not to spend your money? BUY THE DAMN GAME
"
11853,"This has to be the worst game I have ever played
This fucking abomination doesn't even work properly
 
1st:To find a game you have to look through servers like its 2005 and the fucking quick-play wont work

2nd:If you find a game it will spawn you at a military base which is in the middle of dip shit nowhere and the enemy is at the other side of the empty boring map so you have to drive 50km to die by a camper and spawn all the way back to base

3rd: Dont expect a campaign lol

4th:The controls are the worst I have seen in my fucking life,you cant even vault over shit,moving around is the hardest thing I have done,when u aim your character has fucking Parkinson disease or some shit,there are so many fucking buttons you will spend 5 hours to fix everything 

5th:The optimization is shit

6th:Many times no matter if you press the right button or not it will just not fucking work and can risk ur life

7th:Its glitchy as fuck

8th:Finding a match can take 5 minutes even if there are players


I was so excited to see a realistic military game set in my home country of Greece and I left with the biggest disappointment I have felt with an fps game in my life
What a shame man
My pfp was the way I looked like while playing the game"

11882,I mean I got 1000 hours in it now soooo I guess its fun. Just dont expect to have that fun without a good group of people to play with. This is a community based game and it kept alived by said community. Be prepared to be social.
11883,no this game sucks and is trash the controles suck and the graphics are worse then terraria and mine craft
11884,e
11885,"game is super fun, requires lots of team support and communication"

11887,un
11888,good game
11889,"amazing game, strategy, complex shooting, vehicles, open map all in one game. Don't be fooled it's not bad design it's just complex. Once you get mechanics down you can shoot like Call of duty."
11890,Gud yes
11891,The most realistic and enjoyable military simulator
11892,Fun military shooter
11893,"poo dopnt buy

11894,Even though the game is dated it is the milsim that lets you anything and everything.
11895,War.
11896,"Awesome game!! Had too much fun with my friends, you must buy this game"
11897,"absolutley amazing game, anyone who says it isnt just hasn't played long enough to appreciate this thing."
11898,"I think steam isnt working cause I bought ""Walking Simulator 2022"" and it gave me this game but to my surprise its got more features and a better mod support than Walking Sim 2022 so not refunding it happy with the mistake."
11899,I really like the game :3
11900,aahh
11901,its good but i havent really played much yet. will update after i get a few more hours in üëç
11902,"Tactical realism and amazing gun play, also love fucking people in KOTH, GG"
11903,"Great game, I haven't seen the multiplayer yet, but the single player campaign is very good."
11904,"I guess if crawling around in grass for 5 hours until you just end up getting blown up by your own team is fun for you, then get it, but, uh, not for me."
11905,good gem
11906,"Arma 3 is a realistic meletary shoter Arma 3 is set in 2035 in a war somewher so the deves cold make some of the robot stuff and mini drones if u like just to be able to start the game and just press play then i woldent recemend this game as it can take a little longer ther are a lot of servers but many are code locked but that dosent mean that is feq left that u can just join the game dosent look grate but my settings is not at high or ultra becuse i have an GTX 1660 super and AMD 6300 six core and i get around 30 to 40 on the server i play on for the first time it can be little urrrrr hard the remember 100 keybinds  when spawning in u will spawn at a home base thet is XX KM away at the server i play on ther is tanks and helicopters and stuff and a costimicebal loudout station now i wold wich for ther to be more  cosmetics like Frogman helmet, SAS or GIGN and that wird japen i think black mask i wold recemend this if u like a Hardcore FPS with mods and having to wayt until ur in action"
11907,MY LIFE
11908,war
11909,yes
11910,i like this game
11911,The game is basically based like a real life military simulator with realistic controls
11912,
11913,Game is Okay
11914,"Arma 3 does not have to be a sim, it seems incredibly complicated almost to the point of scaring people off, but it only has to be as serious/real as you want it to be. If you enjoy FPS games and are on the fence, i highly suggest trying this out, if not just for the huge modding community. 8/10 too much sand"
11915,"no sex

11916,2602408779
11917,"10/10

11918,"Great game, just bloody great"
11919,Game is alright could use with abit more fps on the servers but i guess thats just arma 3
11920,Gud wit mods
11921,Zuse mode can either be the best or the worst time ever depending on your zuse. but mine has been amazing.
11922,"This game did not build a great reputation or player base for no reason. Arma 3 is truly an experience like no other, yes Squad is a lot of fun but if you want to straight up want a simulator (thats actually fun) arma 3 is the way for you"
11923,"A great game , but not for anyone .
"
11924,10/10 would Arma again
11925,AMZING
11926,pew pew
11927,"Great game, vitually endless posibilitys"
11928,it's the dark souls of shooters ;)
11929,"Too many outright bigots that Bohemia has no way of dealing with. Transphobes, racists, abusers of all kinds. If you are visibly queer, vocally feminine, or in any way discernibly non-white, you will be faced with constant harassment and abuse from other players."
11930,steep learning curve but lots of fun once you figure it out
11931,"I don't really play the multiplayer that much I haven't gotten into it. But on single player editor mode it is very fun. You can create battles, and test out defensive/ offensive strategies, you can fly around and blow stuff up. Its hard to get used to flying but once you get the hang of it its extremely easy and fun."
11932,"good




:)"
11933,"If you like Milsim and you like shooters i can only recommend this game.

There is a vast amount of MilSim units with all kinds of different levels of seriousness and settings.
So for anyone interested in MilSim there is something for you.

There are also alot of different Roleplaying servers so if you are into that go ahead.

This game also has a huge and active modding community which can expand the game in an insane amount.

So if you are either into Roleplaying, realistic shooters, MilSim, or just casual PvP or PvE or even singleplayer shooters
get yourself this game there is a lot to cheeck out."
11934,AWSOME
11935,Very fun awesome game I recommend 10/10 I have a group based around the game as well if you're newer and looking to get into a unit and group hmu
11936,where is arma 4 bohemia?
11937,Some of these people on here are hysterical. never enjoyed a computer game like this in my live
11938,yes
11939,why the fuck do bullets not go through a bush. A FUCKING BUSH.
11940,"Good fun, always something new to play."
11941,nearly 30% of the game is blocked by DLC
11942,yes
11943,After a thousand hours i still don't know how to play the game
11944,"Overall a good game, especially with mods that you love!"
11945,"its fun ig

11961,boring
11962,what can i say i love the game for its mods. and i hope for an arma 4 one day with alot less bugs. Buy it on a sale for sure.
11963,"I find that the manual and diagrams are inconsistent as to keystrokes for specific actions, that they do not function in many instances, and that simple actions that you do repetitively in combat are almost impossible to 
execute. This results in KIA while trying to get menus and keystrokes to function. I have already checked online and find these issues go back years and to have not corrected them by now is simply unacceptable."
11964,"Worth the money if i'm being honest
But the money should be put towards a nuclear generator to power your gpu if your playing on ultra"
11965,Absolutely amazing game love committing war crimes with the boys.
11966,"Arma 3 all in all is a very solid title that i really enjoy. Great mods, fun servers. Its great. Performance issues are not fun at all, frame drops, rubber band, freezes and crashes tend to happen to me a far bit but i cant help but come back. Very solid game and would recommend. Just make sure you get the fun DLCs like Apex, Contact and SOG"
11967,idk whats going on half the time but it's fun
11968,‰ºòÂåñ‰∏ÄÂù®Â±é
11969,This game is awesome specially if you like tactical shooters.
11970,"Countless hours in multiple game modes and mods, and you know its a good game when you're having fun even whilst playing against hackers. At the time of writing this review, it's 2021 and it says I have 54 hours. I will eventually get it to 2000 hours to match its ArmA 2 predecessor."
11971,"RTX 3090

No, sorry. F-ck off."
11972,"One of the must have games to play if you own a PC. Massive community modding support which has what has kept this game going so long. From Milsim to RP, this game has everything you could want"
11973,It sucks

11981,"Once upon a time, on Christmas day 2020, a 18 year old guy named Marc opened his only Christmas present he got from his hard working single dad... A gaming PC! He only had a laptop before that would only Postal 2, but now that he had a machine that was so powerful that Alduin and his dragon army coward in fear of it. His adventures took him across the Mojave wasteland to find Benny, to stealing the platinum chip from Mr house, to defeating the NCR and Caesars legion at the battle of hover dame with the aide of the Boomers, The Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of steel. After that he lived the life of Bruce Wayne aka Batman through the events of the Arkham series, fighting scarecrow, killer crock, Bane, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and finally the Joker to save Gotham and Commissioner Gordon. Than he went on a journey of multiple lives of assassins apart of a creed of brothers. From Rome to the american civil war, and most recently ancient Greek!

Arma allowed Marc who plans on getting a Ph.D in history to reenact both of the world wars, Vietnam, and his fav the civil war! Arma is a great game that really gives the user a lot of creative room to make their Fantasies a reality. Want have a massive riot in New York City? Go right ahead! Want a battle between the Alt left and Alt right? head over to the workshop and get a few simple mods! Want something to role-play with your discord buddies? Buy the damn game! Want to make a whole city and be cop who abuses his power? Boy this game will make you cum in your pants! And most of all, do you want the entire fallout new vegas map and all the assets of guns. characters, clothes, and weapons to create your own fallout new vegas story the workshop has exactly that! Anyway thank you for reading my story, I hope it inspires someone but now I must adventure to the land of West Virginia and build a settlement that will eventually need your help like the late and great Preston Garvey use to say! But than, I will conguer my greatest foe in gaming, and the worst enemy in all of fallout and skyrim history... Swagdaddy69"
11982,everything
11983,"hard to find a game without a dlc but pretty fun
"
11984,30 hours in and I still haven't learned how to play this game. I will update at 100 hours.
11985,Gun Gun
11986,"Awesome Game , Everything about to the community and the creative minds of so many this is way beyond a normal realistic military game , i love this and have been playing this since 2017 and i love it , I hope more DLC and more player will play this amazing game called Arma 3. I've been thinking of making mission for the community even tho am still a starter. I hope this comment is helpful for future visitors and New player."
11987,"I actually really cool, its realistic, you can mod it, its multiplayer, its militaristic , its just epic"
11988,best milltitary shooter its just a little future aspect with the jets
11989,good
11990,"I have been looking forward to play this game for years now.  I don't even have a Gamer PC... just using the old PC I have right.  This is about the 3rd PC game I had played, ever.  Because of it, I will invest on beef-up computer to play this great game on.  Once the Frames Per Seconds go up I'm afraid this will be the only game I will play for a very long time.  

Get the game, enjoy the fight!  Hooooaaah!

Bullet Six"
11991,War.
11992,great game but a little hard for beginners to learn but not impossible
11993,"Brilliant game, I have never played anything as close to real life as this game."
11994,A fun Milsima and mods only make it better. Zeus is really fun and i recommend u try it.
11995,This game is flat out incredible. Love it. AI op
11996,"Arma 3 is a MilSim I find myself always going back to. Just the sheer quality in the small things like movement, realism in weapon sway based on stamina, and a few other things just set this game over the top for me. Especially since there is huge support for mods and custom servers. 10/10"
11997,yes
11998,yes
11999,i complete waste of my money. There are too many fucking controls and their hard to learn. The campaign is absolute shit and the multiplayer experience was ablsolutly horrible. Why do ppl like this game?
12000,"Very enjoyable especially for people who enjoy realism, i personally enjoyed being a Drone Operator controlling a MQ9-Reaper"
12001,fun but i have no fucking clue whats going on
12002,fucking great
12003,its a good milsim game for people who love milsim games def buy

12007,The Best Milsim Sandbox game
12008,VERRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDD
12009,REALISM
12010,"A very interesting game
Lots of very good mechanics
Can be a Sandbox or Milsim game


Arma 3 is one of those game that are pearls among the pile of sh*t
They are good, unique, and very rare

I never played a game before that combined the military universe with the freedom of a sandbox game, even offering you the possibility to add mods and, just like Left 4 Dead 2, a mod manager to only activate the one you want and keep in reserve the other ones

There is so much mod that modify the game that you can literally play in a modern city with nothing related to Military, just like GTA RP.


Although it suffer some problems too, like the old engine that can barely old 20 lanterns on a same spot or the impossibility to build tunnels, which is quite meh when you add a Vietnam DLC to the game

But even with those problems, Arma 3 remain an excelent game and if you like Milsim/Sandbox and military, then you should definitely check it out"
12011,Yes
12012,simple to get into hard to master limitless possibilities
12013,asheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
12014,dogshit game
12015,"The game is still fun, community is perfect, the game still gets updates and overall, a good game.
The campaign's were fun to play.

The engine is a bit funky but that shouldn't stop you from playing the game"
12016,this game is amazing even after years i have to say this is my favourite game
12017,DONT KNOW LAST TIME I PLAYED I SURELY HAD NO FUN
12018,big fun
12019,Best milsim available
12020,"Get mods, amazing game still"
12021,"SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGN: Great realistic military experience, This game is as realistic as the person playing it makes it, Also very challenging. 10/10 would recommend"
12022,"This game is recommended and have realistic gameplay.

From your friend
-V0RT3X"
12023,tarkov but no swets
12024,"Great military sim, great mods to play, game isnt very optimised so expect bad FPS a lot of the time, but if you like military and want more freedom than Squad, go play this and enjoy all the random AI idiotcy and all the random players being asses on wasteland."
12025,bruh gud gam
12026,"still can't get to join any of my fellow malaysian player wkwkwkw, but its a great game"
12027,Have you ever wanted to hear the sweet sound of freedom rain down from the heavens in 30mm? Have you ever wanted to spend countless hours inflicting misery upon others in wasteland? Do you crave shooting a 9mm PCC at 1200 metres to headshot AI? Then this is the game for you
12028,Great game for professional shooters!
12029,ver gd
12030,It's fine for a few hours I guess...
12031,"The world's best battlefield simulation game, there is no one. The picture quality is average, but the realism, freedom and openness is second to none. Operation is not so difficult, even a rookie can easily make a World War II blockbuster. Highly recommended with a variety of Mod use. A variety of mods is the essence of this game. It's not expensive, and it doesn't take up much storage space, so buy it!"
12032,"the best!!!

12043,"She and I have returned from a holiday back-packing (well, case-pulling) around Albania. We went the length of the country, catching buses from town to town and finding somewhere to stay when we arrived.

I wanted to again see a European country much as I remember them in the early 60s before everything became the same, with same shops and similar food, and that's pretty much what we found. Albania is family-centred, safe, respectable and amazingly cheap; two people can eat with a drink for ¬£5 and eat like royalty for ¬£15.

Every evening, families and friends get dressed up and go promenading up and down the main street. It's a young society with few fat people and is untouched by the Americans (we didn't see a single McDonalds in the whole country).

So, if you can survive a run-down infrastructure and customer-blindness, you could try a holiday in Albania. It has wonderful scenery, beach resorts and important archaeology."
12044,"Great game in general, so many possibilities with so many mods to the game that have been made!"
12045,Love this game
12046,"Oof, too realistic . . . this game convinced me not to go to the military after high school graduation - 10 out 10!"

12055,Buy it.
12056,Straight war :)
12057,"This is 100% the best war crimes simulator, would recommend."
12058,Fun game
12059,"I've only played for 6 hours and it is one of the best games ever. I really like the ability to mod this game and the feeling of unease as you walk around the map not knowing where the enemy is. 9/10, stamina does not regen while walking."
12060,i like being stoned.
12061,it hurt my pp
12062,it sucks

This game is not worth 30, its worth 3 at the most. all the servers are broken, its such a shady download and program that looks like a virus and lags your pc, most of the game requires a DLC to actually play, and the keyboard binds are so horrible. Spare your money, unless u wanna play single player, which is somewhat fun. I will probably have this game sit in my library and not touch it much, but if i did buy it full price, i would have to force myself to enjoy it."

12114,good
12115,"just, yes"
12116,Really enjoying this game!
12117,"Bought the game and had my 2nd doubts when playing singleplayer, though when playing multiplayer had the greatest fun. Most people on the official servers tend to be on VC and not always as friendly though do help you get the mission done and you can still have a lot of funny and stupid laughs with them when you are on the way and not in combat."
12118,Walking in the woods simulator. Still fun and immersive
12119,"I'm not sorry to say this, but how can one sell the same wonky mechanics from Arma 2 again, just with slightly upscaled graphics?"
12120,"Best graphics, best simulator ever for military duty."
12121,arm
12122,This game is Mil Sim requires patience the single player campaign prepares you as best as it can for its multiplayer which is brutal. So much fun the community is great get the game its worth it
12123,·µç·µò·µà
12124,"its ok
"
12125,i played a bit... not bad
12126,Is good.
12127,"Dogshit, i can run it well. Players cry at you for being new"
12128,ARMA 3 is so realistic ü§© and the graphics are impressive its a realistic shooter game üòç
12129,Enjoyable game to play with friends that are into milsim. If you dont have friends (which I dont) there's some cool people in online matches with helpful tips. If you want to play casual its worth getting the base game and if you really want to get in the milsim scene. Get Apex and slowly get more DLCs.
12130,"Unless you are into super hardcore multiplayer games with communities that go way too into a game (suprisingly this is more toxic than world of tanks), and you don't like singleplayer, probably not for you. 
With that said Campaign is a lot of fun so far, very much looking forward to reaching Contact campaign which looks and sounds amazing. And I added a few mods too. Not very many mods, but they add a TON to the singleplayer experience and makes singleplayer perfectly playable (and more enjoyable than many singleplayer games)"
12131,"Arma 3 is insane. Let's just get a short pro con list. I'll save the good parts for last so cons first.

CONS:
- Performance (My PC is a 1060 3gb with an i5 7400 can run as low as 20-30 fps in some cases where there's a lot of vehicles and NPCs loaded)

- DLC price (The DLC for this game is amazing, although a lot of it should be available from the start, and it is overpriced normally. wait for a sale, or look into mods)

PROS:
+ Huge maps (the first map, Altis, is 270sqkm/170sqmi, about 4x the size of PUBG's maps, 7x the size of Skyrim's map, and about 10x the size of Fortnite's map, making it amazing for piloting aircraft in large scale missions, as well as selecting one of the many villages for diverse small scale missions, and of course there are 4 or 5 other official maps, and countless community made maps)

+ MODDING (OMG this game's modding community is awesome. Check the workshop for anything you can think of, or search Youtube for a list of some of the most awesome mods.)

+ Diversity of gameplay (Kind of mentioned in the map section, but you can either play a huge scale mission with several objectives over the map, or a small mission set within a single village. You can change the weather, put on night vision goggles and go dark, and put on suppressors to keep your position concealed for as long as possible. Or you can skip straight to my favorite part, flying a helicopter or jet and wreaking havok on the enemy)

+ Much much more. This review is already fairly long, so I'll just leave it at this: With the pros and cons I've already mentioned, this game get's a recommendation from me. There is no more downsides, however there is plenty more upsides, so if you're not convinced by my review, lemme tell ya, there's a lot more that this game's got going for it. Thanks for reading."
12132,"Make sure you buy the dlcs with it, the game is useless without them. It wont let you drive any of the vehicles if you dont. Otherwise good game."
12133,the most realistic milsim
12134,"It spent 40 minutes looking for a single game, and when i joined i was instantly kicked for not being german???

2/10 the guns were cool, but i dont suggest getting it"
12135,great game
12136,i mean its ok but you have to download a bunch of mods that take up more than the game to enjoy it and you have to play with friends its not really worth 30 bucks though
12137,is gwood
12138,it is very fun to play and good if you want smoething more realistic
12139,arma
12140,This Game is amazing I have played the second game a bunch and finally decided to get this one and its even better.
12141,confusingly good
12142,I like that I can play it for a long time and not get bored.
12143,"Bad 
Bad 
Very Very Bad"
12144,"This game believes in equality. Every PC will run ArmA 3 at 25fps. No matter if you have a PC from NASA or a low end PC, ArmA will run at 25FPS"
12145,Nice game.But kind of low fps in pultiplayer for an old game with a low-to-medium end pc.
12146,"- Spent an hour moving a small crew across the map by foot. A few units died from various small skirmishes.
- Finally found a vehicle.
- Immediately attached some C4 to it. 
- Backed over another of my units.
- Finally figured out how to go forward. 
- Ran the car into the objective. Explosions galore. Went home a war hero.
- Or, at least, I would have if I could have figured out how to exit the car while we were barreling towards our objective. 

20/10 best galaxy-brain military simulation ever."
12147,the best game on steam
12148,One of the best milsim games on the market.
12149,"Perfect game , only one thing is minus - ""Engine"" on TOP PC in multiplayer FPS is very low."
12150,Bad performance on a PC that is 3 years younger than this game...
12151,ARMA 3 is a very fun game with endless things to do from normal game to mods this game has everything to  offer players for fun experience of war and role play

12162,where the fuck are the enemies
12163,"Just a bunch of roleplaying kiddos who want to get in army but can't wait to be 18 so they spit in their microphone with words ""YEz SiR"". Just another slavery simulator. Also the flight engine is kinda bad. kiddos flexing on me how they can fly a helicopter, yet they didn't try a heli in MFS2020. Get life kids"
12164,"The physics and client performance are definitely jenky as heck but I am willing to accept those two things considering how amazing this game is at heart. If you are looking for a solid military simulation game with a ton of mod potential, this is as good as you're going to find."

12169,"ok so the base game is something i wasn't the biggest fan of,but the new S.O.G PF dlc is worth it alone."
12170,Just dont man
12171,Good game. Buy this only if you want some realistic military shooting experience.
12172,its a very fun interactive game
12173,The game is pretty good but with the right group of people to game with it is so realistic its amazing!!  I do recommend it without a doubt!!
12174,Worth every penny. Not a big pc gamer but this game has so much in it. Kinda feels like the sims with all the ridiculous paid dlc.
12175,good

12182,"This game is awesome. Not only does it have a great campaign, it also has every other mode possible. Literally the only thing I have the slightest problem with is the legitimacy of the situation but literally every other game in the world does that. This game is truly amazing. I also like how there is an editor that we can use to create our own battles and express our creativity. This game is truly amazing."
12183,Cant even play my game just crashes whenever I try to join a game. and its not like my PC is bad I have a gtx 1666 TI and i can run overwatch at a stable 150 fps
12184,good game but servers dead and you have to buy any vehicles or coop missions you can basically play campaign or workshop content but otherwise your sol so deff not worth 30$

I should see what its about.""  At first I had a hard time grasping some of the menus, but slowly I figured it out. It is a awesome game and I would recommend trying it before judging it."

12255,"A very in depth game, with the absolute worst server browser / multiplayer component of any game. I have never seen a game with such a poorly designed server browser, and never once have I been able to join friends with at least a half an hour prior of debugging. The game should be fun, but if you intend to play it for it's multiplayer, it instead is simply frustrating."
12256,Unbearable controls. Paradox tier dlc moneyscamming. Was expecting a army figthing simulator and instead I just saw servers of people larping their sad lives away or paying real cash to use veichles. I really cant understand why its so popular.
12257,A lieutenant who was 4 years younger than the age you can go to gyms called me a faggot because I didn't end my sentence with over on the comms.

12259,Awesome! Love the flying and graphics
12260,great game i defently recomend it
12261,LOVED IT
12262,fun but un-optimized. 14 fps lowest settings with parameters set on a high end system.
12263,it was confusing the first time i played it also it includes a lot of walking sometimes which can take a long time.
12264,I have changed my my mind about this game. This game is the most uncomfortable game to play and would not recommend if you aren't into hardcore military simulator. 3.5/10
12265,gooodddd
12266,As real as its gets...
12267,amazing. Better than arma 2

12272,"Highly realistic with the help of a few mods it can and is even more realistic than the default depending on the mods. 
A few bugs to be ironed out but in the end its pretty good. (by bugs that would be where sometimes you clip partially into a rock or something if you walk into it sometimes and bug out a tad bit. nothing too bad)"
12273,Everything in this game is just so great and the community amplifies the enjoyment a ton.
12274,good
12275,Absolutely amazing Mil-Sim
12276,ok
12277,It is very complicated to learn for me but maybe not for others. It is fun if you are with your squad [which i wasn't because it was my first time]

On top of this the DLC is expensive, and not all worth it. I would also say purchase them when on sale as well. A lot of items/vehicles require them, but its not needed to beat the main game"
12285,"Great team game, made infinitely better by two things: thorough modding and invested communities. Joining a big unit that plays the way you want to play is the most important thing you could do. Always stays fresh and never feels samey, with a super high skill ceiling."
12286,arma 4 when
12287,"This game is not for everyone. Arma III is a game centered around a very realistic experience of which may push away a lot of people. If you want to feel bad ass but look completely stupid this game is for you. Arma III has a lot of versatility because of the modding community and scenario creator. I didn't like it at first but then I watched some videos on the game mechanics and completely fell in love with it. For beginners to Arma III remember to watch videos online about it first so then you drop the game. When you feel stuck push through it, its worth it."

12297,"Pretty fun tbh just a bit slower paced 
"
12298,"Single player is great with the campaign divided with three episodes (and a few more with the DLCs)- if you struggle with the AI's pin-point accuracy and instant-detection, you can dumben down their awareness in the settings (though I don't suggest doing so as it would ruin the immersion of going up against trained soldiers, rather you'd be up against clueless bogeys). Multiplayer is where this game shines. Should you ever indulge in what this game has to offer, you'd best be prepared to study the game mechanics and its keyboard controls- if not you're in for a rough situation."
12299,"U shoot like terrorist, very nice simulator for bomb."
12300,"Put off buying Arma 3 for years.

Glad I did, I got to live my life for a few years extra before falling down this rabbit hole. Now I spend most of my free time playing dress up in the virtual armory and yelling at the AI for shooting me from 1km with a 9mm while I'm hiding in a bush.

It's beautiful."

12332,ARMA has a lot of great content out of the box. What really makes it shine though is the tools and freedom to build your own content as well as the near limitless amount of community made mods and additional content. You could setup simple missions just to shoot things or you can get really indepth and create your own little world to play in. Its definitely intimidating at first but you'll get the hang of it. 11/7 with rice.
12333,"Do you become a war criminal because you play Arma, or do you play Arma because you are a war criminal?"
12334,best military tactical team based milsim experience to date!! DEFINITELY WORTH A BUY
12335,"CONTACT, MAN, 200 METERS, LEFT"
12336,"Yes, Arma is a buggy mess. Yes, some of it's physics are a nightmare. Its Unreal 4. But, is the game as terrible as""some"" people say it is? 

No. No it is not.

It's amazing.

This is not C.O.D. or Battlefield. It's a thinking persons game. You need patience, time, tactics, and a bit of technical savvy to really make this game sing.

If you fit that bill, get Arma, get mods from the community, and go have a blast!"

12340,Well i love this game i just think it would be hard to get people on because it taken me like 5 hours or more just to try to get in a lobby/ game it would just kick me out if i got in one and if i could get in one i didn't have the right mods or for some reason just crash on me. like i said i love this game just would be hard for new people.

12344,"Seriously good game. You feel yourself in a war environment. If you read the reviews before buying the game, you have formed your opinion that the game is difficult. There is no such thing, guys. It already teaches you everything in the game, from the bottom up, before you enter the game's story mode. I can't say it's worth the money, definitely get it at a discount. But it's a good game."
12345,
12346,Very overwhelming combat military sim that you have to just tackle each mission / campaign / game mode a little bit at a time and go slowly. Can feel very janky until you learn the controls and mechanics and realize that all of this is in service of building a very life like and realistic war sim that gives you a ton of freedom. Played best with friends in multiplayer over discord voice chat.
12347,"Has some glitches despite the fact that it is almost 10 year old game, And does not use GPU but Fucks up CPU, frame rates sucks when playing multiplayer modes up to 100 players. But over all good game (not perfect)"
12348,i have always loved this game ever since i did not even have a PC i'ts very good for MILSIMS etc.

12371,A game that has a learning curve steeper than Mt Everest ...still better than CoD or Battlefield
12372,one of the best games i ever played
12373,very good game but to make it more fun i suggest joining a group most of the time it is not hard to do. and you will (most of the time) only have to download a couple mods witch is not that hard and the group members will more the likely help you.

12377,Probably my favourite game of all time. It has content for everyone. The mods that exist for the game are awesome and i had 4000+ hours sunk into this game and want to play more. It has one major issue and that is performance and i hope one day Bohemia makes the next version to be the same as A3 but just performing better.
12378,y  e  s
12379,"Great game to practice communication

 Edit: With more playtime on this game I have come to the conclusion that this game is still one of the best games for communication, as well as one of the best military combat games to date. Furthermore, the mods can either make your game more realistic or less realistic depending on your preferences. One of my favorite mods is some of the Star Wars mods.

TLDR: Great Game to buy."
12380,horribly optimized and runs like a dumpster fire but it is a very fun game
12381,Its good
12382,A Brilliant Realist Sandbox Milsim game awesome mod support there is a mod for everything an amazing community. 100% would recommend to anyone looking for this type of game. :)
12383,It is a really fun game. Kinda hard on my computer but a great all around game. recommend getting the dlc if you do editor but you don't have to have them.
12384,not easy but fun
12385,Great action game great co op and works good on server
12386,"If you are into Mil-Sim/RP, then BUY THIS GAME! It is the BEST game ever, super fun, ton of mods, realistic DLC's, and more! I recommend buying this if you're looking for some military RP."
12387,Very very good
12388,"Great game if you are interested in an realistic military simulator. The multiplayer is definitely hit or miss as a good game master will make it one of the most memorable moments but a bad one can also ruin it for all the players. Either way, if you like stalking your prey for tens of minutes only to take one calculated shot to end a war, then this game is for you."
12389,This game is great by itself but a lot of stuff is behind a pay wall in an already expensive game. Even with that I enjoy this game and the story is under rated. It is a lot better with friends especially the younger you are.
12390,Yes
12391,Its only a war crime if you're  caught.
12392,"find a milsim to play with, fun times afterwards"

Arma 3 is Awesome!  I am sorry I am so late to the game.  I think what happened is I either got it mixed up with Operation Flashpoint from years ago or I just didn't have a powerful enough PC.  A lot of guys on Insurgency Sandstorm told me to try it and so May 25, 2021 I got the base game and then after 6 hours into the campaign I laid down for the Ultimate DLC package and SOG Prairie Fire Vietnam DLC.

This game has a control scheme that will take some time to customize but when you do I highly recommend you use OBS to record your settings.  

"
12401,This game has provided a massive amount of hours of fun and immersive game play. There is tonnes of DLC  and game modes online to keep you interested.

12410,"Really fun and cool game. Been wanting to play this before I was even close to getting a pc and when I finally was able to, I was not disappointed. Newb welcoming servers were very... welcoming."
12411,"Best military simulator period. Lots of different types of game modes from coop to pvp to rp etc. Its always a different experience when you join a different server. Well worth the money. My only gripe is that this game WILL TANK YOUR PC. Doesnt matter what you have in it, it will eat up your fps. Adjust settings to your liking. Dont expect to run this game at 60 fps constantly. This game is CPU heavy."

With the right group of friends, its the perfect platform.

Also by far the most playable version of ARMA, and I have played em' all since Operation Flashpoint (cold war assualt) on the original xbrick. It didn't really work with a controller (then as now) but it was a vision of things to come. I will probably play ARMA III forever."

12428,"its fun

12430,"This game is very challenging at times. The gunplay in this title is about as realistic as it gets, no cod running and gunning here. Players that do use these unrealistic strategies will not find this game entertaining. Constant squad communication and coordination is needed by all group members at all times during the ""story"" missions. This game gets a 8 out of 10 from me only because the ultra realism in the game irritates me because COD has conditioned me so much to play shooters at a much faster pace than ARMA 3 requires you to play at. Hopefully an ARMA 4 will release eventually! Have nice day."
12431, The best mil sim I played so far.
12432,it good
12433,"ive recently gotten into arma because of KarmaKut and i will say this is my favorite game ive EVER played! the immersion alone is insane! mods really make this game complete. being a MILSIMP doesnt get better than this! 
"
12434,amazing
12435,"The game is pretty fun and cool for people that like military history, as well as universal! When I bought it, I also downloaded a few mods and bought a few DLCs. It's great to play with mods and DLCs, however, it's more fun to play with an unit."

12449,"I was doing Editor, Seem alot of issue I am having, But I did partially fix it, but the AI in one place isn't working. So For the record, how do I get AI open the doors when driver need to leave out the building? That what I am trying to figure out, Also, With this F/A- 181 Pilot to follow lines where to go and landed, and I did put Cycle at the end so it can fly again but they go different direction and not follow the line to where it should go. So re-fixed the Pilot again, seem to do alright so far. Gonna need some help with that editor."

12504,"Best in its class if you like the mil-sim genre. Unique in it's scale and scope. There's also a ton of mods and custom scenarios if you get done with the base game; as well as access to the scenario editor. 

It excels at infantry and combined arms gameplay, and there's plenty of depth for those who like to pilot jets, helicopters, tanks, light vehicles, etc.

Currently in love with the new Vietnam community-made DLC's multiplayer co-op ""MIKE"" mission."

12516,Really a great game. There are mods for you to really do anything. But it is truly better with friends.
12517,"This is one of the worst games ever made. It is also one of the best ever made. In fact, Arma is not even a game. It is an experience like no other. It might be clunky, glitchy and low-performing but it offers one thing that hardly any other title does. Freedom of choice. It does not hold your hand or tell you what to do or where to go. The choice is yours. Hopefully some day it will get an engine upgrade which will fix many of the problems but I'm afraid if that happens then I may never find my way out of....

12525,"[h1] TLDR; THE BEST MILSIM GAME DECADE! [/h1]

Late 2013, That I've start playing this game.
I've enjoyed vanilla sandbox gameplay for a while. And then
I started to play on westland server, And it made my day for years!

In 2017, I lucky enough that in my country have a great community dedicate for mil-sim gameplay
I started to play with this community from that on. And this community is getting better and better.

Now, I just put a 1000 hours for this game. I know, It not that much. 
But anyway I'm not regret any second that I played this game."
12526,great game get it if you want to have fun
12527,Ayo I'm new to this game and started playing an it got really easier with the campaign but on a mission its realistic it takes time til action if you don't like this than I would not recommend unless you want to create your own mission in editor apart from that this game is fun realistic fun community world wide amazing game 10/10.
12528,The game is stable 40% of 90% of the time when you get into a vehicle. 10/10 still better than cookie clicker
12529,"My favourite game of all time, Highly suggest it!"

12534,"Good mil-sim game, cons is it's resource intensive and requires a very strong PC."
12535,"It's cool but extremely badly optimized, never seen a game this badly optimized.
"
12536,"Arma 3 is like a good pizza dough. What makes it  amazing though is the fixings. 
The mods and their creators are what make Arma 3 the ultimate platform. Every taste can be catered to via mods, scripts and game modes.
You will need time to get use to the controls, that can sometimes be a little clunky. 
Find yourself a community that suits you best and that is active on ARMA. Be curious discover the amazing content that is put forth via the workshop. Play around in the editor and get down to the bones of what the game truly lets you do.
After a 3 year hiatus I was very happy to  download the game and go on new adventures!
Warning: Make sure you have a good internet connection and a shit ton of space to store the mods on your drives. 1 TB isn't overkill.

12552,"I've probably spent 95% of my time with this game dicking around in the editor making dumb scenarios and generally just being an unproductive member of society. The sheer amount of commands, features, factions, weaponry and such is astonishing and trying to learn and master all of that can distract a generation ship's crew for many millenia. Of course the game is not perfectly realistic due to bugs, glitches and technical limitations, but you can generally mold this game into anything you want with a bit of knowhow, like for example a super mario 64 esque platformer (that's a real mod, search for Super Miller Land). As a platform for expressing the creativity of it's userbase, not much compares. As a milsim, nothing else compares."

It appears there are, as of this writing, some bugs with fixed wing aviation. issues with target locking, only partially functional HMDS, and only the standard flight model, which I hope they are working on an advanced fixed wing model for us. But in the mean time, it sure would be nice if:
1. HMDS worked properly (the pilot helmets are based on the F-35 III Joint Strike Fighter HMDS Helmet, which has so many cool features and tech)
2. We could just lock on to our targets properly, the way apparently it used to work in youtube videos from 2017.
Other than that, its an amazing game and I highly recommend it!"
12555,nice
12556,really fun game
12557,This game is a fun realistic FPS military shooter game with some decently good graphics and honestly it does get a litlle choppy with frame rates and lag on my (Gtx 1050ti Intel i7 8gb ram) PC but over all the only reason why i am reinstalling this game is because of the Demons and Angels mod which adds zombies and stuff to the game and this way using the in-game map editor/creator you can make a cool zomie apoclapse map with enemies that carry guns. But over all this is one of the very best fps's that i have ever played *hands down* With that being said BUY THIS GAME and bye! (also it's a very good price for its quality)

Thank you, Arma3, for helping me make some of my best friends."

12579,"Almost fun simulator when u dwell deeper into it. Bugs, bugs , bugs and more bugs. Ai is atrocious. specially the driving. Game performance can be really shit. 
Editor... this is the core of the game right? I dunno were to start... is it even worth explaining what is wrong with it? This simulator is appealing for what it is there is no doubt. BUT... i really do not recommend this if ur not into really frustrating experiences especialy if u don't know how to script. It feels like a alpha product with half baked features and quit mid development and now they are milking it with shiny dlc's stuff cause for some reason people love this frustrating experience. Also speaking of dlc's. They will be installed even if you do not own them. What does this mean? It means mid game, in the heat of battle, xD u see a vehicle. Oh my escape route!!!! U aproach, the car. Your only hope of survival wile taking cover, fearing for your life. Then u see an anemy. He quickly notices u and points his weapon, ready to shoot. Oh no... now or never!! You put your hand in the vehicles door handle to open it and... U DO NOT OWN THIS DLC. PURCHASE

12587,"Garbage bag devs. Every time I come back to this game, something that should have been fixed years ago is still plaguing this game. The main three being:

1. Collision detection.

2. A.I. getting stuck / not knowing how to path through an environment. (Mind you this is on a map made by the devs. These pathing issues should not exist after 8 years.)

3. Shitty animations. I can't count how many times I've died because my character keeps moving in one direction, or he gets stuck in an animation and can't cancel out of it in time. 


Devs, you literally have nothing to be proud of after 8 years of this game being out. The mods you allow carried this game's success so hard. Even to the point where you have to sell other people's content for extra cash. Pathetic."
12588,perty good
12589,Great
12590,errrrrthang was great
12591,its fun with friends really cool game if your into this kinda of genre
12592,Geneva Conventions? More like Geneva Suggestions
12593,"Arma 3 is not a very good game by itself. It lacks in every single category imaginable, but it is also the greatest game I have ever played and here is why. 

Arma 3 is an incredibly versatile experience with the help of mods. You can play in virtually any period of time and any conflict you can think of. You can play as the storm troopers of star wars to the guardsmen of 40K. There really is no limit to what you can do.

However it is to be noted that Arma 3 is best played with a community of people and is hard to be enjoyed alone.

I absolutely love Arma 3 and if you're into realism and military shooters I think you will too."
12594,GOOD
12595,"___bad things___
-badly optimized - lagging as hell
-toxic community on roleplaying servers
-dlcs are overpriced and nearly useless, why do you have to pay to get stronger weapons for example, just pay to win

___good things___
very realistic gameplay
many different gamemodes

Can i recommend this game?
in general - No! If its on sale and pretty cheap - yes! But be aware of those lags and buy at least the marksman dlc to enjoy the game a little"
12596,wait until arma 4

12623,So many angles to how ARMA gameplay works; never boring. User created content and mods make the game. Base game by itself is fairly boring and gets stale after a few weeks.

12634,.
12635,"I was gifted this game and told it was really fun and realistic. sure its realistic but I do not see the fun. you join a server and theres many Tanks, Helicopters, Jets, ETC. but you cant use anywhere close to half of them inless you pour more money into the game for DLCs. 

As far as I know its not Player VS Player and instead Player VS AI. and the games usually follow like this... You join a server -> Pick weapon at base and gear -> get in Helicopter with others -> get deployed near AI enemy base and fight enemy ->  capture enemy base and get new enemy base to fight. and it never changes.

Ive tried to like it but I cant. theres just so much to learn a ton of controls and stuff. And the person who bought it for me stopped asking me to play this game with him pretty much dropping much intrest in it 

oh and if you are looking to get this game because of Arma3 Dayz, im pretty sure you have to download mods for it with the game and from there im not sure. perhaps you must find a forum with a list of exact mods and then you can join those games but im not sure. Youtube may help with that but I sure cant."
12636,"Guns, glory, general dumbassery that you can't get anywhere else. Perfect game."
12637,I really love how the game works the guns however seem to be a bit off otherwise it's good stuff i hope they can make more mods and i would love to play them really awesome game you did well whoever made it

12660,Personally I like this more than the core ARMA 3 game.  No GPS and you have to use your intelligence to navigate.  The AI also seem a lot more switched on for some reason and the weapons are classics and are well portrayed.  Great stuff.

Well worth the ¬£15 i pad and having joined a group of older gamers [Discord channel  Old mans cave] it is even more fun.

"
12693,"I really enjoy this game, but out of the box it's an empty shell. It's a true sandbox, you're given massive empty maps with the tools to make your own missions. Graphics, gameplay, etc, is all there, but there's no content. It has a great base, but nothing built upon it.

SOG Praire Fire CDLC was the first DLC that actually introduced content, missions, dynamics, zones, enemies, AI - actual content to the game. 8 years later and not even made by the developers of this game."
12694,yes

12697,Nice.
12698,"I like this game.

I like the ambience,
I like Arma 3."
12699,"tbh if you're looking for a fun game to play for a while don't get this game, its more confusing than fun i mean i get it that its a realistic shooter but still I'd rather play a different shooter"
12700,"worst game ive ever played for 20 hours a day.  killing people is satisfying.  you no longer die by driving into a tree on a bike like arma 2, which is kinda disappointing.  If i wanna do a header into a poplar, i think the game should punish me.  if eating and drinking are your thing in a survival game, this has that too.  but its not a bug deal if not."
12701,Amazing. Love it. Would buy. Real game here. Fantastic. F***. Awesome. Game. This gAmE.
12702,"game is dead, literrally no one plays it anymore"
12703,Great game. Its only really good with a community and there is plenty of mod support for smaller groups such as playing Antistasi. It does take a lot of study or a knowlegeable friend to play it isn't a typical pick up and play type game. But once you got a solid community its one of the few games you can set up long 3 to 4 hour operations with and enjoy with 50 other people.
12704,decent
12705,z
12706,i love this game put it is so poorly optimized. the contact DLC is wonderful but when i die it tells me there are no spawn points and i gotta force quit the game. other than that its a fun game highly recommend! but i wish they would fix the issues!
12707,I really like the style of gameplay being more realistic and not arcade like. But this game still has a few bugs that need to be worked out. It's still well worth it.
12708,game is dead but fun
12709,"If you like realistic fps games, easy editoring of your game, planty of content, workshop and so on. It is really a masterpiece, i really like it and as you can see i spent lots of time in this games so far and it will be more."
12710,"Once again, we have come to a game that cannot be expressed in words. This time our game ARMA 3. Arma 3 has really great content, so I used this term above. They did their best to get every player to pay attention to the game. I can say that they achieved this a little bit. Generally, those who know the Arma series know that the area in the game is a huge battlefield.

I'll give the game to the one who finishes touring the map !!
I can say that most of the places in this large area consist of empty roads, but what matters is not this big map, but what we will do in this big map. The size of the map is approximately 270 km¬≤. So you can understand, it has a big map that will never end with traveling. But not every part of the map has different contents. Most places are alike. You will notice as you play this."
12711,its a fun game
12712,T A C T I C A L AF
12713,"this game is complete dogshit, it should be free
"
12714,"Very fun game,ALLOT to do just in the vanilla game alone,it has endless mods and modes downloadable from the workshop and some mods so large they could easily be considered a game on their own.And PLEASE when you get the game,do the tutorials and play the campaign,it is HUGE and explains allot about the game,half the people I meat almost never know how to do things because they don't do the tutorials or campaigns."
12715,"get pat too set things up and then its good, u can also see ur fellas ip adresses"
12716,"Amazingly accurate milsim
"
12717,yes swo good
12718,"Though it is a very expensive game to get into, all of the DLCs, it is fun.  The modding system is extensive so there are so many different game types you can play.  Be warned however, getting Armaed is a real thing."

12746,This game is so worth it
12747,"     ARMA III is unique as a game because the more time you invest, the more enjoyable it becomes.  To begin playing is admittedly difficult: The controls, level of depth/realism, and complete freedom of a military sandbox without constant reminders is overwhelming for a lot of new players (I'm new and played for only ~30+ hours in-game.)  This 7 year old game now has more players than at any time previously and consistently ranks in the top 50 games played online every day with one of the largest active modding communities: This should tell you something as a consumer, about how engrossing it can be when the learning curve is climbed.  Although I've never served in the military, believe me when I say this ""game"" is realistic as possible (esp with certain mods.) It is developed and regularly updated/optimized by the same software developers who build actual military simulators.  (Beginners: Expect to die...A LOT. Sorry, that's REAL guns for you.)  As far as FPS and simulator games are concerned, this game is basically the insanely difficult ""Dark Souls"" version of Call of Duty and may not be for every casual gamer...  
      To enjoy this game, you must pass a ""boot camp"" of learning, watching tutorials, looking at Reddit unless you're both a video game god and combat infantry squad leader simultaneously: (I'd like to meet that person.)  I've owned it since ~2016 but am only now seeing how this game is superior in terms of replayability, modding, online community, dedicated dev support, and overall ""Bang for Buck"" factor in entertainment.  If you get this on sale with most of the DLC, it may cost ~$50, but damn if it's not worth every penny.  A refreshingly rare (and old) game which sets a model for all the other games in my library who I love as my children to aspire...most of them...
     It took multiple rage-quits and hours of learning/keeping the main menu screen on (usually falling asleep dreaming of the day I'm actually able to play/understand ARMA III lol), and overall attempts to ""get into it"" before I discovered this awesome game I already had in my library. 
    ARMA III is my favorite kid out of all my games and I could write paragraphs about why. I'll spare you the long version. If you're into learning and practicing virtual and realistic tactical combined arms warfare whatsoever, then this could be your next mental addiction.  Get it ON SALE (preferably with DLC), dedicate yourself (for hours) learning how to participate in the operations, prepare to feel like quitting, and push through just a little bit longer to ""graduate"" the learning curve boot camp necessary to access the immense and untapped value of ARMA III. 

  P.S. The main complaint I have is that the stories are not particularly well-done/interesting but...neither is real modern war imo so...whatever.  I think I just realized how realistic this simulator truly is in the macro...A wise gamer once said ""Do not make war, make ARMA."""
12748,s
12749,Very good sandbox game! Has a different feel than almost any other shooter.
12750,"Amazing milsim. I enjoy the fighter jets that have been so well balanced between a sim and casual experience that I am sincerely hoping for a solo jet based campaign. Controls are easily mapped, can be played with k&m, flightstick and HOTAS! The rest of the game is great too. But I can't get enough of this stealthy hornet, gonna go sting some bad guys."

12763,"Arma 3 Is a fun sandbox MilSim shooter. It is hard to understand how to play the game at first, but with Arma 3's huge amount of custom content and gamemode types it is hard not to have fun. Servers can seem intimidating at first with 100's of addons. But the core gameplay of vanilla servers is where I enjoy the game the most. My favorite gamemode is Mike Force from the Vietnam Prarie Fire DLC."

I don't need to review it. It's the king of Milsims and has been for years.

Well.... considering i bought the game on sale and already put 46,8 hours into it within 4 days, i can say its worth buying IF its on sale of course.

the game is from 2013 and paying full price is not worth it. buy it if you like Milsim games"
12777,i like it good PTSD sim
12778,"So on start up you have no idea what to do, even the simplest thing as joining a server becomes the most difficult task. Def no user friendly. 10/10"

12787,"The only time you'll have fun is when you can get a large group of people together to play, and even then you better have the patience of Jesus because you will be tearing your hair out at how amazingly unoptimized, buggy, and poorly designed this game is. The only reason I have as many hours as I do is because I have a group of friends to play with and even then we often feel like playing something else due to the aggravation caused by this game's poor design. If you think any amount of mods will make this game more fun or fix it, ""a house is only as strong as its foundation,"" and this game has a foundation of paper mache and duct tape."

12789,God I hate this game. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. And also the Geneva convention doesn't exist. Commit as many war crimes as you want.

12794,YES
12795,Good game !!!!!!!
12796,"A game I'd probably never uninstall and the first one to install if I have to change anything on my pc, the amount of replayability is pretty much infinite, the visuals, the sounds, the mods, the mechanics, get ready to use your entire keyboard and not have enough buttons on this game.

It requires a pretty good computer however, otherwise you are in for pain.

Btw, I have close to 500hrs in this game and I just started playing multiplayer because I was having too much fun in singleplayer with mods, scenarios and the editor itself."
12797,Fun stuff
12798,"Im an old school Vet. This is pretty real for a game. You even have to watch out for the snakes. Well after playing this, I got new stuff to talk to my therapist about.lol"

12807,"Love/Hate relationship with this game. I've made many memories with mates and met amazing people through it. The community and  Mod Makers hold up this game to this today. The standalone game however....Painful. When Alt Tabbing out of the game can break it there is obviously an issues. Dont even get me started on the frame drops. If you can reralese new content you can fix your game. If you have a will to live avoid this game. Fun Game when played with friends, all in all a good game if you can look past the bugs."
12808,yes
12809,"i spent 30 dollars and i just end up in a game where i spend 20 mins reading the rules of a server i find, spend 20 minutes trying to reconfigure my controls to let me talk to people and figure out how to do and where to find my missions, i have to walk out of town to trees outside of town even though there is trees in the town it wants me to spend 5 mins walking there so i do and walk back sell my wood and then i buy a car because i needed it and what happens? someone on a atv knocks me over while im trying to figure out how to get in the car and then blows up my car and kills me and i lose everything, i spent almost 2 hours doing absolutely nothing and im sorry but im not recommending this game and im getting a refund, i wanted to keep this game but i cant even figure out the menus or any of the controls really and theres these upside V things that fill my screen all the time and i just cant see myself playing this game ever again, i just hated that experience so much i honestly feel like shit after that, every game i buy is either dead or is filled with toxic people or boring as hell.

waste your money on it if you want, i might be fun if you have friends who play it and can walk you through it but i joined and got RDM twice and on top of that the controls are dogshit. 4/10."

12847,good
12848,fun and realistic enough to feel like a real warzone if you immerse yourself enough not to mention helicopters are fun to fly and tanks are fun to operate!! 10/10 would play again
12849,"The UI of this game is some of the worst that I have ever encountered.  There are so many menus and sub-menus that it is difficult to navigate through.  There is no real tutorial but and optional ""Help Menu"" that you need to pull up occasionally when a new task it introduced.  There is a small notification on the screen that there is a new task and help to explain it but the explanation isn't as thorough as it should be and leaves some things ambiguous.  The game would be much better with a different task menu system or an actual training tutorial that went through absolutely everything in the menu system before dropping you into the campaign."
12850,This game is amazing with the right people
12851,its ight.
12852,.
12853,"I'd just like to clear something up regarding the accusations being made about me by some of the female members of this server. The accusations regarding my so called ""behavior"" are untrue and extremely hurtful.

To the accusers (you know who you are), a few points for your consideration thinking

1) Yes I was asking for farting videos in DMs, I will admit to that. Apparently this can come off as inappropriate for some. So I reluctantly apologize for that.

2) The farting videos I was attempting to accumulate from this server were strictly for artistic purposes and NON-SEXUAL in nature. Ever heard of a non-sexual fart fetishist? Well sorry to break it.

3) I have almost NEVER taken screen recordings of the farting videos that have been sent to me and/or sent these pics to other people

4)No I have not been making threats to those who choose to ignore my messages & friend requests. Telling someone who has clearly wronged me that there will be consequences for their actions is not a ""threat"". I consider it more a... life lesson per se. Learn the difference then report back to me. I'll be right here waiting for an apology.

5) And finally, as you can see, I didn't tag any of the women who wronged me in this message, as doing so would not comply with my ethics, but I will always respect one's decision to have their own so called ""opinion"" no matter how misguided it may be. As you can tell, my interests lay mainly in the high arts and I can guarantee you that if and when you do decide to step down off your fucking throne and accept my humble friend requests (farting videos or not) at the very least you will end up having a very compatible and knowledgeable friend.

Hopefully this clears a few things up with the more disgruntled members of the server."

12862,"TLDR: Just wait for Arma 4
This game is 10+ years old and has the optimization to match, and sever performance is never a sure thing. best way i can describe it is ""hurry up and wait"" then two hours later immediately get disconnected when your boots touch the just because this game has a fucked up sense of timing. And that is just in the moded servers. and about the base game there is honestly nothing in the vanilla version that objectively mods haven't improved upon at this point. 

 It is my honest opinion that this is not worth buying out side a sale and even then your enjoyment is hinged upon your patience."

12871,YES
12872,"Game is designed for Community play, so the quality of gameplay you get is based on the community you are able to play with. Thankfully I was able to find several great communities from Milsim groups like Arrowhead, to twitch streamers like Sheriff Eli and Finkone, and these groups will have private servers and admin communities that keep the game fun and can help any new players get setup to enter the immersive warzone that is the Arma 3 sandbox. 


I have mostly been playing the Prarie Fire SOG Vietnam DLC and it's my new favorite game. I was used to playing similar ""sim type games like ""Squad"" but this ARMA 3 DLC is so well done and has the right balance of game mechanics to make it a ton of fun and allow you to take in the world and it's contents. I often hate being stuck behind a first person camera, and ARMA has the right balance, where you can swap between the two. Some servers disable this to try and give the real simulator experience but that's not for me. 

I highly recommend ARMA 3 and the Vietnam DLC, there is no better Wargame that can compete with this currently out on pc."
12873,The game is amazing and even for a laptop the game runs great. the only thing I will say is that you need mods or the dlcs to make game fun
12874,Steep learning curve but worth it
12875,"Best Military all around shooter out, still an epic game 8 years after release. So much depth to this game, it never gets old. The modding community keeps it fresh, and just the different ways to play the game is limitless. You can mil sim, action shooter, edit missions, have small ops with your friends, or just mess around in the vast sandbox. This game is pretty much like open source software, and that is what has kept the ARMA community around so long. This game is truely for the gamers, and not like the big name companies only creating games to make money. I have logged over 4000 hours on this game and don't plan on stopping anytime soon, maybe when ARMA 4 comes out..."
12876,Great Game
12877,love this game. Especially the anti-stasi MOD and the SOG DLC in vietnam. totally worth the money in paying
12878,Just make sure you have friends to play this with otherwise your not going to have a good time.

But beware this is not call of duty, Some might find the human movements somewhat clunky compared to new games."
12900,"One of the most important an enjoyable experiences of my life and no doubt until I die. It is a shame that so many gamers out their have assumptions about what this game is like and almost always assume it's too complicated or too real for them. Simply put, you have no idea what you're missing.

EDIT: the idiotic useless AI and terrible performance is getting old now. You can see how much I've played. This includes making missions. I'm getting tired of it. It's high time Arma 4 came out. Either that or watch Arma 3 stagnate... it's starting."

12958,Overall great game still adding more maps dlcs etc. But there are a few problems such as character animations but hopefully that will be fixed. Lots of mods to experiment with. Overall great game.
12959,Game struggles to get 60FPS. Don't buy for smooth gameplay. Get Squad instead
12960,"Great game , all round modern combat simulator"

12962,Very good game! Hard at first to learn the Keys but it's worth it. The community around it is cool.
12963,well this games takes a lots of my storagee. i like this game
12964,pog
12965,After playing the game for 15 hours i would say the game is worth the price high graphics a lot of the game modes are fun.i would recommend the game to any one who like Milsim. if like milsim and have not gotten the game you should
12966,"Nothing else out there like it. Still the best mill sim to date. Great coop and multiplayer experience.

With a very powerful scenario editor and great mod support.

The only negatives I can add is that the FPS gameplay can be a little bit clunky, compared to other modern games like Squad, Hell Let Loose etc. 

And the engine struggles with performance compared to modern game engines.

Would still highly recommend it due to the sheer scale of content and replayability."

Bohemia doesnt have any real good competitors all that have tried never get close because Bohemia is always one step ahead if not more."

12989,Yes
12990,"I only have 75 hours in the game, but it's a great game, for modding that is. The base game you might find to be boring, so it needs dlc or mods. The game is worth it if you're looking for a good, fun, realistic singleplayer experience. I haven't played multiplayer in my whole 75 hours but its defo worth it with friends or solo. You NEED Dynamic Recon Ops mod as it makes the game hugely replayable and has the scenario for almost every map. 9/10, great game, just nothing revolutionary like half life or doom"
12991,"crash big time a lot
"
12992,"Fun with mods
"
12993,"The game is challenging to those who arent used to uniform mechanics, however the gameplay (when its not bugging out or siezing) runs amazingly, I remember when I bought this and played the tutorial to get a feel for it, it makes you feel like your in the games world. its immersive and its also very open to player ideas. if you discover a sidequest you can do said sidequest, however there are unscripted events that will also pop up in the world that just make every enemy encounter feel unique, however the gunplay could do with a revamp and some models could use a touch up."
12994,Good game
12995,"GOOD
"
12996,hehe brain cells go brrrrrr
12997,"Really easy to get into if you have literally nothing else going on in your life.

Also, In other games, if you spend about 5 minutes doing something boring, there's a good change you'll get to have 5 minutes of fun.
In Arma, you have to spend 5 HOURS doing something boring to have 5 minutes of fun. (If you're lucky!)

And oh my god the DLCs. The devs block about 40% of the games content behind a 100$ paywall. Holy hell.

Buy this game if you don't value your time or money. And you REALLY want to roleplay as a military transport helicopter pilot or something with a bunch of teenagers."
12998,Great game i recommend finding a communtiy to play with thou
12999,Cool game but I don't have any friends to play with

13005,"Great game especially with mods. Having said that, I've had to re download this game maybe 15 times just this year. Deleting the files, documents, everything. Something with direct x is all i can really gather. I'm also not the only one with this issue. Verifying files, reinstalling etc. Again, having said that, it isn't a good game for people with little time"

It's an awesome game, i just hope they make the 4th one"

13036,"Hard to get bored with this game and a couple of friends together working on a common objective, the amount of mods and scenarios out there give you a fresh, new experience each time. Each role, airman or infantry has it's own forms of play and allows you to figure out what roles fit for you easily. I can't see this game as a game you can experience without friends or just by yourself, it's fun to request support or have to plan out attacks with your friends, I can't say anything about public servers since I haven't tried them out and likely won't."
13037,Play it
13038,It's ok
13039,"f*ck the UAV mission, f*ck that shit so f*cked up, it's frustrating f*cking shit. Good game enjoyable :D"
13040,"yes
"
13041,"While I admire the ambitions of the game, they are built on a shaky foundation that only becomes evident way after the refund period. It is also difficult to distinguish between legitimate bugs and just poor UI choices or things you have to learn. Commanding an entire squad and being the commander of a tank or helicopter in the same game are definitely interesting concepts, but it is all completely ruined by all the bugs. Bugs that should maybe have been fixed during the decade this title has been receiving more money through DLCs.

This game is as buggy as it is ""realistic"". My very first realization that I might have bought something bad was when the ragdoll of a defeated enemy started bouncing like some glitch around the landscape after being shot. Alt tabbing makes it crash and you can randomly lose control of your squad (they're still there, but you can't control them). The AI won't follow you into buildings, sometimes it can't drive by itself, it often collides when driving and keeps trying to go through obstacles. I haven't played a game yet where my game didn't crash at some point or become unplayable. The single player experience is extra confusing and you seem to always lose the latest save or something. Indeed, I don't think I even experienced legitimately quitting the game a single time, it was always some crash or other thing that made the situation unplayable or a complete lack of any ""save and quit"" button. Even when it works, most of it is just very very confusing and you don't know if it's a bug or just you not knowing some esoteric controls.

Those are just the problems the player can't do anything about. There are several problems you can do something about, such as quickly googling for the answer, hoping that the game won't crash this time while alt tabbing (even in windowed fullscreen). If you accidentally hit alt twice you get stuck in a mode where you turn your head, which is confusing and led to abandoning many missions or restarting. Of course later it becomes handy as you can look around while running forwards, but it's really quite confusing if you have ever played any other FPS ever.

Playing on a public server you have to quickly teleport to some other location so that you don't get downed by new players who just teamkill everything at spawn (because there is no indication of who is friend or foe, which is fair in the sense that friendly fire is a common problem in real warfare, but maybe disable damage at spawn or something?).

Learning to command a squad is an exercise in fingerbending, trying to memorize which number was for which menu. And when you finally learn that to make your AA infantry rearm their missiles from an ammo crate you do F2 (or F3 etc) to select the unit (because you can't just order all of them to rearm at the same time), then hit 6 to select the menu, keep hitting 0 through a bunch of completely irrelevant stuff to find the most useful menu selections at the end of the list and use your mouse wheel to scroll to rearm. The soldier says something like ""okay"" and then does nothing. You keep trying to do it while enemy airplanes and helicopters are buzzing about. Then you read on some forum from 2014 that it just doesn't work and you have to give them missiles manually. That's about the point where you decide that you no longer want to play as infantry. I'm assuming that mine laying is also as tedious as that and you can't just tell your squad to lay mines around a city or something, and you have to tell medics manually to heal your squad, which is just dumb. Or maybe not, healing mechanics seem really confusing where you can keep healing the same person over and over. I wonder if there's a manual command to tell your squad to reload, that's how dumb the AI can sometimes be.

Vehicle controls are also somewhat confusing. There's a steep learning curve. But it's not atrocious. Actually it's a bit unrealistic. The AI gunner seems superhuman in its senses about what's going on around it, seeing things that are well camouflaged and invisible to regular human eyes.

I have to applaud some people in the public servers for their patience with new players, but scold the developers for not making things intuitive in the first place, although I suppose it's very difficult when the scope is so grand. I wouldn't wonder if most of my issues come down to just being new, but I still wouldn't recommend this in its current state. Get some alternative to this instead if there are any."

13051,"fantastic game with such a lot to offer. all the different weapons and vehicles are amazing.

lots of game modes too, play campaigns, co-op missions or pvp (my preferred type) in King Of The Hill

good active modding scene adding so much more to the game including game QOL improvements. also the modders added maps, uniforms, vehicles etc.

a very big enjoyable game with lots of value - especially considering the majority can often be bought at very good discounted prices. hard to not recommend this :)"
13052,Yes
13053,GOAT!!!
13054,pretty good for how shit it is
13055,"Great total arms Mil Sim. Land, air, and sea. Very well done. I'll currently rate it a 8/10. The only thing stopping it from being a 10/10 in my eyes is the outdated engine. I highly wish they would either update or make a updated engine as ARMA 4.

If you like a combined arms game that has absolutely full controller and HOTAS support. This is the game for you!"
13056,good
13057,"Game is decent by itself, but once you add mods this game is amazing
11/10 would reccomend"
13058,good game. much fun

Good Game
"
13060,"It runs like dog water but other than that it is great, if you can get a few friends together and play some D.U.W.S or Dynamic Combat Ops you will have a great time. Even without mods it is a very good game and will give you hundreds of hours of fun, if you don't have friends to play with then you wont enjoy it as much but the community for this game is very nice and you will find some people to play with in no time. Sale or not make sure to pick this and its DLC up, especially S.O.G Prairie Fire."

13063,great realistic military game
13064,editor is good but i dont play much online
13065,"I have purchased this game a few month ago and I absolutely love it. I will say if you are not a big fan of military simulators this game may not for you. but if you are, you will defiantly enjoy this game and this game has tons of content. the thing that makes this game cool in my opinion is the huge amount of mods to choose and they completely change the game and you can play in all types of eras like ww2, Vietnam, cold war, and much more. my favorite mods so far are the halo and the clone wars mod. this game is similar to how day z standalone works with mods if you are familiar with that. Bohemia Interactive (the developers) have introduced creator dlc which is similar to how fallout 4 has the creation club that is basically made by modders and were approved by the developers to put it on the market for people to purchase and Arma 3 recent addition is Arma 3 Vietnam : S.O.G. Prairie Fire and it is a great addition in my opinion, because it adds tons of extra content in a new time period. My final thoughts are that people should give it a shot because even if you dislike the game you can always return it for a refund if you only play 2 hours and return it withing 14 days. but if you are still not sure, wait until there is a major sale and as of writing this review you just missed a sale because they had a sale week because the launch of the brand new dlc. but wait until the next sale because I bought the ultimate edition when it was on sale and it was about $27 which the regular price is $140. so it is worth the sales. the game in my opinion the game is amazing if you like military simulators that has mod support, dlc's, co-op/ multiplayer experience, campaign, editor mode (allows you to create your own stuff and its like halo forge mode on steroids. I have had so much fun and I think you should give it a try (when on sale if your new to these style of games)."
13066,very gud
13067,great game
13068,yes yes good good
13069,garbage milfsim
13070,yes
13071,Bad servers game is dying toxic players
13072,"I have had a blast with this game. The only negatives Arma 3 has to offer is ok optimization ( encountered a few bugs). That's it. Sure there are other issues like bad ragdoll effects and weird gunplay, but all of those issues are fixed with mods that can easily be installed from the Steam workshop, no setup or time required to figure out how to install all of it. Now to the good part. This game is easily the most FUN military sandbox game ever. The base game itself has a campaign that took me around 20 hours to beat, which is bigger than the average campaign for an fps. To top that off, there is a level editor where you can create your own missions and mess around for, making it replayable for a lot of time. If that isn't enough to make you go buy this, Arma 3 has the largest modding communities ever, with largescale modding projects that add in new maps, terrain, factions, weapons, and more, one of my personal favorites being Operation Trebuchet, which adds the Halo universe to Arma. Overall, if you love modding, military simulators, disappointed by the recent ghost recon games, or just overall looking for something new go for it. Just keep in mind this game requires a lot of patience due to its high learning curve."

13077,"Strategy, ballistics, realism, and more. This game has it all!!! I you like war thunder, try it! If you squad try it! What im trying to say is any tactical game, arma can go head on with it!"
13078,pewpew though pretty boring when you have to travel 50km to get shot once and die
13079,"Nothing but fun in singleplayer and some rage as well as fun in the online servers. it may be a bit tricky to get the hang of at first but its pretty basic once you've learned the keys and most people will teach you what key does what if you ask maybe not gladly because sometimes you can hear the agony of having to teach a new player the basics in their voice but they'll teach you and that's not most people to be honest, be warned that the players mostly take this game pretty serious though so don't buy this game expecting to come and joke around all the time in main chat people will get easily annoyed but you can make a squad and talk in squad chat with a friend if that's what you're looking for. of course every game has its sweats and ppheads so don't let that discourage you just try to get better and ignore the ppheads but if you play on the same server all the time you'll most likely run into them again. I recommend no towers and infantry only for new players or just a more chill experience."
13080,it's all good
13081,great game!
13082,"While if you can enjoy the complexities of it's controls and all it's features then go for it, but for someone like me whom would be stuck trying to remember 10% of the controls most of the time, it's just not worth it. It's one of those games that need to be your type to enjoy and really I don't think you could play other games as leaving for extended periods of time would mess you up. 

If that's something you enjoy, don't let me stop you, I just personally would not recommend something I wouldn't play."

13089,i only played solo but online is where its at from what i seen from videos its the only way to play unless you want to be alone while you play solo is kinda boring but it is fun still when ever i play im now just trying to make my own missions but buy DLC and when theres a good sale do not miss you would regret it
13090,"Ill update this once I have properly played, but here is my experience so far. I started off in a town, almost immediately someone crashed there helicopter, crippling me. After wandering around for some time someone questioned why I hadnt gone to the hospital and took me to a medic, then told me a bit about how to make money. I walked my way to the apple field, hopped around for a while spamming H on tree's but had no idea what was going on and couldnt find any apples, so I wandered back to town. Then I bought a car and a driver's license, got recruited into a gang, and went on to do a heroin run. Pretty fun, it was a little confusing, I give it a 8/10."
13091,The best military simulation game for all purposes. Be it roleplaying a military unit with full cooperation and organization or just screwing around with the game's physics or in a fun PvP/PvE gamemode.
13092,best
13093,"I loved Arma 2, but this was a horrible experience. Crashed during the tutorial twice, and twice more when trying to play Multiplayer. All in the total of an hour. Very greedy DLC concept. You have to pay to use Helicopters, Jets, and Sniper rifles??? Purchased during the sale with the bundle for the price of every content DLC included is what the game should have been from the beginning.
Refunded immediately"
13094,Best MILSIM game on the market so far!
13095,"Just around 40 hours and i cant get enough of the game, normally stick to the KOTH (King of The Hill) game modes as it has a little bit of a level grinding and unlocking equipment/perks as you progress in the game which IMO makes the game play alot funner and different!"
13096,"It's not quite what I expected, I only saw SovietWomble play and had no frame of reference. The game is fun and engaging, and I would recommend. The team did a great job on the Contact DLC."

Seriously though, this is my most favorite game ever, I have no idea why it took me 3k hours to give positive review."

Sadly the AI needs alot of work if you are playing solo but it's still enjoyable.
I recommand it in sale or not, it's a hell lot of fun!"

13145,If you are looking for a good military RP game this should be considered.
13146,just one of those games you can keep coming back to over and over again.
13147,"game is boring due to terrible official servers. you have to buy so much dlc to really play the game or use weapons and vehicles. ( the good ones at least ) 90 percent of  internet servers are locked. the ones that arent will team kill you almost always. no campaign just the prologue, everything else is u gotta buy. only paid 7 dollars for this and im glad cuz its stinky"
13148,"Very good game 
Did bootcamp and I played it for 4 hours. Got into a server , committed several war crimes and left. 
Best game ever."

13152,"There's so much stuff I could mention that makes arma great. Also so much stuff that makes arma suck. But ultimately arma is a category on its own. There are milsim games that can do a subset of what arma does better. But there is no other game that can do everything arma can. If you get past the initial learning curve, a bit of clunkiness and performance issues you will be rewarded with a one of a kind experience."
13153,its really fun try it
13154,I have played my fair share of SPS games. I have all of them. The controlls on ARMA3 is the worst I have ever encountered.

I was scared I would spend alot of money and not play but it is slowly becoming the only game I play.

If you like cars, Weapons, flying , Multiplayer, or  just messing around in a sandbox this is a great game."
13160,"trash game
"
13161,"Got infistar banned due to... who knows why. 
Tried to get in contact with them as i was just randomly banned from one day to the next. 
They wouldnt talk, they laughed. Permabanned. So the game is now unplayable as a mod community is ruling over who gets to play and who doesnt. 
I've never even tried to do something bannable on arma. That would be stupid. 
But hey, these people think they're doing justice and a good job. While in fact they are banning innocent players from the game. 
well done bohemia :) you lost controll over your own game."
13162,yes game runs well if you have bad pc
13163,"I have an obsession with military history both current and past. After you get enough mods this becomes an amazing outlet for that. You can custom make missions too, pretty easily at that if you just want to mess around. If you have an interest in military, this is definitely a must have."

13165,i keep getting pegged
13166,Very good game
13167,"Really solid game over older versions, pretty barebones if you don't get mods but the community took a sandbox game and made it a wonderful one. Strongly recommend if you are into hardcore or war games."
13168,Its arma thats for sure
13169,i was swindled
13170,Awesome Game!!!
13171,"amazing game ever
"
13172,"I love the game although the new dlc prairie fire has been nothing but issues and I can't recommend it until it gets fixed. Maybe it's just on my end but the first mission has always been broken for me where I can't place the spiked ammo. It does the animation placement but nothing happens even if I stand on the ammo creates im supposed to spike. Also I know the LZ's are random but if it places you at  LZ Tokyo you are around 600 meters from the objectives where you place the ammo but you  have to backtrack over 1.4km just to get to the mission starting point and then go all the way back. Love the concept but I have had nothing but issues with it.

13173,This is ARMA
13174,Pretty awesome so far!

13184,"If you can get over the jankiness of an old game engine, this game has an insane amount of depth in its systems. The amount stuff that this game does well vastly outweighs its shortcomings in limitations and persistent bugs.

Plus, the new Vietnam dlc made my pp hard for the first time since my wife left me"
13185,fun
13186,"Can't say I recommend this. After all the hype this game gets I finally caved and tried it and it is significantly overhyped.
*The controls are clunky and unresponsive
*The game provides almost no direction or assistance, making learning the game frustrating
*It has controller support...BUT it doesn't let you invert the axis, which makes zero sense
*The maps are empty and outdated. Most buildings are just empty shells
*Inventory management and item usage are an absolute nightmare

At best this game is 3/10"
13187,The clunkiest military sim i've ever played with pointlessly drawn out steps in every game and miserable inventory management. Im trying really hard to find something to like here and finding nothing.
13188,Best milsim out there.
13189,now i can commit war crimes

13195,"yes

13196,"cool people, cool game. Although the game is realistic it really isn't that difficult once you get a feel of how the game plays. Although you get some tryhards and hardcore mill simmers (in public), you can also get some cool people."
13197,I love it!
13198,"great in depth milsim, fun with friends even if you prefer more casual games"
13199,best tactic game!
13200,hell on earth
13201,the performance is really bad i dont know how it got this bad
13202,this is a pay to play one youve already paid to play piece of shit game 0/10
13203,Worth it ! Make the price at 20-25 $ and the game will blow up again !
13204,"Take it from someone who hasnt actually played the game, it's good."
13205,"So, I play strictly singleplayer. I tried multiplayer and its taken way too seriously for me and far too hardcore. Then one server it felt like I was scrum at bootcamp being literally yelled at. I told them f* off its a game not real life and left. So unless you are into super hardcore multiplayer games with communities that go way too into a game, and don't like singleplayer, probably not for you. I just wanted to have fun, not join military propaganda. Though maybe there are servers like that, but I didn't find those.

With that said Campaign is a lot of fun so far, very much looking forward to reaching Contact campaign which looks and sounds amazing. And I added a few mods (one is antistasi for an epic 100+ hour dynamic campaign, another adds citizens and animals and a bunch of immersive world stuff so its more like a living breathing world and a third is faction stuff that goes well with antistasi). Not very many mods, but they add a TON to the singleplayer experience and makes singleplayer perfectly playable (and more enjoyable than many singleplayer games)

Besides mods, there is a lot of content by default. Though do need a lot of the dlc for that content. I got it on a super good sale for 33 dollars for all DLC except S.O.G, so I bought that extra. I'm very glad I did as well, as while its mostly a multiplayer game...like I said, singleplayer (do need mods for it though really) has been a great experience and (again) better than a lot of singleplayer games I've bought. 

Plus its just nice to see how active the modding community is, a healthy mod community is a good sign of a healthy successful game."
13206,New NAM DLC is awesome. check it out. Why so late though?
13207,"A fantastic game, I have been supporting BI games since the OFP Demo. Arma3 improves upon all previous versions. Looking forward to what Arma4 looks like."
13208,makes me pshoit
13209,It's pretty fun
13210,"I like the game its not bad. Though when it comes to the commuintys yes toxic depending on who is leading the group but most are okay. If your looking for a good sandbox game where its not like gmod phyisc then this is it, though expect some crazy s***. Now if you get this game I reccomend not trying to join every arma group on gods green earth or else you will burn yourself out within a week. I do aboustly not agree that kids under 16 should be playing this game its like cod servers on this game and we all know how that was now, other then that good game some good mods and great dlc content coming out."
13211,"Arma 3 is the successor of Arma 2 and honestly keeps the name alive.
It's very realistic, there are still dozens of popular servers of many different types. Overall this game is very fun, challenging, and there is much to learn.
The only downside, is the Arma franchise is known for absolutely horrible CPU and GPU utilization which is the main source of power for this game. I don't think there is a single person out there who can say their PC is beefy enough to run this game on maxed out settings, 1440p at 120fps unlike most other games. 

The only warning I will give you, is that if you're looking for a DayZ mod server or something like it, just buy DayZ. It runs much smoother, and will be a better experience. But if you're looking for the oldschool Arma experience and you don't care that much about performance, this game is the holy grail."
13212,Its pretty good takes a bit to get the controls down and it can be infuriating at times but over all its a fun and realistic experience.
13213,=)
13214,"Still totally worth it after all these years, got the Ultimate Edition on sale, which made it even better!
It's unforgiving, unrelenting, can be hard as nails on many occasions, but it's equally rewarding.
And the community content just makes it never ending.
I could say stuff like ""it's no CoD and other similar games"" but by this time in place pretty much anyone knows that. You wanna play with the big boys, get this. Now."
13215,Speechless
13216,I love getting shot down in a helicopter by a 45 year old man living in his moms basement 10/10 would get shot down again

13256,Its very fun and good game !
13257,Played the tutorial and never touched it again. its worthit tho i just suck at communicating
13258,"An absolutely outstanding milsim game.
Base game is a lot of fun, but if your going to play this game your gonna need some mods. Mods are key to the Arma experience as it allows you to explore new avenues that were previously unknown to you and completely change the experience. Mods let you go to Vietnam, Star Wars, 40k, hell even ancient Rome. and thats just scratching the surface of content mods. other mods like ACE3 and LAMBS Danger change how the game is played and how the AI behave, in the case of LAMBS the AI is able to call artillery using nearby artillery emplacements along with proper artillery with ranging shots.

If you decide to pick this up I highly suggest picking it up with friends. Play through workshop scenarios and then what I personally would recommend is that you have one or more of your members learn how to make scenarios in the Eden editor (Its a lot simpler than most people think.) and from there you can do basically whatever you want. I don't have any experience in the clan community so I cant speak for that aside from that it looks funs and I would highly reccomend trying to go that route if you play the game more regularly than I do.

overall, amazing game highly recommend you buy it."
13259,its good
13260,Pile of shite.
13261,very fun and realistic recomended for those who like simulations
13262,"Great! I see a lot of reviews for this game are critical of the learning process. If you're so anxious that you can't take an hour to learn how to play a game, then you should probably rethink how you spend your time."

13279,"One thing I'd recommend for new players is looking through the Steam Community guides for Arma 3, Especially the ones that are FPS and Graphics related, that helped me out a lot. There's a lot of key bindings and it is a lot to take in at first. I don't have much to complain about, I bought the game on sale and I've got the SOG in my Wishlist. 8.3/10"

I don't want to press a combo of multiple buttons just so I can change how I aim. Another thing that bothers me a lot is the fact that I need to buy DLCs so I can ride tanks and such. This is just stupid.

13320,Fun game but not for everyone.
13321,very good game
13322,"
I‚Äôve heard people who served say that your time in the military is what you make of it. Arma III, a deep combat simulator, is the same in that it largely asks you to make your own fun using its vast array of meticulously recreated military hardware and gorgeous, expansive battlefields. It requires great effort and patience before you can derive any amount of what you‚Äôd traditionally think of as gameplay from it, though. What it offers in return is multiplayer that‚Äôs sometimes very impressive and completely unique, but it‚Äôs also convoluted in ways that cannot be excused with aspirations to realism"
13323,Excellent simulator that can be fun when the AI is not a crack shot that can see through buildings and bushes. Gets to be abit much when they can see you from a kilometer away when your prone in bushes. Multiplayer can be toxic and unforgiving as most take the game way too seriously. Other then that it can be good if not for AI and pvp.
13324,"GOOD

13346,Pictures and videos of fame make it look good but its pretty disappointing. Regular crashes and a waste of  time
13347,"fun but god awful optimization. on a 2070 super and R5 3600 I get 30-40 fps despite the forests looking flatter than garry's mod and overall looking poor on less than high settings. They should not be putting so much damn time into DLC when the game is this broken, performance-wise. Also this game is hardcore as fuck, do not go in looking for an experience akin to Battlefield, literally EVERY KEY on your keyboard with have a dedicated bind. There are even COMMANDS for certain actions (CTRL + Key). 

This seems like the kind of game that's best enjoyed with friends, but it offers a decent singleplayer experience, and the Workshop page offers a lot of value for those who want a more relaxed non-competitive environment"
13348,The sandbox leaves endless possibilities for playtime. Worth every cent.
13349,GG
13350,"not good at all, a lot of bugs... nothing works..."
13351,"I truly cannot recommend this game enough. The vanilla experience is meh, but modded? Oh boy, It's glorious. All you really need is the ACE mod and Enchanced movement. CBA and CUP as well, and it will be an unforgettable experience. If you love hardcore, realistic shooters, ArmA is the game for you. It's amazing. I would also highly recommend joining a unit for the full experience. My top recommendations are: 1st MEU (A Halo unit) 501st Legion (A Star Wars Unit) The Damned 38th (A fun and non-serious unit) or the 3rdRB (A very serious unit, but very fun as well). Please, buy this game. You will NOT regret it. If you need people to play with, add me. I host operations for my friends all the time and would love to introduce more people to this gem of the game"
13352,Its Arma
13353,"Arma 3, very boring worse then its competition ""Squad"" the servers are mostly dead with only a handful of them that are full or halfway to full. I bought the game expecting a realistic multiplayer shooter against other real people, like Squad but with its own Arma flavor, since it had all this DLC and one with aliens, so I thought it could be fun.

Turns out its just a bunch of co-op servers getting generic missions and fighting NPC AI fighters with other real players helping you and the AI isnt fun at all, you could be a half mile out, impossible to hit anyone accurately yourself even if your prone but the AI can 2 shot you with no problem and since everyone is bored or doesnt care, no one will revive you, so you spawn 6 kilometers away from whatever the objective was and hope they come back to get you with a heli.

So its just a hyper realistic single player game with a ton of Co-op, fight deadeye accurate NPC servers, I will just save my money and play Squad because I want to fight against other players, not hyper accurate AI. its just an overall boring game and I guess most of the former players feel the same way as the servers are mostly empty, while Squad has dozens of full or almost full servers everyday of the week.

If you like Co-op missions with friends and randoms or single player stuff, this is the game for you as Squad doesnt have any single player co-op versus the NPCs type of missions, if you want to play against other players, grab Squad instead. you'll go down in 2 hits but atleast it will be from the skill of another player and not a cheating AI."
13354,"Absolutely love this game, It is phenomenal and reminds me of a saying by Gandhi-""Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever"""

13362,"Do you enjoy military stuff and being a dungeon master? If yes, then this is the game for you! Just make sure to have masochists... I mean friends, that willing to put themselves through the horrid mess of a mission you'll probably create. 10 / 10 would bomb my friends again."

13365,"the game I've always wanted, but never knew actually existed"

"
13367,"The learning curve is massive if you're a new player but if you check online and Reddit to find a unit there's a lot many of them that are pretty good, installing mods (free as well as paid) are pretty easy to do."
13368,"I have had nothing more but the pleasure of owning both the mac compatible copy and the current copy of Arma 3, putting up with the fantastic A.I, the absolutely fantastic realism, and not to mention that this game now takes up 30% of my second hard drive, all because Bohemia couldn't keep up with supporting the four people out there who still play ArmA 3 on the mac platform. 

Truly an amazing time, 10/10, would take up more of my HDD again."
13369,GOOD GAME
13370,yes
13371,a good game.
13372,"Good game, but holy s*** chill on the paid DLC. It's cool to have DLC, but there's far to much for this game, and almost                                                               every DLC is like $20+."

13398,"Debose ruined this game for me, he's not fun to play with.  Don't play with Debose"
13399,good
13400,yes
13401,"This game is garbage on its own. The guns are weak, the campaign is awful but somewhat enjoyable. The vehicles are shitty retextures of irl vehicles like the merkava 3 or CH-148. Anything below .30 to .50 cal take about 15 shots to kill. However, this game has the most modding potential out of any game on the market. You can play anything from WW2 to modern conflicts. Hell, theres even very popular mods for the Halo universe and Warhammer 40K. The mods especially make Arma 3's main appeal of combined arms gameplay come to life. Baffling. One in particular i wish to mention is ACE3, or Advanced Combat Environment. In other words, a realism mod. Main features of this mod are a new advanced medical system, advanced ballistics, a new interaction menu to replace the terrible scroll menu, a new arsenal and new items to go along with all the previous features. If modded, this game can be the ultimate milsim experience, however only if an experienced player is Zeusing and making the mission (Zeus is basically the dungeon master, and missions are made through the Eden editor). Get this if you have friends to play with. Playing alone is not fun, but with other people this game can be amazing."
13402,cooL
13403,the game is so difficult to control i hate that
13404,"the game really needs to add better help for new players. The tutorials are just poorly put together, the help will tell you what to do but not how to do it. there is a lot in this game. I like it, but when ever it comes to something new in the game, you're really cast into the fire to learn. and the showcases (at least for the drone((what brought me here)) are just not enough, they are just another miss  using the drone. Better tutorials thru the campaign would be nice."
13405,"yes
"
13406,Best war game ever!
13407,THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FPS ON STEAM. INSTRUCTIONS AND KEY BINDINGS ARE HORRIBLE. ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THERE ARE POSTIVE REVIEWS. AM I MISSING SOMETHING. THIS IS THE THIRD UNISTALL ON THIS SHIT GAME. I'LL NEVER INSTALL THIS AGAIN

13412,"When a Dev team is only as good as its weakest member.

Great story, visuals and general concept, all ruined by AI from the 1990s.  Its absolutely braindead.  The worst is the tank missions (which should be amazing).  Usually, after the first 200m or so, you AI tanks get stuck or route finding glitches and so you end up leaving them behind and doing the mission solo.

A real shame and  not work buying, even on sale."
13413,"amazing game if you like to create youre own missions do what ever you want this game is a good pick downloading mods is easy i personally havent made any but from what i heard from freinds its not to bad i currently have almost 10,000 hours and thats just me playing editor its a fun game only downside is graphics and how laggy it can get but its not to bad"
13414,Still having a lot of fun years later!!
13415,"Ive played countless hours of on Arma 3, from testing, running things, and making things. Arma 3 is a great game to play in general because there are countless of things you can do from ranging from like Modern ere type of mods, all the way up to like WW1,"
13416,SICK
13417,ITs fun
13418,Awesome game! I have played ARMA series from operation flash point era. Its keep getting better! keep up the good work!
13419,"Good realism, Great multiplayer."
13420,"Mil Sim Sandbox, whats not to love really, ya'know?"
13421,Piece of shit bugfest even after 9 years of patching it up.

13427,this game rocks!!
13428,amazing game with lots to offer if you havnt played it yet what are you doing

13431,Great game

13434,Fun game many ways to play
13435,"The Level Editor is a lot of fun! I haven't done much multiplayer, however the workshop is rich with content. Definitely recommend"

Missions are hard, however it's extremely fun and worth playing if you're into a more realistic combat scenario.


"

13448,"The game is realistic, fun, and allows for creativity. You can make your own scenario and play them with friends or AI. Might be a hassle to set em up without help but its worth it. What else would I ask for? Its amazing."

Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,

Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,‚Äî

To children ardent for some desperate glory,

And there still isn't any semblance of a Friends/Invite system whatsoever.
Someone needs to slap these developers in the mouth.
Don't waste your time unless you wanna play with randos all day.

EDIT: Holy crap this game is lame. Someone told me this was the ultimate game, like all games are based on this and nothing measures up...this game sucks. I wish I could remember who told me that so I could punch them in the throat."

13492,"This is the game that made me want to get a PC for gaming after having watched so much of it on YouTube. sadly, i dont actually enjoy it as much as i thought i would, however if you are interested it is so cheap anymore that its worth it just to see if it is your flavor of game or not."
13493,Constant crashes
13494,it's a good game
13495,"I tried to find BigBoobs.com, but I ended up here, worth the buy. Hard as a rock."
13496,game is fun but controls are not good
13497,Arma 3 is  a great game simply because it's action packed and may I say very immersive among the many other games that grasp the viewer's attention.

- Said no fucking human at all"
13512,Arma 3 is outstanding - the S.O.G. Prairie Fire Mod (Vietnam SF) is arguably the best shooter campaign I've ever played!!!
13513,poop
13514,I dont even own this game. How am I able to review it...
13515,All round the best combat simulator game I've ever played
13516,war crimes will be committed.
13517,is good pewpew game
13518,Amazing military game in general and never gets boring.
13519,"This is game is fun yeah, when it works, to this day I cannot get  server up and running due to how much of a technical nightmare it is to port forward for me apparently. Anything and everything within this game is intentionally complex or outdated and is generally not fun to play without friends. This sets up this game for a fail automatically because no matter how many guides I watch or do, setting up the server just isnt feasible as friends cant join the editor worlds I spend hours on working to make fun.
Would recommend if this damn thing wasnt so clunky and steep of learning curve to where it just isnt fun and is like a darks souls with no pay off"
13520,based
13521,"Fun game, mods alone vastly improve the value. Nab it while its 8 bucks"
13522,its fine ig. played a little bit
13523,I love this.

13528,This game stole my childhood and  made me a homicidal maniac.
13529,"Cool, if you don't buy the dlcs they will flash your screen until you have so many seizures that your medical bills will be worse than the dlc prices."
13530,yep

13533,great with or without mods
13534,cock
13535,when you shoot the civillian and they go ahhhh and they are all sussy like you know its pretty cool and fun.
13536,"Not as arcady as Ghost recon, more of a HC military simulator.
Good missions, lots of community content. Whats not to like.
Well, Enemies do sometimes see through cover, so there is that... 
"
13537,"Steam wants to know if I enjoyed Arma III or not.
I have 1340 hours in this game, translating to about 56 full days.
Barely any time was I bored - there is about a quintillion possibilities.

sure, its a good game - so I recommend
when it works

also game optimization is trash"
13538,NO
13539,This game STINKS
13540,"Great game, I play it a hell of a lot.  Definitely super fun when you find a good unit and do operations with them. Some things could be worked on such as physics for aircraft and definitely ground vehicles but that‚Äôs not too big of a deal. Would 100% recommend this game if you‚Äôre into mil-sims."
13541,i mean its ARMA
13542,Fucking awesome game 10/10 would recommend only if you are fully blown big cam sick cnt that likes guns
13543,Great game steep learning curve
13544,"Good game.  Enjoying it so far.  Will submit more intelligent review once I've played it enough, but definitely love the simulationist tactical gameplay here."
13545,"Once you go ArmA there is no going back. If you are a sucker for mil-sim, this is the game for you. The only series since OFP that I have ever been obsessed with. Is it the graphically best looking military game on the market? No, but good enough. Is it the least buggy? No, but it is acceptable. Is it the most ""open worldy"", immersive, realistic, varied, and free in terms of what you can do? Yes. Is it the most creative for community designers? Yes. Case closed."
13546,arma 3 = sandbox = 1000+ ways to have fun
13547,"everythings great
"
13548,"lol
"
13549,Stupid to put UAV mission without training first. This is worse than the mission with helicopter from vice city. Uninstall!
13550,"I don't need to play any more to recommend this game. This is the MOST quality game I have played in a long time. If you're on the fence about getting this game just do it. Don't let MilSim scare you its really not that complex, however that does Not mean there is not a lot to explore here. 

A lot of the basics are pretty common amongst a lot of shooters now. You most likely already know how to move around, shoot, lean L&R, crouch and prone. As for the other idk how many stances you can take, how to change to third person and look around without moving your body, how to change between your optics and other equipment, any and all vehicles except the basic's cars and trucks. have fun learning all that. hope you know how to read a compass and a map.

There is also a very good tutorial that surprised me. when was the last time you left the tutorial thinking ""wow that was a fun and good tutorial that taught me a lot about this game"". The tutorial also leads into the first campaign in a very nice way I thought. 

Fair warning the AI is very good and will mow you down before you know where they are in the beginning and weapon sway is just a little too intense for the realism it's going for IMHO.

hosting your own server for your friends Can be a huge pain in the ass unless you use Hamachi to be on a lan network or another third party app like it. But joining other servers that are up already is as easy as going through the server browser and clicking on the one you want to join."
13551,Still holds up in 2021 as the best all-round milsim available. With all the mods from the community you can play for thousands of hours and never get bored.
13552,k
13553,Very nice
13554,"the AI can be a little unfair and stupid sometimes, and the game is a bit buggy, but other then that I have absolutely no complaints"
13555,It's okay.

13580,very fun to play
13581,absolutely amazing one of the best pc games ive played so far
13582,"It's good, the game is a little choppy but it's very realistic. I got rid of it simply because it wasn't my cup of tea but for anyone who likes realistic combat games, this is it."
13583,"This game was great in 2014, but is now out competed by other games. I personally like it, but there are many other titles out there these days that do it better. 8/10"
13584,"good war game
"
13585,"Great game, plenty of tutorials for almost anything online, and mods can make a great game even cooler! Only downside is the framerate you get when a lot of stuff is going on. I like to think I have a decent PC and I lag a ton with servers near me, I can get great frames (Around 20-30) But it can drop to 2 REALLY quick. overall 9/10 :)"

13599,"This is not your COD or Fortnite game. You really have to understand shooting mechanics and angles in the environment. It truly reminds me of the time I spent in the army. One mission I took my men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, while searching for Ryan, we embarked upon a personal journey and discovered our own strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage."

13624,fun game recomend it to play with friends more fun

13626,not addictive
13627,yes
13628,"I definetely recommend having friends with this game too, playing public lobbies isn't that easy and its way more fun with friends!
Overall the game is well made with the function of having a workshop."
13629,on of the best military games I have ever played.  I would recommend this game to any one who like s to play military style games.
13630,"First time trying to get into Arma, decided to get Arma 3 since it was on sale. 
All the servers are either password locked or DLC required which is where all the players are, the unlocked and no-dlc servers are either a quarter full or empty empty. Quick play doesn't work and anytime I tried to ask for help anywhere, I'd get links to Reddit pages and whatnot telling me I need to read 9 different Arma posts before I can ""truly"" start playing Arma.

Seems like a cool game but unless you're dedicated to a virtual military group and own all the DLCs (Can't be 1 or the other, you gotta have both), you're not gonna be able to play at all. Refund from me."
13631,xf5ts43sr
13632,"I have seen some Youtube Videos about the game and It looked good so i decidet to buy it, I bought this game for 7 Euros (its not worth 28Euros). I played the game a little bit and its not like in the video at all the game is very difficult the controlls are all over u keybord so u have to play LIKE SPIDERMAN xD. I requestet a refund because the game is not why I expected. But if u want to buy this game pls buy it for less than 28Euros or Dollars or what ever."

13641,not bad at all
13642,"Despite being a pretty fun shooter, it is the most needlessly complicated game I've ever played.
It feels like the developers were given a challenge to use the most amount of keys they possibly could, Because of this, I spent 3 hours alone remapping the controls.

The Singleplayer Campaign's AI are also very difficult to fight, Able to spot you and drop you way before you even get the chance to retaliate, meanwhile, your friendly AI are so incredibly incompetent, rarely ever killing any of the combatants, and dying, leaving you by yourself against 10+ enemies. The combat lifesavers don't even heal injured soldiers.

I've dabbled very little in the multiplayer portion of this game, not from lack of trying, But because it is just as complicated as the rest of the game, introducing new mechanics that have no obvious tutorial.

There is no dedicated filter system for servers in-game, leaving you to sift through dozens of empty/full official servers, and trying to find servers in the ""internet"" tab is nearly impossible, the vast majority of them requiring Workshop content/mods or optional DLC that aren't listed. Any others are either empty or private.

As far as I'm aware, there are no traditional FPS modes, Such as Battlefield's titular Conquest or the ever-common Team Deathmatch. Again, there are no obvious tutorials for what the different game modes are, leaving you to rely on the internet for information about them, But even then, finding a comprehensive guide is difficult.

There are many other problems I haven't listed here, Such as various crashes, some performance issues, etc. I'm sure others have touched upon these in their own reviews So, I won't go into depth with my experiences.

Due to these issues, I can't, in good faith, recommend this game to fans of the FPS genre. Even fans of military simulation games should probably steer clear, though, due to the lack of competition, This may be the best/only option."
13643,"Authentic weapons and military dynamics, with great DLC available to keep game play fresh."
13644,"The biggest cluster fudge of a war you will ever be in. Love every second of it. The amount of game modes and mods out make the game playable for years and years. Just don't jump three feet or you will break your legs, also I wouldn't try climbing a latter that might go bad too. 

8/10 Ignore the bugs and get to the WAR!!!"
13645,This game has great potential for spending hours of time by yourself
13646,"A truly immersive experience, difficult and gruelling even on the easier settings."
13647,"I guess it's finally time !

After 2645 hours.

Arma 3 Is a bit of a niche game that let you do a ton of things

Don't get discouraged if you never touched that kind of game, try it out and learn !"
13648,"Remember, It's only a war crime if there's survivors to tell the story."
13649,Love this game

13652,yes

It is operator barbie... It's a sandbox for military adventures... Play someones operation, or make your own... 
C'mon... You know what it its.. It's Arma.

13654,BEST FUCKING GAME EVER THE DEVS DID A AMAZING JOB OMG IT IS SO FUN WESTERN SAHARA MADE IT BETTER

13657,Best game ever.
13658,Noice
13659,"The game seems fun and all, but there are many cons about it. First of all. The controls are crap. Im having to reach on the other side of the keyboard just to be able to look through a scope. Second of all. It is not saving my progress in missions, so 40 minuets wasted. And lastly, its just an overall complicated game. If you are dedicated to put your time into learning all the controls, how to join a server that is actually worth playing, this game is for you. I would refund it if I could, but silly  me left the launcher open all night. I would rate the game 3/10."

13667,I both love and hate this game XD The game is great with friends and the AI sometimes listen. The memes are amazing. I enjoy some of the game modes more than others.
13668,took my wife and kids but hey atleast i finally got over 100 hours
13669,This game fills me with happiness and leaves only pleasant experience.

13672,"I have to say no game has a community like arma there is almost nothing you cant do with it the editor is amazing
and what i love the most about arma is the community very helpful and detailed so id check it out"
13673,"Great gameplay, very realistic, also a huge fun. 10/10"
13674,"Yes
"
13675,"While the game can be fun unfortunately the optimization is utter garbage!

The fps would sink from 100s to sub 40s and even 30s when there is action and battle going on making the game stuttery and unplayable, this is unacceptable.

For reference I got the following specs.

CPU: i9-10900k @5.1GHz
GPU: RTX 3080
RAM: 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16

Unless you enjoy playing a stuttery mess I'd advise you to stay away from this."
13676,Its fine
13677,"The good side:
-Good military rp
-I haven't heard a single 9 year old kid
-No earrape or trash talking from other people
-I had fun but im still very new to game so i have a lot to learn
-You can go with a wet suit on dry land missions 
The bad side:
-Many dlc, some servers wont let you in because of dlc
-Multiplayer optimization is not that good i get on any setting same fps
Please remove that message:""You're using premium weapons please purchase them to remove the message"" it's annoying because it appears in the middle of the screen.
And that's all i would still recommand this game"
13678,"the most modular game ive ever played. get this game on sale and take a trip to the workshop, you dont need any dlc to have new maps, new weapons and a new gamemode to play. the core gameplay is good aswell"

1.Enhanced movement
2.KP liberation
3. Bulwarks

Don't need to find units or friends this can keep you occupied for a while."
13686,its ok
13687,its alright
13688,Very good when you eventually find a good Arma server
13689,I have no idea what im doing. But loving it
13690,"The base game is set in 2035, but you can make it any time-line with enough mods. I would say that its the mods that make the game so realistic. I love this game because it's so open, Gmod players will understand. It's also very easy to throw away time while playing, last night, i got on for some quick action, and ended  up with 3 more hours wasted. The game is made in 2006, so it clearly won't run amazing, but you can alter the game-play with some really good mods. I will say that the community can be a bit toxic at times. Thanks for reading you fucking fat ass whore."
13691,it's got war. lots of war.
13692,killer game if you get a good server where people play as it should be played. high amount of a@@holes that like to tk. other tha that great game

13705,NICE GAME
13706,This is SO GREAT!!!
13707,very goiod
13708,"One of the best military games I've ever played. The endless content, vast features and added realism makes this game incredibly fun to play. Rather than just having you run around, mindlessly shooting everyone you come across, like many other shooters have you do, Arma requires you to think about your actions more carefully. Proper tactics are crucial for victory. The realistic features of this game make it much harder but also exceedingly more immersive. Arma also seems to have almost endless amounts of content with all the different weapons, vehicles, maps and community creations. Can't wait to try the DLCs."

13739,"good game. but controls are a bit weird
"
13740,Spent 3 years in this game.
13741,"To be honest, I have a love/hate relationship to Arma 3. 

1. For one, Arma is a really good foundation in regards to being a pretty good military sim in most regards. Although it focuses mainly on infantry gameplay, it does provide pretty solid vehicular und aviation gameplay.
2. There are a multitude of different gamemodes. Be it hardcore sim with heavy rp or the casual life simulating experience.
3. One of most valuable things Arma provides, is the extensive modding and map editing functionalities. Combined with the Zeus Mode, it allows for so much variety.

[b]But...[/b]Arma is so poorly optimized, even the best hardware money can buy, wont change the performance. Turning down settings doesnt work either, since it will put more load on your CPU. Furthermore the more mods you have installed and the more complex these are, performance will drop even further. This is a problem typically encountered on Life Servers. But, I'm sure there are a multitude of problems i havent listed here.

[b]Though beside the hate[/b] Arma is a pretty unique game in terms of what it achieved and provides. Military Sims like Squad, Insurgency, or similar all dont give you the same easy to use, flexible and accessible scenario editor and methods of altering your playtime. Ultimately I will recommend it, but be aware that it might heavily disappoint you, depending on what you like to do."

It is very satisfying to get long range kills (over 1000m) because of the bullet trajectory and flight times. You really feel like you are ranging the target and taking the shot.

If you're very creative and want to make unique scenarios for you and/or your friends whether it be milsim, roleplay, racing, pvp, survival, etc. then this is for you! Now, if you're not really looking forward to making a scenario then that's also perfectly fine, there are plenty of servers and scenarios you can join or download from the workshop.

13772,"ArmA 3 is the successor to the legendary ArmA 2, and even 8 years after release this game still gets updates, DLC and support.

For playing multiplayer, special gamemodes and having a realistic army sim, ArmA 3 is superior to ArmA 2.
Also it is alot easier to get new content to ArmA 3 because there is the workshop support and multiple high quality DLC's.

But for playing alone the campaign or playing with the editor, i actually suggest you get ArmA 2.

Yes while it may be technically superior, non optimally optimized and buggy, it still has easier to use mission editor, is cheaper, has nice atmosphere, more base content and multiple single player campaigns and missions.

Still, if you grab this from a sale, you can't go wrong."

13793,Great milsim worth the money
13794,"Great game... Arma is love, Arma is life"
13795,very good game
13796,he was forced to play arma when he was six
13797,Best game ever
13798,Arma isnt bad its other people that make the game absolutely horrid and steam nor bohemia cares about the abuse of tools in the community and theres nothing that can be done about these toxic people. so really? only buy the game if you plan on spending time getting shit on people who think they know better than you when you have life experience
13799,its ok
13800,"Okay, so let me state this review is purely based upon my opinion of this game, as someone who has over 1500 hours in.

The reason I do not recommend this game is for a multitude of reasons. So, I'm gonna do a pros and cons system so that people can understand why.

Pros:
1. This game is great if you're playing with friends and want something tactical that you can play with or without mods.
2. This game has a pretty diverse modding community with people making maps, overhauls, graphical improvements, sound improvements etc. There's something here for almost everyone.
3. This game has a pretty damned decent equipment system with everything having different stats in terms of ballistic and explosive protection, and it adds a good diversity in terms of equipment.
4. This game has a pretty good community depending upon where you go, some communities/units are good but just like every game there are bad apples, that's unavoidable.
5. It's a lot of fun if you can figure out a complex game like this and what works and what you're good at.

Now here come the cons. I know some people may be angry/disagree with me but there's things that need to be said and I'm gonna say them.

Cons:
1. A good chunk of the modding community is toxic, there's no way around that. Whether it be elitism, or just straight up bad apples, some of them are just awful toxic people.
2. A good chunk of the unit/community groups are also toxic, meaning you will be constantly wanting to pull your hair out trying to even participate in them and deal with their BS.
3. This game, ruins friendships. I've lost so many friends to this game because of Uniting BS that I've uninstalled this game a numerous times,
4. This game will make you absolutely insane. There have been numerous times where the constant politics of units or communities or mod developers whatever it may be that it's absolutely a drive straight to insanity.
5. This game has bugs in it that date back to it's release, bugs that tend to absolutely break the game sometimes and cause it to almost be unplayable or will anger you to the point you want to smash something.
6. This game has major, and I mean MAJOR performance problems even on a higher end PC. There's a reason why it's considered #2 in terms of most un-optimized games on Steam right behind ARK: Survival Evolved.
7. Mods break everything a lot of the time. It doesn't matter how hard you work, it doesn't matter how hard you try, it doesn't matter how well you code a server. The bugs with this game will cause mods to break absolutely literally everything.

So, now that we've weighed the pros and cons, you understand why I cannot in good conscience endorse or upvote this game for this review. I love ARMA 3 but I also hate ARMA 3 with a burning hate that rivals the sun. This game is a mess. Always has been, and always will be. Sorry guys but this is my opinion. I understand I may get hate, but I needed to say it."
13801,"its like skyrim, with guns!"
13802,BANGER
13803,"Bad 
>refuses to elaborate further
>leaves"
13804,Pretty good actually
13805,Not bad but grossly overpriced.
13806,play with a group of friends do not play on random servers
13807,Arma 3 is a game where it takes you long hours trying to at least some of the basics. i would recommend it is very good but be prepared to put hundreds of hours into this game learning.
13808,its alright
13809,bullet go ccrcrccraacck
13810,I lOVED everything about this game from the intense fire fights to everthing else inbetween
13811,"So I'm an ARMA series veteran. My first game on the OG xbox was Operation Flashpoint Gold from 2001. It's really nice to be here after  years and see the AI is still brain dead.

In all seriousness Arma 3 is less game and more platform. It's important to understand that because vanilla arma 3 is rough. The campaign is mediocre at best with bad acting, bad AI, and a bad story. Single player in general is also awful because you have to command said AI through a convoluted interface. I have been playing these games for all my life and I still think leading a AI squad is a pain. Vanilla MP is also pretty hit or miss. There is public servers but most of the time they are pretty empty and people don't do much. Most of the times if you are playing vanilla it is part of a clan and they usually run at least one mod (task force radio)

On the other hand though the modding community is astounding and the tools ARMA gives them are wonderful. Chances are if you are going to have a good time with this game you are going to be running a lot of mods. Where vanilla is pain and suffering the mods build off the platform's core and make amazing things. Wanna good singleplayer experience using vanilla assets? Go to the steam workshop and look up pilgrimage, Hunter 6, dynamic ops, or any number of other excellent single player mods. Wanna have fun in MP? Alright, go to the server browser and look through what servers are running and see what sounds good then download the mods or find a clan. Wanna build your own stuff using interesting assets from games like mass effect, halo, or even other eras of warfare? Cool, go to the workshop. Chances are you can even find a AI mod to fix the AI such as VCOM.

That's the thing with ARMA (here's your TLDR) you should not buy the game for vanilla. If you want to have a good time your pretty much stuck buying it for a platform for it's mods. For that it is worth every penny paid and a thousand times more."
13812,There is nothing like Arma.
13813,EPOCH MOD FTW!
13814,THIS GAME IS AWESOME!
13815,Every video game could be an arma mod. I don't think you can say that about anything else.
13816,player base is very toxic
13817,boom bang pew pew

13833,everything is just awesome....operation flashpoint to arma 3.....just awesome
13834,"Old but good, creating mods is a pain. But the modding communtiy pulls through with some massive projects and customization. Its still a milsim, dont expect the rush, shoot, get shot rush. You will get hit twice from 300 meters and and bleed out unable to do anything for a while if you play it like that. Its about perception of threat, ranging, and eliminating the targets with the correct tools."
13835,Best Milsim game to date.
13836,best game probably ever
13837,"almost every server in this game is password locked and the public servers are empty. If you dont have friends, go cry in a corner. *crying cerca noises* someone freaking add me to their clan and teach me the game please, i beg you."

13842,"This game makes War Fun. Fun is good. War = Good? 

This game is great if you like commiting war crimes casually without consequence."
13843,"i don't like it because hobo on the bad company server keeps kicking and banning my boys, but now they done diddled the server and nobody plays on it. hobo sucks and i also don't like it because Jamie my pocket Aussie doesn't like it. But other than that i love the game totally recommend."

13855,"I bought this game for $30 a few weeks ago. Every time I open the game and click on any of the options in the menu the game will open a dialogue window saying it crashed due to missing file "" "" but the game will continue running, but it will not allow me to access any of the menus past the screen, except for the servers menu which never loads."
13856,"the ultimate was sandbox, the ultimate sandbox period"
13857,i love this game it is very fun recommend
13858,What if arma was anime?
13859,the game is so much fun i commited more than 50 warcrimes in 20 diffrent countries during 2013 and up to 2021 and i have no plans of stopping the count.
13860,"After a few thousand hours of infantry only gameplay I would say that the game is still worth it.

13868,"Steam says I have played an hour of this game. I never played Arma 3 before. Help.

EDIT: I bought it, played it, and uninstalled it. It's total booty. Play Bohemia's other game DayZ instead."

13881,its a great war sim ive played for about 260 hours now and still cant find a better game
13882,"Get this game!!! Its absolutly awesome! You can download mods and make it even better. There is an awesome and long campagin in this game and after you even finished it you can join a unit and play in multiplayer. This is game is super realistic so if you dont like realistic shooters, then this game is for you.."
13883,it aight
13884,Beats rubbing chilli in your eyes.. but only just. Easily one of the better games out there..
13885,armby man
13886,It's good
13887,The gunplay is a little bit wacky but you'll get used to it really fast. If you're into a realistic military simulator this game is for you. As soon as you get the hang of the controls and find a good community server. You'll fall in love.
13888,War Crimes
13889,"Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance."
13890,is good bro
13891,if you actually get into a community that uses mods like i am then it can be amazingly fun and you will meet amazing people but thats my personal experience
13892,good
13893,'s ok
13894,"God yelled at by my CO for *not* shooting up a full ambulance with my MG. Honestly, 10/10 good game"
13895,Get some milsim server with your friend and have fun
13896,"For a good year or two of my life I spent hours outside of my normal job doing a second job as a transport pilot on Operation / Liberation servers taking troops to and from AOs and providing CAS when it was called for. The mods that you can put in this game, the ability to run MILSIM D&D for your pals with Zeusing etc make it absolutely off the hook.

It's janky. Its hard. It has a million keybinds. But I love it."
13897,"There is of course a few bugs, but that's because it's so detailed. Many, many mods to choose from which are often the main cause of the glitches. Such a fun game I play it most days, highly recomend even for the price."
13898,great game
13899,"war crime simulator very enjoyable
9/10 snakes can open doors"
13900,"The grown-ups green army men toy box game. This game is highly potent, especially with mods to your preference. Want to add new guns? Mods. Custom music? Mods. Fundamental changes to the game? Mod- Oh, you get the picture. The game in its vanilla form is decent, but, don't expect anyone online to play it like that. Speaking of online, grab some friends, or join a unit. This game is easily more enjoyable with friends along the way."
13901,its sick
13902,Its awesome
13903,Epic game

13905,"rdm rdm rdm rdm rdm rdm rdm rdm rdm
jk this isnt garrys mod, this is war"
13906,for all those people who like sandbox games and destrucion  this is your game
13907,It's still epic.
13908,"Interesting game, a shooter that is more about patience and planning than frantic action.  I got it on sale, definitely worth the sale price.  Large maps and stealthy gameplay are some of the highlights.

Mod options are interesting, and there are a lot to choose from, I prefer the Dayz mod here to the standalone game, it is less glitchy somehow. Getting mods in place is quite a hassle though, each server may use different mods and you have to plan which server you are going to and load the correct mods prior to starting the game.  All you have to go off of is a list of mod names, some of which are duplicate to other names that are not that mod in the workshop. It required a little back file editing on my end to get the mod file to work with the server, because they were expecting different file pathing somehow.

Biggest complaint is that shooting enemies feels pretty glitchy, a lot of the time you are not sure why you are missing, and when you hit them there is often a delay before they do a poor animation to the ground."
13909,DONT.
13910,pp
13911,Merica!
13912,One of the best military Sims of all time and an endless modding community. Can never go wrong.
13913,"the game ran at 2 fps (13 if I'm lucky) with a pc over 2000‚Ç¨  
(I tried everything for boost fps nothing works)
I recently bought the '' Ultimate Edition '' pack at more than 80‚Ç¨ 
(I can't even launch the missions (LZ Nowhere) of the packs)
bohemia you think it's funny??  optimize your fkn game before releasing your DLC's for fk sake !!"

13938,  yes
13939,"nice
"
13940,It's pretty good the rp is really good too
13941,"This Game is great. It's sometimes called a shooter and you can definitely play it as a shooter, but it can go way beyond that and be a kind of military simulation. 

It comes with a great modding community that provides mods that add additional maps, missions, weapons, uniforms, vehicles, gadgets, game systems etc.pp., so you can heavily customize your game - just like it should be. 

Want a simple FFA-shooutout? No Problem, it's there. Want to play a complex PvE-Mission with your 30 friends? You can do this here, too. Want to play a DayZ-like Zombie Mod? Again, ArmA can give you everything you need. If you're looking for constant, fast-paced action like in a CoD-Game, you might be out of luck. Otherwise this game is what shooters really should be."
13942,its good
13943,its great looks great and plays great but make sure you get mods for this game other wise its dry
13944,yea
13945,Realism when its needed.

13956,I think this is what i do instead of model trains.
13957,"Arma 3, being my most played game on steam is definitely a recommended for me. 
From the amazing online multiplayer game modes, to the amazing replayability within the editor and zeus.

Overall the game is very good, but it lacks polish in varying areas. But these do not take away from the amazing game and franchise. Recommended, can't wait for Arma 4"
13958,I would recommend this game 100 percent. It is so fun to play with mates and to make new friends. Also they community is a really good place.
13959,
13960,"From what I played it was very entertaining and fun but I didn't play much. I struggled understanding a lot of this as it was overly complicated sometimes. The campaign is fun but is somewhat repetitive in its missions. I love how the guy giving the speech always gives the same hand motions LOL. Very fun game but very complicated, unless you intend to make a keybind out of every key on your keyboard then steer clear. Other than it being complicated its a very fun game and I'm glad the U.S uses the ACR. About time too."
13961,poo idk
13962,The game's pretty good and all but if you play this game you will never - and I mean never - have a social life or a relationship. Good game to larp in if your into that. Anyways Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself
13963,"i rolled up to a mission with level 3 armor and a heavy machine gun and got donked in about 2 seconds

13973,Great game to play with friends.  Start on a sandlot map or annex and invade to get comfortable with the controls and what not
13974,pretty tits
13975,"dope asf
"
13976,"Great game, for it being released in 2013, it's still managed to be a pretty great game even 8 years later. The A.I. are the most annoying thing in this game, and even then you can usually get them to do what you want them to do... Usually"
13977,very hard to get into but its worth it
13978,"Nice military simulation game. not for arcade players who like battlefield because it's whole dam* different :d
but for military simulation this game give me the best experience."
13979,this is the perfect war crime simulator. civilians are target practice.
13980,Nice game! My grandpa loves it (btw he is dead)
13981,good.
13982,"this game is for the extreme military type people. i figured the game might be like battlefield and i was highly disappointed.
nothing like getting shot by snipers over and over again or people shooting from their tanks a half mile away. personal opinion its a great game for realistic military sim but i dont like those type games so i wont recommend it. im sorry bohemia"
13983,love the game been wanting to play it forever and now i have a pc that can play it
13984,"Amazing game. I have had it for around a year now i think and i recently downloaded some mods after i started get bored of the base game, it added so much and this is one of the best games i have ever played. The eden editor DLC is also fun if you like making some scenarios with AI or just want to have some fun and play around with the vechiles and stuff."
13985,Saw a tank woke up at the base great game
13986,gun go pew pew as i hide in a hole getting shelled by artilerry and getting virtual ptsd
13987,"Only thing worse then my depression is flying at mach 8 2000km into the sky, other then that its an asthmatic jogging sim. Best game I have played though for milsim."
13988,great game if you love milsim
13989,"These game is not for fun. This means war and its serious.

Join any of the factions/ communities and the game becomes too realistic.
Haven't played its counter SQUAD yet, but ya its a good milSim game."
13990,As real as it gets!
13991,"Arma 3 is great if you're looking for a pretty realistic milsim experience. Obviously there's more than just milsim but that's what I play most. The game play is always great and immersive, especially with mods which there are thousands and thousands of. However, Arma 3 is rather clunky at the AI is pretty dumb. Objects and players glitch through the floor and walls every now and then, and the engine is very outdated considering this game came out in 2013. Overall, Arma 3 is super fun and even more enjoyable when you play in small groups. If we ever see Arma 4, I'd like Bohemia to keep the game exactly the same but update the engine and graphics."
13992,great
13993,:)
13994,h
13995,I dont like it people barley play
13996,"Super fun, nice realism. Helps if you have someone to coach you into the game, though."
13997,"nice game!!!!! 
pretty realistic if add mods but its has lots of bugs like if someone shot a thin tree with a 50.cal the bullet will stop but it goes threw a THICK wall"
13998,very good simulation
13999,"cool.

"
14000,
14001,Its pretty neat. The eden editor (with some learning and tutorials) is really fun and allows for u to be creative and make scenarios for u and ur friends to play. Would recommend u join a group of some sort to play in larger more coordinated ops .
14002,Yes i like the game
14003,it goood
14004,"I recommend this game today to show you that this game is one of the most realistic shooters you are ever going to play. Campaign: Meh, it is not that good. The AI that you fight against have aimbot so that is nice and your side has... no brain. Multiplayer: If you buy this game don't bother with the campaign but go straight for multiplayer it is so good but you may need a good computer because your computer is going to die. Eden editor: Pretty good for people who want to create WW3 on Greek Islands. 8/10 Good Game But Campaign Could Have Been Better."
14005,"Money is temporary.

ARMA fun is eternal."
14006,really good milsim
14007,Very Nice Game
14008,6/10
14009,i love the game
14010,"really good game, highly recommend if your after something more realistic and more of a role-playing game"
14011,"One of the best games out there, never gets old, different styles of play to keep things interesting. Originally played Arma 2 and thought nothing could replace it; grant it arma 2 will always have a place in my heart, but this game's graphics, dlc's and mods make this game one of a kind"
14012,Kill
14013,pussy
14014,sure
14015,pain
14016,this game sucks ass
14017,game sucks big nuts
14018,"One of my all time favorites, provides so many different game types and play styles.   The Devs are constantly adding DLC and giving players new things to do and explore."
14019,validating files
14020,very good def worth a buy
14021,eww no chickne man
14022,yes
14023,"The number of war crimes you can commit in this game is outstanding
:D"
14024,"""Why would you wanna simulate the military?"""
14025,its aight
14026,"a lot of bad things about this game, first bugs then a community that is toxic and cringes with even more cringe names, the serbian community is horrible, they constantly mention kosovo, mostly 14 year olds who have seen kosovo through google maps and especially have hatred for Albanians
i hate ""arma 3"" because it has a very toxic community and it's very cringe when a 14 year old ""commands"" you to cure complexes"
14027,"You will suffer. A lot. Be patient and take your time to learn how to play, it won't be easy, but the experience is really worth it!"

Good game :)"
14036,really really fun with friends and the best to run around and troll
14037,"great game as long as you can understand how to play it the learning curve is quite big.
"
14038,I HORT PEOPLE
14039,"fun game, shit community, i like mods. :)"
14040,Great game but I highly suggest modding it. The base game isn't bad but it misses a lot of great things. Modding the game makes it amazing to play especially with a group of like 5 to 10 friends.
14041,I want to kill myself. 10/10 would buy again
14042,"Absolutely everything a game should be. Love it! editing this review now that I've doubled my playtime on it, still stands as one of my favorite games, if not the favorite. :) definitely recommend."
14043,this game is base and epic and red pilled oil raider simulator
14044,lmao
14045,cock sex and balls
14046,Sheeee
14047,like real life
14048,"ive mainly play on modded servers but in a nut shell. its a great game. if you can look past strider kites, bike launchers, and weird arma mechanics lol. this game can really immerse you in  another world. the campaign itself was a real treat. even the dlc it has was worth it. i enjoyed it. i know you guys n gals will to."
14049,"great game
"
14050,"best game ever made. i cannot wait for what the future brings!
"
14051,"was in a gunfight, me and two guys taking cover behind a vehicle, one guy screams and says ""we're gonna die!!!"" then runs out into the open and gets killed instantly"
14052,A lot of fun
14053,gaming
14054,If you're into Mil-Sims or tactical shooters definitely get. Sometimes you just want to do a full op or chill with friends and not be playing call of duty over and over again same stuff different day. At least in Arma you can change roles and positions even utilize Zeus to run your own scenarios
14055,This game is boring at first but you begin to like it after downloading mods

14072,"This game saved my life

I am 29.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
14073,"I've not played a single default mission, i've only used the editor. still would recommend"
14074,Gud gaem
14075,great
14076,realistic military game
14077,Enjoy the sim with your friends on the battlefield
14078,"If my PC was better and the game was more optimized, I wouldn't put the game down.

Unplayable without others though.

Make ArmA4 and make sure the shit runs at 60 on a 1080 and I7"
14079,commit non-euclidian war crimes with ur friends
14080,the concept is amazing but even with the best of gpu cpu this game runs like utter rubbish 20fps is the norm for this game tbh i dont even know why its so popular this game has never seen 60fps especially in KOTH
14081,E
14082,You can actually play the game like Total War with modern warfare. Try Zeus!
14083,Best military game of 2021
14084,"its very good realistic
"
14085,Yes good game.
14086,yes
14087,"I just cant get enough of this game. The realism is so immersive, and the devs keep adding more content. Its a different game each time I play."
14088,Yes I love having zero idea what is going on and being yelled at by others. 10/10 home simulator

14098,"It's a good game, for what it is."
14099,"Great game, best played with friends. The modding community is what really makes this game shine. While the single-player can help people get to grips with the game, the community servers are what really make Arma 3 fun, the ability to add mods to the game allows more diversity in what you choose to do, play as or drive. While i love the mods from the community, I would love to see the Arma dev team work on some more visual improvements or advanced radio like TFAR or ACRE2. All in all though, a good game."
14100,"The best military game I know, but gun sounds and animations have not undergone a lot of investment!

Thanks @@"

14107,"The game is very fun and the modding community makes it 10 times better, I played my first 100ish hours without mods and now it is just geting better, its not fully realistic but it's just my type of game. If you're even considering it I would guess is it probably yours too."
14108,"If you couldn't make the ASVAB you wanted, don't worry, Arma III has you covered!"

14113,very good

14115,no
14116,Stealth and slow simulation game!
14117,this game makes me want to tear my hair out with OP Csat AI

I've never played squad.
Don't @ me."
14141,"Horrible.  Don't waste money on this.  Controls are all messed up, doesn't read xbox one paddle correctly, no way to assign functions to xbox controller and they will run away with your money.

Hoping Arma 4 will be announced soon."
14152,"Don't think just buy it, if you are into Military in general i always recommend this as your first time buy on PC the community here is great role plays and servers are entertaining as hell, millions of workshop mods from amazing creative people the list keeps going oh one thing don't get me STARTED on how addicting it is on flying aircrafts and the (Zombies&Demons) is by far the best Mod/Addon practically turns Atlas into your own DayZ..."
14153,No
14154,"NASA Computer is required for this game, but the game is amazing."
14155,"DOWNLOADED AT UR OWN RISK.
This game will give you an authentic warfare experience, complete with PTSD, night terrors and crippling anxiety every time you hear a noise over 60dB.

After 1 hour of ARMA 3 you will become distant from your family as your own mind consumes you.

After 1 day, you will begin to see the faces of innocent civilians killed by your A10 bombing run.

After 1 week, you will struggle to sleep and will start to have violent episodes.

After 1 month, you will run into buildings and drop stomach down when ever you hear a care flight helicopter or qantas flight.

After 1 year, ... well, we don‚Äôt really know, I mean no one has ever made it that far. The realism tears apart a soul, and before long, you will be but a shadow of your former self.

Other than that though, great game."
14156,"I had wanted arma since i saw it, besides most air vehicles being dlc the game is well worth it."
14157,Game is alright at base but is god tier when you include workshop mods like ace and DRO. Also goes on sale for dirt cheap all the time definitely worth.
14158,Get a3 launcher and enjoy life

14170,its very nice
14171,"I don't have many hours compared to others, but many a night has been spent playing Warlords and Zeus. The addicition level of this game could be compared to factorio or even straight crack cocaine."
14172,Apparently I have spent !47 rotations of the earth on it's axis playing this game. Meh.
14173,this game is great but it has glitches that they didnt fix for years but this game 9/10 it has alot of great mods and it has large community alot of modes and real fights alot of good scenarios { its a 2014 game and it's better than some games in 2020-2021 }
14174,In my humble opinion this game is a better experience than any call of duty

This game brings reality into virtual about what we called war, strategy and weapons, not to mention war machines and thousands of community mods out there brings this game has no limit in creativity.
The one and only legendary war simulation game ever in this world!"
14186,"Great game, also far too addicting. If you don't have a life buy this game, if you do then not worth losing that life you have. Accidentally already spent 3,500 hours on this game and I haven't even realised."
14187,"pew pew stop drop and roll
"
14188,nice
14189,Aw yep
14190,"It's year 2021 and still you have to set your server up manually with a 20 step guide. If you want to play with your friends in your own server, take this into consideration. Huuuuge potential wasted and newest DLC offers only in-game customization, not multiplayer support yet. I can even play BF2 online without any effort and ARMA developers expect me to port forward and set my own server. Disgusting and doesn't deserve its money."

14202,"The best war simulator out there. All the dlc like jets is kind of b.s that should have just been in the game anyway but whatever. Still a great game worth the money and great for meeting people and also hardcore military focus minded people will love this game. Every single enemy infantry, aircraft, tank, you name it is armed by real people you call in an airstrike real people have to sucessfully pull it off. This game makes call of duty and battlefield look like nerf guns at little kids birthday party. Mods also make up most of the game you'll probably end up playing with them at some point and will end up not being able to go back to playing without them. There is no b.s if you get shot once in the head or chest instant kill, you get shot in the leg you can't walk without limping or you have to crawl everywhere till a medic can patch you up and give you a splint. So i'd give this game a solid 10/10."

Yeah i guess i wont talk about that, I recommend as the first workshop items to be RHSUSAF and Infinite Stamina, Since the stamina in this is.... Yeah i just wont talk about that either, You gotta pay 100 dollars WORTH of real money for all of the addons... Sounds stupid, But overwhelming worth it."
14205,so vast and so much variety of types of playing super fun
14206,"just play zues or the campain thats really all :/ i mean when its on sale buy it! its a great game and got 74 hours of just playing zues and it feels like a real sitcom or military experiance. I havnt played most of the campain mostly because they are DLC options but when its on sale buy it. I wont tell you how its bad becuase its not XD

Fr just buy it. :/"
14207,"I purchased this game sometime in like 2018 probably. (Edit: I was wrong, 2019)
Didn't play it once until like 2020 when I did the bootcamp scenario, followed by an attempt to do the first arc of the base Arma campaign.
Didn't go well (I stepped on a landmine and died immediately). Didn't play it again.
Cue January of 2021 (or February, idk) when LateNightGaming makes three videos detailing his experiences playing the Operation: Trebuchet mod for Arma 3.
Sometime in March, a server owner of a discord server I'm on asks who would be interested in doing some Arma 3 ops.
I think I had like an hour or two in Arma 3 prior to March 2021.
I now have 84 hours in Arma 3. At least 20 of those hours in the first weekend of us doing ops, namely me playing military dress-up and fiddling with vics in the virtual arsenal (I got super excited when I learned either RHS russian or Unsung added in a Tu-95 Bear).
Need I say more? This game is frakking amazing. It's the first game I've enjoyed in ages, has a wonderful set of mods, and passionate developers both in the Czech Republic and in the community.
This might be one of the few games, if not the only game, in my library that I am giving a solid 10/10 review. While the campaign is forgettable (honestly purely vanilla Arma is so far removed from something as simple as CBA and ACE that it's actually hard to play), the physics engine is a bit janky (thankfully I have yet to experience getting arma'd in a vic or as a person), and the optimization leaves something to be desired (Space Engineers runs better than this game, and that's saying something because that game runs pretty poorly), the amazing and often funny moments I have had with my friends in the over 80 hours I have in this game make up for all the issues it has. From not understanding ACE medical and chasing down an innie in a warthog, to hitting V and going over a barrier on the top floor of a three floor building and falling, somehow only breaking my arm, playing military dress up for 2 hours, running from cover-to-cover as a Spartan II super-soldier, holding the line against seemingly endless waves of orks with nothing but my hellgun, getting ambushed by innies in the jungles of Tanoa, accidentally fragging my team on Tanoa and promptly going ""I am unbinding G right now,"" and dropping feet first into hell on a snowy island crawling with Innies, I have enjoyed almost every moment of this game. And I expect to continue enjoying every moment of this game for years to come.
(also if you make arma 4 please frakking optimize it better. while I haven't had issues with frames yet, I expect to as our unit gets bigger. I like my 60+fps)
Edit: I reviewed this game for the first time on April 26th, 2021. I had 48.2 hours in it at the time.
It is now April 30th, 2021. I now have 56.4 hours in Arma 3. 8.2 hours since I reviewed it. Need I say more.
Edit edit: It is now June 9th, 2021. I have some 84+ hours in the game. I love it."

14209,this game has so many dlcs its almost like DCS but if you wanna buy anything realy you have to buy a 10 dollar dlc and if you get this box that covers you screen for 30 seconds if you pick a gun up that needs a dlc so take that as you will have a good day

14248,"Pros;
Very easy game and a very fun with a competent unit /Friends

Cons;
Lots of zeus servers where loud Americans with bad knowledge of history try insult you or even craft extremely terrible jokes in their tiny brains in which you can rest assured if you didn't get it, they will spend the next 20 minutes stuttering and rambling on showing you how stupid they truly are. (Its best to just let them ramble or they'll pull out their rock solid sock of their own truth backed by racial slurs and commit a war crime on your house)

Also Pros;
Americans are easy to make cry no matter the age. 

This game is truly 10/10.

overall a decent game. graphics are not the best but its a really fun game none the less. lots of key bindings not a game for someone who likes the call of duty type shooter and fast pace game play. this is a tactical game and that is the way it is played with lots of action if you want and none and all if you so choose."

14263,"This game is just amazing is so many ways! Cam and concealment, ballistics, even the delays in sound from explosions when you are further away. I can not speak higher of this game, it is just wonderful. only negative aspect is that multiplayer is a bit hard to set up, but other than that small annoyance, this game is amazing in every way."
14264,"[h1]This isn't a ""game that doesn't hold your hand"".[/h1]

It's a game- and I'm going to call it a ""game"" and not a ""military simulation"" for reasons that get more obvious later in this review- that bites your hand off, and when you cry out in pain and ask, ""WHY on EARTH did you do that!?!"" it just sits there, [i]sullenly unresponsive[/i].

The problem with these games that want to [i]be everything[/i] is that they usually [u]aren't very good at anything[/u].  This is something I've encountered before, and it's a real issue in game design; there are simply points where adding more features is actually the wrong choice; sometimes less is more.

Look, I get it, Bohemia Interactive; you've been pursuing military-sim paradise since Operation Flashpoint, which I played 20 years ago, and quit playing somewhere around that awful mission with the forest the AI could see through and a BMP with perfect aimbot.  

I think everybody (well, all 10 of us, at least) who played that game back then will know (and shudder at) that reference; it was the place in that game, 20 years ago, where the computers of the day just weren't up to the tasks the developers wanted to achieve and the design just kind of fell apart.

Unfortunately, 20 years later, ARMA 3 just feels like somebody just kept iterating on that game design, adding features until the control systems were a jumbled mess of CTRL-LSHIFT-THIS and SPACE-RALT-THAT, without ever considering where it was all going.  Enemies still have uncanny abilities to see through cover; turrets have laser-like focus that seeks the player out with immediacy that feels completely unreal, and the player's experience will largely be one of frustration and confusion unless they're utterly determined to suffer through it all.

The game's clearly got a fanbase that loves it, despite all the general unpleasantness and obvious levels of jank.  The mods that generally improve it and add things like open-world systems, rather than canned missions, looked enticing, indeed.  But I have to review what the core game is, not what it's like when you finally have the Perfect Mod List... and by that standard, it's just kind of un-fun.

For a few more examples:

Little things like, ""commanding your squad is both over-detailed and under-useful"" (for example, you cannot just open your map and say, ""deploy here, line formation, 50-meter dispersion, engage if fired upon"").  Yet you can (and will have to) select one guy, via an F-key, and make 3 middle-mouse clicks (talk about awkward) with perfect timing to get them to ... board a truck.  

Three clicks (and arrow-keys, to boot!) to [u]board a truck[/u], because the AI isn't context-sensitive enough that simply aiming at the truck and selecting a ""quick order"" key was, apparently, too hard to code. Seriously? 

When things like that are in games, you know that ""board a vehicle"" was added long after the order system and basic AI was; that's not how it's supposed to be done; that kind of thing is a [i]core feature[/i].  Core features have to be polished and easy for players to use, so that they're immersed, not constantly reminded that, ""hey, this is really just a super-complex piece of software with layers of things we added later on top of stuff that was probably too complex when the game first came out... not reality"".

Besides breaking the Fourth Wall constantly through sheer awkwardness, the actual missions felt super-rough. 

For example, one point, after a truck heist gone wrong, I'm being told to save my squad and run away from enemies.  I give orders to my squad, ""hey, join me"", and... er... nothing, they're too busy staring like a deer in the headlights at the attack helicopter that's about make them little red smears on the landscape.  

Things like that happened constantly; AIs were either unresponsive to commands or didn't execute them with reasonable levels of competence, while enemy AI was either blundering around or amazingly focused on killing me. It never felt ""real""; in the real world, you can get people to follow you without being dolts and real humans can't suddenly stop and magically kill you when you're hundreds of meters away. 

Worse yet... all of the systems that were clearly meant to make the game feel ""real"" [i]did the converse[/i].  

For example, the player has some sort of (totally unexplained) encumbrance system which causes them to lose their breath in seconds if running around with ""too much stuff"".  This is clearly meant to limit player power, and that's fine, except that, besides never being explained... you're automatically larded down with all that stuff, whether you want it or not, on the vast majority of missions.  

Meanwhile, no matter how much stuff your AI teammates carry, they are are totally (and obviously) unaffected by this system and can sprint all day long.  

As another example, the player's asked to deal with absurd amounts of ""weapon sway"" all the time; the AI is clearly not affected by such problems.  

That list goes on and on, and as it became obvious that that's how things actually work, the ""sim"" feeling rapidly faded away; it's just a game with incredibly over-complex control systems, badly designed missions and game mechanics feel like they were put in as artificial difficulty ramps.

I have no idea if an ARMA 4 is on the horizon.  But... look, Bohemia Interactive... if one of your staffers reads this, take some notes:

1.  Video games need the simplest control systems possible, even for complex tasks.  If it takes more than 10 QWERTY keys and a mouse to play it competently, it's probably in trouble, design-wise.  This is a lot more work (designing contextual systems is hard) but it's worthwhile.

Somebody will chime in, ""but flight sims have more controls than that""... but, if you use a stick with buttons, you're usually good for 95% of the gameplay in a typical flight sim, on all but the most ""realistic"" modes. I'm using quotes there, because there's nothing ""realistic"" about memorizing dozens of keyboard shortcuts to do minor things a real-world pilot does nearly automatically; a real aircraft's control interfaces are designed, with great care, to be as simple and intuitive as possible.

2. AI design about humans in a setting like this, if it wants to be taken credibly as a ""sim"", needs to feel like it's dealing with all the same problems a player is.  AI should not obviously see through things the human can't, react with unnatural speed, or have accuracy that doesn't make sense.  Human players will miss a lot; AIs should miss at least as much, and probably more (after all, you seem to design missions where I routinely had to kill 10 guys all by myself).

3. Games where there's a command element need to consider that part very, very carefully, to ensure it's simple, fast, and easy to use.  The way it's done here felt tacked-on, frankly, which is hard to understand after 20 years of basically making the same game over and over again. Mount and Blade did a pretty good job; for something as complex as this, and I'd suggest something like the Spring RTS's command system, where the player can, for example, draw a formation line on the terrain, and where selecting a single troop and giving them a basic movement order in the map is simple, fast and painless.

4.  Ditch the UI and start over.  Really.  It needs to be elegant and intuitive and most of all, not get in the way of actually playing the game."

14342,Great Milsim!
14343,"The Engine sucks, but if you can get past that then the game can be alot of fun with the right mods and community!"

14348,It fun
14349,"Arma 3 is a military sim, don't expect fast-paced action like COD or Battlefield, if you're looking for a realistic military simulator with an active modding community, this is the game for you, if you're looking for another generic FPS like COD, this is not the game for you"
14350,"Amazing game, even better when paired with many mods available for it. 
Single player is amazing and immersive.
Multiplayer is beyond words...

If you enjoy this genre of game, this is most certainly one you should pick up."
14351,cancer.
14352,i mean its alright
14353,A very fun sandbox game. 100/100 would recommend with or without friends to play with.
14354,its lit
14355,its pretty fun
14356,"Look despite me giving this game a thumbs down I'll be the first to admit that this game has given me hundreds of hours of fun. And some friends that truly shaped who I am today thanks in part to the units I joined and the op's I did with them. I had some of the most memorable times in my gaming career in Arma 3. It will suck you in because there is no game like this that is just a straight up sandbox where you can do whatever you please thanks to the myriad of mods this game has.

But I just cannot recommend this game to anyone anymore. The game runs like shit even on good hardware due to how unoptimized this game is. The AI is either crap or just straight OP there is no in between. The gun play while fun feels so loose compared to squad or really any other game. Despite being a milsim they have a really rudimentary systems to simulate armor for tanks etc. Getting Arma'd (its a term when Arma just fucks you or does something weird. It happens more than you might think). Like I hate that I have to write this but all we really get is just DLC's now. And like thanks that's cool that we get DLC's but the game still has its fundamental problems.

Like look when you get this game and you find people to play with consistently you'll be sucked in and love it. But slowly you'll become more and more annoyed with the game because of all the problems (and more) stated above. You keep coming back because there is no other game like this. A true fuck all sandbox where you can do whatever. But you just realize over time that this game becomes a chore to play because of the problems."
14357,This game is amazing i wish I got it sooner then I did
14358,"Big balls LDF, blows up Altis,Fuck you Malden your next."
14359,"great gameplay good landscapes, I only play modded version so they can be a bit buggy but you can look past it for the pure enjoyment of game"
14360,"good game, but needs people to play with"
14361,"This game is probably the best that there is. The editor is like a military version of legos for adults. The campaign(s) is an appropriate size: meaning it doesn't pad out everything. Multiplayer maps are kind of hard to jump into, but if you're tenacious enough you'll find one. Overall, I'd highly recommend to anyone who enjoys shooters that lean towards realism and let you operate a wide variety of military vehicles."
14362,i never write reviews but honestly this game is a must own.
14363,Good game but mods make it better. RHS and CUP is a must.
14364,Good
14365,WHERE THE INFAMOUS ARMA 3 AND SHREK YOUTUBE VID CAME FROM

14370,"Had some technical difficulties due to no fault but my own nearly failed to get a DLC to launch.  Honestly don't know why but every time I would click on DLC or Mod Tabs The game gave an error which read Please close the game in order to work on mods/DLC's. I don't know what actually fixed it I restarted it then I reloaded it Like I said I contacted Steam for refund which I'am thankful did not go through at least not on the main game. Then out of no where DLC started working correctly and now am playing one of the best military simulators ever. I highly recommend Arma 3 and its DLC. Thank You Steam for understanding my frustration. Next Time I wont be so fast to hit the refund button Sorry! I would like to express disappointment in customer satisfaction If you look at The amount of games purchused by me  vrs number of refunds,,,its not even close. If I dont violate your rules then why question the refund. Arma hasn't exactly been a shining product of performance history since its launch. Yet I have faith,"
14371,Still haven't run out of stuff to do

I AM RUSSIAN AY"

14374,it's alright when you are committing sex crimes in third world countries
14375,40 FPS
14376,"Arma III is still worth the buy even today. for me its the exile mods, others its king of the hill. in my opinon, it bests the standalone and brings me almost closer to the dayz mod from arma 2 but with much more to offer. I have yet to find any other game that can compare or make me sweat it combat as much as this game. its arguably still the best military shooter out there."
14377,good game hard controls tho
14378,i feel more obliged to insert a anthrax laced needle into my head than play another god forsaken hour of this bland repetitive and poorly aged game. Praise the lord i bought it on sale and not waste any more of my money on this utter squalor.
14379,"Very Nice!!!!!!!!!!!
"
14380,Best combat sim in existance. Has some probs with MP stability but its bearable.
14381,if you play arma without mods your missing out
14382,this is a fun milsim. and everyone should get because the developers still update this game and also the workshop mods you can get for it is amazing.
14383,fuck this
14384,yes
14385,I guess it makes for a fun evening or two once you find a great community.
14386,This game is super addiciting if you love military stuff. I bought it 3 months ago and I already have 550 hours lol. I wouldnt recommend if you have a busy schedule. Very good game.
14387,"good
"
14388,Its arma
14389,.
14390,"This game has all the tools of an excellent milsim experience. Many people have a great time using multiplayer and so do I from time to time. However, this game is a complete disaster from the single player perspective. The campaign is so buggy that it basically can not be completed without lowering difficulty, researching forums, or reloading hundreds of saves to complete a single mission. For example, in the final mission of the first episode many players are prone to the commanding officer being killed before reaching an important trigger to start the next portion of the mission. You end clearing out an entire town, you were never supposed to clear (solo) and then the mission never ends. If someone didn't tell you why this was happening, this would be the end of the campaign for you. 

One of the final missions, requires you to defend a city from a large infantry and tank attack. You have a squad of stupid AI however which basically do nothing. If the enemies even set foot in the town you automatically lose. The tanks are super powerful, but there is no tutorial or instruction on how to take it out. You end up reloading lots of saves just trying to figure out the tanks predetermined path so you can call strikes in advance of it actually showing up. 

The story is not award winning, but interesting enough to keep you going. Unfortunately the frequent breaks in immersion throw a wrench in the works of what could be an amazing campaign. Some missions are very exciting and compel me to come back to this game from time to time. For a casual gamer, who is more interested in casual campaign rather than a strict milsim multiplayer lobby or chaotic mess of a king of the hill match, this game leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dlc campaigns do ""look"" interesting, but I have learned my lesson."
14391,Honestly Arma 3 without modes its Nothing!!!  But this game very good for old school shooter players so dont waste your time and play this gold
14392,nice.
14393,The only game I keep coming back to - Though I would drop the DLC spam and start looking forward. The game has survived because of Mods and its sandbox features but the engine in this 2013 game is starting the show some rust when compared to newer games.
14394,its okay i guess
14395,If only i had friends....
14396,gg coulde by better
14397,"A rare gem in gaming. A true sandbox modern military game. Get it if you like a bit of roleplaying.

Edit: 4,000+ hours later...

It's still the best sandbox with wide array of mods and great DLCs and also CDLCs."
14398,"Before I played this i had a dead end job, no GF and Randomly pulled my shirt over my head and yelled ""i am Cornholio"". None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good.
huh huh huh i said pulled huh huh"
14399,poggy
14400,this game is the absolute best with mods completely changes the game
14401,"10/10 got a vac ban after 1000 hours of fun, would recommend"
14402,Bing Bing Bong
14403,I hate this game so fucking much
14404,Its ok
14405,"gun go pew, but like, realistically"
14406,"sit for 3 hours, hear gunshots, get shot, sit for 30 mins while medics try to revive you, bleed out, do it again"
14407,"fun, serious, sim, fun fun fun"
14408,Anytime you see something cool and want to use it the game says: OH SORRY THAT'S DLC PLEASE FUCKING PAY TO USE THAT SINCE WE SHOW YOU THE DLC ITEMS SO YOU BUY THEM BECAUSE WE ARE FUCKING POOR LIKE EA GIVE US MONEY! But other then that it  is fun.
14409,amazing
14410,awesome
14411,It's a really great MilSim. Met lots of new friends through this game.

14413,ya
14414,10 out of 10 would bang again
14415,Amazing game tons of things to do.
14416,"Top tier game, recommended to anybody who is mature enough to role play with a little humor. Community is very funny and mods can be installed without download. No bad parts about the game, some content may be advanced so youtube guides would work. Servers are awesome to push objectives with teammates, and choose a role to help!

Scenario i encountered while in game:
Going over the ocean on a blackhawk helicopter avoiding missiles from enemy fighters, dashing our way through the sky in hopes to live, with the screaming sound of the alarm ringing in our ears. We knew this was the time to panic. As we nervously grab our parachutes to escape to land, we see bullets flying everywhere, knowing this could be our last moments. We are about to crash down when allied jets come in and wipe out the surrounding targets, clearing out any gunfire. Thanks A-10, you will be forever in our debt.

This is the type of action you encounter daily in this game, and i hope you can enjoy it as much as i do."
14417,yes
14418,"yes.



this is all i have to say"
14419,veri gud
14420,yes
14421,Nah Yeah
14422,just got kill by a flying welding cart
14423,"Single Player, Editor, and community-run multiplayer servers are all very fun, can't get enough of em.

Contrary, the Official Servers are an absolute headache. Only part of the game i wouldn't recommend."
14424,"I love this game, just like I did Arma 2. The only downside is all the dlc that you gotta pay for which can get expensive but overall I recommend it. This isnt just a military sim but a civilian sim or a Dayz style sim or a resistance sim. The point is the community makes the game better with mods and unique servers."
14425,it is a really good realistic shooter
14426,best game 10/10
14427,"+REP good game enjoying it 
"
14428,"Loading screen looks pretty good ive seen it for about 120 hours, game is nice"
14429,It smells good
14430,"When I first looked at this game, I was taken back by the realistic feel. I started playing the campaign. The single player stuff is kinda cool, but not very realistic in my opinion. I was left bored. It was only a few months later I discovered that you have to  find a squad on the Arma 3 discord server to experience a real milsim. Since that time I've loved playing milsims with mods.  The game is graphics and processor intensive so it runs at a lower frame rate then I would like (50 fps). Truly a different experience and a wake up call for someone who has grown up on high octane ""shoot em up"" games."
14431,"Great game, 100's of thrilling hours waiting for your attention. ¬£ to time investment makes the game practically free. Enjoy !
p.s. so many dlc/mods and active communities to suit everyones cup of tea :) TTFN"
14432,"Accidentally bumped a cycle with my Main Battle Tank.

I am currently typing this review from Mars."
14433,is good
14434,"Epic gamer, spent too many days on this, near 300 hours on review"
14435,LOl
14436,BY FAR BEST MILITARY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED
14437,"After 1500 hours I can safely say this is the best shooter of all time. The online vehicular warfare is unmatched, in particular the RHS koth servers. The long range sniping on PVP servers is one of the most fun things you can do. If you aren't patient then forget about it, but when you score a kill from 1.2 kilometres away it is quite satisfying. I once got a 3.7 kilometre head shot with an IGLA through an Apache's cockpit. If you are looking for a new shooter, THIS IS IT! Would highly recommend, Arma 3 is one of a kind."
14438,gun go pew pew and artillery go brrrrrrrrrrt on city's
14439,Goooooooooood game
14440,"Great game, l would definitely recommend to people who like Mil-Sim roleplays."

14447,fun mil sim with lots of different game mode for many different experiences
14448,This is an amazing battle sandbox/editor perfect game for people who love making battles and realistic battles
14449,do not buy this Stuff if you are player . ARMA3 is not a game .IS A MILITARY SIMULATOR . that mean you  should stop laughing for nothing in game stop chilling with friends . stop Rushing . you need more patient and dicipline . if you cant do it PLEASE STOP F... OUR WISH . i leave this game just because of no good milsim clan finded . in every clan just doing fun fun and fun . maybe someday back when i creat and run my dedicated server with serios multiplayers . or mariens exprience player .
14450,"Shit game, Shit communities, a black hole of time. Its a game which claims to scratch that Milsim ich in the small of your back, but will fail time and time again to get it. Trapping you in an endless loop of desperation and hope of something good coming out of it. But trust me, nothing ever does."
14451,The best military sandbox out there. The Escape mission alone has given me and my friends hundreds of hours of re-playable action. Same goes for KOTH and Antistasi.
14452,Awesome
14453,very good game a little hard to get into at first but fully worth it
14454,With mods the game is amazing. The countless hours
14455,"Accidentally created and detonated a nuke in one of the first missions of the game. Would recommend to everyone who likes guns, especially if you like committing war crimes."

14471,yeah its ok I guess
14472,Game fails to run above 45fps and averages 30. A.I have literal aimbot and can shoot you through walls without you ever interacting with them. Players are sweaty cunts that have 4000 hours on the game and live in their mums basement.

"
14474,It is very dependant on what you want out of it. Very fun.
14475,"Great tactical military simulation. Challenging, intense and really good fun. A decent PC, not even a good one, just a decent PC can run Arma 3 with almost no issues. I have a mid range Lenovo gaming laptop and I can run Ultra and maxed out graphics with no probles at 85 (average) FPS. Long story short, its a low cost game with tons of fun to be had and made for yourself and friends."

14480,"A fantastic base game for literally thousands of community-made mods. And they are what makes it so good - the mods. Performance of the game could be much better but they are limited by their in-house game engine. From Roleplay mods to Milsim units, you can do it all in this game. Highly recommended."
14481,"Arma is a really good game if you like slow pace shooters and sandbox elements in games, I tried it out and I found the difficulty curve crushing to be honest but back then i was looking for arcade leaning shooters that are quickly rewarding such as titanfall 2 , Im coming back to it however with it offering me exactly what i want. Slow paced shooter with a need for communication with your team mates and long thought prior to engagements, Its a great game to mess around in with friends , I do suggest looking for other games if your looking for the same feel but without the waiting *cough* squads *cough*  But the promises arma 3 makes it genuinely delivers and i really like it. Just be advised if you dont like all the additional paying for dlc and your a stingy prick like i am you wont be to fond of that either, Cheers for reading"

14519,"I haven't played Arma 3 long now, but with what I have seen so far I'm greatly impressed. The attention to detail in this game is stunning and it is very accurate with how a lot of weapon systems, vics, and styles of combat(if you will) are depicted. I also quite thoroughly enjoy playing on player created servers and game modes and think that the sandbox aspect of the game is very well put together."
14520,Commit war crimes from the comfort of your house.
14521,"Still one of the very best military sims out there, the community is vast and passionate, so there is always something new to try out. would highly recommend it."
14522,"My favorite part of Arma 3 is the ghillie suit, the mods, and the community as well. Making new friends, I have made many new friends while playing Arma 3. I also enjoyed several game modes, the zombie game mode, through mods, the roleplay servers, and combat servers, I enjoy both official and community servers. I like the third person shooter option element as well, third person, one of my favorites, first person, its alright and decent, but, I like the third person better."
14523,Koth is best game mode
14524,"this game would be fun but you know the human population, it has some fun aspects around realism and combat which are cool, but if youre not the typical gamer chad or wannabe marine in middle school, the people in this community are probably not for you. if u dont play by each persons rules and how their set of rules on how the realism should be set, be ready to be toxified. i could get over the glitches and bugs but not the community"
14525,"good fun
"
14526,"Loved the mission editor.
I like ArmA 3 as much as Little Big Planet (PlayStation), because even though these games are SO different, both give you absolute freedom to create your custom missions.
500 enemies or none at all. The mission ends when the task is completed, or it never ends. Night, day, hour, fog, 1% or 100% wind (which affects the direction of the bullets).
Enemies, allies, neutral, civilian, all kind of equipment for all characters. Waypoints to make them move, when you want them to move (besides your own squad commanding system).
Real military simulation missions, or Alien: The 8th Passenger if you are using mods! (easy to download through Steam Workshop).

The mission editor is easy to use, I think, and additionally it has advanced options, or even scripting if you know how to use it!"
14527,"Fun game when you play with people
Besides that eden can be a little fun"
14528,yes
14529,"good show
"
14530,"COOL
"
14531,"It has amazing gunplay, a singleplayer mode for learning, it has really good maps and mods, but the online  part of the game sucks.
The quick play menu doesnt have a single good server, and if you dont have a premade unit or server you and your friends play on, you will spent a lot of time searching.
Overall score: 8.5"
14532,"Still figuring it out, but so far I've had an absolute blast."
14533,I got stabbed by an Arabic ninja and then my teammates called me a idiot and left me to die.
14534,I really enjoy the freedom and the friends I have made through this game. So many hours later and I can still say it feels new every single time. Absolutely recommend this one.

14554,"This is probably the best all around game on the market. I would like to see more detail in the aircraft, but this ain't DCS World and DCS World does not offer the chance to fly a helicopter into combat and come home, land and get out, get in a waiting vehicle and drive off. Gotta love it!!!!"

14560,"Graphics are no longer up to date. The controls are clunky. The learning curve is steep and long. BUT if you put in the hours and find a great community the game is great fun, produces unique moments and some of the best memories regarding a game that you ever had."
14561,the game abandoned by creators '-'
14562,The game is great and all but it's also a rip-off. All of the content you have to pay to download is in the game. They charge $30.00 for the WHOLE GAME with ALL OF THE CONTENT. You just can't access all of the content unless you pay up for the DLC's that some game content is divided into. It's unethical. I say we demand a change in these cash-grab tactics. It's unethical and we gamers are guilty of letting them get away with it because we have paid for it in the past. I say it's time to change the game industry and tell them no more micro-transactions.

14568,good
14569,"this is not COD, dont expect to use full auto unless the enemy is standing on your face"
14570,"Arma 3 is the best military simulation sandbox on the market! I love everything about it, including how it is still kicking butt 7 years later!"
14571,Mods
14572,"The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves."
14573,W
14574,Great military sim for people who like spending an extra $100+ after purchasing an entire $30 game to unlock all of the official content. Also great for people who like fighting terrorists at a stable 15-20 FPS on decent machines.
14575,Might need a bit longer to make a decision but its got a good first impression.
14576,"Theres still no match to Arma 3 and the game it is today thanks solely to its dedicated content creating community (Not the devs). And if you are want that complete milsim experience look no further, but just dont get too invested and drawn in for to long because the low frames and rage inducing performance issues will eventually drive you insane the more you play to the point where you are passionately hatred."

14586,"This game saved my life.

I am 45

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

For the beginners ! Don't start downloading mods straight away on Arma 3 . This could lead to game not working probably and mods will not working properly with other mods so pls if u want to play mil- sim or some other stuff that u saw on YouTube or other platforms so check this discord server out it could help u too find the friend or a whole squad to start ur adventure with them. Also to Understand game mechanics and what mods you should download and which u shouldn't download.

Hope this Review will help u , to decide if this game is the game u searching for :)

14599,Decent.
14600,"Great game, just downloaded WW2 content, I really want to do some Commando raids as well as more content from that period. Game is fun, can't wait to play with others and fight some battles. Also, it seems very realistic."
14601,Needs more tutorials built in for Eden... (but all around amazing experience)
14602,"Definitely recommend Warlords and Zeus, especially if you happen to get a good lobby where everyone's able to have fun.

And if you into some Hardcore stuff, try and find a Unit / Community that does that kind of thing, However you're likely to need a shit ton of Mods."
14603,One of the best Milsim games I've played. Game offers a wide range of situations for Milsim combat. However the game includes a casual side for a more sandbox feel and enjoy the wide range of in-game assets and an extensive library of mods to download and play with. Overall definitely a game to check out!
14604,dont have it
14605,"You choose the way to play this game. Depending on what you want, you will most likely find a mod for it."
14606,"This game made me realize I need to go outside
10/10, would blow up a friendly team with an RPG again."
14607,"Military simulator
10/10

14608,"learn the scripting side of the game and you'll be amazed at the options available in the world of ARMA. Purchase of the different DLC isn't mandatory per-say; but the abilities and features provided within will increase the pool of assets at your disposal.  Lastly, there are controls for everything. I advise spending time keybinding your keys ONLY after you understand their uses.  All in all, i'm an ""ArmaHead"" for life. cant wait for 4!!!!!"
14609,"Really good game, realistic, tactical, and great to play with friends. Lots of missions to do, and they all tie into each other, making it hold together a story line or allowing you to branch off a bit with your imagination. The DLCs are smooth and enjoyable and the mods are good, and the game itself supports mods very nicely. I do have issues with the BattleEye software but nothing too bad, just disabled it for now. Would reccomend overall."
14610,"love it bruh i recomend youn watch some vids on youtube and get a feel for if you like it :)
"
14611,even a hamster runs better than this.
14612,Good Team Game.
14613,"around a day worth of play time spent, i havent had luck with getting into online matches such as the things you see on YT with people doing missions together, but i have had good fun trying to make and figure out scenarios and doing little battles and having fun with other comminuty made scenarios too, id recommend this game, yes."
14614,"You have to ba a full-time gamer to actually have fun in this game. If you go multiplayer, it'll be boring as fuck (In PvE) unless you have a fuckton of friends or know a lot of people who play this game. Singleplayer is just in the game, serving next to no purpose AND if you have a shitty PC like me, the game will just freeze for a few seconds, unless you have to set the view graphics and view distance to minimum (wich is pathetically short)"
14615,Its Arma whats not to love
14616,amizing game
14617,big gud yes
14618,"Mods gave us ""haha flamethrower goes ffssshhh""
DLCs gave us aliens and napalm
In my opinion, napalms smell in the morning is the best smell ever
So is the game when you have good scenario and someone to play"

14620,It's pretty good.
14621,the bull---- is real in hear just get it on sale
14622,it gave me tinnitus
14623,gun go brrr
14624,love it and the people
14625,"Play it with friends with mods and it's going to be pretty dang great. Don't expect any good performance, though. Arma 3 is the great performance equalizer. No matter the hardware, 30fps is a distant goal."
14626,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

14633,When are you gunna make an M1 support I need this on my MacBook Pro as my pc died 5 days ago
14634,"Im Not Even Kidding, Theres Seriously, Not enough content"
14635,Most realistic milsim game you will find
14636,"I have been loving this game as a multiplayer game with friends although there are some glitches/bugs.  You have to keep in mind this isn't Fortnite where you have shields and can take a  bunch of bullets or where you can run all day long and then be able to aim real nice.  Getting tired affects your aim temporarily.  This is a game that focuses on some degree of realism as much as a video game can provide.

Pros
Combat feels very immersive to me.  I feel like I am a soldier in the jungle with danger lurking around every tree or bush.
Great array of weapons to choose from.
The vehicles are fun to drive or fly.
So many mods out there that you can find MANY different types of experiences that are not just ""shoot these guys"".
You can run your own server and play with friends if you want full control of everything.
Missions can be very long or short depending on your preference.
You can build your own missions.  Sandbox.

Cons
I have seen some of the modded zombies walk through closed doors.
I have hit a person with my armored vehicle and I have gone flying through the air.  Sort of funny to me.
The server can be a little difficult to get optimized so it doesn't feel jumpy but there are resources out there for tuning.
The vanilla AI is a little stupid but there are plenty of enhanced AI mods that will make them MUCH better.

All in all, I think it is a great game even with some of the glitches.  Some of the ""Capture The Island"" servers/mods are AWESOME.  Look up Overthrow, Liberation, or Antistasi and see what you can do."
14637,"Its a really good game, but there are some bugs that are needed to be fixed, but in all its a really good army simulater game."
14638,mecdix w'ont res me' :(((
14639,Almost 2600 hours and i still enjoy it!
14640,"love the combat and interaction aspect of the game loads of fun with friends 
"
14641,"Great story, but a lot of walking from Point A to Point B, then being told Point B is fucked, so go to Point C. LMAO. Still haven't checked out multiplayer. I doubt India even has an ARMA community."
14642,"Not enough content. I got bored after about 2100 hours of gameplay. Very disappointing, Bohemia should be ashamed."
14643,"A wise man once said: ""can you zeuz heal me i got armad"""
14644,very sex
14645,good game
14646,"Major learning curve with the game. Game modes that are mil sim and other game modes where you just have fun. I recommend Warlords for newcomers, It will teach you alot and help you get over that major learning curve. 10/10. A must buy. I love this game more then any other game."
14647,Simulator perang terbaik setakat ini

14656,"Honestly game is great in almost every way. Only major things to note is don't get this game for the single player at ALL. Campaign is buggy and honestly any other solo things just aren't fun for long. Game also could use a hub thing for new people to find groups. If you came from Roblox Groups (like me) You will get to speed quick. Basically same thing but more features, voice chat, and a lot more walking..."
14657,Squad is better

14667,yes
14668,Play this if you're willing to be brutally taught movement mechanics and patience. 8.5/10 cause i'm still mad at Viper.

100/10"
14686,"arma is the best. better than cod, counter strike, fortnut every damn fps game you think is good, none of them can compare to arma3.

none of this role play baby stuff.

 making maps to kill targets jump out planes and really just creating fun missions, this is the true game for FPS"
14687,"This is a legendary war game in which you can feel every sense of the atmosphere going on! I recommend buying straight from the DLC. The most ambitious war game of all the games that exist at the moment of the present stage. An interesting plot in which you can play one player, there is also multiplayer and squad with friends. Dozens of units of various weapons and equipment, equipment, modifications for them. Here it is up to you to decide where, at whom, from what, where, from where to shoot, and not according to a given algorithm. There are forests (mines are laid in them, be careful!), Cities, individual buildings, roads, plains, bases, islands, mountains.
The most realistic fighting simulator, and no other game compares to it at this time. Very large-scale gameplay, you can control everything and how you want. It is necessary to go through the training carefully, because it is important and exciting!
This game should be in everyone's library, it justifies its money.
We are waiting for ARMA 4 :)"
14688,"I basically have a love hate relationship with this game. The graphics aren't all that great, the player can not switch from first or second person, The items that I need can not be found easily. The Vehicles seem clumsy, the controls for the player and or vehicles are not easily found, and if found not easy to use. 

I suggest Bohemia Interactive go back to the drawing board if you will. Go and play Ghost recon break point and you will see everything is very easy to use. 
I will give credit where credit is due, about the only thing I like about the game is that its a sandbox MILSIM that i can make my own scenario / story line"
14689,Najlepszy pokaz slajd√≥w w jaki gra≈Çem.
14690,Amazing
14691,"Really good game, performance has really improved with new patches"
14692,"Best Milsim game out there, with all the mods on top of a fairly awesome playerbase, this game is worth the full price of admission all day long."
14693,"Downside: all DLC is necessary. 
Upside: Replayability is unlimited."
14694,"The game advertizes milsim. The reviews say ""oh yeah, best game ever i reached nirvana playing this""

but really, its either lag, a bunch of toddlers with no leadership getting lost and crashing their tanks, getting airstriked without knowing WTF is going on, or GTA but with the army, where everyone can summon mbts and fighter jets from convenient little sky packages and it becomes battlefield, but you dont see the enemy and just bleed out in a puddle of your own urine."
14695,"I guess it's was fine, the game has gotten old and reached it's full potential, a new game is badly needed to replace it and all we get are DLCs that I will open once and forget."
14696,Arma 3 is an amazing testament to the capability of a shooter game. Highly sophisticated mechanics available yet easy enough to play.
14697,gg
14698,niceeee
14699,Great game find some friends and go into a zeus lobby for the best experience.

14707,"its a good game i assume its pretty realistic but has tons of keybinds kinda annoying but you get used to it 

its not just the game that is enjoyable but its also the community, on one hand you have the super serious players that just want to play the objectives and take as a milsim instead of a super fun game which i understand wanting to RP, then on the other hand you have the players who wanna have fun messing around with all the available game roles

either way you play it is extremely fun

14711,its a pretty cool game that's a ton of fun with friends but can be enjoyable with Single Player
14712,.
14713,"God, i wish i bought SQAD"
14714,"Arma 3 has given me more than 3000 hours worth of gameplay. Even though I am extremely deep within the game hour wise, it still teaches me new things I never knew how to do way later into my career. It gives the player endless replayability due to the nature of combined forces. You can always hold an island from attackers, secure and escort a hostage out of a AO (area of operations), assault enemy compounds, and much more. If the AI can do it, so can you. (Other than clipping through walls when there is too many modules or AI placed). With mods it makes the game even better, this can cause your vanilla LDF vs NATO or AAF vs CSAT operations, into a full scale world war involving the Germans, Russians, Americans, British, AAF forces, Chinese, and more. Those were to list the popular armies seen within Arma 3, but that is not all; Arma 3 modding can support the undead. You can recreate scenarios from WWZ if you have a good enough personal computer, or have a simple rescue civilians from a town full of infected, or download ravage and have a good time playing with friends, or solo as the world changes around you. Overall i'd give Arma 3 vanilla a solid 7/10, with the modding community still going hard, i'd give it a 9/10. The community has made Arma 3 amazing as it is now, and everyone can agree when I say that Arma 3 would not have grown this large without them. <3"

14716,anyone wanna smooch
14717,"I have a Terrible PC, and while i have to set my Graphics to their lowest settings, its still a phenomenal game. Gun play is very good, although the Stamina is kinda mildly frustrating. Driving and Flying are burdens but when you get good, it feels all the more satisfying."

14737,best sandbox milsim out there
14738,If you're wondering if there's any girls on this game... the answer is no.
14739,"Single player experience is pretty much nonexistant outside of some pretty bad missions. The multiplayer on this though can be at times some of the most fun of any FPS game I have ever played. You can do milsim, survival sim, general RP, TDM, King of the Hill, ect you think it its probably on a server."
14740,"pretty cool game, not gonna lie its very fun to play with friends or even random people, 10/10 would execute POWs again"

14745,this game is addicting and fun. there is a TON of things you can do as well as being moddable. i enjoy this game a lot.
14746,Creativity and Immersion are the best i've seen on this game than any other
14747,"This is an excellent simulator plagued by a single long standing issue. [b][u]Performance[/u][/b].

It is marketed as a large scale air / sea / land warfare game, yet only a small amount of AI can be present in any one scenario before the engine crumbles under the weight of itself. The mid-range PC I had in 2013 to play the alpha runs it about the same as my 9700K / RTX3080 / 32GB RAM / SSD PC does today, 8 years later.

The scale of the game is largely pointless when it cannot be utilised to create a truly dynamic war-like experience. The best you can hope for are little set pieces or battles that take place in small parts of the map. Scenarios that attempt to create dynamic, large scale battles quite clearly illustrate that the engine isn't capable of handling much else. There are even some official campaign missions that will take you from 100+ FPS to sub 30 FPS when a decent amount of AI is present. That's using VERY modest settings (below what the game itself even recommends) as well as optimising the game according to various guides and forum posts.

If BI would get with the times and take advantage of the hardware on offer, this series would be near perfect. Utilisation is abysmal. ARMA2 had the same issue for years and I certainly expected that we'd be past this by now. It is a PC exclusive, after all. What's the hold up?"
14748,pretty gamer
14749,gooder
14750,"This game is for psychopaths, only buy if you like bombing civilians.  10/10"
14751,good
14752,"Best military simulator... Yeah, right... After you download 60 Gb of mods and you still can not jump or climb walls in the vanilla version, not to mention the indestructible houses and tons and tons of bugs in the (vanilla)  game. It is pathetic really. Save your money, it is not worth it."
14753,great game

"
14775,"Is okay,  I guess?"
14776,"Definitely won't recommend. This ""Triple A"" title is the jankiest shit I've ever played. Worse than that Battle Royale parody. Movement is horrible, shooting is like the shooting chimp meme, getting anything done is nearly impossible."
14777,"it is epic
"
14778,"Game is very immersive, one of the best milsim games that I have played. Definitely lives up to the expectations and hype"
14779,"If your looking for a military sim, then look no more. Arma 3 delivers a game to the people who want that actual real world feel. You can learn lots, and there are plenty of online servers to choose from. The story mode is not to bad either. I highly recommend anyone new to play through the boot camp. This is not COD, BF, or CS You need to slow it down, open your mind, and be aware of your surroundings."
14780,god i love war crimes
14781,"An amazing mil-sim that allows for either fun, goofy content or very serious stages."
14782,I love the realism of Arma 3. Being the editor of your own game is very rare for a game. I am recommending this game to all my friends and trying to find associates for some online team play.
14783,"It's a fun game with a bit of a learning curb for new players, but when you get into it, it's an awesome battle simulator.
With realistic weapon and vehicle mechanics leaving you to adapt to a nonnormal for video game standards, You can play single player where you pin your self against AI in singleplayer or use zuse and set up the battlefield for your scenarios or join multiplayer and test your skills aginst other players."
14784,"30 FPS simulator
POG."
14785,"This is the best game you'll ever play if you absolutely load it with mods.

You will go from holding a life, having a girlfriend, a stable job, enjoying the outdoors,

To fulltime modding, mission building, capturing towns on a Liberation mission, transporting supplies, and becoming entirely obsessed and overhwelmed with the details and possibilities of the mission and mods.

Do yourself a favor, Don't DO It. But if you do, Add me on Steam

8.5/10"
14806,its pretty good ig
14807,"Best modern, sandbox milsim there is. 
Game engine feels a bit clunky sometimes and the graphics are ageing, but offers great possibilities. Easy to get in, hard to master.
A great load of game modes and community mods, there's something for everyone.
Awesome in large scale and interarms fights, a bit less in CQB, even more in populated multiplayer servers.

Many DLCs too, they are optional but the game will kind of force you to buy it, bad design imo.
Still, the devs try to bring the question of war and its repercussions through some DLCs and I think it's a great idea. Sadly the community is more focused around... committing war crimes and making it funny (I must admit that it is indeed, funny).

While Squad for example would be way more gameplay oriented, Arma is really open and there are hundreds of scenarios available.

Honestly don't hesitate in buying Arma III if you like its style, it's a reference in the milsim genre.
And don't worry, it's as fun in solo as it is in multiplayer."

14858,"I believe, apart from the glitches, that arma is probs the best milsim there is on the market. You can put 100's of hours in this game without once getting boring. If you do get boring, you make your own mission and have fun again, beside that there is a community which probs the best i've experience. With this game the sky is the limit, you can fight zombies, do mission, create missions(it's hard), battleroyal, combatpatrol, warlors, king of the hill and so on. After 400hours i'm still learning how to play this game. There are so many expects to the game you can learn. Goodluck and may we cross."
14859,good game if playing with friends
14860,"The best sandbox mil-sim game on the planet. The sheer amount of options and gameplay innovations needs to be seen to be believed. Also has some of the best mods I've ever seen. The immersion and sense of real danger this game provides is nearly unmatched. But be warned, you'll need a large group to play with to make the most of it."
14861,love this game so so fun
14862,"It's a great game if you like complex keybinds, confusing weapons, and most of all, Nukes!

Great modding support, better with an advanced medical system and more weapons, but is still amazing Vanilla!
10/10 would recommend"

14869,good game
14870,"suck me 
"
14871,best mil sim money can buy
14872,"Gem in the rough. 

A3 is really the epitome of sandbox. There is something for everyone.
Bohemia approached this one differently, compared to the predecessors at least. For better or worse.
That being said, it is a mil-sim game at its heart, and as such, some people will just not like it."
14873,Its amazing if played with friends
14874,good
14875,can shoot
14876,"Definiteley the best game I've ever bought.
Can be frustrating in the begining, as it's extremly complex and stil not free of bugs.

But this is what makes Arma 3 so amazing - it makes for incredible funny and emotional moments with your friends in multiplayer, playing Exile or KOTH.
Definitely recommended!"
14877,"booba
"
14878,2.00 broke the game
14879,"When you spam ad blocks in my face for getting in a vehicle i apparently didn't waste money on, you become the worst in game devs in my eyes.

Games trash, even after being alive this long. Servers are all full of base tker's, high lag, or empty cause this games basis is to shove every ad in your face, on top of shitty game play and mechanics from AI.

Flying may be the only fun thing about this game, but I came over to play this from Squad, and im immediately going back to Squad now. 

Dont buy this game, save your money and wait for a game that doesn't spam you with ads like its a mobile game."
14880,Yeasir
14881,"The game itself is bloody great. Big modding community, an ok amount of players etc. Only real problem is the price tag, not only do you need to buy the game itself (duh) but a lot of the other content is locked behind multiple paywalls in the form of DLC and pretty big ones at that. If you want to buy the game or any DLC for the love of god wait for a sale."
14882,"Arma 3 is hands down one of the greatest game, so much content and mod support keeps the game fun and alive after you have completed everything. 10/10 would recommend."
14883,"biggest issue holding back arma3 is the map size.  compared to say flying in  dcs world 900 km. It  is just  too small for flying air combat  and  in my opinion gfx needs a big time enhancement 2021 so add VR, maps 500+ km  maps more effects."
14884,"Absolutely incredible, THE best shooter I've come across! Totally immersive open world play, use your tactics to complete mission. Love the fact that you're not pigeonholed into playing the game taking certain routes, YOU plan your mission. YOU attack and execute the mission at your discretion I can't get enough of Arma. Can't believe I waited so long to get a computer to play. I don't see how I can go back to PS4 FPS again."
14885,I hate the military but this game is fun
14886,"Its kinda okay



fuck chicken wire"
14887,its good man or woman
14888,great game
14889,yeah is very gud
14890,ArmA is life
14891,"This game saved my life.

I am 48.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
14892,spent most of my time in the eden editor XD
14893,Good game. It's Arma.
14894,"It is a good game, but almost with like any realistic shooters you need a good clan to play with. What I miss in this game that there's no ,,Public Game'' or at least it is really hard to find one when you just wanna hop on and shoot some stuff. Also should point out how i hate developers that do not let you play the whole game even tho you paid for whole, but you still have to buy some apex or other DLC's to unlock all vehicles etc. 
If I could, I would rate it 6/10. Good Gameplay, (vanilla sucks tho, you have to download mods to have a quality gameplay, at least for me i find vanilla boring), Graphics are amazing for an ,,old'' game i would say, but the whole DLC and other addons stuff that you have to buy to play full game just are disappointing."
14895,haha gun go brrrr
14896,one of the best games ever
14897,gud

14901,This game is like crack. I like it
14902,Very realistic mechanics for war rp
14903,Good game will play again.
14904,"I have about 4.5k hours now. I have seen a lot and done it all. But I keep coming back to this game. Just such a vibe to this game you don't get from any other game. The community is both amazing and terrible all in its own ways. The milsim community is about as mixed as it gets with both amazing community's and terrible ones. But even if the milsim isn't your scene, there are so many mods servers and different games modes that you could play a new game mode a day for a full 6 months and still have more to find. This game is truly one of the most diverse games out there with a crazy modding community. Worth taking some time to find your nitch and play with some friends. 100% don't regret a single hour spent with all the bad times and good in this game."
14905,"don't buy this if you like to role play this game is not for free for all and the setting is weird this game is so bad trust me don't buy this even my friend don't like playing this plsssssss don't buy this it look fun but it not 

"
14906,"11/10 LOVE this game,  can we chill on the DLC's tho, its almost like a subscription at this point...."

14909,shit game not fun
14910,Massive game with very active community however the games age is clearly starting to show and extreme bugs can ruin the game at times. Still a lot of fun with friends.
14911,nice battle sim... lot of community based mods...
14912,totes ma goats!
14913,Pretty good platform for lots of military-style mods and milsim gameplay.
14914,yes

14919,good game
14920,The controls are a mess and configuring them is a task. Game play boring as hell. You spend more time watching the game than playing. The multiplayer system is less than desirable. This game is not for me.

14926,"Great Game. It is buggy at times, but if you can overcome that you will really enjoy. Endless seeming gear and vehicles. Great mod servers that host a variety of different modes. I give it a 9/10"
14927,"The fact that you can barely even clip a tree and die is annoying, but the game has very good attention to detail and has good mechanics. Very well made game. Not a lot of players playing from what I've seen and they have tons of dead servers, but once you're able to find a server with other players it's really fun. Majority of the servers are PVE so if you're looking for PVP I wouldn't recommend this game."
14928,"""civilians are just unarmed combatants"""
14929,Very nice
14930,"If your PC can handle Raytracing, it still will not run ARMA3 at 60fps constantly, forget ""Can it run Crisis?"", because even if it can run it, it wont be enough to run popular servers with many detail assets i.e. Roleplay servers at around 30-59fps. But still its fun tho, and who wants the most realistic game since 2013 and doesn't need 60fps+, wich is still fine because it won't really affect your gameplay that much, is after all the DLC's imo very satisfied. 11/10 would cook my PC again"
14931,"If you could be charged for breaking the Laws against humanity for actions in this game, I would be worse than Hitler. 9.5/10"

14934,yep
14935,This game is has changed so much over the years i don't have that many hours on this game but its enjoyable and now the Vietnam DLC is coming out which im excited for
14936,great
14937,"great
"
14938,"A very good product, the best product i have every seen very good game play."
14939,"More realistic than CoD and Battlefield, slower action but more intense. Especially when you play with friends!

There is something unique about Arma. Sure, other games have stuff like infantry combat, building clearing, tanks, APCs, UAVs flying above the battlefield, helicopters and planes striking ground targets and dueling it out in the air above you... but the main difference is: All those other battlefield elements are players too.

There are no killstreaks. You don't get an UAV above the area to scan for enemies because you just killed 3 people. You don't get to be the gunner of a gunship because you killed 15 people. Everyone has their own role, and everyone works for that role. If you need an airstrike, you need to coordinate that with the people in the sky, same goes for artillery. If you want an UAV doing recon, you need someone to fly an UAV to the battlefield and do recon with it. And if you need ammunition, you need to call logistics to bring you the ammunition you need.

With mods, the game can drastically change. There are mods which turn this game into Star Wars, with blaster rifles and lightsabers. Other mods turn it into WW2. Others again turn it into Halo, or Vietnam, or whatever. Other mods again don't introduce new units, but instead make it more realistic, adding radios to the game where you need to set your frequency in order to talk to others on the same frequency. Yet another mod changes medical from ""Apply First Aid Kit"" to ""Okay, he has 2 large avulsions, 1 puncture wound, he lost about two liters of blood, his heart stopped beating, and his airways are occluded. We need a medic over here!"" And by combining multiple mods, you are creating your very own gaming experience, where you preferably play together with friends, or at least with those a**holes you can halfway tolerate for the next 2-3 hours to play the mission your Zeus prepared for you.

You can also play with other Milsim groups that could teach you anything about the game. Overall like the game very much and I am addicted to it!

I also wanna add GTA 5 and The Day Before to ARMA and 7 day's to die with the graphics of The Day Before would be the best game ever .  and ton's of map created into 1 map massive map .

15029,If you have a good group its a blast
15030,"very good game.
i love to be killed by a car that was slong at me!!"
15031,Probably don't get this game unless you have a dedicated group of friends to play with. This is an anti war game in the aspect of dying instantly from a single round being fired from 2 miles out by some random npc. The UI is pretty bad and playing by yourself is masochistic.
15032,"This Game can be quite fun if you found a Comunity you can enjoy it with, with all the Mods and DLC's available your options are only limited your own or the Game Masters imagination, there are tons of groups for every Playstyle out there like Life Sim to Hard Core military Sim. but the Multiplayer aspect is not the only thing this game has to offer since you can also play the detail packed SIngle player Senarioes or User created Missions. I Big thing to mention though is that this Game is very Diffrent to other Shoters like Battlefied or Call of Duty, but that gives this one it's own Spice imo. though most Servers require the Apex DLC this game goes in Sale quite often so I would recommend grabing it on Sale with a coupple of your Buddies to screw abit around or join an Community and make great memories that way."
15033,8.5/10
15034,"Arma is literally the most fun or the worst nightmare you can ever partake in. Especially in the ""realistic military sim"" category.

This game can make you feel like a GOD, demolishing entire platoons by yourself and your trusty GMG equipped Hunter,
Make you feel like a solid piece of the chain that is loosely holding back the invading forces,
or it can punish you from 2km out from a nobody in a bush who's life goal is to become one with the terrain.


This game and it's workshop can provide litterally anything you could ever desire out of a military sim. You want to fight for freedom and peace for your people? Antistazi and or Vindicta. You want to provide security to those besieged by terrorist extremists? Liberation. You want the thrill of being apart of the bigger picture? Operation Servers, or conquer. You want to lay back as a farmer while the populace thrives? Altas Life.


Simply put: Arma is stupid amounts of fun with infinite possibilities SO LONG AS you bring the right people and right mods."
15035,"They're Not Bugs They're Features: An ARMA Review Essay 
-After well over a decade of playing the ARMA franchise I can safely say that ARMA 3 is an amazing successor to ARMA 2. I've been playing ARMA since the early DayZ mod era, and immediately grabbed 3 pretty soon after release. I soon found myself disappointed in the game however as my PC ran the game like garbage (it was a lackluster rig to be fair) and a lack of mods similar to DayZ at this point made me head back to ARMA 2, feeling kinda cheated out of 60 bucks. This experience almost made me leave a negative review, but not quite. Flash forwards to the release of the still popular (yet no longer supported, team moved on) Exile mod. My dad and I, best friend, and cousin all picked up the game again and fell in love with Exile. While its a different experience it still delivers a good survival experience, along with being very modular. The forums were alive and active, with loads of people creating scripts, map additions and just their own servers (myself included). The community could be toxic, as it can still be now but hey its online gaming. 
The Server Hosting Experience- 
-My cousin and I had hosted ARMA servers for KOTH, Domination, and AI missions. So heading over to Exile wasn't horrible, the servers can be touchy as ARMA can be but they didn't cause us too much trouble. The community we built was awesome, my dad had his own servers and most of our players hopped in between the offerings. To get to the point, this game helped build some great communities, brought people together and changed the face of ""milsims"" (I use that term lightly here, some might get salty). 
The Bu...I mean Features- 
Yeah this game is a buggy mess, modding it heavily like we did doesn't really help much. BUT, it still stands up graphically (if you can run it, this game isn't efficient whatsoever and doesn't utilize resources properly). It also can be a real pain to get working at times.
Conclusion- 
This game is one of the GOATs, and if you can get over some of Bohemia's recent bullshit. Its an amazing experience."

I started playing Arma chiefly do the huge amount of requests I got from friends and viewers to check it out. And I'm glad I did. It's a great simulator game. It's a game where you get together with friends, and have a big shootout match, very much like an interactive board game, but better. It's a LOT of fun, when you have people to play with.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title."

15043,"buggy af, unoptimized, multiplayer could be fun but if you have tons of dlc's, the single player campaign is downright frustrating, the voice acting is great but the story is meh...  yes the game is hard, but it's also unrewarding, stupid ai, messed up controls, idk why tf did I buy this piece of crap, I wish I can get a refund"
15044,All I can say is aloha snackbar my dudes. 10/10 unlimited content creations.
15045,"Arma 3 is a very interesting game. Yes, parts have their flaws, like the physics engine freaking out and senting you to space if you hit a tree, or the rather demanding system requirements (that is, as long as you want to run it at 60 fps+) or some of the DLC being rather pricey (though it is not as bad as some other games, like DCS, but that may not be a fair comparison because modules in DCS take an obscene amount of time and effor to make, because they are one-to-one recreations of the actual aircraft) But as a whole, if you have some friends, Arma 3 is well worth it. There are so many aspects that I like about the game that I can't name them here, but I will say, if you have $30 (USD) and a couple friends, buy it. You won't regret it. And the general community is pretty good too, even some of the more hardcore groups are perfectly happy to teach a new player the game."

15059,"Awesome game! I have been playing this game for a long time. Bought it many years ago. I still go back to it every so often. Graphics are great and the game play is incredible! This game is just so much fun and totally worth it! I would definitely recommend it if you are into shooters/FPS games. This game has so much to offer and you can customize the games to play it however you want. Their are so many mods which include extra weapons, armor, vehicles, boats, planes, maps and more. You can also get DLC which aren't necessary but include maps as well other guns armor and vehicles. Get this game! TWO THUMBS UP!!"
15060,it is an amazing game for people that like realistic shooting games and having fun with friends
15061,If you haven't heard of Arma then I don't know what you're doin bud
15062,"This is the gold standard by which all other tactical shooters measure themselves.

15069,"multiple ways of how to play the game an one of the better milsim games i've played over the years
"
15070,POG
15071,"This game is long and tedious. but if you enjoy realistic, tactical game-play, then you will surely love this game. However...

Cons: The  graphics and animation does show the games age. This isn't a new game for sure and the limited graphical capabilities are apparent. This game has a lot of locked levels. Many communities for this game are locked so unless you are invested you will not enjoy it. The games are slow. You cannot confront this like a COD or a Battlefield. You have to be careful with every action as it can lead to your death. Some players are simply trolls. They will make your experience a living hell. Confront players at your own risk.  A lot of access is restricted behind paywalls. 

Pros: The game is known as a combat simulation. If you want a true experience that borders a realistic combat situation then you will enjoy this.  Many players are genuinely nice people. One of the nicest communities I have ever had the ability to congregate with. This games has a excellent Admin community. 

Conclusion: 7/10, his game has it flaws, but this games' benefits are far better then the flaws. Take patients and you will enjoy."
15072,really good if you're looking for realism and fun
15073,"Alright... Well, if you don't have patience and you don't like challange, pass this one. This is not cs go. There's a steep learning curve. In the beginning enemy hunts you down like a duck. You can't even see one most of the time. But the more you play and learn mechanics of the game, it becomes more and more fun."

15080,"brilliant
"
15081,"Great if youre looking for a command or tactical based experience, or if youre looking to interact with people online in Milsim or RP servers. But if youre looking for solid gunplay, a smooth gameplay experience, and stunning graphics, turn and run. There are plenty of fun things to do, but mostly, i just felt underwhelmed. i have tried time and time again to like this game, to enjoy what it has to offer, but i simply get cockblocked by this games dinosaur of an engine every time. The bullets dont feel impactful, the environment is not engaging, the vehicles go airborne at every speedbump. SIMPly unplayable."
15082,"I wish I could get a refund for this crappy game.
I haven't even been able to fire ONE round yet.  If I hit the wrong button on the controller, it goes to the map, then gets stuck on it so I have to reboot my computer.
Terrible, buggy, garbage.
If you enjoy getting pissed off, get this game, otherwise, avoid it.

15088,"This game saved my life.

I am 22

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Can't really recommend the game if you've got no one to play it tho and sometimes people take the game way too damn seriously, but you can always go looking around for a Unit that fits your play style and etc.

So yeah all in all, give the game a shot if you've got people to play it with, a solid 9/10 game."

15143,I was playing the tutorial all these years. The game really starts when you download 100 mods and enter 3den editor.
15144,Stunning.
15145,"Great military simulation! Can‚Äôt wait for arma 4, hopefully they will improve the graphics and fps!"
15146,"This game is hard to first get into, but once you get into it and learn the mechanics, the options are endless. There are so many custom mods, missions and more to try out and have fun with. There is jank, but it's just part of the charm of the game."
15147,Enjoy the game has so much to do in it truly a great experience.
15148,it wont even load anymore
15149,worth the money if ur boyfried really likes it it makes him happy so just do it
15150,This is the Dark Souls of Military Simulators.
15151,great game
15152,"WW1,WW2,Star wars,Modern you name it.This game has tons of mods that make it really a game for every war topic.The base game is good with Multiplayer and Campaign.Extremely realistic in a bad and good way.
"
15153,"hella tactial shreking is the best shreking, it gets you high"
15154,ha ha war crimes go brrrrr
15155,"I recommend this game to other players because it is my most liked game ever, and probably the most realistic military game so yes i recommend it to all military game lovers XD"
15156,balkan simulator ;)
15157,its okay
15158,great
15159,"just overall fun, great game, but you need to buy the dlc for it really to feel like a full game, and the single player is... well its horrible, you should probably find a group to play zeus campaigns with, thats where most of the fun is, but you can still have fun doing dumb sh*t in the official stuff like koth or warlords. great buy"
15160,its amazing
15161,"One of the Best games i ever played 
"
15162,bussin
15163,it good
15164,This game is very different unique fun hard interesting if your looking for something to question your skills for if you have what it takes this is the game to try and I don't think you can go wrong with a game like this and it is not a very high title demand game that requires you to use high end specs of your computer to run. all you need is something good enough and you can play and also that the mods are really good the developers have done a good job for what its worth and the main developers of the game have done sooo much of a great Job I honestly don't think there needs to be a squeal to this game I just would bring more DLC and more mods for this game and thank y'all for taken the time read this thank you.
15165,FUN
15166,i mean its an ok game i would recommend it
15167,"best tactic game out there

15172,better than fallujah that's for sure

15175,nice
15176,"Bro this shit hella fun with friends

15178,"Although the game can be quite janky at times, the campaign is quite good & playing with friends is a blast."
15179,You see bad terrorists on TV? You can shoot at those bad people.
15180,"Many different game modes to choose from, one can spend 10-20 hours getting lost in the maps Arma 3 has to offer. Dive in and grab a weapon, your number is up soldier."
15181,"Sandbox realistic military shooter.

Positives:
-Editor
-Varied game play
-Realistic
-Huge modding community

Negatives:
-Clunky
-AI

Extremely good game, becomes even better when played tactically with others. Missions are varied and the possibilities are endless with the editor."
15182,War is great
15183,it's a fun game. just dont bother playing it if you have a potato pc since my rtx occasionally lags at some point.
15184,This game is awesome for new gamers and especially for girls.
15185,seems like a ok game :)
15186,It's basically mario maker for pc
15187,fun
15188,"guns, lots of gun, I mean like big guns, small guns, and more guns.

15191,dirt wasnt realistic enough
15192,arma
15193,nice game i love it
15194,"Terrible.
Cant say the reasons because I will get banned in this ""free speech"" world.

lolololol

"
15195,"Over all i would say this game is not worth it.
A lot of parts of this game are great such as the graphics and the textures. It does have glitches but its playable 100%.

The reasons this game is not worth it: 
Getting into combat is hard and very time consuming, you spawn 3000m from the battle zone to travel there you need a vehicle which unless you have DLC's you wont have which means depending on someone else to take you there. This will then result in you're vehicle being destroyed 9/10 on the way to the battlezone. 
If you survive long enough to get to the battlezone you will likely be killed very fast by enemy players with OP armour and weapons which will wreck your level 1 armour and youre weapon will do next to nothing to them thats if you actually see them. Chances are you will be shot by a sniper over 1000m away that you never see, who has DLC advantage. 
The DLC provide a huge advantage in the game with everything from weapons, armour and vehicles. 
Not only that if you dont want to spend ¬£50 on DLC's icons will apear on your screen while playing to try and get you to buy them. Including a DLC pop up that will take up your whole screen every 5 minutes even while you are in combat that will likely lead to your death.

Chances are you will play a match for 2 hours and get approximately 30 seconds of actual combat and that's if you are half decent at FPS games. The rest you will spend re spawning and simply travelling to the war zone."
15196,Good And Fun And BANG BANG BANG ebr hs across map
15197,kinda like the final season of attack on titan
15198,"It's Arma, who doesn't think it's fun."

15201,very good game!
15202,"Terrible game.

15204,"It's a very fun game, but it's very laggy even with a beefy pc."
15205,"good game
"
15206,The best simulator game
15207,"you can do anything on arma 3,

if you do milsim or any thing regarding infantry, prepare for walking simulator
i have this many hours and yet i still suck at the game. flying is fun fly boys

games is even better with mods but if u play with mods prepare for 1 fps."
15208,fun
15209,I bought an extra keyboard just to add the sprint keybind.
15210,"I'm not a huge Military RP guy, but Arma 3 is a ton of fun. It's super moddable, which lends a lot to the experience, and it's easy to download scenarios or missions to play with your friends. Definitely worth the price."
15211,"if you like to sit in a field in the middle of no where waiting for hours and hours to build up anxiety for whats to come....

Than this game is for you. :)"

15213,its ok

15215,hmm
15216,"Imagine this, your driving a humvee with your convoy in Taliban occupied territory. Just as you reach the encampment you will be infiltrating, you drive over a small rock and fly into the stratosphere... welcome to Arma 3."
15217,It gave me PTSD
15218,"Awesome gameplay, cool adventure in the Editor. Real fight experience, beautiful to creat a good feeling of war."

15231,Amazin shooter. I keep coming back to play it.
15232,In single player this is a fun game. same as in Multiplayer the only problem in multiplayer is it is very lagy.
15233,Based game.
15234,"the game is very confusing at first, thankfully I had a  friend to show me the ropes and we play about 4 times a week with a squad. I have a blast playing and im going to start streaming soon."
15235,18 hours on record... Have not gotten to play the game yet due to al my friends giving me mods! Seems fun to xD
15236,"Really quite an amazing game, with others. I'd recommend not bothering with playing solo. Multiplayer, that's where the real ArmA experience lies. Join a unit or just pop into open multiplayer servers."
15237,verry fun
15238,Love the game
15239,I like this game

15249,"Absolutely i love it, best ""Army/war simulation"" game on Steam, find a good squad, find your preferred mods and start enjoying!"
15250,"You like getting shot a lot?
You enjoy the feeling of being watched at any time?
You love feeling superior over these damn Battlefield and or COD gamers?

If you answered yes to any of these questions this is the game for you"
15251,100% Recommend for ppl that want a full milsim experience!
15252,Pretty cool and realistic military experience.
15253,eh its alright
15254,"Pretty cool, walked about 30 minutes in the desert and died to and IED, pretty realistic."
15255,very game
15256,good hame
15257,no clue how to play this game but its fun
15258,ez gud L3
15259,"Great purchase, fun by yourself but even better with friends,and a lot of mods for variety."
15260,"Gmod of combat games
update: now without a functioning unit system"
15261,"its pretty fun to set up your own levels and make mods, or download mods"
15262,Yeah it's cool I guess. You can get shot and you can shoot. Pretty fucked when you get bombed though.
15263,Not too bad of a game. Im completely new to the whole computer aspect of gaming so its like trying to walk all over again but id have to say this is a very interesting game with hours of game time to enjoy by yourself or with friends.
15264,ok
15265,consuming
15266,"dope
"
15267,I like how the devs let you mod the game to make it as realistic as you want and how fun it can be to play multiplayer with friends to mess around or do missions.
15268,"You and your buds get in the heli. One of your bravest comrades takes up the job of flying the helicopter to the objective.
You hop on the bench. You wait patiently alongside your comrades to reach the objective and complete the task at hand.

A few minutes pass, and the pilot forgets that he needs to land a safe distance from the objective. As it turns out, the enemy had anti-air assets!
Your heli is shot down. The pilot manages to scream out 'MAYDAY MAYDAY!' before you all crash. You've just failed the mission. The other helicopter lands safely, meanwhile your helicopter has failed, because the pilot forgot that he needed to land a few hundred meters away!

Just then, the other part of the team sets up a spawnpoint, and you decide to make it over there. You group up with the other part of your team, and start slowly but surely, taking the enemy base. You kill many enemy infantry, and take out their anti air assets. You've done it. The mission is complete!

Everyone rushes to the heli. It becomes too full, but you managed to rush over there in time. The pilot states he will come back to pick up the rest of your buds. You fly home back to the airbase. You've just completed the mission successfully!
Repeat! But, it doesn't feel redundant, and I was able to play this game for 7 hours in one sitting once, because of how fun it is.
Buy it. If you enjoy it further, buy the DLC."
15269,.
15270,very good just be on sale so my broke friends could buy
15271,is good game
15272,"This game has been out for a while and still is one of the best, if not THE best MilSim out there. There are so many things you can do as far as making the warzone the way you want. Definitely a must if you want to bring the firefight to your home."
15273,G
15274,its cool
15275,its sick
15276,Mods with exploding chickens...yes this game is fire

15279,PP HARD
15280,"Hehe, A-10 go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR"
15281,:)
15282,"I love everything about this Game, It is so hard to play, and tough you have to think everything through, including your overall carry weight, distances covered, you get to plan and create your own missions and scenarios, It is genuinely a War based Simulator, I Can't wait for Arma 4, I'd expect Arma 4 to have Breakpoint graphics, 
I'm still learning to play the game, but i watch peoples videos on YouTube of this game, creating their own scenario's and they're really good, having a missions creator also helps us as players understand and appreciate what it takes to create a game that is fun, 
I guess this game is everything ive ever wanted a game to be"
15283,"Kill things, perfect"
15284,"All the pieces were there, but somehow they were never really glued together into the game this was meant to be. I also found the level creator painful to use and the community was pretty terrible I‚Äôm sorry to say. Probably a very different game if you have a community or friends waiting for you."
15285,Just the best
15286,"I mean, just let my hours be proof that this game is truely incredible.

I'm not saying you'll be good right away, but give it time and learn the clunky controls, You'll enjoy it."
15287,oof
15288,ARMA 4 when?
15289,best sim
15290,Good :)
15291,"More fun with friends, get a group of homies and play some missions."

15299,"I hope my hours count for something. If not.... Arma has stolen alot of time from me and im not mad. bugs, glitches and being arma'ed. Its always a fun time"
15300,good game with friends
15301,"i like shooting people, arma is pretty good though"
15302,best shooter on the market
15303,"Love it!, Been enjoying myself as a medic on arma, an dabbling into RPG Servers it quite entertaining what people are capable of."
15304,Positive review
15305,very good yes
15306,its really realistic and complex
15307,"playing this game is weird, you could get entirely sucked in for many hours at a time, or you could open just to decide to close it once its finished opening. i would suggest for the mp experience and the editor, the mods that you can get for this game really do make it that much better. i had the most fun in the editor myself."
15308,Yes
15309,if you dont play fortunate son while riding in a heli than your doing it wrong
15310,uftr
15311,"Strong, very immersive gameplay. I also quite enjoyed the campaign included in the base game. Definitely a worthwile experience."
15312,:0
15313,Everything. Period.
15314,"I Can't join a server, And MODS Stuff are weird. I didn't understand anything, Or how to play."
15315,good game
15316,"Good game.  Movement mechanics are tough.  You don't want to Run & Gun in this game.  Knowing when to fight and when not to fight is important in this game.  Also, you better understand the difference between cover and concealment; otherwise, you're dead.  This game ups the realism similar to the way America's Army game did.  I highly recommend playing with a team to fully enjoy the game and what it has to offer."
15317,if there was a way to download the mods from the server list i would still be playing
15318,it good
15319,really awesome game
15320,It's ARMA...
15321,"I like it
"
15322,"Everything about this game is so good, Id play like my life depended on it"
15323,"Pew pew with guns.




Slag"
15324,"I really liked the campaign and the dynamics of the game, the controls are a little bit difficult at first but nothing that a tutorial doesn't teach you.
Better than Call Of Duty at this times."
15325,20 fps
15326,"Its kind of confusing or frustrating at first figuring out the editor/vr not to mention the single player campaign i thought was just kind of pointless and didnt teach me much at all... But i enjoy putting soldiers wherever i want and putting a couple choppers over here without anyone around so i can have them whenever i feel like flying but its just neat in general playing around with stuff.
"
15327,"yes
"
15328,Great Game! Love it.
15329,very gud
15330,Can be very addicting and fun if you find a good unit to play it with.
15331,"It's fun and mods are pretty fun for single player and it's a nice game B) Despite the fact I cant go first person in any vehicle or else the game will cut all frames kill my audio. If I stay in first person too long it'll completely crash my game. But, yeah, other than that, it's fun."
15332,arma is epic but showing its age. time for arma 4.
15333,good game
15334,yes
15335,"hehe shoot shoot bang bang
"
15336,fun

15338,Hoo-ah! It's a good military sim. Check it out.
15339,Much fun. Very war crimes.
15340,Good and Bad. I refuse to elaborate.
15341,No but good
15342,1
15343,This game is real fun with friend but kind of hard to understand but it fun. and If you like milsim then is game it for you.
15344,"This is a very good game if you're looking for a fairly realistic game. There's a unit system which allows the community to make different factions, whether it be fictional, real, or...memes? The system can break however, where you're in a unit on the web but when you get on your launcher it doesn't show. (please help me with this) But in a nutshell, it's a pretty good game."
15345,one of the best realistic military games
15346,"This game saved my marriage... and my life. 

I am 62yrs old.


My wife and I have 4 children 3 beautiful boys and one beautiful girl they're my heart.


But a few years ago I had a work place accident. Two broken femurs and a spinal cord injury...L1 through L5 vertebrae. Doc said I could never walk again.


This is when the pain pills came in I quickly was ushered into the cruel prison of addiction...the only thing I could do was take more and more pills. 


But one day, one day I said this is enough. I can't live like this. My wife was getting tired of it. My children, they didn't have a father. 

This game saved me I played it and played it. I ignored my withdrawals and played and played. 


Finally, I had made some progress, wow I said to myself, is this finally happening? I'm free again I yelled at the top of my lungs. The withdrawals subsided. I went to physical therapy everyday. 

And in a years time. This game in combination with the our lovely Healthcare providers saved my life. And saved my family. 

Thank you, Bohemia Interactive!"

15356,.
15357,"forget about COD and Battlefield, this is the #1 combat simulator"
15358,this game may not have good graphics but that doesn't hold it back from being a really good shooter game.
15359,it is a bit over priced for when it came out other than that its got a great aspect of everything
15360,"Although the DLC's make the game less fun at 1st, the steam workshop makes up for this. You can truly have a military scenario of any kind happening. Any reenactment of any time period, it is quite the unique exp. and I absolutely love the Creativity in the people's mods."
15361,Nice game if you like being shot from 1000 km
15362,"its good but old, recommend squad instead"
15363,Cant play without mods

15382,"k
"
15383,"honestly I've loved ARMA for a long time ever since Operation Arrowhead but i can`t recommend it. Base game is still 29.99 but if you want to be able to play the game uninterrupted its around 90, the game was 59.99 on release and was beyond broken, now add countless dlc that was overpriced that added a decent amount but seemed to get lazier as more dlc came out. Apex was great but the map was terribly optimized when it came. Contact was cool but overpriced and again terribly optimized map. honestly the only people who should consider picking it up are probably those who enjoy tactical shooters but even then its a hard sell with Squad, ground branch, hell even EFT currently out and in a far better state than this. And when ever arma 4 comes out its will be a repeat of a broken game that will take about five years to be a complete game with a multitude of DLC thats is over priced. I just feel a little let down by bohemia honestly. looking back i tried way too much to justify all the dlc that came out for this game and the ammount it costs."

15418,Been playing with the 15th MEU Realism Unit for a good bit now. Highly recommend this game and my unit to anyone who's interested.
15419,"Probably the best and most realistic military sanbox. Huge world, many not necessery DLC's. Fanmde servers with roleplay and, and, and. Sure you may occure some problems, but it's huge and has so many contest, that for every military fan content included is."

15426,"Well, I originally had posted a long and detailed review of this game...but I have decided to shorten it to the simple basics after attempting to play more multiplayer.

The game is old, I know. Me being a former 11B of 9yrs and a combat veteran, I really never got into mil-sim games after I got out.. I recently decided to try some and ended up liking them...now catching up to the games. This one I had seen recently and saw the open world etc and thought it was pretty decent...... until I tried multiplayer...

2 main reasons I don't recommend this game...despite all the good things in it.

1: 75% of the Single Player content requires paid DLC. This will end up costing you 4x the cost of the game. The main campaign that came with the game was only about 2hrs of play time that I saw. I paid for an expansion and got a mission from it. Although there is a bit to do for editors and single scenarios, it would seem you get spawned in with a pre-made loadout that you can't change..

2: Multiplayer....man oh man..what a train wreck it has been. In the 4 days I have owned this game, I have attempted multiplayer on 13 different servers. 2 of which were the official servers... ALL 13 ATTEMPTS WERE HACKED. I have never actually witnessed hacking like this before until I got this game. I am piecing together a video for my channel showing the insane hacks being used on ALL players on the servers. It would seem the big hack is this massive kill-everything-on-the-map-in-one-click thing that destroys the match or game. ALL servers I tried to play on had someone doing this. The longest I got to play before this happened was 15 minutes. Even the official servers.... 

 It has been a massive let down to see over a thousand servers running with players...and literally the first 13 I try to play on are riddled with the above hacking. It's a shame...."
15427,"This game is a simulator, if you like realism and non-gameplay then here you go. If you don't like monotony then steer clear of this game."
15428,good game
15429,soooooooooooooooo gooooooy
15430,"
When I played it for like 30 min I loved the mechanics and everything included in that category, but when I tried to get into servers i couldn't connect, and most of them were very small."
15431,buy it
15432,"Pros: Great game and community
Cons: Too many hackers now, the game doesn't utilize battleeyes new anti-cheat methods. Players use external programs which draw over their screen the cheats which completely bypasses battleeye's old methods of anticheat detection. Bohemia seems more concerned with dlc content for extra money rather than updating their anticheat integration making the game plagued by cheaters... It's all so tiresome."

15441,333 hours and loving it.
15442,"At the time of writing this review, ArmA 3 without a doubt is already a classic.
I have enjoyed every single one of my 1500 hrs of playing this game, and from that experience 
I can say ArmA 3 is the most perfect military sandbox to date, even 8 years after its initial release.
The controls take some time getting used to, but every keybind has a purpose and will help you be a better player.
You want to create Artwork? Don't worry, ArmA has you covered with endless possibilities provided by Bohemia's official content as well as the amazing mod community at the workshop.
You like to customize your character to the last detail possible? Worry not, the only only thing limiting you is your hard drive's capacity for mods.
You are more of a singleplayer type of player? Thanks to ArmA's exellent mission editor and a few hours of learning how to script missions, you'll have your own custom playing experience from raiding Insurgent hideouts to a relaxed sunday drive.

So basically ArmA has it all, and even with ArmA 4 being a possibility in the not so distant future, I still recommend you buy this game if its ever on sale, and I assure you, it's money well spent, if you have the time to get into it.

10/10

15443,2 - ATTACK THAT RIFLEMAN - 200 METERS - FRONT
15444,"Great gameplay, lots of customizable content, ten out of ten."
15445,Awesome Game!
15446,"Great tactical shooter, takes a long ass time to really get to know the insides and outs, Recommend having a few friends to play along side with!"
15447,10/10 would get shot from 1km away again
15448,good game
15449,One of my Fave games.  Love the mod scene.   Equally good playing solo against AI or with mates co-op or MP online.  The sound and lighting is great and  the mods out just give you so many options.  STILL the best war sim out.
15450,it's still good
15451,yeah i guess its cool
15452,Plenty of content to check out through the workshop
15453,"Arma 3, the game where AI can simultaneously snipe you with ruthless efficiency yet get decimated in a dogfight. assuming you don't clip into the truck in front of you and become the newest member of the Altan Space Force. I would suggest getting into a group though. (Maybe Killsmith's Armory?"
15454,pp big
15455,yup
15456,game is good if you like to suck dhick and bhalls
15457,very tacticool
15458,really good millitary sim but needs to get some bug fixed as well as ai and probably the best millitary sim no other sim beats this
15459,"I first got into Arma after being recommended a video on YouTube, I was interested in it's sim like atmosphere and decided to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. Arma 3 is the epidement of a simulation video game which is still fun, from it's ""Zeus mode"" which has one player actinh as a game master creating levels in real time for others to enjoy, or it's hundreds of different kits and weapons which can be customized to your liking. Overall this is a game which can only be experienced with other people, this can lead to hilarious situations but also very toxic ones. It is also very hard to run, I have a fairly high end PC but even then I would consistently see low frame rates. This game is perfect for people who wish to be apart of a hardcore experience, or even just a game to play with your friends."

To be honest I've been playing since day 1 of the beta, there's a lot here now to have fun with!"
15468,mod servers way to go
15469,It is a good game
15470,very good game. only good for people with patience just have to practice
15471,"Dear Arma gamer, 
My message to you is pretty simple, if you want to feel yourself to be immersed in the center of the combat actions, feel each bullet flying towards you and your team, get new close friends, one of the best communities and just play adequate game - Arma 3 is your choice. 
Best wishes,
Unknown Arma Player"
15472,"Great game, would love LMGs with underslung grenade launchers though.
Overall good game, allows for a large amount of freedom."
15473,fun
15474,This game is SO much fun to play and roleplay as an actual marine. I would 100% recommend this game to people who like modern war type games and roleplay.
15475,16 hours and i still love it. This game is a masterpiece of tactical realistic military shooters. my one complaint is that it is quite a bit laggy if you put settings to high. and dont buy this for anyone under the age of 14-its a bit to realistic along with to much mature language.
15476,its a good game i might play it more
15477,"Arma 3 is the most recent in a series of open world military FPS games with a focus on realism, simulationism and co-op/team gameplay.   Following on from Operation Flashpoint and Arma/Arma 2, the core gameplay is decent enough but the huge modding and community created content are what makes this shine. 

On a technical basis we have decent enough graphics, 4K support, and everything else you expect from a AAA PC title.  Gameplay is on point, with FPS and vehicle combat available, and the maps and missions that cater for it are nearly limitless. 

This is an easy and obvious must-have for fans of military FPS games."

15481,I can't believe how relevant and playable this game has remained through the years. I definitely recommend joining a dedicated milsim community to get the best out of it. I'm really looking forward to what the future holds for the franchise.
15482,Sorry this game does not have enough content. Wish it had more mods
15483,"fun
"
15484,Is good.
15485,It's ArmA
15486,"Well, after over 600 hours spent in this game - it deserves a review. I bought this game in 2017 and I am playing ever since, being in two milsim units, then playing with two of my friends in different gamemodes.

But let's start from the beginning. Before you buy ArmA 3, ask yourself this question: ""Do I have experience with milsim shooters?"" - if you answered yes, Arma 3 will be good for you, but if you answered no - worry not. ArmA 3 works on the basis of ""learn on your mistakes"", there are many tutorials and showcases which will show you everything from shooting a gun to flying a plane. If you have friends, they can teach you everything - and the game has a strong community which will teach you with tutorial videos.

I run the game sometimes at only 20 FPS at high settings. It surely guzzles PC resources like an iced tea on a hot summer day alongside making my PC fans sound like a 30mm GAU-8, however that is a personal problem. There are a lot of settings, however take my one advice... Disable the picture-in-picture graphical setting (the one that is responsible for all the mirrors in vehicles) if you rarely look at them, it will significally boost your FPS. (Funfact: ArmA 3 doesn't use multi-core, so that may be a problem)

Now, after that mumbo jumbo - the gameplay. It is punishing as in every milsim shooter, with AI laser targeting you through walls, being able to sometimes shoot down a plane flying 500 KM/H with an APC, not being able to enter a vehicle, etc. But, overlooking that, ArmA is great fun, from the different mods and gamemodes to it's glitches, but let's talk about the campaign.

ArmA has a campaign which will introduce you to many of its aspects, driving, shooting a gun, placing explosives, driving vehicles, firing a rocket launcher. It is however buggy and can break often, so I recommend downloading a mod which will be a failsafe to remove an enemy that is stuck...

...Mods. Yes - ArmA 3 has a strong modding community. From the wonders of detailed plane mods, to packs of weapons and vehicles alike by Red Hammer Studios, to the realistic and hard ACE mod, everyone can find something for themselves. Like in bethesda games, it can even fix the bugs created by the developers, which isn't a surprise for a 2013 title that has oftenmost problems. It also has a map editor, the so-called ""Zeus"", which allows you to even edit in real time when in-game, alongside making scenarios starting from a convoy mission to a mission where you have to destroy a giant rabbit. Is it hard to learn? Yes. Are there youtube tutorials? Of course, there are many great ones, but I never dipped my toes in them nor the editor.

The DLC. I own most of them except for helicopters and Contact, which is one of the more expensive DLCs. Bohemia Interactive has a great DLC policy, you can use equipment from them in the arsenal with only an occasional ad popping on the screen alongside being able to sit as passenger in vehicles. What DLCs are worth it, you may ask me? The Apex DLC. It adds a terrain, alongside many weapons and equipment - it is also a basis for many different mods made by the community. But every DLC is for a different person, such as Laws Of War being a great campaign with few major bugs, Jets being great for people who fight air-to-air and air-to-ground and Karts being for the ones that waant to make a meme operation.

Multiplayer. It is rather visible in ArmA 3 with many gamemodes being created, ranging from King of the Hill (the most popular gamemode), to Exile (which is DayZ on steroids) to the likes of Antistasi and Vindicta, playing as guerillas and starting from the bottom. The community may be sometimes friendly, sometimes toxic, sometimes scream on voice chat (which is of garry's mod quality). MilSim units are an another popular type of a community and technically a gamemode, most often using the ACE mod (which adds things such as morphine, bandages, ballistics, earplugs etc) and being either serious or rather casual, playing their own scenarios. Personally I enjoyed them, laughed at them, made great friends in them, but they require a microphone most often, so prepare for that - alongside knowledge of ACE. Some units have basic training, so they will probably teach you everything you need to know. I recommend joining an unit after you get the basics down and play around fifty hours of both multiplayer and singleplayer combined, but if you feel safe after ten hours, then go for it.


 I think I wrote major points that came to mind. It is one of my longer more professional reviews in a new era. Do I recommend ArmA 3? With all my heart, for new players and veteran players alike. It is simpler than it's sibling of ArmA 2, with it's simplified controls that will fit on keyboards (but numpad is important for third person, so keep in mind you will probably need it if you want it). Thanks for coming so far into my review, please send any criticism my way to improve my writing.

Final rating: 8.5/10 ""Something for everyone inside."""
15487,"Arma III, a well made game, one I have spent may hours playing and is dear to me. I never played multiplayer so I cannot speak on that front, but what is incredible about this game is the sandbox scenarios you can either download or make yourself. These can be so well made, voice acting, controlled ai, the whole 9 yards. This game is hard and takes awhile to get accustomed to but after that it becomes fun with the ability to level buildings and fight it a tightly knit combat where you feel vulnerable and an actual solider. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who like realistic shooting and don't mind a lack of progression. 
If you do get it, I recommend you take a look at the workshop there is some really great addons there and deserve a look."
15488,Its a very realistic first person shooter. This game i thought was pretty lackluster until i found out all the things possible to do with the steam workshop. it adds so many scenarios and mods it makes the game your playground. i only have 4 hours as of now but i already know im going to put so many more on it before im done
15489,"I love this game. I mostly mess around with the mission editor because its by-far the coolest feature. I can't recommend this game based on the fact that there are multiple issues with AI, ragdoll, scripting, and the editor itself. Among other things. Solutions are available online for almost every issue, but in the experience of myself and players on almost every troubleshooting forum are that these ""solutions"" simply don't work. Whats worse is that when something doesn't work it might just be your particular luck.

Basically, if you get a bug, or something like a simple waypoint doesn't work... that's just the way the game is. Enjoy the disappointment after spending a few hours on a custom mission to find out that IF the AI helicopter takes of when it was supposed to it might refuse to recognize targets or just hover in place instead of droppng off your troops and landing somewhere as requested.

I have been disappointed with Bohemia Interactive in these regards since buying the game after it was already a few years old. It's just sloppy."
15490,"good game

15491,It's okay.

15498,Yeah I don't like or maybe don't understand the helicopter controls. It says that it requires the DLC to ride as passenger and that is somewhat disappointing. Anyhow it is so far quite good.
15499,"Don‚Äôt let this distract you from the fact that spongebob has dark magic that lets him light torches underwater

15500,My friend posted about my friend being divorced over this game. 10/10 would watch the pain happen again.
15501,"Arma 3 is a game that played well with a community or friend. in my Case, playing with Community give the bond as a unit. Arma 3 is like a canvas in a modder world. the game so much fun with the mod, and give the game more to Realism, or even Not Realism. You can do almost anything and Create a mission that you want, Or Even make your friend suffer because playing your mission. At the end, you will kill innocent people just for fun.

-PabbeY"
15502,Its good
15503,amazing if there was an rts game like this
15504,I left my wife over this game. 10/10 would divorce again.
15505,"If you want to have a life, this game is not for you."
15506,I like this game because it supports mods unlike ARGO and I can play with friends with thoes mods

15520,"Very fun (even more fun with friends if you have those) its not very optimized so just keep that in mind you'll be running like 50 to 20 fps (i have a 1060 6GB and a decent CPU) i have low settings. But i think the gameplay makes up for it. it does use more than your entire keyboard so that will be hard to get used to. but if you like Mil-Sim's this is a must

15565,"In general ArmA III is a pretty good Mil-Sim. single-player and Multiplayer are enjoyable. Coop with friends is especially nice. One minus point is the performance. ArmA needs a good CPU with good single core performance. But hopefully the next ArmA is going to be more optimized.

EDIT:

After diving into mods for ArmA, i can only recommend it more. Of course you have to expect bugs if you play modded games, but personally i have not encountered bugs that destroy your experience."

15604,"[b] This review applies only to single player, with no mods. [\b]

I've tried to play this several times over the last few years and stopped playing in frustration each time.  I just can't anymore.  

First, saved games in the single player campaign are routinely deleted.  From what I have read online this is by design; as in: the developers planned it this way.  If you are in the middle of a mission and save your game and then quit out, your saved game will be deleted and you'll need to start the mission over again the next time you play.  From wheat I read, it appears the only way to mitigate this is to manually make backups of your saved games while you are playing.  I suppose this means Alt-Tabbing out of the game and copying your saved games to a new folder each time you save?  This is just broken.

Secondly, sometimes, for some reason, all of your progress in the campaign will be deleted, and you'll need to start the entire campaign over again.  Fun, right?  There is a way to fool the game into thinking you've completed the entire campaign, which will let you restart or replay a mission, but any good gear you had found and kept with you in your now-deleted campaign will be gone.  You'll just have a default loadout.  Like, I lost my scope and extra first aid kits and had to go back to iron sights on a mission which included engagement with snipers.  And for those wondering, this just happened to me between when I played last night and when I played today, and the version of the game was not updated, so there's no way an update to the game did this.  (Yes, in the past game updates removed all previous game progress...)

Third, for some reason, the game obstinately refuses to retain any keybinding changes I make.  This means any time I start the game, I have to go back in and rebind all my keys again.  There have even been times where my keybindings have change [b] in the middle of a mission [/b] while I was playing.  I've also had other configurable options, such as screen resolution and audio settings, mysteriously change between play sessions with no warning.  I've never had these issues with other games in my 30 years of PC gaming.

As I said, I really want to like this game.  It's clear that, as a simulation, it's fantastic.  But my experience so far in the 20+ hours I've played is that I've become an expert in configuring my keybindings and have played the campaign's first eight or so missions at least four times now, due to constant deletion of my saved progress.  This just isn't enjoyable.
"
15605,"Large game, fun and a good action based game, good for playing with a lot of  player or yourself, there is a lot of options to choose between and thanks by the mods there is much to do."
15606,very fun when you get to know how to do stuff
15607,really only fun with friends idk.
15608,Very cool and realistic game
15609,"With all the incredible mods offered by a very active community, you are able to render nearly any conflict in the 20th century onward (not to mention a number of other fictional universes), and with enough time and patience learning how to use the Editor (where I've spent 99% of my 1600+ hours making the missions I want to play for myself, then sharing them back w/ the community), this is as close as you can get to a DIY tactical first-person shooter. I love reading about historical conflicts, then rendering them in Arma 3, researching the units, and getting creative with the tools to bring ideas to life. Mods like Faces of War, Unsung, and CUP offer expansive options for WW2, Vietnam, and the GWOT, respectively. If you enjoy building mechanics similar to Fallout 4, you will find scene-building in the Editor to be addictive. If you saw a photo of a modern combat zone only to realize it was actually a heavily-modded screenshot from this game, you will find yourself tumbling down the rabbit hole. My only complaint is that the AI can be a bit stiff, even with mods, when it comes to CQB and vehicle control. A small price to pay to be able to easily bring your game ideas to life and actually play/share them."

15640,"The game itself is absolutely amazing and is the best in MILSIM category. But I don't like the way company treats Chinese content creators and the content they generated in workshop, so I give a down vote as my way of protesting this, especially considering the company's move is very likely to be a response to what happened during the US-China dialogues. 
To me, this is either 1. a stupid move, because the company unnecessarily sets off a considerable proportion of its player base, or 2. this is simply a revelation of the true colour of the company -- they never took players in China seriously and probably withheld their hostility towards these players all this time.

So, no. No to this game, and no to this company."

15758,"Its very, very meh. Hard to find a fun server, the gui and navigation aren't intuitive at all, and no matter what gamemode I joined, it was either wait 15 minutes to be killed instantly or have some idiot stand in the middle of the teams spawn zone and mow everyone down with an lmg, never getting kicked. When you accidentally team kill one person, you get kicked. If you're looking for a video game, search elsewhere. If sitting still or walking in a line for hours on end seems like fun, I won't stop you."

15761,i dead to many times. i drove car
15762,Great game and the editor and the community for modding is so vast and diverse. Graphics are showing its age but its a unique war simulator toybox.
15763,Good.
15764,This game is very realistic.
15765,"even though i can barely run this ga- simulator* its still an amazing piece of software weather being use for fun, or for tactical operations training. well worth the asking price."
15766,"Great game with a shitfuck terrible launcher. Want to play Exile? Goodluck spending 10's of hours downloading, unsubbing from workshops, deleting folders, resubbing on workshop, finding someone to send you the exact missing file, etc just to play in a game. It says I have 80 hours in game? I've played less than 20. Fuck this game's launcher and its terrible workshop integration. Fuck it up its stupid ass."
15767,"Game is fun to play with friends, its a unique military simulator than not a lot of other games can compete with."

15773,"Lot of little frustrating situations among the different game modes that are typically fixed with decent plugins when available. For instance, not being able to cancel medkit animation once triggered or finishing a rocket launcher reload before being able to move. 

Other than that the game is Amazeballs, evident by the 1500 + hours i have put into this game, and the 500+ ive idled in it XD"

15775,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this game yet, and I have almost 500 hours in the damn thing, and I've reviewed games I've spent 4 hours on.

You all know what this is and whether you want it already. I cannot fully do it justice, read the description and if you don't like that, you won't like the game. Simple. I do love the game, so I highly recommend it.

15812,"Awesome game hands down, This is what got me wanting a PC and i still come back to it often. There are so many things you can do and the servers are always teaming. There is always a bad apple (Cheaters) in games and there was a time it was rampant on the official servers, this is the only negative i have had in the game. It has been fixed and I play on there regularly. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.  
*You can get this game for 66% off on one of the many sales.*
I would highly recommend the apex at a minimum. I bought two sets with all the add-ons to have friends play, that's how much I like this game. No other game comes close... yet. im looking forward to arma IV"
15813,yes
15814,Great game

15818,"i found out u can do some coop stuff n singleplayer stuff which was cool, but a lot if not the majority of the game is locked behind dlc, meaning you have to pay more beyond base game price if u want to experience the full game, that being said what is available gives u a taste of the full game, u dont get tanks n helicopters n stuff but some base game missions will still have them,from what i can tell its making n joining servers n these servers can be regular pvp deathmatch or coop online missions, its difficult at first but i can see having a decent amount of fun with the base game, i played a bit with my brother n we had a good time, will derfinietley play it more in the future"

15827,shit
15828,"I have 1,200 hours invested into this game, and I swear this game is the most addictive thing I have played. I have gotten 1,200 hours, and I only got the game in June of 2020 (it's 3/15/2021). I spent some time with a Milsim unit and this game plus a decent map maker leads to a great immersive factor. The campaign is great to play once and never touch again, but the base game has lots of stuff for everyone to try. With very immersive Air, ground, and naval warfare, no two experiences in this game will be them. PLUS, this game has lots of mods like RHS, CUP, USAF, Ni arms, USS Nimitz, and even star wars/ Halo mods! This game will never get old!

Note: Most of my time was spent with JTF-Manticore (as Medic/ Infantry/ pilot/ what ever the fuck High Command told me to do lol), 107th Navy refueling (as an airedale/ MEDIVAC/ MP) Altis Warlords 1e (mostly a CAS pilot in A-10), Asylum life #1 (it's not meth, officer. i promise it's just salt), and Antistasi Altis/Takistan.

Warning: this game will lead to hours of devotion, and is just as, if not more addictive than meth."

I have bought this game previously twice and refunded it both times because I was too stupid to understand the game and the concept, ontop of that had no groups to get into. However most recently I have been highly into it with having 112 hours within 2 weeks of recieving it I am extremely enjoying this game and would highly recommend it, however the DLC content can be a bit annoying, I recommend highly to buy this when its on sale as you can use your money more effectively to buy a handful of dlc content or something! The modding community is very professional and the communities so far for me have been wonderful I've enjoyed playing medic with KAT medical mod! 

I hope this review helps I typically only post reviews after I have had 300  hours or more on a game but I find this game to have unlimited potential with the community!"

15858,"So, Arma 3 by Bohemia Interactive. . .

They develop software used to train modern military forces around the world. They also make some of the best war games you can find. Sure the controls aren't the best on the market, (some joke that you need a manual just to move your body) but they offer movement features you just can't find elsewhere. Turn your head without moving your rifle or body? Multiple stances of crouch to prone? Incremental leaning? Hip fire dead zone to move the weapon without turning? Check on all of these.

Multiplayer can be a blast, ranging from the ultra-serious military realists, to battleroyale type gameplay (the genre started as a mod of this game series). My personal preference is Wasteland (red team vs blue team vs green independents): Stores to purchase vehicles, aircraft, seacraft, weapons, gear, bodywear. Material gathering, base building, territory grabbing, generated missions. It's almost always a blast. (Some players are possess uncanny skills). Voice chat is well handled. Character mouths sync to VoIP, adding to immersion. Despite the aggressive attitudes (the game can indeed induce stress), most experienced players helpful and always willing to give advice or explain how something is done. 

Do not fear the VoIP. Although, you can be heard by nearby players when communicating. Be wary of chatter in combat situations. 

The graphics are better than what one would expect from most simulators, and hold up well given the course of time.
Given, buildings don't collapse as beautifully as Battlefield, and character and weapon animations aren't as fleshed out as CoD. What you give up from the Arcade, graphics driven game such as these, is a drop in the proverbial bucket compared to the immersive, realistic experience this Military Simulator has to offer. 

Audio isn't the greatest in the world, but it does attempt to echo and bounce off objects. Locating the source of gunfire in urban areas can be stressful and disorienting, while open area gunfire can be easily tracked. Explosions will rock you, and tank engines will drown out chatter. The game has an excellent audioscape overall, but the sfx isn't perfect,  some weapons just don't sound right from a distance. There are mods, however, that aim to fix this. Kudos to them, I'm all about the ultra-realism. 

AI is a mixed bag as well. They can see through bushes and leaves, etc. Sometimes, they have godly shooting skills, other times they get confused trying to cross a wooden fence row. Again, there are mods that significantly improve AI, some even possess unnerving levels of adaptation.

Single-player campaign has it's moments and helps teach you the ropes of the game's internal systems. It's worth playing through, at least until you feel confident with the bullet mechanics, movement and all else. There are tons of scenarios others have made, ranging from surgical covert ops missions, to chopper or jet sorties, to full on dynamic territory warfare modes. (Of the latter, i I have enjoyed many hours of game-play). 

This game is for those who feel constricted by the accepted norms of titles such as Call of Duty or Battlefield. Here, your kit carries weight and all you carry will slow you down and fatigue you. Being tired effects your accuracy and your ability to move properly. Your heavy breathing can also give your position away. Gear and stamina management are often challenging hurdles to new players. Many online servers forgo this system, the ADS while tired can be absurd. That being said, weapon resting/crouching is a thing and works on most objects, including tree branches. 

Day/Night and weather systems can sync to the location of the server, or being adjusted (like everything else) by server admins. Night play can be difficult. It is possible to navigate by the stars, if you know your constellations. Flares and tracers will mess with your night vision (if you have any). Yes, tracers do indeed work both ways. It is possible to load ammunition without tracers as well. Flying at night has it's risks as well. HUDs in aircraft do not track trajectory against forward geography well, so you can crash into mountains, if unfamiliar with the terrain. Lights on vehicles and craft can be toggled on and off, however. Engines can even be killed while in motion, so stealth that last 1km or so. 

Weather systems look great, but don't transition so well. Rain will affect driving conditions and heavy rain will affect vision. Lightning will totally give you away at night and gunshots can easily be masked with thunder.

Realistic projectile physics (I've seen flak cannon operators and spotters coordinate make-shift artillery, by doing the math, and fire into the sky bringing the rounds down, on target). The physics are realistic enough to make that possible. Wind is not a factor in vanilla gameplay, but there are mods that add this feature. 

Advanced Flight Physics (meaning you can stall and actually damage your engines, etc, overdoing things. I've seen pilots lands loaded transports without tail rotors (impressive). 

Location based damage. A powerful enough rifle and well placed sniper round can actually disable rotors and turrets. Knock the tracks off that tank, climb up, open the hatch and toss in a grenade. Watch jet pilots try to bail when spinning out because you blew their wing off. See where they land and hunt them mercilessly. 

Loot choice gear from the poor saps inside the wreck. Take prisoners of war and coerce information from them. Play a medic and drag wounded soldiers from the line of fire, then patch them up. Be an engineer and get that busted tank operational again. Sweep for mines, lay your own. Operate actual mortars and artillery. 

Want to operate a fleet of attack drones from 2km away from the target, while offering IR targets and AA support to friendly strike craft? You can. 

Want spend hours stalking through the forests in a Ghillie, sneaking and waiting for the perfect shot? Boobytrap structures to collapse? Mine roads and set ambushes? 

Crew a flight or tank crew with your friends. Even maintain logistical supply lines, by hauling the ammunition or fuel out into the field.

Coordinate with dozens of team-mates, and groups of friends, and feel a real sense of victory when you drive out the other team and achieve your own objective? Find it all here, folks.

Again, Arma 3 is an incredibly immersive experience. One that I keep coming back to, time and again for various reasons. Sometimes just to hop online and snipe with large guns at incredible ranges. I enjoy playing a sapper in multiplayer scenarios. Spotting traffic routes and distrupting them. Often I play just to enjoy the excellent flight model. No other game can offer the complete package of modern military immersion. Games like Battlefield are very enjoyable to, but they have never aspired to the kind of scale and realism I have found in the Arma series. I've tried to go back to CoD and Battlefield games and their likes. When I can't adjust the ironsight for range increments, I'm done. Seriously, I'm that spoiled on this game's features.

If the company doesn't all go down for war crimes or espionage, Arma 4 will be an instant buy for me. Bugs and all. 

By the way, my hours on record is a lie. I've spent far more time with the game not connected to the net."

[b]Conclusion[/b]
ArmA 3 turned out pretty well. Sure, some people have fun. But some despises it. The only time I remember enjoying myself in it, was upon release with some friends of mine, hence the 2000+ hours I have in game. In the beginning it had a lot of hope, We was promises a big update to the game with a new map and a lot of new features including DLC(s) in the game all of that made it successfully into the game. And a lot of people seems to enjoy it. ArmA 3 has a custom modded experiences which people can get by browsing the steam workshop. If you like fighting and survival you should definitely get this game. ^_^

15889,"Ok This game can be fun

Arma 3 is basically a realistic shooter stuff like ammo guns and movement is closely matched to real life physics. 

Playing Arma 3 alone can be boring at times servers like invade and annex are good for new players to have fun in  the game but can be frustrating and good repetitive. Where Arma 3 rlly shines is the amount of mods and the community. If you want to have fun in Arma i would recommend either playing with friends on player built missions or join a unit for more exiting and funny times. 

Finding a unit can be hard i would recommend Reddit or the Arma 3 discoed which has everything you need to get started( remember Arma 3 is a realistic game so most units are serious with actual military ranks and so on. 

https://discord.gg/XUAKwTdQ- heres my unit we are a semi serious group which do Star wars missions with star wars guns and vehicles"

15897,"I only played the single player and found the story good and the actors voices pretty good. However, OMG the combat was just way to hard. There are too many keyboard controls to remember the mapping system makes no sense. I wanted to get used to the controls so I put the enemies accuracy and skill down to 0 but in the next battle got gunned gun like a plump goose. Even the inventory is unhelpful and I don't why I can add this item but not that item. Sadly this game is not for me as I play games for enjoyment not to be constantly frustrated and angered."
15898,What to say about this game hmmm.... Jumping inside of a brand new game being a newbie is kinda overwhelming theres so much to do and server rules I feel like having to make an investment just to hop in and kill pixels. It needs more simplistic gameplay like counter strike then I would def be playing it more. At the moment I feel like I wasted alot of money on this game and the dlcs.

You can land your huey in rice fields and seek the VCs in the jungle, then climb the hills of takistan with your squad  of american soldiers to free it from it's evil ruler, to finally go into space to defend your planet and the imperium of men with the help of the emporor. This game offers so much possibilities with an awesome community and incredibly talented modders."

15943,"Great game, I mainly play Arma for the expansive mod support it has, the community puts such effort and detail into them and it overall makes Arma more fun as a sandbox game."

15950,"Overall i love this game but for some reason when i hooked my bluetooth headphones i didnt get any sound but my grandpa downstairs starting screaming, so dont know what thats about wish i could i get my headphones to work but overall Great Game!"
15951,i love this game
15952,"It is really good!
"
15953,"Better to play with friends because of the shenanigans! Fun game to play if you are looking for a huge map, and a mil-sim experience. It is a slower shooter, and takes the time to plan strategies or you can try to run and gun but it might not work out in your favor. Game play is mediocre, its not optimized if your going to play in online servers and there is a lot of dsync. low FPS get a gun that shoots faster and vice versa. ( Navid, Zafir, SPMG) all good guns. It has been out for a while so servers might not be as populated but the community is still strong and play it regularly. There is different modes to play but my personal favorite is some good old 'King of the Hill'. Wasteland isn't bad either. Have not played through campaign so not sure how good it is but I feel it would be fun to play. Also fun to play modded scenarios with friends."
15954,"For Glory!

15957,"em promo√ß√£o: ruim por√©m muito bom

15958,The single player campaign is absolute dogshit. The AI's could not be any dumber. It's literally impossible with them running miles away from the main objective or constantly crashing themselves to death. Would not recommend.
15959,bang bang problem solved
15960,"Realistic graphics, textures and scenery.
Easy to understand controls, unless using a controller, definitely not recommended.
This is what DayZ Standalone aspires to be, especially with all the Workshop Mods that are available.
Realistic bullet drop, which can be somewhat countered by ranging your shots.
Semi-realistic hunger, thirst and health counters.
Crashing a fully armored vehicle into a tree stump? Almost instant death.
Overall 10/10 would recommend."
15961,yes just yes its a very fun game even for how old it is I love it and i hope you have as much fun as me
15962,Big learning curve. But very awesome game!
15963,"Arma definitely excels at trying to make things as militarily accurate as possible, it can be a somewhat cumbersome experience if you're not use to it's very tactical focus, but it's a lot of fun. I watched a bunch of Twitch gameplay before I picked it up on a decent sale, might wanna do the same if you're on the fence.

Do me a favor, do it, do it."
15964,"Very Tactical and Strategic.
Better with Private Servers though, cause public are mostly filled with Chaos or the Server Population is toxic towards ""newcomers""."

15975,Es muy sexy
15976,The standard for Mil-Sim. It's a niche genre so know what you are getting into. The learning curve from intermediate to advanced play is steeper than a MOBA and you will want a college degree or equivalent to install mods without getting lost in the addons folder. Good game :)
15977,I am in love with KOTH especially C4G (Code4Gaming) I highly recommend it!
15978,"nice game

15979,"785 hours later and i still feel empty and i can still hear the frogfoot strafing us and mowing the whole formation down, or that time I was in a metro op and now i cant handle the sound of silence becuause every time i hear nothing i see the dark ""empty"" totally not full of fucking demons and the souls of those who cannot find peace in the after non life, so now i have to sleep with a light and tv on, so do you see how much time ive wasted on this game?

15985,"Would I recommend ArmA 3? Well that depends. 

First things first the game is a ""milsim"" a military simulation so it is to be expected that if you've played shooters such as CoD or battlefield before and like the fast pacing you most likely wont enjoy ArmA. Though on the other hand if you are looking for something more realistic with huge maps and combined arms combat and actual military strategy ArmA has you covered.

Let's get the singleplayer out of the way. The singleplayer in ArmA 3 is ok, it will show you the basics and some bitch basic ""strategic"" know how. However the base game  campaign storyline is mediocre. it's not bad it's just not that good either, but that isn't really the point of ArmA.

Then we get to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is really the games bread and butter. It has basically everything there are less realistic game modes such as King of the hill and such, then there are more realistic ones like invade and annex. However if you want a true Milsim feel you should to join one of the milsim communities and join their OPs. Though the main thing about ArmA 3 MP is that depending on what you want play with the same sort of people. Want a true fullblown milsim join their group, wont be as easy but a LOT of fun once you get there. Want milsim content but at a less realistic level just find a group that does such OPs. If you want to fight as a resistance movement play Antistasi. There really isn't an OP type that isn't routinely ran by some group you just need to find said group. 

Another thing that is keeping ArmA alive after all these years is modding. No milsim community plays the base game. People push for more realism and scenario types so there are mods for that. The base game ArmA 3 is set in 2035 want an OP with modern day gear like M4s, AKs, T-72s and M1s try the RHS or CUP mods, want to go roll over the eastern front in Tigers, T-34s, or just as a normal rifleman try the Iron front mods, or perhaps vietnam, there is the unsung war mod for that. Even Sci-fi mods Excist such as Warhammer 40k, Halo, Star Wars and so forth. 

Also the most important form of mods in my opinion are the ""Realism enhancing"" ones like ACE or TFAR. ACE adds an enormous amount of thing to list a few an improved medical system with different medicine, bandage types and IV, it also completely reworks ballisticks to the level one would expect from say Sniper Elite with not just distance affecting bullets but also wind, temperature and air humidity. TFAR adds a new radio system that works through TeamSpeaks 3D audio. It makes basically all combat situations feel far more alive when its distance based how well you can hear others, or you have to communicate through radios.

Then the DLC. The DLC in ArmA 3 isn't required. Personally I haven't used most of the DLC assets even though I own them. I mostly utilize mod assets due to the zeus scenarios we run with our friend group. Also the way bohemia deals with DLC vehicles is also great. You can enter DLC vehicles as a passenger no problem so even if DLC vehicles are utilized it won't limit you getting a ride in them. 

TLDR: If you want a realistic milsim shooter and can put the effort of becoming a part of a milsim group and utilize mods you can have endless amounts of fun, however if you just want a shooter you can just open the server browser and join a game I would instead recommend squad."

16012,"this game is AMAZING with friends and without friends it becomes your playground. You are able to play RP, Battlefield type battles, Realistic battles and or military situations and much more. Anything and everything is fun, I even seem to have fun even if im trash or dying constantly. This is possibly one of the best games ever made even with the poor optimisation.

10/10 - L?N

"
16013,"Thought it'd be daunting joining Arma in 2021 but I can't believe I hit 80 hours already. Game is amazing, though a bit tricky to learn. The community is amazing! They really helped me get into a place where I can enjoy the game. There are servers for everyone, some more realistic others more laid back. 9.8/10"
16014,"I've been playing shooter games for years now but this is the best game I've played because; 

1: Its realistic. You know that most shooter games whenever you reload you drop a mag that still had 10 rounds in it and put a fresh one in? Yea that mag you dropped on the ground that still had 10 rounds is now back in your ""Inventory"" (I don't know how else to say it)

2. It relies on teamwork (If you don't want to play online there is singleplayer don't worry.) Yes most shooter games also relies on teamwork. But this is different. You get a killstreak in a game and you get an airstrike, right? Now think of an ACTUAL player who is flying that plane. That means you can fly planes and helicopters and shoot at the enemies to help your team out.

3. Its a fun game overall. Here's a list:

Graphics:  8/10

Gameplay: 9/10

Audio: 9/10

Difficulty: Not too difficult. But is hard to master.

Pc requirements: You don't need too much.

Story: There's not really stories, but there is showcases. Which is similar. Overall 7/10

Gametime: This is like it is in real life. Honestly, I spend a few hours on a stealth mission and its worth the time.

There is no bugs I can think of Other than the Official Server. Sometimes when the AI shoots at me I don't take damage. 


Overall, I would give this a game an 8/10

Hope you guys find this helpful :)"
16015,Best game i have played in a long time but i hope they are really working on ARMA4 this game is only going to go so far the game needs to stay the same just update the graphics put some ISIS fighters Taliban fighters add a desert map update guns a little add desert uniforms new missions like bin laden special operations like ied finds come on guys you have fans stop the updates and dlc move on the new game ARMA4  we need a new game already i mean its been so dam long can you atleast start the process of arma4 i mean people are waiting why nothing? your fans are being patient and i think its been long enough stop putting out DLC's and updates work on ARMA4 already i mean what is it going to take? for you guys to see that its been a long time i think its time thanks for letting me put my input
16016,"I had such high hopes.  While the game and game play do appear to be interesting.  The instability issues are untenable.  If a player  has to, or is otherwise expected to, adjust security settings, major parameters, and regularly delete user data the game was not developed properly in my opinion.  Hopefully they can sort these issues out with Arma IV.  If not, there are loads of other good games out there that do work reliably."

16021,Cannot fire!
16022,Graphically it's showing it's age and it doesn't really use multi-core cpus all that well but there's a huge community of modders keeping the game fresh with new content and mods

16036,unless you have the patience of a saint to try and learn all the keys because playing with a control is next to impossible then this is not for you. the graphics suck  and this game just isnt that great. They wouldnt give me a refund when i bought it cuz i spent seven hours trying to play and figure out how to continue one of the missions cuz i kept dieng for absolutely no reason then it said to retreat with my teamate and he got downed so it wouldnt let me continue mission. its just extremely complicated. I mean im litteraly in the army and the shit is easier in real life.

16038,"npc vehicles have 100% accuracy at all times. I've gotten to a point where I can't progress any further because of this. The gunplay is fun, but when a vehicle with a gun spawns in, you're gonna be stuck there for at least an hour, more likely several hours. I've been shot from 500 meters away from a single shot from a vehicle's mounted machine gun, and died instantly. I've been shot in the head through miniscule gaps in cover, from again, a single shot. Not even a luck bullet from a whole spray shoots me in that tiny spot, just a single, perfectly placed shot, every single time. 
Gun play is fun, but vehicles will shoot you through a keyhole from 500 meters away and you'll be stuck for hours dying to the same mrap over and over again, taking out all the fun you might have had."

16055,"Arma3 is wonderful to play with friends and also great to play alone in the eden editor. So many possibilities have been brought forward with the workshop and the vehicles all work perfectly. While the controls might take some time to get used to, once you get the hang of it youll be a pro."

16068,"Now this is the best military simulator I have ever played!

I love the environment and islands on which the scenarios take place. Nature looks amazing and I like to go on a patrol on my own and just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. The detailed possible movement and stance variations (9!)  are great and that you can put down your weapon, when not in need. Also switching between two sight variations and different firing modes are nice. The inventory system is also great and gives a great variety in customization.

The campaign missions are mostly fun. I enjoy the general slow pace of the game: long walks or flights to the destinations and that the firefights are mostly fast, lowkey and unspectacular in comparison to other FPS titles. Radio chatter is also nice but some of the dialogues or scenes that take place in the campaign are not well written and the characters seem at times overly patriotic American or very childlike with simple mindsets, making condescending remarks about the quality of local military for example. At some points in the campaign it was not very clear how to use a certain device to complete a task (e.g. UAV) and one mission had to be skipped because of a mission breaking bug.

So it's not perfect. But the general engine and gameplay mechanics are amazing and complex and there are so many possibilities in this program."
16069,very nice!
16070,Only good with mods :)
16071,good
16072,its alr.
16073,"Very fun game, the gameplay is quite realistic but it can be improved with mods like ace, the map's are massive you can do alot of stuff that Cod and battlefield does not have, in the end its worth the money."

16090,"Yes, I gave this game a thumbs down, but before I explain why, I should preface that the game design itself is not poor in any way, and is an exceptionally executed military combat simulator. 

My issue with this game is the tediousness amount of time it takes to set scenarios up. In the context of Arma's original usage, that is totally ok. But for non-military people, and casual gamers who want to just play an FPS game that doesn't overcomplicate things, this game can never be that for those people. 1) Multiple mods are already a base requirement for this game since the starting factions don't really do much, so rip people with low storage. 2) One player will always be relegated to the role of creating the scenario, which if they don't have the complete skill set to do, will result in long wait times. Another thing that doesn't help is the fact that modded scenarios don't save, so depending on how things work out, you may have to leave the game open and hope your computer doesn't crash (I have to verify this last point, because it may be innaccurate).

Ultimatley, the appeal of this game depends on what you are looking for. If you need to have the most accurate military simulation as your FPS game, then I totally recommend it. However, if after a long day of work, you want to sit down and get a quick gaming fix, this isn't the game for you."

Game can be played in first person or third person."
16099,is good
16100,"BIS has come a long way from Arma 1.  Arma 3 is much more dynamic, mod friendly, easy on the eyes, and high replayability thanks to the mod community.  My unit took a decently functioning dynamic mission system made by a couple modders, and we were able to tweak/fix assets and scripts in the PBO to make it more stable and expand capabilities.  So long as BIS stays on this path of development to make modding accessible (albeit updating the architecture for modern tech), I look forward to Arma 4."

16127,very good!!! recommended.
16128,"I gave this game back an hour later because:
i got 30 fps in gtx 1060 :/

gameplay was so bad 

the game have no player and all of the game servers was empty

"
16129,It's a good game
16130,fun
16131,hard but fun
16132,Cool.
16133,i love it
16134,"This game is great have a lot of fun, when the game fucking works, it's so buggy and a lot of the code is copied from arma 2. That's not saying its not fun, but you may find it hard to have a super hardcore simulation. I mostly play this game to do some ""realistic"" retarded shit with my friends. Squad is larger and smaller scale, there are less vehicles and smaller maps, but the maps are MASSIVE in that game and extremely high detail. But yes, I cannot recommend against this game its amazing, probably would have felt better for me if I got it a few years earlier because now it feels outdated. but yes play it. My only problem with multiplayer, like the ""large scale"" that is mostly only 15v15 its extremely laggy, where I can run squad on max graphics with 50v50 players never dropping below 60. Play this game as a sandbox and a kind of simulation and mess around with mods."
16135,good
16136,"spent a little bit of time playing, 10/10"
16137,poor stealth mechanic go brrrrrrr
16138,Creative mode.
16139,"good
"
16140,"Great war simulation sandbox! 
I probably spend more time building missions and scenarios than actually playing the game.. No matter how much I learn in the editor, there is always something new and interesting I haven't figured out yet.
The AI in game sometimes feels off, but doesn't break the experiences I've had.
I like that it is somewhat more of a realistic game and not a mindless shooter like Call of Duty.
The amount of mods is staggering and many make the game so much better and give you more to play around with.
Overall I love this game and highly recommend if you are into military simulation and such."
16141,it's pretty good but i think it depends too much on dlcs
16142,best game ever
16143,"The cringe is unbelieveable 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0KTnawJZfQ"
16144,"Its so complicating to play with friends, you need to mess around with your router. I wouldve thought it was as simple as invite your friend from steam and play local lke role playing and simulating teamwork and WW2 mods. I would recommend this game if the creators would fix the Friends category."
16145,The most realistic shooting game in my arsenal. Awesome game.
16146,Really good game. 10/10 recommend
16147,"Dont get me wrong this game is really fun! However it sucks when you have no friends....... ofc i have friends........heheh



ps: i spent 24.99 and 7.49 on dlc and the game..... 6days later it came out on flipping sale ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
16148,yes
16149,"More realistic than CoD and Battlefield, slower action but more intense.

There is something unique about Arma. Sure, other games have stuff like infantry combat, building clearing, tanks, APCs, UAVs flying above the battlefield, helicopters and planes striking ground targets and dueling it out in the air above you... but the main difference is: All those other battlefield elements are players too.
There are no killstreaks. You don't get an UAV above the area to scan for enemies because you just killed 3 people. You don't get to be the gunner of a gunship because you killed 15 people. Everyone has their role, and everyone works for that role. If you need an airstrike, you need to coordinate that with the people in the sky, same goes for artillery. If you want an UAV doing recon, you need someone to fly an UAV to the battlefield and do recon with it. And if you need ammunition, you need to call logistics to bring you the ammunition you need.

With mods, the game can drastically change. There are mods which turn this game into Star Wars, with blaster rifles and lightsabers. Other mods turn it into WW2. Others again turn it into Halo, or Vietnam, or whatever. Other mods again don't introduce new units, but instead make it more realistic, adding radios to the game where you need to set your frequency in order to talk to others on the same frequency. Yet another mod changes medical from ""Apply First Aid Kit"" to ""Okay, he has 2 large avulsions, 1 puncture wound, he lost about two liters of blood, his heart stopped beating, and his airways are occluded. We need a medic over here!"" And by combining multiple mods, you are creating your very own gaming experience, where you preferably play together with friends, or at least with those a**holes you can halfway tolerate for the next 2-3 hours to play the mission your Zeus prepared for you."
16150,it fun
16151,:)
16152,"well this game is great but for almost 40$ its not worth it, but i got it for 10$ for the lunar new year discount and so far really enjoying it"
16153,Have had a great time. It runs smoothly on my laptop
16154,This game is pretty cool very realistic and fun
16155,Best Milsim game
16156,"i just really hate this game, the intro is boring but demonstrates the awful aim mechanics and stiff gun play, i have played games like r6s titan fall 2 tf2 devil daggers l4d2 and a handful of cod games and this is the worst one yet and i hate cod.

a comment has sead that this game is not just another mindless flashy shooter but a simulator, now i have held and fired hand guns, nothing much as it was a small glock but the thing is that you just cant simulate somethings, like combat. out of the games i have played r6s would come the closest to a simulator as it trys to simulate a swat team requiring teamwork, skill and timing to succeed.

in the end this is my revue from my point hence why i put down some other games i have played so you can see where im coming from, slapping ""simulator"" on a game does not give it a good reason to be bad, the worst part is that this game is not even close to being a simulator as it has the worst aim mechanics."
16157,This game didnt ban me.
16158,Pretty nice mil sim game with a substantial modding community and a diverse range of servers to play on. Its also a game that due to being a sandbox-based shooter can be played however you like and despite some bugs/glitches is great fun with friends and solo!
16159,ggggggggggggggggggg
16160,I have no clue what I'm doing.
16161,good
16162,My team-mates were racist.
16163,Been avoiding this game for years due to the optimisation rumours......kicking myself now the game runs like a dream.
16164,"Not suitable to play single player.
If you buy play it in multiplayer only.
You will got a experience of friendship like ""TITANIC"""
16165,"One of the best mil sim I've ever played, and also with a really good server and mods comunity I've seen in a game. When I bought it I just played Roleplay servers but once I started to play King of the Hill, Wasteland, etc... you start having lots of fun if u weren't having before. Still waiting for the sequel :P"
16166,Like Squad except you don't have to pretend that you're having fun.
16167,Shitty perfomace simulator 10/10 tho.......................................................................................... improve your game
16168,realistic combat is fun but the butter is the RP servers
16169,God I love how good the sandbox is
16170,iz good but not as good as Noita
16171,"Reduce the price of DLC it's practically pay to win and without a sale of like 50% off the full game is around 60-100 dollars USD. Other than that the game is worth the insane amount for the payed DLC. Side note: Have a mic because people barely read chat, I made that mistake."
16172,i frickin love this game
16173,"Great game if your into milsim and or Realistic shooters 

theres so many different thing you can do like fly helicopters, planes/jets or tear up a villiage with a tank or explosives so many possibilites"
16174,realistic but could be a a bit more optimised
16175,"How can a game that prides itself in being a realistic military-shooter simulator be so immersive and precise while also being the buggiest shit I've ever played? Arma 3 allows users to create and share endless experiences, scenarios and missions that lets other users immerse themselves in combat and strategy. You can hop into the editor, spend an hour or two creating a base of operations and enemy encampments to raid and destroy, while also being able to share that experience with friends or the public. Its arguably the main reason that Arma 3 is so popular after all these years. While many servers are dedicated to military simulation, many others are all about simulating warfighting in some of the most popular video games and movies. Star Wars servers exist that allow you to join up with dozens of other clone troopers to take down the Separatists. Warhammer 40K servers are still up with plenty of space marines to praise the Emperor! There is no limit to the places you can bring war in Arma 3. 

With all that being said, this game can be buggy as hell. Small drones the size of watermelons tipping over artillery tanks. Planes blowing up on a clear runway with no obstacles. Getting stuck inside of rocks or containers. Many things can ruin the immersion of Arma 3 while you are playing.

Yet somehow this adds to the Arma-ness of the experience and has made many playsessions of mine more enjoyable and fun! Defending a small hole while being pounded by artillery and surrounded by enemies is already a fun and challenging experience. Then out of nowhere an AT squadmate pulls out his Vorona missile launcher and hits a T100 battle tank. The tank goes flying hundreds of yards in the air and we are all dying laughing while dying in game!

I would strongly recommend buying this absolute unit of a game. Make sure to get the ""Apex edition"" if you intend on going into multiplayer servers due to many of them requiring certain DLC's that the Apex version contains."
16176,yes
16177,">Shoot a man seven times
>The man shoots back
>Game fails to register hit, so you think you survive
>Ends up being a one shot kill from that other guy
>You die, having to painfully do this over and over again
10/10, Arma 4 please."
16178,Best game ever.
16179, one of the best games i very play very nice very good game and you need to try it

Pros:
-great sandbox itself
-many mods,gameplay types and gamemodes are just on point (especially zeus for dynamic scenarios)

cons:
-quite buggy (none of them destroys the game but sometimes its pretty annoying)
-zeus mode is perfect itself but hasnt been updated a long time ago and needs some work still
-sometimes playerbase is just not so much into it as it should
-requires really good pc for smooth gameplay since i own decent one and it still can drop below 40's

16194,game goes wrong to much and you cant play with friends as all the servers are password protected
16195,love the editor great for making own games
16196,Still perfect
16197,acceptable casualties go brrrrrrr
16198,"As a person who has at the moment put in 1k hours into Arma 3 I recommend it highly. Its a game that I've put so much time and effort into and the result is a community of people that can come together and have a good time. If you get this game, you should find a community to play it with. That's where it shines the most, whilst public games are okay; the extent at which you can play with a group of people is amazing. 

This game takes Combined Warfare to the max, in a single operation you can have squads of troops carrying out a mission whilst Aerial and Motorised groups support the ground troops, doing things like gunruns and convoys. Its insane how large the game can feel and how alive a single operation can feel when you have so many different people working together in different ways to accomplish one goal.

The infantry gameplay is extremely enjoyable, even if it takes a long time to learn all the keybinds. It has a steep learning curve, but if you can put in a couple hours to learn how to play you will reap thousands back in immersive gameplay.

Whilst not a game built around helicopters and planes, Bohemia has done an incredible job of making these vehicles extremely fun to fly and use. If you enjoy flying games, whilst not ultra realistic, it still gives an extremely fun time as you fly at insane speeds, pulling off incredible manourves or formation flying with friends.

The vehicle aspect of this game is i think very underlooked, the driving in this game feels really good and I love sitting in vehicles driving and hearing my gunner pop shots off at contacts. 

A lot of things in this game work so perfectly with eachother it creates a truly amazing experience and I have to say if you can get past the bugs and steep learning curve you will end up having a truly amazing time

Thank you too the devs for the continued support on this game and I look foward to Arma 4 ;)"

16204,"[h1] Tis be my 100th hour review, and I dub thee a good game.	[/h1]

[b]allow me to tell you what I like and dislike about it.[/b]

1. graphics are good, very pretty.
2. easy to learn, hard to master, even harder when your being attacked by CAS and all you have is .44mm grenade launcher.
3. Mods, mods, and mods, How can one be without thee.
4. People you meet in servers, lots of friendly lads.
5. The contact campaign was VERY good, I liked it very much.

[b]things I don like bout tis game :-([/b]

1. the east wind campaign: Its pretty good, it didn't crash on me and there was no major lag I noticed BUT it was boring :( and there wasn't much options to steer the story. [spoiler] when I got to camps and I do the patrols, nothing changes its as if I didn't go there in the first place, it does not tie in to the story, and on top of that, the loot wasn't worth it. :-( [/spoiler].

2. campaigns: the game has these nice drones, love them, they are great, but we hardly touch them, it would be very cool if we could go on a recon mission and use them, or have them as an option item to use.

3. the tanks, Choppers, and Jets DLC... they are very basic, I mean they are not all that exciting to buy. I think, personally these should have been in the base game, as for DLCs: add more, interesting, historical vehicles! people will go nuts for them.

4. physics: if the enemy doesn't kill you, arma3 physics will :(

5. dying in the single player campaign is the worst, lots of saves, lots of time spent staring at the screen waiting for the game to load up. I know there isn't much to do about that issue aside of switching characters or making the game less realistic, which the realism is the fun of it. But still, its an issue that bother me.

[b] these do be my own review, if I missed anything let me know[/b]

thanks for reading. :)"
16205,"pretty much pay to play after buying the game, you have to pay to get on a quad bike"

16208,Terrible optimization. Ugly graphics. Controls feel floaty and unsatisfying. I have no idea how reviews for this game are so positive. Do not recommend at all

16210,"greatest game ever made. from building your own scenarios in a city skylines type view, to playing on the battlefield, to flying in jets and helicopters. amazing. Cant wait for more form this studio.

Truly a feat of game creation."

Everything as usual - enemy AI sees you through the bushes, ally AI stands at full height while being shot at and you are the one who is responsible for damn idiots. AI cannot flank, they only rushes your position like the are Swarm from Gears. I did try increasing AI difficulty, but got only more headshots through the bushes."

With tons of mods on the workshop you can customize the game in whatever way you want. There's also mods out there on the workshop that can make ArmA 3 more than a Mil-Sim. The base game itself is filled with content with both multiple singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios pre-made for you to play.

I really recommend this game to anyone who finds any interest in Mil-Sim games."

i have always disliked server oriented mp games, i prefer the join lobby and quick play style more. I had fun playing the campaign but getting into the mp scene is just hard for me.

16309,pew pew
16310,Milisim is fun
16311,Fantastic Game in terms of the Mechanics and Realism. Weapons are truly Fantastic. The game can feel like a walking simulator at times if you dont know what your doing and your new. Online players use real military Tactics to engage Enemies. This is a Mil Sim so dont expect to get into action right away. Missions take Planning. The game has an Eden Editor which is pretty in depth and awesome with the community making their own Missions. Bullet balistics and projectiles work amazing real as the game has had many years in development however one thing the game could do better with is Server Optimization as well as audio issues. Gun audio tends to feel delayed at times and games feel a bit laggy at times. overall i give the game a 9/10 considering there is not really any other game out there that can compete with what arma 3 does. If you love Real military shit and are passionate as well about tactical shooters/mil sim games then this is for you. but make sure you have a fricken MIC. do not play this game without reading the field Manual.

16324,"Sadly, a disgusting game, very sloppy, horrible engine, no missions, plus weird online servers and never a straight up match, always weird , i thought this is a war game not an unhinged pubg lookalike with many options you will never use, not even worth 7 dollars !! i regret this purchase !! i should be refunded, but i will leave that to steam and the developers, i dont think they care to anyway"
16325,"The game is way more fun then it seems, it might look complex but it isn't unless you install ace medical, lol. But the game general is a lot of fun for those who want to experiance some fighting but not dying to a IED In RL. But of course the there is a to many DLCs for such a game, but thats my only real issue with it, other wise check it out."

16333,"UPDATE: I don't suck at ArmA 3 anymore, thanks to my dudes over at Consolidated Global Front. You can join us, too!

Alright, real man talk - I have never played an ArmA game before.

I know, I know - ""dude, you missed out on your childhood"", ""what do you mean you have never played the greatest hits of all time"", and other such commentary have smugly snuggled in my noggin for the past three years. So I finally gave in to try ArmA 3 out, and ... 

I suck at it. Plain and simple. 

The game is ridiculously well-optimized. I often believe that if I ever get a completed game, I should get it with all the DLCs. Even on a sale, the entire ArmA 3 bundle is priced way out of my budget for any game, and so I got the base game to try it out. Love it when there is a sandbox available, love it when every simulated detail fits in place. This game looks like it has an infinitely replayable concept running; however, I play (and prefer to play) solo campaigns. I can now either get it again, YT some tutorials, and grind till I master it; or I can accept that I suck at it and never look back.

After realizing what was happening, I refunded the game at 119 minutes of gameplay. I have been fighting a battle of regret and relief ever since. Help me."
16334,never gets old. 10/10
16335,"Its very worth it and I've enjoyed playing it a lot. The community is great and the game it's self has a good story, and a fun community. The controls take a little to get used to, but once you do there is nothing to complain about. You will most likely have an easier time with the controls if you own a full keyboard. Smaller keyboards have a harder time with all the key bindings. 

Overall, def. worth it. I would wait for the game to go on sale to get it though."
16336,"it's not a war crime, it's denying the enemy future recruits."
16337,gud game until you get shot by a tank from 4km away.
16338,solid game been out for years but is still so much fun to play i recommend playing with mods as the modding community produces amazing content however the base game is still fun all servers are populated with loads of game modes. Playing this game with mates is a lot of fun however you need a good cpu as it is a very cpu heavy game
16339," :)

16340,Maybe the real warcrime was how much fun we had along the way.
16341,if  you want  realistic this the game.....best game ever
16342,"Do not get this game. Literally out of nowhere i am unable to play this crap game because the launcher crashes within 10 seconds every single time i try to play the game. Literally deleted and reinstalled this game 3 times now i even unsubscribed from the 30+ mods i had and reinstalled the game and for some reason i still see ""launch with mods"" in the launcher when i dont even have any. I repeat. DO NOT GET THIS GAME."
16343,Really Good
16344,i usually look at playtime from comments to see if the game will be a quick 20-60 hours.... as you can tell from these comments you can have a playtime of a month or more and still enjoy the game

I guess the downloadable mods made this game maybe the most entertaining and fun game to play. Even though the game is almost the 10 years old (8 years if we are more presice). I think this game will be on my playable games a long while."
16361,Arm 3
16362,"This is a good game however it's better off with a community to play with apart from that the story is okay. The basic training helps the player get the basics of the game. Overall, it's good but really get a group of people to play with."
16363,"I've played this series since it was operation flashpoint so I'm very familiar.  The new updated engine and interface is really cool.  You can drag bodies in multiplayer and heal each other.  You can use the vehicle inventory to load and unload gear and it was all confusing but there was a tutorial on every aspect of the game.  The single player campaign in my opinion is rather weak because the stock rifle has high recoil, no power.  Other than that, most multiplayer games have whats called virtual arsenal where you can pick your own gear, weapons, outfit, the whole nine.  Everyone looks different online its so cool.  Coop is so much fun.  I recently bought a headset to play and talk online, the human teamwork is very good in multiplayer.  The community is very mature and takes it serious.  So much fun.  As far as the single player campaign like I said, I don't  really play those, but the mission editor I'm looking to get into.  It also has a tutorial and there are forums online with many articles on how to make your own missions.  The replay value goes on for years with this game.  I played the original operation flashpoint for like ten years.  I know I'll be playing this game for a long time.  I don't even want any other game at this point.  Highly recommend."

16373,"This game has been throughout my whole life it seems, it is truly a master piece. I can't wait for Arma IV, will be amazing without a doubt"
16374,"Arma 3, where to start...

I think the best place to start, is the Basic Training or ""Tutorial"" that the game suggest upon you starting the game. This training will take you through the basics of Arma, the controls, how to read a map, and the mechanics of this military simulation. This then leads into a small ""campaign"", this will teach you the basics of combat and fearing for your life (In game), reacting to contact and the difficulties of engaging AI. 

This then leads into the main campaign, where you are a ""Future Soldier"", you experience the difficulties of combat and other various situations that give you an ""Oh shit"" kind of feeling. The campaign is long and sometimes tedious, but the missions are worth it, the experience and combat is great, commanding a fire team sized element to a squad sized team, is very useful when the situation can change in an instant. The campaign, is unforgiving into where you are unable to go back on a decision very easily, with every decision you make, resulting in victory or a mass casualty situation. Fantastic for single player people who wish to have that experience.

Public Multiplayer is a whole other situation. Multiplayer is difficult due to the Arma mechanics, its difficult to see people sometimes, and reacting to players who are more focused on a kill shot more then the suppression of an AI you might experience in the campaign. 

Ah, Milsim, where the Arma community shines. Milsim or Military Simulation, is something that is differently not for everyone. Milsim (Depending on the community) is where you will find the best communities as they are full of people who love the game, as well as people who are military enthusiast and or people who are active duty or retired. It takes time to wiggle your way into a unit (again, depending on the unit), but most units are fun, you enjoy playing with the same people, learning how to be leaders and to work together as a team making these communities friendship groups that can last for years to come.

What I love about Arma 3:
Arma 3, to me, isnt like any other game. It has its restrictions, but Arma is completely up to you. With little to no limitations other than the strength of your computer. You can do what you want in the game, You like planes/helos? You like tanks/APCs/IFVs? You like drones? You like tactics and acting like a commander to a larger unit? This game is for you. I can not stress this enough how much you can do in this game. With its vastly expansive Steam Workshop and other modding communities, it offers almost limitless opportunities. 

I hope this has helped you determine if you want to play this game and join the awesome communities it have to offer!"
16375,"ArmA 3 can have an appeal to all types of military shooter players. If you enjoy more casual and arcade gameplay while also incorporating realism into it. Things like Official serves and groups who specialize in that type of gameplay will apply to you. If you want a hyper realism experience to immerse yourself in your game, there are private servers who do it every day. ArmA also has an extensive workshop to customize every single game to be a unique experience. From WW1 to Afghan+ the ArmA has it all."
16376,"Great game, very tactical and enjoyable. The Arma community is easily one of the best i've been in... hope this helps :)"
16377,gucci
16378,shit
16379,Run.
16380,"Arma 3, is a very realistic military/war simulation. Open world and massive multiplayer game. 

This game is really hard to understand at first, but once your in the game and you play for a few hours, everything becomes clear to you. The experience is great, especially with all the DLC's, this makes Arma 3 more interactive and exciting with action packed missions/objectives. 

Gun simulations, Navigation, Commands/Orders. Leadership, Combat and all other aspects of the game is very realistic. UI (User Interface), Controls/Key-binds, and other visible statistics can be quite complex but you will soon get use to them and understand what everything is.

Vehicles, weapons and gadgets are great, sound effects and animations are very close to somewhat the real things. Arma 3 also has a similar Battlefield feature in the game, such as, squads/units. Very good for identifying those in your team and personal squad. 

Overall, Arma 3 is a fantastic, realistic war game that i'm pretty sure most people would enjoy. 
Team working is a must, especially on missions.

Highly Recommended! Try it for yourself if you haven't already!"
16381,"I'm in a discord Arma Unit, of course I recommend it, it's one of the methods of recruitment that we have"

16458,"Arma 3 Vanilla and Modded - 7/10

Vanilla: 

The vanilla version of Arma 3 has a lot to offer, if you bought the DLCs; multiple campaign stories (some unique and some are bland). Overall the optimization is up to standard as it runs on 90 FPS with Ultra settings and 30-60 when there are a lot of vehicles or assets  in a particular mission.

The vanilla multiplayer is amazing if you have the right people, as it seems like a CODMW2 lobby with zero coordination if you go onto the Zeus, TDM, etc. with incompetent people. However, it has a lot to offer with the right people.

In conclusion, the vanilla version of Arma 3 has a lot to offer if you paid for DLCs (which is not a lot if on sale), and with the right people. The game is amazing, but has a lot to be desired in some areas, such as vehicles.

Modded: - 9/10

The modded game has a lot to offer with many great mods porting weapons, vehicles and terrain from Arma 2 and unique gameplay such as RHS (Red Hammer Studios). However, the optimization is abismal, as it requires modifications to the game; it pays off with an organized community to take role in missions that are top tier.

In conclusion, Arma 3 is a full package with or without mods and I highly recommend acquiring the game"
16459,"Love it all though Argo is free, Arma 3 is way better. i like the Special ops/millitary types since i like those type of games"
16460,"great game for people that are sick of playing the same rounds of call of duty over, and over again. There are tons of different types of servers from RP servers to milsim experiences that are extremely fun to do. If you're a realistic game lover, I highly suggest buying this game and others like it (squad, tarkov, etc.) Also do not get overwhelmed by the complex look of the servers and mods and all that, its actually super easy to do!"
16461,"Very Mod Heavy Game, requires all DLC to fully utilize the full depth of the game. Requires lots of processing power. lots of replay-ability with workshop mod system. ESSENTIAL to install A3 Launcher as it manages the mods much easier and makes connecting to modded servers a breeze"

 Game demands much of the player's ability, forcing him to make the best possible experience. It is the player who has to entertain itself using the tools that Bohemia Interactive provided.

16522,"I will make an Average review. Well here I go: ArmA 3 is an Milsim, more like a Military Sandbox tho, it has thousands of good mods, and awesome Gamemodes in Multiplayer, it is an slow pasted game, teamwork is important, the campaigns and scenarios are mod compatible, but get buggy with it tho but still playable if you got time, I've been playing ArmA 3 since some years now (4+) ArmA 3 is sick, with it's gun fire, if you got mods that make the graphics' better grab em'! Grenade impacts, better flashes. ArmA 3 plays in the year 2034-2035, it has 1 main campaign, East Wind, but alot of scenarios, and a DLC campaign Apex which is awesome! If you want a fun Multiplayer experience with friends, get it, the price went far down since back then, for examplxe: I bought it for 50‚Ç¨ my friend bought it for 5‚Ç¨. The Game has some bugs, but, be patient lol, like really, idc if there are bugs, the game is awesome, with mods it gets more advanced, with some mods you can get ArmA 2 weapons and outfits, you can play it for Hundreds of hours before it gets boring, got 3000 hours to spare? SPEND IT ON ARMA! I thank Arma for nearly everything, Arma was one of my first games ever, thank you Bohemia, and thank you reader! Play it, it will change your view of gaming."

16536,"WARNING: THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT AND A CAUTIONARY TAIL OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU BUY IT... YOU'VE BEEN WARNED


I hate this game, I hate it. I hate it. I HATE IT. I hate everything about anyone who profits from this game. If you like this game? I hate you too. Its nothing personal, that's just how it has to be. I gave Bohemia the benefit of the doubt AND my hard earned money along with it. That was my choice, a poor one at that. Don't blame me for all the hate that emanates from me, Bohemia made me this way.

The moral of my story is, if you are looking for a game that will frustrate you to no end without countless crashes, no support, AND terrible menu limbo then STEP RIGHT UP AND COLLECT YOUR GOLDEN GOOSE. However, if you don't wish to become a hate filled fool babbling on a steam review for no one to ever see then please don't buy this game. Writing this totally pointless review for how much this game has disappointed me wont bring back the 130 hours closer to death this experience has brought me, but it will act as closure for the last moment of time I will ever lose to this game."

I don't understand how a game from NINE YEARS AGO that is still undergoing extensive updates, IS SO HORRIBLE. 

On top of this, you are a soldier who can't jump. yes, you heard that right. you can't jump. what you do is press the V key until you kinda just glitch through whatever is stopping you from advancing. the idea for this game was so good... but the execution was horrid. the graphics are extremely dated, and to be honest, I'm not really concerned with that. what concerns me is that even with the graphics on the lowest setting, I can only manage about 10-18 fps in the main town. my computer can run cyberpunk 2077 at high, and Fallout 4/Doom eternal at their absolute max settings. how the heck is this game so bad..."
16550,69 niceeeeee
16551,Very good!
16552,i like it

16557,i'm dying to play this game... the last time they did a free weekend i missed it cos by the time it downloaded the free weekend was over. then i went to get it now and just missed the sale! üò≠ it looks amazing
16558,"I do love this game. As soon as I began I was excited that almost any computer can run it. I love the gameplay and realism of it. I do have a few issues with it such as the Tutorial does not exactly give you enough info on healing, how to actaully use iron sights, etc. Another issue is I struggle to find a good server where I can just play the game with random people. I always feel like I do not fit in with the others."
16559,too bad game dont worth a cent ....
16560,Mil-Sim Perfection.
16561,carpet bomb civilians 10/10
16562,I have almost 4000 hours in arma 3 now and hands down it's best game I have ever played. Make sure you have a good pc before buying this game. Just because it's and old games does not mean a lower spec PC can run it. But once you do get a PC that can run this game there is nothing like it. It is a sand box of the likes which you have never seen before. Other AAA games are born from Arma. It's way more than just a realistic military shooter. It's a glorious RPG sand box. The community has reinvented this game one hundred times over with community created content. If you're going to buy this game download some mods. You'll thank me later.
16563,Hands up or die...
16564,Just get it.
16565,I like the sandbox aspect a lot! The multiplayer isnt really for me.
16566,Very Cool EDEN Editor remindes me of gmod

16571,"Arma 3 War Stories:

Become a squad leader of a 12 man squad, fucking hate squad mates 11 and 12 because they aren't binded to F11 and F12 keys so it makes it much harder to control them, managed to load my squad in a covered transport truck, mission is to secure a route, controlling the truck felt immersive while doing this little road trip to the mission, get ambushed by enemies on the road, lost a comrade including my own life... (Sh*t medic decided not to heal me)

New life, also the squad leader of a 12 man squad, fucking despise squad mates 11 and 12, this time I bought a helicopter because I don't wanna be ambushed again, forgot I didn't know how to fly, somehow managed to fly my ass and my squad to the mission without crashing, mission is to defuse land mines, landed choper, me and the boys walk up to the land mines and accidentally stepped on one, nothing happened?, thought the mission was bugged so I canceled the mission and me and the boys beginning to go back to the choper, fucking HUGE explosion, apparently the mines were activated and can only work on cars so a truck that was just passing by got fucked, reloaded the save, spent 30 minutes defusing all of the mines, went back to the choper, 11 and 12 were glitched and couldn't some reason use the choper, fed up with 11 and 12 I order execution but rest of the squad didn't like that so I died, atleast I got to kill 11 and 12
The bastards got what they deserved

16596,i love this game
16597,10/10 would play with the australian again
16598,"ah, arma 3. this game has a learning curve and takes some getting used to, but when you get the hang of it, i guarantee you'll have fun with it."
16599,"Great game, i like it."
16600,It is a fun game
16601,Tha best
16602,"This is the single most enjoyable military shooter I've played. I love all the mods, the ease of install, and the variety of different game modes. The only thing that holds the game back is the learning curve. A lot of the different roles and options seems to be more difficult than they are or they require some controls tweaking. Once you get a hold on the controls and the scope of the game, IT ROCKS YOUR SOCKS OFF. I just played the Vietnam mod, Unsung, and it blew my mind with the completely changed gameplay. 

GAME IS AMAZING. Please just be aware of the Arma 3 jank. Things are going to break, hard, but you're going to enjoy every moment you play with friends. Solo is an iffy recommendation."

16604,
16605,Poggers game
16606,great game good for pros and new player easy to learn love zues only down side is i need to find away to use a controller for the game
16607,go
16608,I like the war aspect of this but mostly like the mods you can get which they're are thousands of them and you don't need a really good computer for most of them
16609,good game
16610,yep
16611,A really amazing simultaion game that offers your mind to expand it's thinking and see how life would be like in war/misson/operations.
16612,pog
16613,no
16614,good game
16615,fun
16616,"So, God forbid that they allow setting up a server to be even remotely simple. Ive been trying for the past hour to set up a server, just so i can play with the friend who suggested this to me. So honestly, unless they fix this, I see no future of me playing this game, and will be requesting a refund until then."
16617,Really Fun Sandbox Game
16618,gud game :)
16619,
16620,"Went to change my settings. Nope, Need DLC for that. Tried to exit the game. Nope, need DLC for that."
16621,Realistic
16622,"Still the only open-engine tactical shooter and because of that, remains the best. The community units and modders are the ones who have given this game it's reputation. Highly recommended if you understand that the real game starts when you join a unit and get into custom Zeus ops. Here's hoping the next version comes out before I'm dead xD"

16626,hello my fellow panda followers i am here yet again to give you a review during my first 3 hours of gameplay i have grown to love this games multiplayer during the time i have played i meet up with my squad and we were walking to the objective when we got ambushed by the enemy it was a blast fighting them of and i would recommened this game to anyone who enjoys online shooting rps
16627,Jumps on curb flys and dies.
16628,real life 2.0
16629,This game might be 8 years old but damn if it doesn't have nearly unlimited playing potential. The SP campaigns can be a bit tough but the multiplayer and the tens of thousands of mods will keep you entertained till the end of time.
16630,Enjoyed the team play and graphics. Like the real sim feel of the game play and the strategic planning to accomplish missions.  The mods are sometimes too much to load if you don't know what is being used or not for different missions.
16631,muito bom e realista fizeram igual o rio de janeiro üòéüëç
16632,great game with endless fun and if you get bored you can play on different servers
16633,its fun if you get into a good server and watch a few tutorials. Also it manages to make sitting around doing nothing fun

16647,"Ok, so this is my finally update to this game/review.

So everyone claimed, that my pc was overheated. I did have battery problems.

But then, when I got my laptop repaired. I got back on it, re-downloaded steams and the Steamui.dll was damage and was a fatal error.

So then I went to my technician support, they claimed it was malware that cause the damage. I also get yearly check up. Idk when everyone does their check-ups but I do mind less often due to the fact I only visit websites I know.

So overall, Overheating, malware, and damage files all in one day of me playing this game. I find it very interesting that I claimed this game damage my pc. But everyone claimed it was overheating, yet a bunch of my files were damaged in the process, plus I got malware on the same day as my pc overheated. 

Now, I know coincidence is a thing. But when you get literally 2 completely different things effecting your pc. You start going, not coincidence.

So basically a 20 dollar game since it was on discount turned out to be nearly 500 dollars of repairs. Their goes 500 dollars of my bill for this month. Thanks arma 3.

So now, I am completely not trusting this game even if it free-to-play. I would not recommend new players to buy this game.

I also know laptops aren't that good then desktop. But my laptop cost me over 2.5k which is a very expensive gaming laptop. Alienware as well. Had this laptop for about not even 5 years yet.

The only reason my pc overheated was the helicopter part and the funny part is I have a few games with helicopters in it and more high graphic then this game plus I was playing on medium graphic to high before it all went down.

I also feel like I should get a compensation for this as well. But I know i'm not gonna get it cause someone just gonna make up some fake story relating everything being a domino effect. So just gonna avoid this companies games at all cost, even if it hits console.

So lastly my conclusion to this game is, Is that it could be compromised to new player who buy the game. So I warn the new players.

I would say I had bad luck at the very neno-second before everything went down. But I am doubting it a lot.

For the people who try'd to change my mind. Thanks for trying. But this game and the company is now my black-list of companies/games not to trust.

I'll just stick to the youtube videos of this game. But until they fix this or compensate me for this. No chance I am ever coming back to this at all. Not asking for a million dollars. Just asking for the money I spent on repairs alone. I don't care for the taxes. Just on the main payment I paid for the visit of the repair store, the repair cost, and the technician. That's all I am asking.

Until then. Good bye and Avoiding this game at all cost."
16648,war never changes
16649,Best military game I've ever played and convinced ever created!
16650,"Really immersive once you get the hang of it. For the best experience single-player, download some realism mods (there are a bunch of recommended ones on Youtube), then download scenarios or campaigns from the Steam Arma 3 workshop."
16651,"??
"
16652,"Arma 3 is like riding in a volvo with the roof off, it's surreal bro"
16653,"Acts more as a foundation than a game, the dedicated modding community is what helps this game thrive - best played with a group. Avoid some of the DLC as it literally adds stuff that the RHS mod packs adds for free"
16654,"where do i start.... arma 3 has been out for a very long time now, and even though it may have its bugs and its issues in all honesty thats really what makes arma... well arma. this game has a never ending list of bugs and issues, but compared to most games that have comparable amount of issues this game just works, its fun, its playable over and over and over and dont even get me started on the mods that have never once failed me, every single mod ive ever used worked flawlessly perhaps one of the only games ive ever played where the mods dont fail. bohemia yall may suck at development, but whatever yall did here with arma 3 its working and i hope arma 4 or whatever comes next will be as enjoyable as arma 3 is, there is a never ending amount of content and gameplay even on the vanilla game its replayability is incredible. i strongly STRONGLY reccomend this game to anyone who wants to get into milsim, i was with the 3rd infantry milsim for many years and although right now i no longer have much time for milsims and i have accumulated over 1000 hours on this game i still from time to time pop in for a play or goofing off or what have you. i cant begin to describe the amount of things to do in arma 3 after you introduce mods into this game, its incredible how a game this old has stayed so popular for so long. bohemia heres a note for you specifically if you get around to seeing this review: please dont shut the servers down any time soon, lots of other games at this age already are shutting down their servers and all that and arma 3 would be one of those games i can see still being played 15 years from now, so please let the servers live on as long as possible, arma 3 has so much potential still even if yall are working on a new game i would love to see arma 3 thrive for years to come. anyway i highly reccomend this game even if its not on sale pick yourself up a copy of arma 3 if you are a milsim fan or a star wars fan or a halo fan or anything along those lines, ive seen entire servers running full blown halo mods or star wars mods its incredible how much the modding brings this game to life. go get it... like yesterday... go on you need it."
16655,"after playing this, i have become a true noob."
16656,b
16657,"Put a couple of hours in, it's alright. 10/10 PTSD simulator"
16658,"As a person who has at the moment put in 1.5k hours into Arma 3 I recommend it highly. Its a game that I've put so much time and effort into and the result is a community of people that can come together and have a good time. If you get this game, you should find a community to play it with. That's where it shines the most, whilst public games are okay; the extent at which you can play with a group of people is amazing. 

This game takes Combined Warfare to the max, in a single operation you can have squads of troops carrying out a mission whilst Aerial and Motorised groups support the ground troops, doing things like gunruns and convoys. Its insane how large the game can feel and how alive a single operation can feel when you have so many different people working together in different ways to accomplish one goal.

The infantry gameplay is extremely enjoyable, even if it takes a long time to learn all the keybinds. It has a steep learning curve, but if you can put in a couple hours to learn how to play you will reap thousands back in immersive gameplay.

Whilst not a game built around helicopters and planes, Bohemia has done an incredible job of making these vehicles extremely fun to fly and use. If you enjoy flying games, whilst not ultra realistic, it still gives an extremely fun time as you fly at insane speeds, pulling off incredible manourves or formation flying with friends.

The vehicle aspect of this game is i think very underlooked, the driving in this game feels really good and I love sitting in vehicles driving and hearing my gunner pop shots off at contacts. 

A lot of things in this game work so perfectly with eachother it creates a truly amazing experience and I have to say if you can get past the bugs and steep learning curve you will end up having a truly amazing time

Thank you too the devs for the continued support on this game and I look foward to Arma 4 ;)"
16659,it ok
16660,Good game for 2021
16661,Really fun!
16662,Fun after you get the hang of it
16663,a high-medium pog game for me crashed quite a bit but overall a good game
16664,d
16665,gud
16666,"its not war crimes its just denying the enemy future reinforcements
"
16667,"9/10 Great game. Slow paced and methodical strategy to overcome your enemy is all it takes. Great selection of weaponry and a wide variety of vehicles. The DLCS are dope too. Only downside is its a simulator. So all the COD kids who like to spray and pray, keep scrolling this isn't for you."
16668,i play this more then i use pornhub and i cum twice as hard as i use it :)

16674,"I played this game for 6 hours straight yesterday because of how fun the campaign mode is in this game, it is by far one of the best military simulation games out there and the storyline aswell is amazing i would highly suggest this game 10/10"
16675,awesome
16676,Yes
16677,very gud gam must by
16678,"ArmA 3 is a versatile game, a great jankfest. The base-game is entirely fine on it's own two legs. ArmA has a campaign, which while janky at times (it can be broken due to the nature of the game) is stellar. It manages to educate you on the basics of the game. 

But the true gem of ArmA lies in the modding scene, and the operations. They've added revolutionary new features such as:
Jumping, turning on your safety, radio interference, a million different guns, food system, the ability to carry boxes (though in a janky way), women and a stupidly complex medical system. 

While ArmA on it's own simulates wind speed and air density and every little detail which has a factor on ballistics, the community has added so much that ArmA now can be played as anything from a janky zombie survival game, to a full military simulator with different units co-ordinating and doing different roles. 

The best thing, though. That's the ability to spend 4 hours driving a truck carrying imaginary guns to people, only to slightly overcompensate in a turn and hit a tree pulverizing your leg."
16679,"if you want to feel stupid and useless, play arma 3 for the first time :)"
16680,was fun but its to hard to play multiplayer
16681,
16682,i got the game again because of a friend and it turns out you need the right mods and right people to play with but it doesn't take away the fact that the game is quite buggy so get the game at your own risk.
16683,Nice game
16684,"This game is my jam, only reason I don't have thousands of hours was I forgot how much I loved playing it at some point"
16685,"very nice,"
16686,"Game is really showing it's age, mostly in the game modes. Most of my time was spent in a milsim unit, and while that was an interesting experience, without it the game feels pointless. The multiplayer game modes are a slog. The engine is lacking many functions one would expect from an RPG, where those modes are concerned. PVP modes are generally grinds just to unlock the access to gear and vehicles. King of the Hill is the most popular mode, but it would take literal days and days of playing just to level up and gain access to higher end gear that most of the dedicated players already have, which is a drag as you will constantly be killed by things you cannot access (weapons, vehicles, even just optics take days of playtime to unlock). The only redeeming mode, in my opinion, is Warlords, where you can order troops and gear and play out a small campaign in real time. However, even that mode was only fun for a couple hours before the novelty wore off. Bottom line, it's just hard to have fun in this game. You can, but it's more work than it's worth to me."
16687,funny guys like to kill you on asylum life because you didnt put your hands up in less than .05 milliseconds
16688,I hate it because it gives me headaches but I also like it because it gives me headaches.
16689,50 bmg
16690,"the game is just amazing, but there is one major problem and the problem is that in order to play coop/ with friends you have to download so many stuff and it's not fair. again the game is great, but the multiplayer/ COOP, mode of the game just doen't work for me.
I hope you guys fix the issue very soon.
  -Tank you Bohemia iteractive

16691,guga
16692,This game needs to make it clearer how to kick players and to add more consequences for friendly fire. So far pretty much every combat patrol i've encountered friendly fire spam has been rampant and there doesn't seem to be any user friendly way to kick someone. Also the AI tend to see right through folliage.  This for all intents and purposes makes this a single player only game. Not as advertised.
16693,game good
16694,grape

16714,amazing mill sim

16769,"i hv been playing this game for like 500 hrs now, kinda lost count.  gonna say every aspect of this game holds its own to this date as an open world military sandbox.  theres no other game like this out there, considering this game was 1st made in 2013. youd expect there is but no, and this game is just awesome.  bit out of budget range for most but even after like 7 years, still well worth the money and holds its own. edit - forgot to mention theres plenty of mods on the workshop that take this experience to a new level.  huge shoutout to modders that make high effort and realistic content and also the support and troubleshooting help is very robust.  you guys rule!  mods are a game changer both literally and figuratively, when done right its totally awesome and what makes this comparatively old game  hold its own to this day"

16771,GOOD FOR A SANDBOX ARMY GAME

However the community sucks, especially the clans. Power tripping military-wannabe clan leaders for example."

16790,"RP...RP everywhere.
And paradox DLC practice nonsense too.

Look, I if you like RP, good for you, really. However, I don't enjoy playing pretend. Even more so, I don't enjoy having to jump through hoops in order to play pretend (white lists, joining teamspeaks, a discord AND a forum).

I enjoy dynamic social gameplay, but I don't enjoy FORCED or RIGID social gameplay. Some people do I guess, after all it totally engulfed this game as well as GTA 5. IMO its just the new ""MMO"" where you grind and grind as a ""role"". Most people I see who are big into the RP game style are often minors/kids. No surprise. They haven't done actual jobs and menial labor. They see it as ""pretend"". 
Well it aint pretend to me, its boring and I would rather make money doing menial nonsense.

The other side of this is adults who enjoy it. Which I guess I can see, its a form of escape, where they can put their real world experience into their ""persona"" or RP character. Especially without risk of social backlash. So hey sure, have at it.
To me and anyone else like me, its boring as fuck.

DLCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

Each C was for each extra thing you need to purchase to have the ""full game"".
Let it be known, that EA and ACTIVISION have NOTHING on paradox and ARMA3.
TLDR: Fuck the DLC practices in this game.

P.S The reason I have so few hours played is because all that was needed was to open server browser and see that the only servers with life, were the RP servers. If you are like me and were hoping some kind of dayz or cool mod servers were running around the clock, like the 40k mod or halo mod, or star wars mod. Nah, I guess the cool stuff is all scheduled and stuff and well, I don't care enough to go digging, others might, and if so, enjoy."

16812,"Its a game that takes time to really like it, It took me like a couple of days to figure out the controls/key mapping, but when you figure them out the game gets easier/better. If you buy the game I suggest you play the campaign because it helped me a lot."

16835,"The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. Arma's capacity for stimulating camaraderie, atmosphere, and problem-solving, GREAT."
16836,"hard to get into, but fun to master and try out all the different things you can do
"
16837,"play at guys good game
"
16838,"I highly recommend Arma 3 because of its realism and gameplay. The campaign can feel like driving and walking simulator 2010, but co-op missions are really engaging and realistic. Arma 3 is a game that takes up a lot of processing power, so I suggest not using a Dell laptop with 4 gb of ram. I run on lowest settings with a decent graphics card and 16gb of ram. Everything runs smoothly. This is not a game like COD. Eg. If you get shot in the leg, then you will be limping. If you get shot in the arm, then your aim will greatly suffer. You will slowly bleed out without using a medkit, and with the proper mods that are common in ‚Äúunits‚Äù (ACE [Medical]), you have to apply tourniquets to stop bleeding on your limbs. You may also have to use epinephrine and morphine to stabilize someones heart rate. These common mods and realistic gameplay make the game really detailed and as realistic it can be. Even things like proximity chat and different Radio frequencies set Arma 3 apart from every other game. To sum it up, if you don‚Äôt like the campaign, then don‚Äôt refund the game. If you still dont like the multiplayer and co-op missions, then go ahead. Arma 3 can have players with thousands of hours on the game that laugh at you. Just remember that everyone was where you were, and it may take real combat training to get into the fight."
16839,"Good Game
"
16840,i shot terrorists. it was fun
16841,"no as expected
the game is very lag and cant find a session to play in"

16845,Good game but need to be modded.
16846,"A lot more fun if you play as a team.  It's a milsim, so cooperation makes it much better."
16847,dont buy this if you have no friends to play it with.
16848,I guess its o-k
16849,Servers that you make to play with your friends dont work u always have to go to server settings and that is happening to 5 diffrent people.

16851,"[h1] 9/10, but it depends on your POV [/h1]
There are two ways to review this game:
Those who play it by themselves, and those who play with friends/Milsim Units

[b] BEFORE YOU TRY AND LEARN THE CONTROLS, FOR ANYONE: [/b]
Play the virtual lab trainings for said area. As a high ranking pilot for a unit, I know from experience that it helps a lot (Atleast the flight ones do).

TL;DR at end
[h1] For those who play alone (FYI its super simple to join a unit, and a lot of fun) [/h1]
The isn't much to do. The campaign is poor because the AI is either horrendous or has literal aimbot. Although it is interesting, the AI makes it a bad experience. You can fool around in Eden Editor/Zeus and explore the absurd(-ly good) amount of things in the game, but it is made more for those hosting a game for other people, and for running operations (in units).

[h1] For those who want to play with others [/h1]
Holy goddamn, it is insane what this game can achieve. Although very outdated, modpacks (usually bigger than the game itself, storage and size-wise) come to the rescue. Want to fight in WWII? Done. Want to fight in a StarWars military? Done. Want to fight for ____ Nation? What about ____ age? How about specific mods for those little things you want? The options are nearly endless. If you want to join a unit, it is extremely simple and can be very fun, no matter your role. If you want to play with your friends, someone will have to host the server and be Zeus to control the AI. Just note that Zeus is very complex, so it will take getting used to.

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
It is more orientated toward the Milsim Unit community than solo players, it is outdated but mods more than make up for it, and its complexity may be daunting at first but you will understand it once you really get into it. Great Milsim game, can't wait for Arma 4."
16852,I had this game but refunded it bc every server needed mods for some reason and i just wanted to play vanilla idk if anyone knows any resolutions but it was annoying
16853,@Lamp get this game or you not kool kid
16854,GOod times
16855,lol machinegun go brrrrrrrrrrrr
16856,"fun game
"
16857,its a very fun and realistic game.
16858,"Amazing game, overall 9/10, just because 50% of the game is locked by DLC."
16859,I love it.
16860,i love this game
16861,"It is impossible to find any server without mods and all dlcs. Each time you have to wait for mods to install and restart the game over and over again. It was so much that I spent nearly an hour just by installing mods, waiting for the server list to appear and restarting the game for mods. I am frankly surprised about how this game survived this long with the player base it currently has. Refunded."
16862,"The game is awesome, the only describe i can give to new players is just try it and you will like it !"
16863,decent
16864,coool
16865,"After having a decent amount of hours I feel like I have the right to write you all a review. BUY THIS.

Okay so, It's a lot of DLC and packs to purchase at once but let me tell you, everything Is perfect. I'm not one to play Scenarios or the Campaigns all that much since I spend most of my time within Zeus and Eden (The In-Game Editing tool).
The Modding capability that's here Is Insane, mods are so much better than the base game and provide hours of fun.

Only gripe I have Is that the Steam Workshop browser for the game can be a bit buggy sometimes and this game Is also HUGE. Base game + All DLC's = 43ish Gbs of Hard drive space taken up. Mods also take up a lot but It Is worth It.

If you like shooters, Tarkov, RTS games, Community based games, Solo games or Immersive games. Play ARMA 3. It's a good time."
16866,great game for the tactical minded player.

16879,Fun game.
16880,"Constantly kicked from server because of battleye telling me spots are reserved, no games found even with ""any"" selected as a game mode. Got team killed multiple times because I didn't know how to revive. Idk this game is WeirdChamp. Singleplayer and co-op is probably good though."
16881,BORING AF!
16882,Entertaining and pretty realistic.
16883,best game ever
16884,THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOR MILSIM COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS SO MUCH YOU CAN DO LIKE MAKING CUSTOM BASES FOR MISSIONS IN EDEN EDITOR
16885,"I've always liked this series and this one is the best yet.  For me, the mission editor is the biggest seller."
16886,I found my dream game
16887,jpigrvwdfs<
16888,Can commit war crimes +1
16889,Extremely good considering the age
16890,nice but you need to spend alot of $$ for good servers ( i only had apex protocol and i only got 3 servers)
16891,"This game has serious issues with optimization which is realy frustrating since you have a game that requires precise weapon handling and relies on simulation. Graphics downgrade doesn't resolve an issue, this game has constant FPS drops which affects you a lot in combat."
16892,"After only 4 hours of playing, this game is not even close to worth the $8 that I paid for it, terrible optimization. And even after 7 years the devs still cease to fix it, only thing they do is cram more dlc down your throat, wanna ride in a cool car or helicopter with your friend? Well looks like you gotta buy the dlc just to ride passenger in it. And on top of that unless you ordered your computer custom built from NASA you might as well kiss 60 FPS bye. This game is nothing short of a disappointment. Even while the game is on sale, still not even worth it. If devs see this please optimize your game, I think the player base could boom if you make a game from 2013 be able to run on PCs from 2013."
16893,"The game ist stunning even 8 years after release, why ima tell ya'll. The ai is probably one of the best you can get most of the ai in newer games cant even beat the one from arma 3. In generel there is no game until now that keeps up with the millions of features arma 3 has to offer. You can turn this game into anything what you want, no matter if its military or something else. You can even if you want to turn this game into a flight sim. I do have to say that the game wouldnt be that great anymore, of course the game on its own is absoloutly great, but the mods make the game truely shine. So to all the modders thx for keep updating and posting such awsome content. Another factor which i love about this game is that you dont even need the most powerfull pc to play this, i myself play on a pc with intel 530hd graphics and an ssd and around 8gb ram and even with up to 500 ai units doing stuff at the same time i still get around 30-40 fps on maxed out grahpics and trust me in this game 30 fps feel hella smooth :D 

PS; i myself would not recommend buying the dlcs (of course its up to you) because the most stuff that are in the dlcs have already been made by modders and are better. Let me give u an example the jet dlc: 
includes the most jets in the base game as well as an aircraft carrier and an destroyer the uss freedom and uss liberty u can use both of them without buying the dlc, then there are mods for airrcraft carriers that are miles better then the uss fredom, my favorite is the uss nimitz which is fully enterble and has almost all features a real aircraft carrier has. The second thing i need to critizie is the jets in the jet dlc, of course they look cool but there are so many mods that do better even with interactive cockpits, but of course at the end of the day its your decesision if you wanna buy it or not :D"

16903,Some dude talked about going home to his mom and he got shot instantly. 10/10 for realism
16904,Thumb Up!

It won't let me in. I need a refund, this is pathetic. I googled it and dozens of people are also upset for this same reason."
16906,fun game once you figure it out
16907,"Its not your conventional ""run in and spray"" type of game. it really tries to simulate a real engagement and has some really fun aspects around this.

GTX 2080 super TI
64gb RAM
AMD 3900x 
4tb SSd x 2

I almost never see frame drops below 30 no matter what in most public Zues games. I haven't noticed play through with signifficant frame drops to disrupt game play (to which the applications also can extend to V.R flight and tank with modded software). I'm hoping they will have official support for V.R in Arma 4 as this game already has the structure to do it from what I can tell. Once I get more into the solo scenarios I think i'll be able to give a better review. So far though I've played for 180 hours at the time of this post and I've only done the initial boot camp mission in solo. The rest of my play time has been in virtual boot camp and multiplayer. So far, i would say this is the best purchase in a video game I've ever made hands down but, I still need to play the single player to really give it consideration. This game made me right my first review. Thanks again."

16920,it good
16921,"yeah lets be honest here for a moment this game is by far the worst game for a person who doesnt know anything about milsim if you do not already know how to play arma 3 just stay away from it there is absolutely no help in understanding how to play the game, good job devs on making a game that is overly complicated to understand"

5/10 best game ive ever played with endless hours of entertainment would'nt change a thing"
16924,"Feels old because of models and animations, older games dont feel this old, the controls are over complicated for no reason as every other ArmA. But ultimately its the community that ruins it, too many players just want to role play. I have gone into servers where people would talk for hours but as soon as action starts they couldnt hit anything and would get obliterated by bots which i single handledly killed...
Bohemia could easily make a better game than Battlefield if role players weren't their focus."
16925,"I recommend ArmA 3 for all those who like milsim and modding your game so much that you forgot what it's like playing the game normally. Also if you have 2 TDs of disk space and can tolerate playing video games at crisp 15 frames per second. If you check all those boxes, then you will enjoy ArmA 3."
16926,I like eggs ü•ö
16927,"Do me a favor: if you're going to buy this game, PLEASE find a unit to play it with. Playing by yourself is okay, and playing in public lobbies can be fun at times, but this game is absolutely unforgettable if you jump on reddit and find yourself an ARMA Unit to play with. I haven't played a game this much since Black Ops 2 and it is purely because of the mods and the community. Not to mention, they just released a DLC where all of the revenue (that's 100%) goes to the Red Cross. I strongly recommend this game because of its mods, its community, and its developers."
16928,cant use enhanced movement mod and down loading the mods for one server takes 2 hours when you dont have great wifi but one of the mods is 17 gb and the vanilla movments are trash
16929,Not sure what to say other than it's fun
16930,Most things are locked behind a paywall
16931,"Glitchy, bug filled, and all around hard to play. Best Game to play with my friends no question there. I have more fun here than on Cold war or Warzone."
16932,"Really Hard to understand and work with boring youtubers made this seem alot more than wa it really was , i will continue to play and try to find something but so far a dis appointment."
16933,"writing this from the battlefield, shit fye no cahp"
16934,I committed a lot of vehicular manslaughter
16935,!
16936,"Amazing game even for someone like me with no friends, but the 14 hours i currently have, i spent 11 hours of that time downloading mods..."
16937,good
16938,"good war crime sim

complete edition is better"
16939,"basically BTEC squad, still pretty good would reccomend"
16940,Now I can commit war crimes from the comfort of my own home.
16941,Arma 3 is THE reference in war combat simulation
16942,"very epic 
"
16943,"Cause of the modding community, the game really shines! One of the best Mil-Sims out. Even in 2021"
16944,you need a really good computer
16945,"good to play with mods
"
16946,"Extremely enjoyable, if you like variety mods the workshop is a big help Now Go Break The Geneva Conventions!"
16947,yeet
16948,cool military shoot terroists. booom boom bomb boom
16949,"Edit: Now that I've played this game for 70+ hours, I can describe it better, the game is very well optimized, you don't need a gigantic PC to run it as I run it on my laptop that I use for work, my is the AMD A4-9125 and I can run it at 40 FPS max in some areas with low graphics, in places like cities I can get 10-28 FPS which I can still play very well in. The game allows you to destroy pretty much every house or building you can find. The vanilla medical system is pretty simple but if you wanna go for a more complex system, download the ACE3 mod from the workshop, it completely changes the medical system and a bunch of other aspects of the game. The launcher has a mods tab where you can make presets so that when you join a server you don't have to go through the pain of disabling mods that a server doesn't allow every time you want to join a server. You can also host your own server like in Garry's Mod, except for Arma you need UPnP if you don't want to set it up manually, most routers have UPnP on them so you won't have to go out and buy a new router, and if your router doesn't have UPnP, you can still do it manually and you can also still join your friends! 


 The combat, oooh the combat, you will have the greatest time of your life in the combat, from fighting the AFRF (Armed Forces of the Russian Federation) to the CSAT (Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty) to normal civilians that turn hostile against you if you point your gun at them too many times to committing war crimes. There is so much fun to have in the combat, the suppression actually works because you really don't want to die or get wounded and run out of medical supplies, the frag grenades actually have fragmentation instead of most games where they turn into HE (High Explosive) grenades, smoke grenades actually blow with the wind and create a smoke screen, so if you mess up that smoke grenade throw then you'll just have to go with it unless you have more.


Ballistics, the ballistics are great, bullet drop is a thing meaning you have to use the notches below the reticle of your magnification sight, bullets can penetrate meaning you are never safe in that outhouse made out of wood or plastic. Velocity also affects your bullet's penetration ability, meaning if you're at 400m+ then your bullet might not be going through that outhouse containing that one Russian soldier who needs to take big crap. The audio is amazing, the guns, the helicopters, the cars, the tanks, the jets, they all just sound so great, and you can download a mod called JSRS Sound Mod to overhaul the sounds to make them sound even better (not that they aren't already amazing). The flying is perfect, it's not too complex and it's not too simple, if you've played GTA 5 on PC then you'll know the struggle of having to hold LMB to fly, that struggle is gone with Arma, you can even change the game's flight model in the settings, the game is also joystick compatible meaning you can make it even more complex if you want to (check out OperatorDrewski's video on youtube for his setup). The AI is great, the AI actually uses cover and suppresses enemies so that you can get a better position on that civilian that just wanted to have a nerf gun fight. The AI can actually die in the story missions, so you can't just sit back and relax while the AI does all the work, but it is very rare that the AI will die, so you're not constantly struggling to keep the AI alive.


The customization is amazing, there is so much that you can do, from being in your boxers and your bed shirt to being a literal moving ammo box, you can customize so much, and your weight affects your stamina and slows you down if you carry too much, so if you try to carry those 64 TNT blocks, you're not going any where very fast. The size of items affects your backpack space, so if you're trying to be the portable gunsmith then you'll only be able to carry a few rifles and maybe 10 pistols depending on the size and space the backpack has.


The planes are amazing, you have a literal A-10 at your disposal (A-10D Thunderbolt II), an armed drone, a fighter jet that I can't remember the name of and a lot more. The CUP mods add a bunch of things from Arma 2 like helicopters, jets, drones, cars, guns, uniforms, vests, helmets, backpacks, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, smoke grenades, and a lot more.


There is a lot more to describe but I am running out of time as I have yet to complete my work, so I shall stop here and possibly return to this review another day.





 Original Review: I got this game yesterday as of writing this review, I love it already. I've watched a bunch of videos on it and have always wanted it and got it because it was on sale. There's so much about it that's great, modding capabilities, AI, gunplay, customization, mechanics, and so much more. If you're thinking about getting this, get it, you'll love it."
16950,"A game of infinite potential if you're into military simulations. Be aware of the very ... interesting physics when it comes to vehicles and obstacles. You might find yourself doing backflips with a tank.
If the base game is not enough for you or the near future timeline doesn't interest you, the mods can make the game be whatever you want (within reason, of course). Make the game be about the modern day warfare in the Middle East or about WW2, if that's what interests you.
The workshop also offers endless fun in the form of scenarios and missions. Or create your own in the Eden editor. (Most of my hours have been spent in the editor creating crazy battles, lol)"
16951,this game makes me healthy

16970,"It's hard not to recommend this game. I've got 87 hours in and only just scratched the surface of what is possible with this mighty military sim. The combination of high quality DLC and a very active modding community suggest that this is one of those titles which will run for many more years despite it already having 7 years on the clock. 

Whatever your military inclination is, the chances are that Arma 3 will tick that box. Tracked vehicles, infantry, special forces, divers, aircraft, civilians, aliens and zombies to boot. The list goes on and on. Check out the Steam Workshop, and you'll get an idea of how much there is more to this game.  Of the maps I have seen, including mods are of great detail, you can literally get lost exploring them, campaigns are well written and executed. 

A massive 2 thumbs good!"
16971,"A well designed and developed game with a great community, but need a good computer to get most enjoyment out of it
"
16972,shot. dead. gg
16973,"Well, What to say about Arma.....In Many Ways ARMA is the best and worst game ever created. 7 Years on and still going strong. The Modding community for this game is like no other and the people are both absolute cunts and great to play with. Dedicated group of people trying to get their MILSIMs. If you are considering buying this game then do not hesitate. full price or On sale it doesnt matter this game is worth more then any Triple A Title. Laughs, anger and retardation is all incorporated to create a masterpiece. ARMA 4 When Bohemia? Why are you still reading buy the Goddamn game!"
16974,Good game very good
16975,country roads HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
16976,eh its ok ig
16977,Great for people who want a good time.
16978,"arma 3 is the best reaking game anyone could ever play

16979,GOOD GAME - 500 METERS - RIGHT
16980,"Very fun game if you actually put in the effort to make the fun yourself. Big payoff, especially with friends. Only good dlc is Apex."
16981,good
16982,"Graphics, immersion, realism, and mechanics."
16983,Haven't enjoyed a war game like this since Conflict Vietnam on Playstation2..  I've enjoyed the hell out of this game.
16984,its bearable. pew pew. it functioned as it should with little to no maintenance.  when i pushed the buttons the game responded in kind. would recommend.
16985,its cool
16986,Fucking delicious
16987,"very awesome
"
16988,"There's a steep learning curve when starting out but if you have a friend or two who have experience with milsim games and are willing to play with you, then i say go for it."
16989,"if your PC can handle it, this is the ultimate military sandbox.. this game is best run on an SSD"
16990,I like how you can create your open world war.
16991,HArD
16992,"Honestly one of the best military games I've ever played, needs some optimizing on YOUR end to make it run smooth like butter (like I did) for it to run 60+ fps in my rig!

10000000/10 would recommend if you have friends that are into milsim!"
16993,super fun
16994,If a war crime happens and nobody is around to see it or hear it then did it really happen?
16995,"tha mutiplayer is not the best but tha sandbow or campiang is the best

16996,"I LOVED this game Played online with friends for many hours so many laughs. used the editor soooooo much to set up different scenarios using the workshop to heavily mod and enjoy the game my computer tanks in bigger fights but oh well. recently logged back on and every gun I pick up while trying to play gives me some stupid add wall ? they literally put a screen blocking add wall.... why not just put a ""you don't have the proficiency to use this weapon"". literally ruined the game I wont pay extra money to play the base game normally""."
16997,its arma whats not to like
16998,"I don't recommend anyone expecting it to be as easy/fun as the YouTube videos, I spent four hours in this game and I regret everything. Those four hours are me trying to like this game however it's just not my cup of tea."
16999,"lol Arma Zeus go ""helth nd rekuvry for u""

iz nice

can be skary when yourslef only

but still nice"
17000,Best money youd ever spend
17001,"Amazing, Breathtaking exciting game to play."
17002,"I will recommend this game but you HAD better like FPS and military simulation.
There is also a HUGE learning curve based on everything this game exposes you to.
From playing to editing,  if it is your thing you will get it.  :)"
17003,how have i already played 130 hours what the fuck
17004,ahhh i guess its good

17006,"After a few hours, I can say.... I'm fully addicted."

17008,it really is a great game.
17009,good mhm :)
17010,"I was from the era of Arma 2, the feeling back then was that everything had a more darker tone, slow paced. Arma 3 took a sharp turn on that, it evolved, created new mechanics, making the game more acessable even for fast paced players. But it was a well made turn, not abandoning the folks from the past, but also accomodating new players.

Arma 3 has a surreal feeling of freedom done well, me being a mission creator, besides the harsh times scripting and etc, all the bad times go away, as soon as i see my creation come to life, seeing unscripted scenes where you see the bomb dropping near you, or a high speed chase with a AI, a duel with a enemy sniper or a tank approaching you from the tress, knowing that only the scripted parts we're the briefings or the AI telling something. The sandbox experience that besides the linear story you build, will always play different, because of the AI and enviroment combined. And that feeling at the end that you accomplished all tasks without dying, and knowing that you dont have any plot armour imunity. Your not someone special, you're no hero, you're just a goom, and that adds more value to your deed than a game that keeps presenting all the choices or giving the player this imense plot armour.

Arma 3 is not your typical shooter, one bullet can and will end your game prematurely if you dont use your head. Planing ahead, using the surroundings, knowing the enemy and the're weapons is just a basic strategy to turn the tide of the battle in your favour. The feeling that everything worked, because you and your team had coordenation is something that you can only experience playing. Unfortunately in every game, players manage to ruin it somehow. If you seek a fast paced game, where you spawn 5 meters from the enemy, kill him, and then die by another dude spawning above you, them this game is not meant for you. But sure enough, people in this category appear here and there to ruin the fun, rushing, screaming, glitching and acting like a five year old.

Talking about glitches, the most common glitch ive seen, we¬¥re the vehicle physics, where if you bump a sedan into a armoured tank, the armoured tank would fly away like paper. But Bohemia Interactive seems to doenst really care about it, its been years since and they not even started to fix it. Instead, they keep launching DLC's, salty priced DLC's that sometimes are just priced mods from other creators.

About mods, some of them make the game perfect, i play around with 16 or more mods, most of them we're ACE sorts. ACE can make the game more realistic, adding hunger, thirsty, fatigue and a cool medical system, that make you always carry around medical items. Whats more cool about it is that you can edit these and other more options however you like, and make the experience better for you or for you're friends if you are playing in a LAN server."
17011,"Not the best-optimized shooter you'll find out there, but the amount of freedom is amazing. Lots of very well made community-content adds to an ever changing experience.

Get this iff you're into sandbox games, RP'ing, or likewise"
17012,"Love this game
love that it was made i my country
love the latest DLC
just love it"
17013,f
17014,"Let's be real! You've seen a video of ARMA att least once in your life. While watching the video you may have even thought to yourself ""Huh nifty."" Well nifty it certainly is, and you owe it yourself to try it."
17015,its epic
17016,"gay







something
"
17017,
17018,"I love all the endless content this game has to offer. A huge variety of weapons, vehicles, and equipment to use at your disposal on an endless range of missions and game modes. Don't even get me started on the mods... I dislike the DLC always being thrown in your face making you purchase it in order to use certain assets but it isn't required. Definitely get this game on sale and grab some mods for the best experience."
17019,Good game.
17020,"Been here a while now, not seen much action, but the squadie life is an interesting one. Spent tonight looking up at the stars talking about what we miss about civilian life - can't say I really remember much from that time, but I'm glad I'm here with my family."
17021,"good game
"
17022,good
17023,"yeah, it's okay. you'll get maybe 1 to 2 hours out of it tops though."
17024,"All around a great game 
good community 
great mods"
17025,"A buddy of mine got me into this game a year or two ago, i cannot get unhooked!! ERMAHGERD!!!

It's definitely worth the purchase!!"
17026,Pretty fun
17027,bad glitchy garbage game that makes you reinstall it all the time.
17028,"much good, fun."
17029,10/10
17030,awsome game
17031,"If you find the right Unit, this game is incredible."
17032,"Between Operation Flashpoint and ARMA 3 I have about 10k hrs in the series.

This isn't really a game, it's more of a platform that mission and game content is created within, with the campaigns etc being a showcase of what is possible with a modern military theme. Other themes are possible but most content is based around military combat and operations.

If you like the idea of having advanced ballistics (can get very advanced with mods) with physics based sound; 16+ player stances; firefights that can be in your face or from miles away,  dozens of weapon and vehicle options, not including the absolutely MASSIVE amount of fictional and real-world content and assets on the Workshop; incredible extensibility through modifications and other nerdy stuff of that nature, give it a try. It's by no means perfect, but it's the closest you're going to get to real world combat.

Battle Royale is best in this game too for a lot of people, mod created by Playerunknown himself.

"
17033,"What can I say, best purchase I ever made"
17034,yes this game is good but other games like squad take more team based matches

17046,"Brilliant military sandbox with the best physics engine I've ever seen. After a 20 year career in the US military, multiple operations with special forces, and being the president for 2 hugely successful terms, I still found I had much to learn in terms not only of military strategy, but within my own character. After a further 6 years studying IT and code, I felt I was ready to Zeus. I could not have been more wrong. Instead, after entering a command to simply rotate an LAV, I was distraught to find my computer possessed with multiple pieces of malware and possibly haunted by the soul of Napoleon. Such is life I suppose."
17047,shit
17048,"My pp shrunk, 10/10 would recommend!!!"
17049,"Super-Realistic, Fabulous, Massively Open-World War game ever made. Details are so good even after 8 years it looks incredible and it atmosphere, it takes me high above the clouds!"
17050,basically nam
17051,"Sinceramente, esse jogo √© MUITO bom quando tu aprende a jogar.
Nas primeiras 50 horas esse jogo √© ridiculamente dif√≠cil e nada amig√°vel a iniciantes, mas com o tempo quando tu aprende a lidar com a comunidade, sabe escolher os servidores certos e aprende os comandos(20h s√≥ pra memorizar comando), vai come√ßar a achar o jogo divertido e engra√ßado.

O jogo √© CHEIO de bugs, tipo CHEIO MESMO, mas nada que um mod n√£o fa√ßa o que a Bohemia n√£o fez, n√©?

Recomenda√ß√£o final: Compre caso goste de simuladores militares e tenha MUITA, MUITA paci√™ncia"
17052,If you don't have a good eye sight just continue playing Minecraft.
17053,VERY HARD GOOD!
17054,"It is a wonderful games years after getting it , is very fun, and the mods make it way way way better."
17055,"Whelp I've got 800 hours so I should probably throw out a thumbs up. A brief description of why:

- It's more of a platform than a video game. 
- I spend most of my time in the editor screwing around with too many mods burning my CPU. 
- Top notch immersion with compelling and engaging gameplay. 
- Has changed what I have come to want from my video games."

17076,"Overall a pretty unique game if you give it a chance. Ranging from short term gameplay for people with not much time to spare, to much longer game modes that could last you days, weeks or possibly months if need be. Besides the amazing game modes presented to you via vanilla Arma, theres also steam workshop capatability so you can enjoy game modes from the community that you could expand into. Graphics and physics are clearly one of my most favorite features as it adds a realism and thrill effect to really try to preserve yourself."
17077,hmmm not bad at all!
17078,OAHIIIIIIIIIIIIOOOHAAAHHEIRRIIAKKKA
17079,nice game

17082,Really fun
17083,"spent most of my time in the scenario creator, brilliant engine, the actual game itself is alright i guess, i just spectated large battles across the map

try out multiplayer and hosted mods if you haven't, my experience was with a WW2 japanese VS american operation which kicked ass."
17084,AMAZING
17085,I get to tactically kill people
17086,poggers
17087,pretty good i guess
17088,this is areally goood game that i would reccommend  to anyone who is looking to get into mil sim
17089,"First of all, if you have a low-end PC, keep scrolling and move on, accept you won't be able to play this and maybe just spend the money on a different game.
This game is great, the graphics are really good and it feels polished, it's very immersive too.
I prefer to play this game with friends as it's more fun than jumping into a very simulation-type game with a bunch of strangers.

17103,The game's design is all around hard to get used to. It's not intuitive or easy to grasps for new players like myself and it's not like the youtube videos where they do army roleplay. I do not recommend for newer players learning how to play keyboard
17104,"meh
"
17105,Is good
17106,One of the best mil sims out there honestly the mods and commuity is worth it.
17107,can be pretty pog ngl
17108,"If your looking for fun or even serious game play Arma 3 is where it is at all range of diffrent guns, maps and items even have a fun but can be serious mode called Exile from PVP to PVE or both in one map even with Zombies and AI, Yeah the frame rate may not be the best for Video cards in the 2000 series Nvidia or 5000 series AMD range but still very playable and fun, I would recommend this game over DAYZ made by the same company any day just so much more to it."
17109,Good game
17110,"Fantastic milsim, outstanding multi-player, rich set of options for the modding community.  Great editor, fantastic tutorials.  The only downside is the AI can see you through the grass when every blade blocks your line of sight."
17111,GOOD GAME

17144,A long learning curve but worth it in the end
17145,"After over 1600 hours of playtime, and working on 7 years now of ownership, I feel its safe to say I like this game. 

This game to me, is like a gigantic tub of Lego, with a couple of pre-built sets on the side to serve as example. The pre-built sets are the vanilla features of the game, the campaign, scenarios, maps, and everything else in between, they function well enough, and offer A LOT of fun just by themselves. The gigantic tub of Lego is the modding community, a huge beautiful melting pot of mods that quite literally change every single aspect of the game. With mods ranging from factions, WW2 content, equipment overhauls, and hundreds of quality player made missions, all the way to crazy sh*t like Halo, Warhammer 40k, and Star wars. On top of the crazy mod selection, most of the aforementioned mods have active and welcoming online communities, that are always eagerly looking for newcomers to join their ranks. I really cannot emphasize enough just how many mods there are, and how diverse the mod scene is for this game. 

If you get this game and somehow play through the hundreds upon hundreds of hours worth of content in the workshop, or you begin to grow bored with game, then this game makes for a great game to forget about for a little bit, to then check up on later to be wowed by what other crazy and new mods people made while you were away. On top of all of this, the game frequently goes on sale, so go ahead, don't be shy, your magnificent tub of Lego awaits you."
17146,The game is not easy for the novice to be careful what you buy
17147,"777 hours of playing this game. Its got bugs, its got some kinks, and its got toxic players. However, the modding community and the experience of being in a Zeus game are everlasting. Buy this game and be a benefit to the community."
17148,pretty good game all around the chat sometimes can get hilarius i do think that anyone should play it if they are old enough but its pretty good
17149,This is the real og game from my childhood
17150,I think people should buy this game tbh
17151,"AT Soldier!, 100 meters!, Front!"
17152,"Just like Arma II, which was just like Arma, which was just like Operation Flashpoint. Operation Flashpoint was fun though so I am prepared to allow this string of near identical clones. 

6/10 Not broken don't fix it."
17153,Nothing else like it.
17154,aaaaaaa
17155,"good gameplay
"
17156,"Join organised groups for the best fun. 
Mods are almost essential for better immersion."
17157,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood pop
17158,HOW DO I PLAY THIS PLEASE GOD HELP ME
17159,gud gud
17160,an amazing game
17161,rOlEpLaY
17162,nice game
17163,War crime simulator
17164,cool
17165,"a real love hate relationship. very mod dependent which makes for great customization and variety. base physics are fairly janky. good luck getting 100 fps in a city environment, or even 60. not to mention if some turd is hot boxing in a MEV, looking at around 10-15 then. over all, a great game with plenty of room for improvement."
17166,its cool
17167,Really fun now
17168,"Game is awesome..  Play it modded with friends and enjoy hours and hours and even more hours of combat 

My recommendation is to play on OFPS BECTI server ...  best way to enjoy Arma3"
17169,Good game my guy
17170,"Holy sh*t, is this fun. I'm not really into Milsims, or very in-touch with the military at all, but something about the mix of fast and slow-paced gameplay, merging perfectly to give an immersive experience based on where and when you imagine the situation takes place, results in a masterpiece, in my opinion. Bug's are somewhat frequent, but I have yet to run into one that was game breaking, or that was annoying at all. When they happen, they're hilarious, and it's good comedic relief from the adrenaline filled gameplay this game provides. Highly reccomend"
17171,Intense
17172,"I mean, it's aight. Overrated if you ask me."
17173,yes
17174,"REEAAALLY good game but 1) You will need some gooood PC but hey I have ""potato"" PC and i have more then 1000 hours...
                                               2) Some people are saying its not fun, but if you will play multiplayer like COD player then yeah... 
                                                 it will be not fun.
                                               3) There are thousand of mods soo you can try them in sandbox with zeus :)"
17175,very realistic military simulator. slightly confusing though
17176,"What an awesome game, Just look at it."
17177,best game ever game
17178,"A wise man once said;
""Once you play ArmA III, You truly understand that sub 15 FPS is playable."""
17179,"Owen is not allowed to host, literally E.T. the game"
17180,Milsim go brr
17181,I SEE A MAN. 100 METERS. FRONT.
17182,beesten luv it good game evar in world
17183,Nice game (y)
17184,"Arma 3 is Halaal:

The first category is games which help in jihaad for the sake of Allaah, whether that is physical jihaad (fighting) or verbal jihaad (i.e., knowledge), such as swimming, shooting, horse-riding, and games which involve developing one‚Äôs abilities and Islamic knowledge, etc. These games are mustahabb and the one who engages in them will be rewarded so long as his intention is good and he seeks to support the religion thereby. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúShoot, O Bani Adnaan, for your father was an archer.‚Äù Shooting or archery includes by analogy all similar actions.

The second category is games which do not help in jihaad. Example: games which are specifically forbidden in the texts, such as playing with dice as mentioned in the question. These games should be avoided by the Muslim."
17185,I love committing war crimes.
17186,"On sale this game is a bargain, especially with friends.
It offers a wide range of varying game-play from tactically realistic situations, story led campaigns, or just messing around in exploding go karts in friends. 
"
17187,Mhm.
17188,"Would be a good game if it didnt cost 200 dollars to be playable.  You want to hold an LMG for more than 4 minutes without popups ruining your screen like its a mobile game? Well just buy the 25 dollar dlc that it comes with? Want to drive this cool vehicle? Give us 30 dollars! And the actual gameplay is GARBAGE! It's like they dont even put effort into the game itself!  You need so many mods just to make it fun. This has to be a joke. In conclusion, do not buy this game unless you have 200$ to spend on it, the hundreds of hours to put into it just to learn the controls, the 50-100 gigabytes of free disk space for mods alone, and the patience to be accepted into a unit to play with.

Just go buy Squad. You'll have more fun, and spend less money. The Youtubers that play this game arent showing you the hundreds of hours of playing and planning that goes on behind the scenes, let alone the hundreds of dollars they put into this broken game. You're not going to be this ""Cool Spec Ops Navy Seal"" dude, you'll be a stupid looking character that has no customization available for it, very small amount of guns to use, and be waiting an hour just to gain up CP (Currency in one of the shitty game modes) just to buy a helicopter that gets one tapped by a sniper sitting in a bush.

This was my opinion a couple months ago, things have changed. There are certain things after extended time playing I have come to enjoy. Still, the amount of money you have to spend, the amount of mods, and the preparation itself is still a big downside, but if you can find something you like to do, for example you can make entire battles, fly jets, drive tanks, etc in the sandbox world edit in this game, as long as you have some of the DLC you can use most of the things here. You still need to pay for access to a couple of guns and a ghillie suit but I bought everything, which is mostly my reasoning for rewriting this review. If you are willing to spend time here, good for you, this is what you're gonna want to buy. If you want something like a tactical mil-sim that is gonna be easy to get into, this is not it, you're probably looking for Squad."
17189,"Please help me I have a crippling addiction to this game, but overall very fun game"
17190,It's alright.
17191,"yes, make my beefy ass PC look like potato, realistic graphics and gameplay"
17192,this game is awsome
17193,yes
17194,game is nice and rp ist the best mode xD
17195,i do gud stuffz
17196,This game is fun as hell. When I first heard about this game I became immidiately obsessed with it. I have played many many video games in my life and arma 3 is easliy one of my top 3 favorite games of all time i strongly recommend it.

17198,it's really fun to play
17199,"This is a great game for people who are looking for a dash of realism. This is not a frantic run around expending thousands of rounds while respawning countless times, this game is best played methodically and with precision. If you don't care about tactics, don't bother."

17201,hands down best game out there never gets boring
17202,"If you have a squad to play this game with it is very fun and entertaining. Spend a lot of time on it with my squad and has a blast, also some mods on Arma are amazing."

17208,If you can bare the low frame rates then this'll probably be the best game you'll ever play. Stay the hell away from any RP because that sh*t is ass.
17209,what i liked about Arma 3 is u can do all kinds of stuff like do the campaign and the bootcamp mission and u can also do scnarios showcases and etc and u can also play multiplayer with all kinds of people all around the world there is alot of game modes u can play but my favorite is being a Zues and chatting with other players about how they think i should set up the base or a mission or anything else and arma 3 gets alot and i mean alot better with mods on its a awesome game and there alot more to it but i like this game alot and i go live on twitch sometimes to on arma 3 and if u wanna watch my name is xxxtherealphoenixxx

17227,"Really enjoy this game. The mil-sim gameplay, especially in large groups, can be extremely satisfying. A lot of the time, though I play on a LAN server with 4-5 friends, and mess around playing PvE, PvP, and Hide and Seek scenarios (which we made ourselves). With great mod support, loads of player-made scenarios, and a very robust (if not super intuitive) scenario creator means you can really play whatever and however you want in ARMA. Just be aware that the controls take some getting used to.

I recommend getting the Apex dlc if you can, IMO Tanoa is way more fun and varied than Altis"

17229,"my one true game to rule them all, arma brings squad warfare, sandbox gaming and lots and lots of bugs and weird physics glitches to keep you entertained and/or furious and/or confused af any day you play"
17230,"Really good game the community is an alright 8/10.
-----------------
Positive:
-There are a lot of nice people that will teach you how to play.
-Offers a lot of mini games.
-Has a lot of weapons
-Has a lot of vehicles
Negatives:
-Not good for FPS (No mater what specs you have If you have 120fps and then 30fps It's to the server side)
-AI's have super vision
-Things can get buggy ""Armad""
Recommend:
I recommend that you change your name as soon as you start the game to whatever you'd like If your name starts with (Admin, Administrator or User) people will think you are a troll and kick you instantly.
It's also really  good to inform the people around you that you are new to Arma3 they will be 100 times kinder to you then.
If the DLC bundels and they are on sale buy them It will unlock more fun in the game and It's worth it.
Also learn the basics about talking in game If you're going to type in chat type in caps.

I hope this helped you decide if the game is for you or not.

17231,YESSSSSSSSS IT'S SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

17252,"This game only improves with MODS and if you are not into modding you will be less likely to be able to fully enjoy the community here. That being said, all MOD installs I have improved this game 10 fold."

17266,"I like Arma 3 and I  spend all my Game time making Missions and playing ArmA games Missions as a Single player in Multiplayer mode and Now ArmA 3, I like Warlords feature but I hope to see a Warfare style like that of  ArmA 2 and the ArmA Gold as Warfare is Much Fun and user friendly. what I dont like  about ArmA 3 is the  Lack  of ability to Shoot Enermy units and I get killed meny times by an Enermy that  I so first but I the Weapon pointer moves all  over the place and not making clear shoots, so I would like ArmA 3 to  have a a Basic settings for  Wepon  Control so  I can enjoy my Targets and not use Eventhandler to increase  my Health. Otherwise Its a Best Game ever and I would like to see the other Gender for Mission perposes as the Other Gender is always around when things are Happening for the View and  I would like to see some fixed up Buildings  with Furnitures inside for living so that it  dont look like evryone Packed up and Go for my  Missions. otherwise ArmA  3 is Outstanding and Hope ArmA 4 will be and dont forget to make it feature Single player mosd  and  keep up the Friendly Multiplayer  that allows Offline play for a single  player."
17267,great game for having fun and having to take a break after the ai get lucky and one shot you

17276,I hate this game

17279,This game is awesome! Never thought I would do well in the game with all the commands but I did. I'm now a pretty good sniper and team medic üòÅ
17280,"Great game so far, worth every cent I put down on it in the last sale. I wish I would have picked it up sooner but it was always intimidating. But so far the game is walking me through it nicely. Not even attempting MP yet."
17281,"I've played a few hundred hours over the years.. I've expect performance improvements, and for a minute I thought they had been done when they release the launcher with all those nice options.. They do nothing. The game will still run on a single core no matter what and that will just strangle any FPS you might want. Running a I9900k at 5.0Ghz paired with a RTX 2080 and you can't get past 50FPS on ""high"" settings. Could play this game with any graphics card you want really, the CPU will always bottleneck the performance; my GPU usage never goes above 15%. The game needs multicore support to become playable, it's been years now."
17282,I like the lore
17283,"Okay.... it is a super duper great game!!, it is just like Battlefield: vietnam....  the really oldschool WWII game, i used to play that with my dad and two brothers.
But Arma III is just horribly optimized..... my pc runs the game fine at 70-120fps when i play without bots, but with bots on..... oh boy.... lets just say i had to put all the settings on standard instead of high - very high, and even with the settings on standard + Bots included, i ran the game with 15-35fps.

Pc specs: Cpu - Intel Core i7 3770  3.40GHz.
RAM - 16,0GB Dual-Channel DDR3.
Graphic card - 2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti

And the developers reccommend to play the game with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660.....  Nah ah!!, they should change it to - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1020.

Hear hear!!"
17284,The realism of this game is unrivaled anywhere else.
17285,"[b]It is a military sandbox! U get what u buy![/b]
[hr][/hr]
And more! Arma 3 gives opportunities to play all the gamemodes one can imagine and cares to develop. Don't expect high realism, even tho a lot of players take this game too serious. Be warned it is a cpu hungry game, so if you are a fan of high framerates this might not be for you. The campaign is... not bad. As usually the community created content is far better.
Some DLCs are worth the money, some or not. I mean Aliens? Come on Bohemia..
Anyway this is a great title where u can get more out of it than it seems at first glance. I personally would recommend to wait for a sale tho.

17298,"Works in linux with minor bugs, especially initial launch that for me started in windowed mode with minimal UI (illegible UI)
Solved it after guessing what was video setting, changing ""something"" and restarting..  Also, ALT+Enter helps you to go from windowed to full screen mode.

Beware: Game uses 1 core/thread for processing ingame.. Which is fking unbelievable with 16 core consumer cpu's available.

When fully setup, it loads and works quite nice - BUT there is improvement to be had if the game would bother taking advantage of hardware available.
Manjaro, kernel 5.12, AMD 3950x cpu and rx 6800xt gpu."
17299,"Overall Arma 3 is very good creation, Base game gets boring quite quickly, but there is fortunately great mods that you can find and make playing Arma 3 so pleasant. Only sky is a limit. 

Graphics: I think the best that you can make using this game-engine I guess? 
Engine: Could be better. Not very good CPU optimization. 
Gameplay: Godlike in every way while using mods. 

If you are planning to buy Arma 3, even its release was in a stone age, I recommend hugely. 
It's worth the money!

17341,"This game angers more than one can imagine. I have friends who think this is the best shooter game out there but I have always begged to differ. So since one of them bought me it to play with them. I will leave my review after playing a few games of it.

Main reason of my anger.

The base game is a total mess. Everything from controls, movement, gun play, bugs, the amount it throws its expensive DLCs down your throat, just annoys me.

This game has been out for a long time (2013) and comes as part of a series of releases that follow the same formula of Operation Flashpoint (2001). In my mind, the series of games have not progressed technically at all in almost 20 years where other games have. 

Lets focus on controls for a moment. This game has the most over-complicated controls ever put into a game. There would be no way this could be released on to a console because its so pointlessly complicated. Here are some examples 

1) Default controls do not allow you to look down a sight if you have a more complicated sight setup. Instead, you must press two other keys (at the same time) to ""toggle"" sight you want (without any feedback of your toggle), then click the mouse slightly to achieve what you wanted. This IS stupid. I launched Insurgency Sandstorm straight after playing this and it was easy and very intuitive in comparison. I launched Call of Duty (although I dont much like it, I do play it on occasion with the lads), the same, very simple to play. Just because something is realistic, doesn't mean it should require a qualification in menus and commands to play it.

2) There is absolutely no climb / vault system in the game (without mods). Instead there is this VERY VERY POOR ""step over"" animation that usually just moves you slightly into the model you are trying to jump over. That is AWFUL for a AAA game that has been out for 7/8 years and follows on from a series to be improved on. There are literally 3 mods which fix this and add more, so why cant the AAA devs do it?!

3) Movement through buildings / stairs is AWFUL, you stick to walls, you cant climb steps (usually because they are taller than a human body!), you get stuck in doorways. Again, AAA game, that hasn't got the fundamentals right.

DLC issue:
- This game now pretty much throws DLC in your face ALL of the time. So much so, you could play a scenario, try to pick up a weapon and it says ""this weapon requires a DLC, press P to purchase now!"". After you finish the scenario, it tells you AGAIN ""you used this content, purchase now!"". I got an idea guys, how about your improve the base game? Then I might think about paying for some DLC.

Pros (for balance):
- The modding community make this game a seller, without it, it would tank, get reviews of 2/10 and nobody would play it
- The expanse of the maps is astonishing and suit vehicles very well
- Realism is great and a very rare sight to see in 2020/2021"
17342,If you like committing war crimes this is the game for you.
17343,l
17344,pretty dank
17345,"Super versatile with all the available mods, DLCs and gamemodes. It has one of the friendliest and dedicatest community's out there. You can play it like GTA online (e.g. ""Altis Life""), as a tactical shooter  (e.g. king of the hill) or even as the way it was intended: An infantry simulator."
17346,this game is  detroit simulator
17347,"The gameplay in scenarios is timed poorly and does not auto advance.  If you get ahead of the timing, it fails you out.  Getting into a server for multi-player is klunky and not intuitive.  The game is not polished.  Constant indicators asking you to purchase additional DLC content.  Vehicle spawns are not automatic and not all over the map, some admin has to spawn them for you.  This should be a $10 game and it's not.  I'm ashamed I paid $30 for this game.  It's not good.  Buy ARK Survival or Sea of Thieves instead."
17348,"The game is good, but if you're expecting a full game included, don't. The game has about ¬£70 worth of DLC and wont let you do barely anything without it."

17392,"This game is very immersive and brings military realism to a new level. It is really amazing and you can play already made games and scenarios, and servers or you can make your own server and/or scenario/mission.
Really recommended!"
17393,skibidi bop mm dada. THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!
17394,"This game has been the most fun I've had with military style games, shooters, multiplayer and role playing.
I truly think everyone should at least try this game for the friends you can play with, if not, the crazily large amount of custom content provided on the workshop.
There may be some things disappointing, like a lack of animals in the base game and DLCs, or a lack of maps being in the western part of the globe (The Americas, Caribbean, and Pacific areas).
Regardless, there's tons of good writing in the story (as much as I can get through before being shot dead because I'm not great at stealth and such), tons of new styled equipment and vehicles, as well as many characters and voices to choose from to represent yourself (Although, there are no female choices except for the VR female voice).
I'd give this game a high 9 out of 10 due to it's achievements. Not every game is perfect, but there will always be bunches of fun.
(Also, Arma glitches are very funny, so you'll have a great time with those.)"

17418,"The community is supportive, helpful, and quite fun to play with, the controls at the very beginning can be confusing but i recommend playing the official servers for awhile, the people will be happy to help as long as you state your new. 

8/10

I only drop this game for a little due to how much it costs, i purchased it on sale and i saw it's worth it, but with so much of the game locked by DLC it's hard to not get a little annoyed everytime you try to play and get kicked because of it being a DLC map. Other than that the community, physics, and fun factor would bump it to a 10 from me"
17419,Game is shit
17420,"GAME IS GOOD AI IS OK

17421,Ive played ARMA 3 for years and still love it.  It is by far the best game out there with an open world concept.  There are some bugs and lag spikes but if you can get past that It has so much to offer.

17434,wow
17435,"Arma 3

Graphics (9 of 10):  An amazing simulation, I love flying across coastal areas and low over forests bringing troops in.  The virtual cockpits, terrain, and water detail are wonderful.  Everything from underwater life to hopping bunnies, the detail is stunning.

Ease of Learning (7 of 10):  The basic tutorials are quite good and walk you through essentials of game play.  There's only one area I find very difficult to learn and that's just learning to spot enemy.  All I can say is don't rush and take your time to scan while moving cover to cover.

Audio (8 of 10):  Sounds are realistically simulated.  As much as I hate wearing headphones I always use them for Arma 3 so that I can get the benefits of stereo to localize enemy fire.

Stability (8 of 10):  Arma 3 occasionally glitches, mostly in game glitches and inconsistencies rather than outright crashes.  Interface or visual defects were the most common, but getting stuck under terrain, or other crippling problems do happen from time to time.  Usually simple to fix.

Fun (8 of 10):  Arma 3 for solo play is poor for anything but learning and practicing, but if you have or take the time to find a good community it can be great.  It is however a simulation, do not expect non-stop intense action.  If spending time finding a good group is not your thing do not buy this game, without a group to play with and help you through the glitchier parts this game is not worth it.

Customization (10 of 10):  Whether you want to write your own mods (extensive scripting is supported and well documented) or just use one of tens of thousands of premade mods and missions this community is stunning.

Overall (8.5 of 10):  A great game if you want a simulation and are willing to find a good group.  I found the APEX, Jets, Marksman, Tanks, Helicopters, and Laws of War DLC to be essential."
17436,"it is mad fun
"
17437,"I have had this game for a while, ive really got the most out of this game after joining one a many online units, they exploit the game to its maximum and really allow you play how its meant to be played.

The single player game modes are equally as good they just miss that radio combined efforts of team mates that you can only get online.

The mods for the game make the gaming even better but some are very large and my stop you joining certain servers.

All in all, highly recommended!!"
17438,It's a great sandbox that you can do milsims in or just flat-out have fun tacticooly.
17439,yes
17440,"Game is great, what else is there to really say, population is in a decline but that's due to age, overall a great military sandbox and by far my most played steam game. Modding community is great and allows you infinite possibilities in this game."
17441,yuh
17442,This game is very realistic
17443,"I've been playing ""Arma"" since Operation flashpoint back in 2001 and boy it's been a bumpy ride.
This game has had so much potensial and has provided so many great moments that I'll never forget.
A few years from now, Arma was a mod installation and crash simulator. 
We would spend a whole evening just problemsolving issues and then at the end, when 80% of the players had given up trying, we FINALLY got to start our session, got spend 1 hour traversing to the area of operation. 
We would sneak up, scouting and marking enemy positions, planning our attack in detail aaand it crashed..

Today Arma has evoled alot. Correction: The mod community has made mods that makes the game so enjoyable that there is simply no experience like it anywhere.
With the right combination of AI mods you can make the AI very convinsing and allmost humanlike at times!
Some mods are improving sound, immersion, functionality... Just everything turns from a dull and boring experience to a shining gem of a game!
However... without a community or someone that knows how to implement the mods, it will take a loong time to figure out how to implement the mods. 
If you are not willing to spend 1k hours just learning how to set up a server with mods, I suggest joning a community for the optimal experience for arma.
And also: make sure you join the right type of community, as each one is having their own empasis on gameplay: Some are realism based, milsim based and some are just about pure fun. 
Personally I think this game is the ultimate milsim, where you get a very complete feeling of realsm and immersion to a level where you s**t your pants when the firefight starts. 

The game also has a VERY steep learning curve. 
In order to play it properly, you'll have to learn a ton of keybindings.
But this is also the cool part. You'll have more control than in other shooters.
In short: you can pretty much do most of the things you could IRL from movement to weapons functionality.
This is more like a simulation than anything else, so If you expect a pure action shooter, go somewhere else. 

At the and I would say this:  ""Arma is hard to love, but once you get to know it, it is loved too hard"". 

Here is my verdict (with great mods)
Graphics: 8/10 
Sound: 8 (JSRS sound mod)
Gameplay: 9/10
UI: 6 /10
AI: 8/10

I think this game has lots of promise however its not for me."

there is no way a bee

Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

go play pubg    dont waste your time with this game"
17514,"Pros - No other FPS can touch this. No matter how many First-person-shooters I try I always come back to ARMA 3. 
 I guess the bar has been set too high. No other game can give you the immersion, customization and pure satisfaction of this masterpiece. I certainly hope there will be an ARMA 4 but in the meantime this'll do just fine.

Cons - To get the true immersive feeling you have to navigate through and install a f**k ton of mods. If you can get past that then you're golden."
17515,Good old Arma. But this time with character customization and a 3d editor.
17516,"Arma 3 is a one of a kind experience. Not only from the realism of war and combat, such as recoil control, diameter, aim, wind, distance, speed and much much more, but from the experience it provides. I spend most of my time in the Eden Editor, designing and building scenarios in a combative situation. The possibilities are endless. To be honest, I doubt an Arma 4 is even needed. Because even after years of release, Arma 3 remains one of the top shooter RTS games of all time, and even gets updates. I'd recommend it to absolutely anybody."

17550,"This game has alot of issues bugs and other things some of the bugs still excist even after 7 years of release and such Lets get into some of the issues with Cons,  Then pros coz i found more Cons then pros so thats last.

Over-all :
1) Damage - it can feel like your or the enemie bullets do nothing as i have legit sat there and unloaded half a clip of a gun into someone only for them to not die and b een cought reloading my gun only to catch someone turn the corner and start unloading there gun into me only for me to take no damage,  Sometimes they or yourself drop in 1 hit from a random stray or a shot to the foot or w.e,  sometimes you take half a clip and still be A-OK for the most part sure you got some bleeding you gotta patch up but no big deal to sometimes driving along in a truck run over a rock and you took damage ... wtf is this games logic?
2) Bugs - The game has issues with Bugs from scipting events in the campaign not triggering coz X Team member died from something random like he was driving a truck ran over a rock and the truck went flying into space,  To bullets legit taking 90 degree turns and hitting someone in the face you can see the tracer curve 90 degrees and hit someone at times or fly off into w.e
3) Controls - The Controls are sluggish at times and it takes some getting use to especly with certain vechicles and such,  This game trys to pride itself on being ultra realistic but with the number of bugs and such its just annoying as fuck.  I dont mind controls being a bit off at times but eveything combine makes me sometimes just face palm
4) Freezing / Loading - The game freezes and take awhile to load at times and will randomly crash a number of people report this, its a normal excuise to just 'restart' till it works but holy fucken shit that shouldnt be the fucken case.
5) Saves - Sometimes the game auto saves right before you get head snipedo r something in the campaign or such things that forces you to manuoly save at times when you think your safe and even then i have to re-start the mission multible times coz of fails...

Campaign :
1) AI - The AI is just terrible at times,  Trying to control team mates or when your apart of a squad being controled, you will sometimes watch them just go THAT way and keep running off that way for a random reason till they die,  sometimes they love to just jump out of cover and run across open ground making them easy as shit to shoot at,  this is both the enemie AI and your team mates,  This dosnt happen all the time but it happens enough that it gets frustrating annoying
2) Scripted events - The Scripted events to keep the missing going / flowing is pretty badly done there are TONS of missions where the mission itself will just stop working and you gotta re-start over and over and over again till something clicks and you can complete it,  Some Events are scripted to characters meaning if they die or something happens to them the mission will fuck up,  Sometimes you know this and take GREAT pains to make sure they are not killed, but the mission still fucks up for some reason just a simple early mission like Tipping point requires the Squad leader to not die,  I Learned that and had to shoot him in the leg to make him walk so i can kill eveything in time the problem with that is ive seen online that paratroopers are sopos to come in attack you you gotta escape all this intence stuff,  nada dosnt happen even with eveyone in your squad alive.  Sometimes i tryed not shooting my squad leader in the leg and just tryed it normaly holy shit he loves to get himself killed, but na game still bugs,  IT WORKED FINALY after I shot him in the leg and the other team leader in the fucken leg then patch them up once i cleared a spot so they hurry forword then shot them in the leg again only so i can clear the next area only to patch them up then i had to shoot them in the fucken leg a THIRD time before the paratroopers would spawn in then patch them up,  THEN the mission would complete normaly
WTF???? i heard alot of ppl having issues with this game and i can see fucken why

Multiplayer :
1) The Walking simulation - So in normal MP matches you spawn SHIT TONS far away from the enemie and you gotta A) Hoof it to the action and hope you dont fucken die right off the bat just to re-peat the process or B) Get into a halo or some other vech and then get into action Provided lag or such dosnt just kick you out of the Halo and you fall to your death and gotta repeat shit all the fuck over again

I can see why people call this game a walking simulator,  I Personaly wouldnt mind it to much in the campaign and other such things or if i didnt keep getting glitchedo ut or watching other people glitch out, or watching the tank your in flip over coz of a rock or some other Bullshit

fffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkken hell

I Mean from what little i was able to see from the campaign and doing shit I Got to control my own squad only to contently be blown up by a Halo time and time again HELL I did beat the mission but then i got shot by the Halo behind me after it said MISSION COMPLETED! and died and it went OH WAIT NOPE GOTTA RE-START THE FUCKEN WHOLE MISSION BRO!

WHAT THE FUCK MAN?"
17551,Great game!
17552,gud game
17553,"I can't say i'd reccomend it to a lot of people but.

A lot of new features, Zeus is really cool. 

With friends online can be amazing at times.

 still more fun than a lot of fps's.

 It does feel like it has stayed true to the ""military simulator"" tag people give it.

HOWEVER, it is buggy as hell, no one out of my friends can ever see each others games when we host, so we cannot use the scenarios that we make ourselves (which would have made up for the poor campaign) and your support team did not offer much help.

Really small campaign lacking some of the single player aspects from Arma 2 Imo, it does feel like they put a lot less effort in single player content, considering the story (in the vanilla game) and environment especially, not much was done with this huge map, Even in the expansion. BUT it does give a lot of room for modders to have fun with.

Looking at DLC like lords of war, it really does seem like they care about the whole military process, including the aftermath which is quite different. But really guys some of the DLC is just pointless, I can't pick up someone's weapon in the middle of a fight due to not having some DLC that I don't want? then giving me Ads during a game? this really needs to stop. Quality DLC is good but a lot of this just hurts the experience and does not encourage me to buy anything from you again.

All in ALL, 
Still a good game, nice big maps, needs a lot of work, is a very old game but I hope version 4 is different."

17564,Arma 3 is that autistic piece of trash that you keep playing over and over again because it just somehow keeps you coming back? like the fuck is the reason I keep play is it the people maybe but 90% the people you meet are either literal children or man-children to some fucking retard that doesn't know that bullet drop exists to that no life armchair navy seal that thinks hes the shit because he in a super elite milsim but when hes not in the game he'll probably get a heart attack walking 10 feet away from the house.

I bought this game on Lunar Sale for just $7 and had no indication that I would need further DLC just to join online servers or seemingly, even launch the game.

After loading up the launcher for the first time, I was greeted with the server screen and each server says 'GET DLC' in order to join/play. So I thought, okay, I'll just launch the game standard. Nope. Nothing. Game literally wouldn't launch.

There are tons of options of different ways to play this game you can: Play in a milsim unit, play on a life RP server, play exile a survival mod, etc. And the modding community is immense, just the shear amount of mods available on the Steam Workshop and not is insane, only game I've seen that is similar is Rimworld. 
All in All I would recommend this game to anyone who is considering buying this game, especially if it's on sale. A must buy even in 2021.
"
17659,"I've picked it up at the lunar sale fur around 7 bucks. I always wanted an realistic shooter and never found one. Now this is a hell of a shooter. You make a wrong move you die, you don't plan your attack you die, you think you are good you die. I LOVE IT. Never was a game so rewarding for getting something done. Yes, you need to learn and I also still must learn a lot, but you really like shooters and want to play a real shooter for mans, then you should buy this. Its age is visible, but the mods make the game so much better and make it worth playing for a long time (Thank you to the modders out there)."

H O W E V E R 

this game runs on an engine so clunky and handed-down, it makes gamebryo 2 from 10 years ago look like cutting edge technology. Gameplay has poor pacing for something so focused around military life. A lot of actions and things take forever to do. Movement is ridiculous in how its handled, and the simplest actions can become complex chores during gameplay due to the overload of keys and their functions. Since so much is also handled through a scroll down, real-time, interaction menu, this further complicates things. Furthermore, the actual menus and design of Arma 3 is confusing to people who aren't as knowledgable about Game networking. I remember spending hours on a Malden scenario, only to find out I couldnt seem to host a game for me and my friend to play together, because of how ridiculously confusing the multiplayer gaming seems to be. There are so many minor quirks and problems in just the moment-to-moment flow of Arma 3 that greatly impede its enjoyability. Compared to the flow of movement and combat in other, modern strategic shooters and milsims(Rising Storm 2, Squad, Beyond the Wire, Post Scriptum), Arma 3 is like 50 feet below the bottom of the barrel.  This movement is outdated and feels like something from 2003 rather than 2013.

Game is also a bit of a dlc-hog. There is a lot of cool equipment and stuff in Arma 3, but so much of it is behind paywalls for miniature DLCs to access more cool equipment and maps. 

However, the game is still plenty fun. The reason my review is so negative, however, is because there is so much potential in this formula if the code of the Arma franchise were to be changed fundamentally to perhaps come away from modability, but a lot more towards creating a fluid, challenging, and enjoyable milsim. I understand the clunkiness of the movement is only partially due to the hand-me-down code, and is mostly because Bohemia Interactive wishes to retain Arma's modding reputation, but its more important to have a fun game that people can buy and play than it is to have a dull game people can buy, mod, and then have fun with after 20 quality-of-life mods are installed."

17736,"Great Military simulator,
Would recommend also playing Tanoa,Altis,Stratis life...
Modded community player base."
17737,"Keys, memory. That's all, all this game is. 8/10"
17738,It is RETARDED how much money you need to put into this POS game for you not to get snagged up on any pay wall's or stuff like that...honestly I hope the dev's of this game choke on their cornish game hen and they have to pay 100 dollars for the life saving DLC
17739,great game. endless possibilities. but in wish i played against more humans then Bots
17740,i have had this for a year now and without the warkshop and mods i miaet of said no (sorry im not good at typing)
17741,"In dont really have anything negative to say, the game has some AI issues yes and some weird land physics but overall the game is great, after school i jump into scenario editor and mess around takes a lot of stress out bombing the V.C on a monday afternoon."
17742,Tough learning curve but when you get used to it its great.
17743,;)
17744,Name one thing you cannot do in this game. Amazing communities and great contributions by mod makers. 7 year old game still great gameplay
17745,One of the best Mil-sim shooters you can get. Even better with friends.
17746,"Amazing Game. I've been playing over 1,400 hours and still love it. It's always changing and never boring. 

"
17747,"straight up, this game has potential but feels cheeky"
17748,muy bueno
17749,"Had this game for 2 days, I already have 10 hours. I play non-stop Love the game good job Bohemia!"
17750,Great game recommended 10/10 considering how old it is its one of the best milsim games out there
17751,gut.
17752,very epic sausxe
17753,haha funni war crimes :)
17754,great game
17755,this games a major Bruh moment ngl
17756,this game runs soo horrible you will spend more time trying to get the game to work then actual game play
17757,its hard to get used to the controlles
17758,It is a very fun game to play but it has a lot of bugs
17759,really like the game but i cannot play it because i dont have an ssd. if you are going to play this and dont want to deal with a lot of stuttering then you are going to need an ssd
17760,good game I was just too stupid to understand how to play with other people thats why I returned this.
17761,"As Jotaro once said:
YES
YES
YES"
17762,"Joined a roleplay server, got hit at full speed by a car and then was arrested because my character was black.
10/10 would play again."
17763,no idea what im doing but im enjoying doing nothing so far
17764,This is the best war game out there. This game has everything from boot camp all the way to go-karting and more lol
17765,I don't know where this game has been all my life.....
17766,"I definitely haven't gotten the full experience of the game just yet but it is amazing the graphics aren't the best but it still amazes me how open this game is, it is fun to play, theirs lot to learn, and tons of thing to do and explore in this game. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes an open world sandbox game with lots of gun, planes, and tanks."
17767,good campaign good multiplayer 10/10

17780,"Hands down the best game i have ever played. Even Though theres alot of drama with the milsim side of things, it was amazing taking part in legendary operations ill never forget, from having to go behind enemy lines as a 4 man spec ops team and barley make it out to a full scale invasion of cherno, it has never failed to keep me in the game really wish i didnt have to grow up cuz i rarely can play
"
17781,"Love the game, would suggest it for people who have a-lot of time on their hands and like MILSIM's."
17782,Best sim game for military RL users.
17783,Holy shit why do so many war veterans Play this fucking game don‚Äôt you have PTSD to worry about

17785,Dogwater
17786,owo
17787,"this ""simulation"" is way too much fun and on top its reapeating fun and all around enjoyable i would recommend this to military enthusiast. advance movement makes running around easier too even though it break immersion for heavy gear but i could play this ever day do mission or playing Zeus repeatedly"
17788,I can't believe my Aspire 5 running this. 10/10
17789,awesome milsim
17790,GREAT
17791,Like the big maps and communication within players.
17792,banned for no reason
17793,Great game.
17794,"Arma 3 is a poorly optimized military simulation that you will struggle to get more than 30 fps on multiplayer servers.

That being said, if you enjoy shooters for their realism (Escape from Tarkov, Ghost Recon, etc.) you will enjoy this game. Imagine the Gmod of shooters, the sheer number of mods available means there probably a server with your exact desires waiting for you. 

Also, don't buy any zombie survival game. Get this instead and you'll have a better time than ever playing Dayz standalone, World War z, etc."
17795,"As a tried and tested gamer this is by far the worst game iv sunken hours into, however this is the best tech demo for Cig smoking, Slav Tracksuit wearing, immaculate small dick energy, ever made. with the mechanics that will make grown men who molest 13 year olds at his local Airsoft group throw their Hush money at Bohemia. I would say I speak for the community when I say this game somehow sucks, but at the same time somehow slaps harder then a drunk Irish dad after he lost a 10k parlay cuz Ireland didn't win the World Cup, and England didn't die in a freak plane crash."
17796,It's alright
17797,It Fun
17798,Its frustratingly fun.. lol
17799,woot
17800,Pretty cool I played with this guy called commander rockwell but he hasn't been online since march 15th 2019
17801,"Really promising idea, but the engine is so uncomfortable to play with. Gunplay feels weird, movement is completely janky, menus are awkward. Love the concept of it but it fails to immerse."
17802,I have more hours on this game than any other game for a reason
17803,its awesome
17804,"-gets into a random server through the Quick play option
-realizes it's a russian server
-looks around
-has no idea what to do
-finds a helicopter
-attempts to fly the helicopter
-manages to blow the helicopter up without even getting it up in the air
-a random person comes and explains how to fly upwards
-finally gets the helicopter in air
-flips over 5 times before crashing into the base and killing some of the allies
10/10 would try again"

17824,its a fun game
17825,good game
17826,Games Goodn't
17827,"Likes: ability to play almost all roles of large scale, combined arms conflict game matches. VOIP team comms adds element of total team coordination and allows helpful teammates to offer help even during matches.  Access to massive armory of weapons and equipment. Dislikes: servers prone to scripting, cheats can ruin a great match despite running anti-cheat software in game."
17828,arma + workshop = god tier
17829,"It's buggy as hell, horribly optimized, convoluted to learn, and often times infuriating to play.

If you can get past all these things, there's absolutely nothing that comes anywhere close to it in terms of the gameplay experience it provides.

You will probably rage over this game a lot, but you'll still keep coming back for more."
17830,Amazing
17831,It's all great.
17832,one of the best games out there
17833,I like how it is the closest thing to real combat but my ass itches for some reason when playing this.
17834,Best FPS (simulator) ever. I feels as real as it gets! can be slow at times but just makes those fire fights all more rewarding. level builders are great and makes for good fun with friends!
17835,Awesome
17836,itty bitty titty comitee
17837,I'm trapped in the Arma editor. Please send help
17838,"It's a great game and all, lots of funny bugs to find. But it just really pisses me off you have to pay like 15‚Ç¨ or more just so you can drive a tank, same goes for jets, helis and other kinds of shit."
17839,cause
17840,"Pretty ridiculously expensive DLC which in what makes these games so good is the community servers which will not allow you to interact with certain environment without said DLC. ~$90 on top of the initial 30. It's a lot. It's great if you want to spend the money but I can't recommend a purchase on it.
Edit: As pointed out - on sale, this is a great game (if bought with most/all DLC). It is older and DLC is needed I just find there to be too much DLC added to one game. I more believe that the base game is not worth a purchase without the DLC."
17841,good
17842,"It was good, can even run well on a MAC"
17843,its neat
17844,Have you ever dreamed of committing the most horrific war crimes? Well boy..... do I have the game for you.
17845,Get it lol.
17846,"Arma 3 is a very entertaining game. The multiplayer is very lively, and the campaign is fun (albeit having to run a marathon to every objective). The game does have it's flaws though, there are a lot of keybinds and commands to remember, as well as other parts of the controls that are not explicitly identified. The campaign, enjoyable as it is, also sometimes feels a bit confusing: the missions are laid out in multiple different ways and the objectives to complete are sometimes quite a challenge, particularly Signal Lost, where you are quite literally up against an entire army with a pistol. The multiplayer can also be confusing at times for new players, especially with the players and units that take the simulator roleplay to the max and use proper military codes and call-signs. But playing games of Zeus and King of the Hill are very enjoyable, rushing straight into combat and having to use tactics instead of just: 'shoot shoot bad guy'. Overall, the game is extremely fun once you get to grips with it, but may take some getting used to with new players. I'd give it a solid 8/10."
17847,"Good CPU, more than 4gb ram forsure needed, testing with External SSD but other than that everything fun in this game"
17848,MilSim
17849,Play overthrow with friends you'll rack up hours
17850,"It's good, The campaign is unbearably slow at moments, but its a well crafted mil sim. Altis life is the shit though.. Haven't had much time in it yet, but its enjoyable for sure."
17851,its pretty realistic if you are into those games
17852,It is an Amazing game for itself but with mods even better
17853,becaus arma..

17859,Awesome war sim
17860,welcome to the real war
17861,For my first time ever playing an Arma game I gotta say it is amazing. (definitely unforgiving) You actually have to plan ahead instead of just doing because if you just go you will die over and over and over again.
17862,"it gud
"
17863,"Fantastic game, but it's a steep learning curve. Do your research before buying and make sure it's the right game for you. If it is, it doesn't get much better than this."

17896,BETTER
17897,loved
17898,it good
17899,"I will be honest, if you want realistic vehicle physics this game might not be for you. If you decide to get into a little fender bender you might go flying like a choncla after you piss off your Mexican mom."

17901,Good game.
17902,
17903,"bit complicated, lots of DLC, but still fun"
17904,i can commit war crimes and not be judged. who the fuck would not want to play this
17905,"Basically the standard for any military simulator, but its also a blast even if you don't intend to play seriously. Only downside is you do need a solid rig to run it. Besides that, certainly worth the buy."
17906,"the dlc ads are kind of intrusive, but otherwise good game"
17907,"just don't purchase it because isn't fun 
"
17908,"ArmA 3 has become my favourite game. This is due to it's complex mechanics, incredible community with huge amounts of mods and maps available, the firefights (even against AI) are difficult and the Eden Editor that comes with it just creates so many new options and ways to play. It has lots of DLC options for you and these introduce even more weapons, vehicles, landscapes, characters and behaviours. It is just truly amazing even in 2021."
17909,Great game.  Lot's of fun.
17910,I have a gay faggot saying i scammed him

17917,fun as shit
17918,yes
17919,game is great! lots learn!
17920,"if you like recreating or reenacting war then this is the game for you, tons of mods to add new factions and weapons, vehicles etc. just dont expect the highest fps possible, bohemia interactive should of built a better engine, the game is very CPU heavy, but my game runs pretty good and ive got a i5 4670K."
17921,very nice
17922,Its Okay TBH. Played it a little bit.
17923,good army simulator with realistic gun mechanics. only thing i dislike is that frame drops are very common. not very well optimised.
17924,LAGGY TRASH LAME STUPID PIECE OF TRASH GAME.
17925,yes
17926,the frame rate is a drag to fix i suggest trying to use a optimization tool such as Razer's game booster. but overall a good game to play.
17927,I have PTSD
17928,great fun :D
17929,
17930,"worth every penny, amazing game."
17931,I may not have the largest amount of time but I really enjoy this game and recommend it to you
17932,"sweet game, hard to get into but fun"
17933,cool
17934,"Great Game, even my girlfriend enjoys it after I forced her to play it :)"
17935,Best MilSim game I've played ever. Can't wait for Arma 4!
17936,Excellent for its realism and very fun to play with friends.
17937,"Game crashes too much 
"
17938,I loved the realism of the game just make sure you get  a good server tho you don't want a bunch of noobs ruining the game. You can sometimes forget its a game. Anyway i would recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic combat simulator.
17939,Interesting military sim with a TON of keybinds. This game has a STEEP learning curve. I really reccomend you buy a mic if you don't have one already. The game itstelf is based heavily on communications. Overall the game runs pretty easily and has a friendly community that will help you learn along the way.
17940,Great game
17941,its okay
17942,noice
17943,The only thing i can complain about is the performance. with i7 4800k and 1070 i get 50fps if im lucky. 30fps in a very crowded city. but the game is still very wellmade and playable. there is no more complaint for my side right now. so if u have a weak pc i dont recomend but other wise pick it up if ure interested.
17944,....
17945,yes
17946,"Military simulator. It's about 10 years old and still going strong, and the mods are about endless. Need I say more?"
17947,ARMA
17948,"good
"
17949,"To be clear, I think there is an audience out there for this game and there are reasons that some people would want to pick this up. I'll outline the reasons someone would like to pick up this game later in my review. That said, I think the average person that hears about ARMA and only wants some multiplayer shooter vaguely grounded in realism isn't going to enjoy this game.

The critical part of the review:

This game *is* realistic. It is a civilian spin off of a simulation software that the US Armed Forces uses for training. But because of that, it runs into the same problems as almost anything else sold to the US Armed Forces. 

Performance wise, it feels like $37 dollar screws the game.  Despite being released in 2013, on low settings with a Ryzen 7 CPU and a GTX 1070 my frame rate will hover around 30-40 in cities. The gameplay isn't that fast paced, so you don't *need* to hit the 60fps mark to be competitive, but it's still fairly disappointing that I need to run an 8 year old game on low settings when I can still play most current games at 1080p 60hz no problem. Outisde of cities, the game runs much better, but it is impractical to change your performance settings every time you enter or leave a city, and the game's art direction doesn't lend itself to looking pretty at low settings. Even with higher graphics, several of the animations (even in single player) look buggy and take you out of the experience.

Gameplay wise, it spares no expense for realism. Advertising materials brag about how bullets that hit your gun will deflect off of it and there being a multitude of stances/poses you can do in game to give yourself the best tactical advantage. However, sparking no expense includes no expense for UX. Interacting with things by default is done with the space bar, and interaction opens up a menu that you then need to navigate and select what you want to do, even if there's one option. To get over short obstacles, you press 'v'. You can't really 'jump' (which may or may not be realistic given how heavy the gear soldiers get irl is). Aiming down sights by default is toggle, and I had to look up a guide to figure out how to change it to the industry standard hold. Doing anything more complicated than your basic movement, interaction, shooting, and reloading feels clunky and you probably won't want to attempt any thing unless you know you aren't under fire. As for game flow, on the single player campaigns and on most military simulation servers, there's a lot of realistic down time where you aren't really doing anything, and a lot of realistic times you try your hardest to check your surroundings to make sure everything is clear, move forward, and get shot by someone too far away to see clearly.

Also some gear is hidden behind DLC. This isn't that big of a problem in multiplayer, the only DLC that splits the multiplayer community is whether or not you have the Tanoa map, otherwise you can still join servers, just can't use the DLC items. However, just be aware that you aren't getting access to everything when you purchase the main game

The part where I praise ARMA:

With all of the complaints above, there are some things I found ARMA did well. I would recommend ARMA if these features specifically sound worth dealing with the frustrations I listed above to you.

The biggest draw by far is the community content. 

The game has a very powerful built in scenario editor. I've seen many creative things done with this, including a remake of CoD: Modern Warfare in game. 

The game also has very strong modding support and and active modding community. Mods can add new weapons, reskin existing things, give you new maps, let you download custom scenarios, script entirely new mechanics etc. Looking at the workshop tab right now, there's an entire Clone Wars mod that straight up adds blasters, light sabers, total faction overhauls, etc..

Servers can use a combination of these mods and scenarios to crate new modes of gameplay. ARMA 2 gave birth to DayZ and PUBG with this process, and ARMA 3 has it's own active set of custom servers that include not just zombies and BR's, but city life RP servers, warlord servers, and probably a tonne of other new gamemodes that I don't know about. 

And also there's single player. If you are anti social and don't want to communicate with other people, there is a built in single player campaign and several others you can download off the workshop.

Conclusion:

What I wanted out of this game was a smooth playing multiplayer shooter with large battles that is loosely grounded in realism, BUT will make sacrifices for the sake of gameplay. This game isn't it. If that's what you're here for, which I suspect many people looking at this store page are, I would strongly recommend looking at Squad instead. I don't have the money to buy it because I'm unemployed and pandemic, but everything I've seen of Squad on Youtube is exactly what I was hoping to get out of ARMA. 

If you want 26 page standardized brownie recipe levels of realism, this is the game you want.

If you want to see what new wacky/amazing thing the community made in the sandbox, or want to try the sandbox out for yourself, this is the game you want.

If you just want a polished experience that is more realistic than CoD/Battlefield but will make some sacrifices for the sake of user experience, consider looking into Squad instead."

17964,"My original online FPS was America's Army v1 beta through v2.6 (?) and it was a great platform and a riot to play, then they took it to AA ""proving ground"" and it was only a shadow of the original game. A few years later I was introduced to Arma 2, lots of fun and really complex but fun as hell. was away from Arma 2 for about 7 years due to injury and have just deployed with Arma 3  and man it really rocks with the great time of yester year in AA original and 10 times better, with tons of content, 

To the Dev's and and Contributors wow GREAT JOB!

I set our own unit today and recruiting many of the old farts that I loved hanging with way back when.

Cheers.

17966,I have just hit 100 hours on just the base game (without DLC's) and i am still having fun! 10 oout of 10 no cap
17967,Haha fighter go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
17968,Amazainggggg
17969,very richtig good
17970,Really good the most realistic war game
17971,This game is a huge disappointment. great potential but its just a**
17972,Campaign is extremely short and  the dlc to expand it is horrible. Not worth the buy in my opinion
17973,"Coming from someone who currently serves in the United States Marine Corps, this game is very accurate. Great community, can learn a lot from them if you ask questions. 10/10 will recommend to a friend!"
17974,its shit
17975,"Cool game, I like it. Takes a while to get into though, since it's pretty complex. Well woth it though."
17976,A total blast!
17977,"from watching tons of people playing this on youtube i thought this game was gonna be great. but unless you plan on spending an absurd amount of money on dlc then the game will stay garbage. theres no campaign like they advertised, and after trying to join around a dozen matches the only one i wasnt immediately kicked from was one from china and i couldnt even play because nothing was in english."
17978,"kills hours of time very few bugs/smooth frames 
"
17979,.
17980,"I won't recommend this game to other, since the gameplay isn't smooth. Constant performace issues and complexity. Also realized the game doesn't offer cloud save over steam, so my reinstalled game doesn't contain my old game files.  
I hope arma4 will offer a more compelling gameplay."
17981,"So I have 5,000 hours in game now and figured it would be about time to write up a review. This is probably my favorite game based on sheer playtime. Even though Arma III has been out some ~8 years now, it offers a lot for anyone. If you like ground combat you can focus solely on that. if you like flying (that is me) you can just spend countless hours online or offline dropping ordnance and dogfighting. I highly recommend HOTAS flight controls though. And TRACK IR to really get the full experience and immerse yourself in world. If you are worried about getting involved with the game because of its many keyboard controls, don't worry. They come to you with play time. Just don;t think you can jump immediately online and play in PVP servers without even having done the tutorial. (Stares in disgust at all that do this!) Seriously do the fucking tutorial and a few missions of the campaigns to get acquainted with the game! The editor is one aspect I think a lot of people forget to really talk about. If you take some time, you can make some pretty cool missions. This game is great for those who play offline SP because of the editor. You can play the game by just making bases if that suits you. Treat the editor as a world builder for model military bases. But if you need me to endorse this game, then yes, get it. Sure, there are weird collision physics with tank going flying because they hit a parked car sometimes.... and dead bodies will magically float and twitch.... but past all that this game keeps on because it is at its core a decent time every time you sit down and fire it up. Arma is anything you make it. Sandbox, flight sim, roleplay, and so much more."
17982,If you have no life this is thee game to play you can do anything in this game except have a life outside it.

It ranges from RP servers to Muslim groups to modded servers, where you can shape the game to how you want to play it. I‚Äôve met a lot of people through arms, and it has helped my friends list grow, I at one point joined a Milsim unit and spent hours with that group, honestly if you‚Äôre looking for a game to play to burn some time this is it."

18020,This game is awesome and like others it need improvements. Hopefully we will see Arma 4.
18021,"Game is good however it is pretty hard to get the hang of it, such as understanding what everything does and means, Multiplayer is only fun when you know what your doing and dont get shot out the sky right away. Afterall, this game is good and i recommend it. ;D"
18022,"great game, if you can't remember buttons and get confused easily then i don't recommend his game for you. This game is a rough game in the start but with a little effort you will enjoy this game very much."

18026,yes
18027,I love this game. Tho you do require three big things to play. 1. A good unit 2. Patience 3.  Mods. There is so much ton this game i have yet to experience. The controls may overwhelm new players but believe me it pays off in the end. I recommend this game if you like squad and other such games where you require team work or like being a small cog in a big machine to complete an objective

18048,"Having been an avid XBOX player for 10 years playing COD and the various Battlefields, I saw some game play of Arma 3 and  was desperate to play this game/simulation. I managed to get a cheap PC and installed an RX 580 graphics card in it and it runs Arma 3 on Ultra settings and let me tell you - I'm hooked. As ex military this game has it all and squad tactics !!. Playing as a team with everything realistic can make things tense - get shot and you need bandages or a medic, its not COD were you get shot loads of times, people are jumping up and down like a spring, instant sniper shots, if you want a proper military experience without having to sign up then give Arma 3 a go.
Its not perfect as it runs on an old engine and it has some issues, but you WILL spend hours on this game, just make sure you do the tutorials first.

18060,I have grown up playing Arma games i started on Arma 2 Dayz mod when I was 11 then eventually moved to Arma 3 so I am very well versed on its community when i say that the community is completely bi polar I mean it because half the time you will find the coolest most down to earth people you've ever met while the other half you find ex rust players screaming like speds into their mic but in the end you will find that the Arma franchise will give you some of the greatest memories a video game can give you i highly recommend Arma to anyone
18061,"Arma 3, a lovely mil sim game where you play as a 1 lunged asthmatic who somehow made it through a medical check while being drafted into war.

Gonna be real here, I mostly play it for the King of The Hill mode, as the actual mil-sim parts ends up being a whole lot of ""Getting Arma'd"" which includes but is not limited too, Getting run over by your own truck, getting quick scoped from 1km out by an AI with iron sights, and a large amount of ""How did he survive half a mag to the face!""

Overall a fun game, just expect bugs, and for the bugs to make no sense. This is the only game where I can say I'm still playing it after an Audio bug caused Frame rate loss."

18084,"ARMA 3, which should be known as Asthma 3, is what you will quickly come to understand when you first encounter the hellish stamina system designed for infantry combat. Infantry combat being one of the core and largest aspects of the game. If it wasn't already bad enough to deal with heavy breathing and weapon sway, being wounded makes you wish you were KIA instead.

Those who play ARMA 3 and offer it positive reviews will often fail to mention how heavily modified the game has become over the years in order to enjoy it. Even if you do not personally use mods, you will often encounter server-side mods as hosted by the server you're on to make the experience palpable. The most commonly implemented server-side mod is designed to disable the original infantry stamina system entirely.

One of the largest failures from Bohemia Interactive was their shift towards a ""futuristic"" representation of warfare for ARMA 3. This includes some absurdly bogus and fictional representations of equipment and vehicles which will take time for you to recognize. ARMA 2 was likely the peak representation of what ARMA's ""Military Simulation"" experience meant, even with the limitations thereof at the time.

Ironically, if you look up mods for ARMA 3, you will ultimately find a plethora of mods that make an attempt to ""revert"" the game back into a more ""modernized"" and ""current"" version of military equipment and vehicles akin to ARMA 2. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive would be wise to acknowledge the intentions of their player-base that regularly struggle with mods, just to put the game back the way ""it should have been"".

Perhaps they will pay attention to mods such as the ACRE mod, allowing for more realistic military radio communication with simulated static and keyed-mic sounds. While also including an ""advanced"" medical system akin to the ACE mod.

One can only hope that Bohemia Interactive takes all the handy features and ballistics of ARMA 3, while incorporating the weaponry and vehicles of ARMA 2, in hopes to ultimately develop the foundation of what could make ARMA 4 the best game of the entire series. That is... If they dare to sell basic vehicles as a ""DLC"" for a second time...

Realism -is- what people expect from a ""military simulator"". Not futuristic. Pay attention Bohemia Interactive."
18085,good game

18087,It is a great game for people who like military type games
18088,it gud
18089,"This is truly the peak of realistic war shooters. The sheer amount of customization in this game is incredible, With mods and minimal coding, you can basically create any war scenario you can think of. For instance I have been playing this Vietnam War scenario where you can assemble a squad and capture squares on the map that are held by enemy VC soldiers. The map spawns enemies randomly and it has infinite replay ability."

Plus, no mission is the same with is amazing Zeus and Eden editors (great mission creators). Great game but you need at least 3 people to play with to have a good experience. BUY THIS GAME"

18121,"A great idea, but poor execution. It theoretically has all the components needed for gestalt but the final product remains elusive. At the end of the day it remains more of a military simulation framework, where signification modifications are needed for the actual simulation. Any end user experience is blemished by the clunky animations and boring atmosphere that appear to warrant only minimal graphical power, yet for some enigmatic reason the game runs as if it were optimized by a sophomore in college-- requiring beefy hardware and delivering single-threaded low FPS. Beyond the terrible experience of the game, and ignoring the cold unfriendly feeling it gives you, Arma fails to deliver even the basics of game-play. After finishing a hastily-completed-then-sold DLC, the player is left wanting. One may venture to the multiplayer tab expecting long-term game-play, only to be left with no fun server experience and a dreadful selection of public servers. They are wrought with low activity, strict rule-sets, and boring bits punctuated (read: adulterated) with the most basic of minimal realism and a few stray bullets-- good luck getting that revive!

Maybe Arma could be good, if they actually made the game."

18139,at first its hard but after doing tutorials and finishing story mod it becomes more fun to play
18140,
18141,help what button is to pee
18142,"great game and i,'ve had loads of fun"
18143,very nice
18144,Super optimised and great fun. I get a solid 45 FPS avg on a server with more than 20 people!
18145,This game will rid you of your crabs if you play it long enough.
18146,excellent
18147,
18148,"Very very difficult game to get in to, though many find it fun. 

The controls and the gameplay feels unintutive and it is difficult rummaging around in the menus.
Genuinely had a bad experience just trying to figure out how to play and get into the game. On top of this, the bugs, the inactive servers, the load times and the DLC placements."
18149,Lots of editing/mod fun if you can put the time in to learn the game.
18150,gooooooooooooooooood game
18151,Awesome military simulator. Would recommend!
18152,really makes you feel like a soldier..
18153,yes
18154,very nice
18155,GREAT GAME
18156,my mom bought this for me
18157,very cool
18158,they said I couldn't play with barbie dolls anymore so I brought this instead
18159,"big gun, fast plane, tank boom. 

very sim

con

18160,Best game ever
18161,"The best PvP and PvE game youll ever play, the game physics aren't  the best but this is one of the best games if you like PvP or PvE"
18162,yes
18163,it haz armie mans nd guns nd stuff
18164,gamer game

18168,amazing
18169,"trash compared to SQUAD
BUY that instead.
Save your money !"
18170,yes
18171,good
18172,butthole sex very nice
18173,"Enormement de fun mais une courbe d'apprentissage bien longue.
Une communaut√© hyper prolifique qui fait que l'on trouve forc√©ment son bonheur !!"
18174,The vast majority of the hours I have in this game are of me forgetting to close the launcher
18175,good
18176,Don't buy this game...it will consume you.
18177,One Of the most realistic games on warfare
18178,Ultra realistic vehicle physics simulator
18179,"Coming into Arma 3 with a few hours on Squad, I thought I knew what I was getting into...boy was I wrong. After 5 hours or so, I've yet to figure out how to join a public server, memorize half of the millions of keybinds, use any vehicle, etc. The fact that I'm still determined to learn/play this game speaks either to the joy of Arma, or my alarming lack of braincells. Cheers boys.

- Lyle"
18180,"It's a fun game, even if you just start playing now. There is a whole lot of things to do and as long as you understand its a relatively slow paced (to start) game, then you will probably love it. You can snipe, use a grenade launcher at close range, you can drive a truck with a 50 cal on the back of it, arma has it all. You can also roleplay but its not my cup of tea."
18181,"The mods in this game are great and the multiplayer is great. The campaign however is still bugged, in the mission ""tipping point"" if the squad leader that is originally assigned dies the mission does not progress like normal. That's all I have. Kudos."
18182,"Great game *starts dry humping you*
"
18183,"NGL, i dont know how to feel about this game. But, if you are buying it please have some friends or people to play with before you get it."
18184,"The only game where you can do war crimes whithout being put in jail.

Maybe there are some problems but whit right mods and right cumunity this game is a master peac

8/10

Needs better AI and needs driving remaking."
18185,"This is not a scoot n shoot, arena death match, RPG type finger masher. This is a complete immersive modern combat simulator. This is what Microsoft Flight Simulator is to flying, this is what F1 2020 is to formula 1, this is what FIFA 2020 is to football, this is as real as it can get whilst still being a game..."
18186,"Great game, annoying at first when you are starting off as a newcomer, however if you stick to it and learn through youtube tutorials you will get there and it will be extremely enjoyable. Its just a shame that you basically have to buy all of the DLC to use the game fully, the DLC's cost a lot of money."

18201,GGGGGGGG
18202,d
18203,This game is very fun but... you have to find the right server to play on or it can be very boring. I think the price is still too much for a almost 9 year old game that has bad FPS issues when you have a lot of mods installed that a lot of good server require to play.
18204,I can TK in this game because I'm a medic. 10/13
18205,Fun
18206,Very fun game. I enjoy the open-world type game very fun!!! Vitanam mod fun

18213,love the tactics potential of zeus mode flights very good aswell .... down sides the culture of the gamers some are there for trolling some are there to be serious and some are there just to have fun ... all dependent on the group and what ya make of it
18214,"Extremely unethical dlc practices. If you don't buy them, they are constantly on the right side of your screen and appear frequently in either THE ENTIRE FUCKING SCREEN or RIGHT OVER YOUR CROSSAIR AT ANY TIME(including during combat!!!)

edit: The game is great besides that"

18225,Like Gmod with guns
18226,Fun to play. The dlc vehicles and weapons are annoying though.
18227,"I'll be honest with you from the start. This game is not for everyone. If you want a game where you go on perfectly scripted missions, run around like a madman, and destroy enemies by the thousands, then this isn't the game for you. BUT if you enjoyed games like Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six and want to play a hardcore military simulation with one of the most brilliant communities in existence, then GET THIS GAME. ArmA 3 is demanding, but beautiful. The maps are insanely large. There are hundreds of weapons and vehicles to experiment with. The campaign is enjoyable, but also very difficult. The online community is full of helpful people who can help teach you the basics of the complicated systems. Then there's the mods. OH LORD the mods! Ever wanted to pit space marines from 40k against a Russian armored battalion? Now you can! The editor alone will provide you with hours of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this game.

18228,The game where uber tacticool virtual larping meets morally questioning acts. The mods just make it all the more believable.

18245,"Dear Diary;

Today I saw a Contact after spending twelve hours walking through the jungle. Someone else shot him, but, it was fun anyway.

10/10

"
18246,"Putin complicat asa la controale da doar putin, merge merge."
18247,"Very In-depth Mil-sim. With mods it can be even more in-depth. Like for goodness sake I installed a medical mod and now I feel like I need to go to medical school to understand what to do if my friend is having a heart attack. Luckily enough there is a cheat sheet I can use. Will definitely bring the cheat sheet into my next surgery operation if I have to do one in real life!
Good game.
Multiplayer is better than story-mode tho.
I have literally had so much fun just doing scenarios with my friends on Zeus."
18248,Very fun game

Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript

  
According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.

18262,  I have enjoyed Arma 3 so far. Have spend most of my time on multiplayer servers. Honestly haven't had to many issues with lag or performance issues. Although i have kept the mods to a min. All and all it is a lot of fun. servers can be toxic tho. Hopefully it gets even better as i try more mods.

18294,"If you like the realism aspect of war games then arma is for you, although be warned the realism factor makes the game hard too, it is kinda like the dark souls of tactical combat games.
While other war games try to make you feel euphoric, arma also manages to give you that strange feeling of gratitude that you are not actually there because people die in armed conflicts and sometimes you won't even know what hit you.
The engine has its limitations so some newer games sometimes may excel in some areas but to this day i have not seen anything that comes close to the overall feature package of arma, there are people who have spent hundreds of hours ingame and still haven't explored half of the functionality and possibilities. 
The mission editor is a (sometimes frustrating) beauty in itself and allows you to use the game as a virtual military sandbox."

18312,"I enjoyed ArmA 2 back in the day.  ArmA 3 is an incredible game and has quickly become my favorite.  It honestly took me a while to learn what the game was really about and what it was capable of.  There are many different ways to play this game.  Personally I enjoy the editor and creating my own scenarios, though I occasionally do multiplayer as well.  The editor has a slight learning curve and the scripting is probably something I just won't have time to learn unfortunately but as far as the capabilities in the editor it is quite impressive.  I really enjoy the fact that community members can create their own content, armed forces of real countries, vehicles, missions, maps.. and then publicize their work.  This is a very fun and interesting experience"

18359,The editor is a vicious cycle of: Have a cool idea > realize the AI can't do it > look up how to do it > realize you can't do anything cool without knowing how to code > give up.

>create a super in-depth mission to play with friends

Jokes aside ARMA 3 is by far the best tactical military shooter I've ever played. It's immersive, fun, can be play solo but is even more fun with friends, campaign is actually fun to play, many DLCs, endless replayability as every mission is different, open sandbox that depends on what you want to do. You couldn't wan anything else from a game like this, recommend 10/10."

The game time is usually long,  but in some single player scenarios you can save and exit.
Talking of scenario- the arma3 workshop is flooded with awesome scenarios, be it SP or MP, which add life and freshness to the game.

This is my first comment to any of the games I own. And I on Steam for a long time now. Also, if you wish to join me in the game, send a dm.

18424,"A hazy cloud of fog had slipped over the ground, condensing possible footsteps and tracks of the enemy army. Its the middle of the night, my team of over ten Spec Ops people were with me and were relying on me, not only to win this war, but save their life. We hear loud sounds nearby. [i] CRACK! [/i] A twig snaps. I order to ready fire but not to shoot. [i ]CRUNCH! [/i] It gets closer. A few seconds later its right by us. I order my men to fire. It attacks back, its not an enemy army after all, its a bear. The bear takes out two men and we manage to wound the bear. However our two soldiers' injuries are fatal. They tell us to go on and take out the enemy. We continue to walk for what seemed like an eternity. We eventually reach the enemy compound and notice that there are quite a few snipers on guard, if we don't sneak past them, its mission over. We slowly creep and crawl our way into the compound, silently taking out any people that might see us. We get to main vault room and prepare to extract the enemy plans, our mission all along. We get the safe open and steal the plans. An alarm goes off. We had set off an alarm. Enemy soldiers rush in to see what the commotion is. Its either kill or be killed. I order my men to shoot. However, because of our shock our men were a little bit slow to shoot, resulting in a mostly dead troop. Me and three other soldiers are left standing in a bloodbath of our former friends. The enemy starts to flank us from the other entrance. One of my men knows there is no way out, and he takes his life. Its just down to me and two other guys. The enemies throw in a grenade and it explodes, knocking both of my men unconscious. I immediately run to the nearest spot I can hide. The enemy grabs both of my men and pick them up, presumably to take the prisoner. The remaining enemy troops continue to search for me. I have to escape this compound or I die, but there was way too many enemy troops. I sacrifice my AK-47, throwing it as far as possible to create a distraction.   They quickly move towards the sound and I go as fast as I can to the nearest exit. I get away as far as possible from the compound. I make it to the nearby forest and camp there for the rest of the night. I set up camp and wait out the night, thinking about how I was most likely the only person that survived. The sun soon rises over the horizon and I start to head off back to station. It's moments like this that make ARMA great, no other game is this realistic in warfare, its amazing. The horrors of war are very accurately depicted in this game, and every mission, something is going to go wrong, there is no whizzing through ARMA. It may not be a perfect game, but still, ARMA is something special. You may see ARMA on sale all the time for 10 bucks or so, I recommend to pick it up, its worth that price. I do warn that you need a decent computer to run it though as it is [i] HEAVILY [/i]  CPU bound, however a decent computer with an i5 10400F or better could easily do the job."
18425,"the games core content already provides you with enough stuff to create and experience various different elements within the game, giving you almost limitless possibilities when playing.

18470,"admittedly its pretty scuffed when it comes to the actual mechanics in the game, but as a mil. sym. it does pretty well, and the ops are very enjoyable"
18471,this is a good game but can be glitchy or laggy sometimes

18477,get it rn best war crime sim evr!!!!!!!?!!?!?!!!!!!!!
18478,yesss great game but very complex do not  reccomend game for younger player not becuse of violance or anything just becuse it is very complex but if your child is very mature and smart buy it for him
18479,I peed
18480,its awesome
18481,"Great game, with the proper squad"
18482,"I love the game but what really makes this game great is the publishers. if it wasnt for them making mods, terrain,missions i probally wouldnt be so addicted. I highly recommened because of them."
18483,"Fuckin' sick that I can blow up churches with civis inside with an artillery order from miles away. I spend hours in eden editor looking for the best way to commit war crimes in the most realistic way possible. (my personal favourite is ordering predator drones or A-10's on civilian targets.)
10/10 recommend to anyone wanting to release any built up anger on the minority population of Altis... real stress reliever"
18484,yes
18485,pretty ok
18486,you can get 1000 plus hours of enjoyment in this game
18487,I love the game and have since it came out! I still get excited just thinking of turning this realistic game on and starting a campaign in many different Mods. Always a great experience every single time I play!

18493,100% worth it very fun vehicle
18494,"This is simply one of my favorite games to play. It is a realistic military simulator that strives to put you in the most immersive situations possible. While that can turn people away from this game, I personally love this, and the fact that a lot of the glitches and bugs in Arma II have been mostly remedied here. There are some lingering one though, which is to be expected from games this large.

I enjoyed the story, and it's there is plenty to do. The main bounty of the game is the fun you can have in multiplayer situations if you have buddies that enjoy the same games as you! The multiplayer base is alive and well here, and not shut down like Arma II. Not to mention, with mods like DayZ, there is literally endless amounts of fun to be had here.

Some problems I have with this, is that the DLC are expensive. The controls to this game are super confusing for new players, and there is hardly much int he way of help in terms of tutorials in the actual game. I had to turn to YouTube when I started playing this series. Another issue people may not like is the optimization. Sometimes, you will have lag, and it won't always be your fault, but a lot of the problems with optimization have been fixed over time as the game has gotten older.

It is not a perfect game, but I hold it dear to me, and would recommend it to anyone.. but the thing to understand is that it is not for everyone. You have to be pretty patient while you learn the controls, as they can be a bit complicated. Once you get past the learning curve, you should be fine. 8/10"
18495,Arma 3 is like an old bmw. Their engine is always broken
18496,"Fantastic single player campaign. Very similar to the original Operation Flashpoint but with updated graphics. There may be some sort of multiplayer mode but nobody plays it - definitely don't get this game for the multiplayer - this is primarily a single player campaign, and some scenarios you can also play."
18497,I would say Arma 3 is a brilliant game and with mods you can't find any game that could challenge you and your friends like Arma 3. I also recommend you guys to try Arma 3 skenario called Antistasi Altis Community version. You can also play antistasi skenario in Finland by trying out Antistasi Virolahti and with RHS mods it is one of the top skenarios.
18498,R8 good it is
18499,"lot of fun, challenging, realistic"
18500,If you want to shoot things play any other game

I promise those Iranian kids had guns."
18509,This gamer is is.... yes
18510,great
18511,YES!
18512,"Great game, I had a lot of fun on multiplayer servers since everyone talks. Friendly community, Helped me out as a beginner, and had a ton of fun in the editor."
18513,"It's a nice MilSim, alittle buggy, and much better with certain mods, but generally well done. I am probably not going to recommend it to anyone who doesn't like MilSims but generally it's more of a simulator and less of a game; and by that I mean it uses basically realistic (depending on mods like ace 3 - which enhances realism) weapons, vehicles, and tools to get the job done. Things are complicated (especially controls) but if you can get past that it's a nice simulator; still it's DLC Heavy and if you want to give it a pass in favor of something more ""Arcade"" I wouldn't blame you."
18514,"This game would be a joke without the mods. There is so much high qullity user made content they should honestly add all of it to the base game. Even if this game is a buggy flaming hot cow shit of a game sometimes and its frustratingly hard for server owners to fix shit. I still love it and have dedicated the last 6 years of my life playing this thing and have had so many fond memory's with the boys, cant wait for arma 4"

18520,"Do you enjoy gritty realism that sees you crawling through a jungle for 2 hours only to get mowed down my an MG emplacement you never saw? Yes? Welcome to Arma, you masochist!

While the game does contain a large variety of entertaining single-player campaigns, where Arma REALLY shines is when HALO jumping into the middle of an enemy position with a squad of your buddies on your six."
18521,"Is nice 
Is also useless without mods or friends 
Singleplayer exists but its not my thing"
18522,i would recommend the game it is pretty fun very confusing to learn though but overall very fun
18523,"heh, war crimes go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
18524,Best game ever.
18525,pretty good
18526,"Very good Sim Army Game, You just need a decent PC to get good FPS"
18527,Arma 3's main strength is that its built as a sandbox game. It has almost infinite posibillites in mission types that are playable meaning that theres always a game type for you. Along with this Zeus missions allow for multiplayer missions that will be different every time you play. Despite the time this game has been released it is not a very well optimized game and still has some continuous bugs. Still well worth the full price
18528,The best military simulator
18529,just ok
18530,"[h1] Game in general is awesome! [/h1] 

BUT, its not really game like casual BF or COD where you jump in and after of few hours you are rolling around with top tier (meta/OP) full decked out stuff and just HS-int/360/no scope/blind shot/jump shot. And tanking like half of mag with 5.45x39 mm or surviving 2-3 shots of fucking 7.62x51 mm! Mega 1 m jump in height and 3 m in distance. I can continue this list of casual stuffs but will not. Because reason you are reading this review, you are interested in ARMA 3, or at last you found something interesting for yourself (FREEDOM of imagination: vehicles, aviation, weapons, attachments, customization of character and so on... (i am too lazy to think some thing more, but I am sure somewhere, someone can achieve something in this game and share with others)).
For me, I finally found something where I can put [b] A LOT OF HOURS [/b] 
[spoiler] (thanks to Battlefield 4, I f****** enjoy piloting helicopters (Little Bird to be more specific)) [/spoiler]  and still HAVING FUN + endless quantity of mods [b] GUARANTEE [/b] your enjoyment (only if you are interested in MilSim's or HC FPS with vehicles on [b] GIGANTIC BATTLEGROUNDS [/b]). Me personally, I found a reason to have really powerful PC, just to be able enjoy in this game at FINEST. 
The only con for me is the optimization. [u] Low FPS and FPS drops is part of the game. [/u] 

Edit: I tried before, but did not enjoy since I had weak CPU, no SSD and I played more casual stuffs which ones were in trending. But after some time I realized, that HC FPS is my cup of tea. Insurgency (Source version) showed me that being tactical, precise/accurate pays off, a couple of bullets is enough to kill, optics and bipod is an amazing thing and iron sight is totally enough. And after this I tried EFT. Oooooh boooy.... I really shouldn't. Spent ~2k hours and completed a few times (had ridiculous amount of Rubles and top inventory full of HIGH LVL STUFFS). Of course I abused some game's *flaws/gaps* (2 of them are still relevant and useful (R.I.P. Nikita Buyanov's and BSG Team's hard work of fixing and balancing)).

After some time, in future I gonna add some more info's about my progress and thoughts in general.

EDIT: 
A lot of violence and gore. Do not support it and against of them. The idea of killing and murdering people just because you are supporting someone idea and following orders. It is an awful thing and you should be ashamed. But everything comes with realization and experience. 
In general games and especially like this one are bad for mental health and conscientious."

18538,Very good.
18539,"Arma 3 is a very interesting game
As a Mil-Sim, it isn't your run of the mill shooters and has some interesting game play loops.
That being said, it is near required to play with a group as just hopping into a server doesn't always lead to the most fun games.
It's an acquired taste but it's far from a bad game.

Rinse and Repeat. 

It's a jogging simulator.

There's tons of mods for this game, most of which are better than the original, really probably the only reason i'm thumbing up."

18570,"The game has some pretty good mechanics overall, the design of the game is pretty good and it feels realistic instead of some war games that are meant to be ""realistic"" but restrict your gameplay pretty much, but in this game there's no such thing you can call that to. 

About the details you can play with anything you want, there are more then 30 weapon and a lot of different equipment.

Overall my average score of the game would be a 8/10 since it has some bugs and sometimes frame drops can happen but these won't effect my idea about the game pretty much. I recommend it to anyone who likes realistic style war games."
18571,"I love it. Infinitely moddable.

18585,good
18586,"Tough to say, and different Players would have different things to look out for.
New to the Franchise? Then I do not recommend this to you simply on the basis that it's more a Simulator than a Game.
Story: Good, and funny in parts (CONTACT DLC)
Progression: Difficult to know what Objective is current and next as details can be extremely vague
Controls: A MESS*

*For those who use a Controller, neither DS4 or XBOX Controllers work as expected for this game. The worst part is that it's tricky to Map, and you can't map every function to the Keys you'd expect. Sure, some Logic's port over, L2 and R2, Aim and Fire. However, some do not, for example the Crouch and Prone are handled by two different buttons instead of just one. Some keys appear to be without any Mapping by default, and remapping manually is absolute chaos.

For those familiar with the Franchise and used to using the Keyboard and Mouse, it works I think. I'm not a K&M Player, I really don't find that relaxing. I just spent 5 Hours on a Mission that should have only taken two Hours. NPC Aiming can be adjusted thankfully, but even on Novice, they one-shot me in a blink. It should be noted that trying to see anything is rather tricky even with a Scope. I'll be honest, I am just a Casual type.

I partially knew what I was in for, but the Control System is just absolute chaos and needs addressing. Insanely difficult for new Players to get into the game."
18587,Yes

18600,"I'm Not very good at arma, Or any realistic shooter really. But arma 3 is one of the best games I've ever played, hands down. It can be whatever you want it to be. It's incredibly fun with friends but you can play it alone or join a group. Like Fuck knows [FK], They're pretty cool.
Just 3 notes, 1 is Install ace and raise the stamina as Base arma 3 stamina is godawful and honestly it's a disappointment to its family and friends.

2, Don't play altis life, It's really bad. Unless you want to.

And finally, Try to get it all in the bundle while it's on sale, Lots of servers use things from Apex, The vehicle DLCs and Possibly even contact. But some use laws of war, marksman and even Karts."

18646,At time of review I've barely played the game but it is a really good game with an amazing community. I joined a semi-casual company to play online with and I will admit they are the least toxic gaming community i have ever encountered. I was on my first op with no training but the controls are easy to master and really easy to change to suit the individual. The mods are also really good if you want more realism and a better experience for you as an individual. Overall great game and I really recommend it to anyone considering buying as it's absolutely worth every penny

Its also a good comedy game for example placing AI on roofs in teams they will procede to kill them self by walking of the edge. And ordering troops via zeus to get into a tank that they were not previously part of makes them do circles for an eternity.

Ive also encountered a tank group that got demobilised and the leader kept ordering ""Get in that tank"" followed by a response of ""negative"" and then repeat that for about 8 minutes before they got neutralised."

18665,"ArmA III Is one of those games that has been with me since my transition to PC gaming. Over many years from Mod to Mod and server to server, ArmA III and the ArmA franchise as a whole, has earned a special place in my library and a Special place in my adolescent years. 

It's this franchise, along side other games that have filled my childhood, that have given me the distraction I needed to get to where I am. As we celebrate the near announcement of ArmA IV, I will continue to play this game until its replacement. 

__________________________

ArmA is a military sim that literally can be a Military sim, if you want it to be, or literally anything else you want it to be because of the outstanding modding community that have kept this game alive for years. For anyone thinking about this game, I truly recommend it to you and your friends. You will enjoy yourself no mater what game mode you play."
18666,trdghbasedtgdsfg
18667,"I have heard that in Arma 4, you will be forced to sustain yourself on nothing but MRE's in real life or the game will detect useless ""human"" traits like ""happiness"" and ""joy"" and automatically lock you out for being a ""filthy traitor""

This game has the most confusing input mapping i have ever heard, you require a pilots license just to turn off your damn laser.

You would think Zeus is awesome fun but actually, that guy you always watch playing that on Youtube has a giant circle of ARMA addicted friends that make it fun. If you have no friends at all, like me, this game is pretty stupid, because you can never see any of the AI soldiers, and they kill you further than the coolest battlefield 4 helicopter sniper trickshots you have ever seen.

The most fun i have had in this game is refusing to ""behave"" during the debriefing, but i always get kicked if i try to enjoy myself.

Not sure how to rate this game, all it shows is that the real army i would probably get court marshalled for yelling ""poopoo"" at the colonel."
18668,Absolutely amazing community. The game begins when you finish the standard game and discover the community mods and MMO features it has everything from fantasy mods to GTA style worlds and even alien invasion scenarios. not enough? it has a feature where a group can develop scenarios via a game master in real-time. the possibilities are limited only by your imagination.

18675,nice
18676,"Arma 3 is a Military Simulator sandbox first and foremost, making it an incredibly versatile platform for large scale multiplayer warfare. Mods make this game great, with total conversions allowing you to make the most of the engine to play in settings such as WW2, Vietnam, Cold War Europe, 40k, Halo and so many more. Join a couple groups to play with and you'll find some of the best gaming experiences on PC. 

However, despite all this, Arma 3 as a GAME is an incredibly flawed one, with too many bugs to mention and poor optimisation across the board. Use Arma 3 with caution, as a platform, not as a game."
18677,This is a very good game with unlimited potential. Between the workshop and the 3d editor along with dlc if ya wanna play on multiplayer with random players. and workshop mods of all eras modern ww2 vietnam cold war and if i remember correctly a world war 1 mod
18678,"After nearly a year of experience and 1000h in this game, I want to say that it is still one of the best sandbox shooters on the market. Ofc, it is an old horse, but it packs a punch for sure. Unlimited amount of mods that will satisfy even the most picky player, large amount of DLCs, and the best ingame editor that I've ever seen.

My recommendation is to play with friends, solo can get hard and boring real quick.

2021, still worth it."

18688,"Its perfect for people wanting a wonderful milsim game for almost anything. Whether its normal, star wars, 40k or pretty much anything as long as you install mods. The base game is okay and still can be very fun so if you dont feel like installing mods you can still have tons of fun. It just takes getting used to the people and how they work and if you have a good group of friends whether they like to mess around or be serious nonetheless it'll still be an amazing experience. Although having mods can turn the game into whatever your heart desires and I recommend it. It's fun however you take it."
18689,it do be good
18690,very realistic i give it 68%poops and 83%cocks
18691,dont waste your money on this until either battleye fixes its borderline malicious anti-cheat or until this game gets better anti-cheat. hours of my life wasted trying to get this garbage to run without blue screen.

After 1 week i found out i already had 100 hours on the game which was crazy. DLCs are like mostly cheap except for Apex which im not even sure if its worth the cash although I must say it adds lots of content. I recommend getting the antistasi scenario on the workshop and playing it with around 4-6 friends. Its fun."

Was sad to see gamespy servers shutdown in Arma 2(loved ChernoLife) and seeing the Island Life community die off in Arma 2 OA.

I would say in Arma 2 and Arma 2OA did it have the best life/rp servers, Altis Life in arma 3 is generally toxic which is horrible to see. But on other servers like KoTH(King of the Hill), Insuregency, Overthrow, Vindicta, and Antistasi are a great play."

18718,"The game itself is great, it's the issues with multiplayer that will kill it. Namely the UPnP error that many players get. I've payed nearly 25 euros to play this game- resolve this issue for f*ck's sake!!! And yes, I've read about the router settings and guess what- my router is shared, it's not mine so I cannot tweak them. I've tried all the other suggestions (firewall exceptions etc.) as well.

Honestly, use a torrent tracker and download it for free- it's not worth the money at the moment."

18743,Its ok
18744,game is terrible
18745,"A game that is big on realism, long list of equipment (from handguns to main battle tanks) including weapon attachments, night vision et cetera, et cetera. The main campaign is interesting, and there is a definite learning curve. The DLCs are good, overall, and most of them add something to the experience. Laws of War, especially, provided a very interesting take on the effect of warfare on innocent bystanders.

And once you have tried the game, why not jump down the rabbit hole of mods, public servers and milsim. This game has one of the most prolific communities ever seen. Even though the game is set in the future, there are mods that add all manner of contemporary military equipment from World War 1 up to modern day (including things like destroyers, submarines and even spy satellites). 

10/10 will play in the next pandemic."
18746,its a great game even if its old
18747,Really fun game to play with a GROUP of friends
18748,Great game if you are fine with running an average of 30-50 fps while in combat
18749,"After many, many, many hours in Altis life and that part of the game I can always return with mods or base game. what really makes me come back time and time is playing with friends either in milsims or things like that. 10/10 would recommend from making friends in Altis life to seeing new mods"

18760,is good
18761,Great Game! Hundreds of playable hours worth of content with a great community!

18763,"ARMA always was a Series hard to describe and hard too say if its bad or good. For me personally, the postiives outweight the negatvies by far,
It is advertised as an Military-Sandbox-Combat-Simulation. But its far more, actually.

Its the game thats for everyon but not for everyone.
Why? You can have playmodes that are for every taste. BUT You definilty need Several dozen hours to get atleast the basics of the Controls and Tactics.
Also, when you want to play it with Mods and in Multiplayer you need to know:
You WILL have Performance issues - Your FPS are dependant of the FPS of the Host/Server you play on!
You WILL have bugs and crashes. (But atleast on the server of my Group its runs mostly good).

In the Mulitplayer, you can really play every Mode that Modders can imagine. From Milsim too Roleplaying ala GTA Online everything is possibly.
Or just the Vanilla Experience, that is already fun too. I recommend this, before you go into the rabbit hole that are Arma 3 Mods.
There is a reason that most highly Popular Multiplayer Trends like Zombie Survival (Day-Z) and Battle Royale have there Origins in the ARMA Series.
Multiplayer is variable, complex, overly complicated, sometimes unreliable and Fun. When it comes to Combat I had the most intense Battles in every Shooter-Like game ever with my Group in Coop Missions.

The Singleplayer

... on the over hand. Well, the main Campaign is by far the weakest of the series. Its not exactly bad but the Story is just not engaging, the Characteres are bland or just a Satire. The Missiondesign is often okayish, but often just not ... Good. Also the entire Scenario doesn't quite use the potential creativity they had with the near-Future Setting. (If Arma 4 takes much longer, Arma 3 will be actually Alternative Reality.).
Then there are the DLC's. I haven't played them all until today. But aside from Apex (DON'T. PLAY. THIS. CAMPAIGN. ITS BORING AS FUCK, and feels more like a COD without the cinematic atmosphere...)
But The DLC'S I played so far: Contact, Laws of War, and Tanks. All three I highly enjoyed they all had a good written Story and were just fun and engaging.
Especially Contact. If you liked STALKER, you will love this DLC. Its Atmosphere and Story are just really good written. Might be the Best Story in the entire Arma series.


So... but who should try Arma 3?

Well let me say it easier:
Who Shouldn't:
- IF you can't live with FPS below the 60 Mark
- If you despise overly complicated and not good designed Controls
- If you want to play Singleplayer but don't want to buy DLC's like...ever
- If you get Bored after 10-15 Min of nothing happening
- If you get bored when not every minute something explodes. (Well this CAN happen in Arma too... but than something 
  has gone horribly wrong)
- If You want to Run as fast as Sonic, Stomp da Gitz like in Doom, or can't live without regenerating Health - this game isn't 
   for you

Everybody else should inform himself if he can find a Gamemode that he likes and just try it.

18769,Its a Meme Simulator. Just buy it...
18770,Much more realistic and strategic than other shooters. I like being able to control my team and where they go as well as what they can do. Mods offer all kinds of great gameplay aside from what the base game comes with. I feel like there is always something you can be doing in this game. Graphics and gameplay are awesome. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys tactical shooters and team based games.

Cod and other FPS's get boring after the 15th iteration. But Aram never gets boring. There‚Äôs just so much god damn content from both the devs and the modding community that going through it all would take literal years of playtime. And on top of that, the game receives updates and new content all the time. There‚Äôs just so much to do and it‚Äôs all amazing. The campaign alone took me about 8 hours and all the dlc‚Äôs take about 3 hours each. The game has a steep learning curve and a high price of entry, but it‚Äôs so worth it. If you have the money and the time, buy Arma. You‚Äôll get your money's worth."

18860,"not a bad movie, 6.5/7"
18861,"Have played all the games in this series and definetely recommend Arma 3. It is the best Combat Sim out there but here is a few pro's and con's:

Pro:
- The editor lets you set up any situation and most things are possible thanks to various units, triggers, modules etc. as well as the possibility of scripting for more advanced users.
- Huge maps makes it possible to play scenarios by land, sea and air.
- There is a ton of community content as well as DLC's to make the game replayable. 
- The story lines are quite good and entertaining.

Con:
- Controlling the AI can be frustrating as they have problems with pathfinding, keeping formations etc. which has been a problem since the very first game.
- Cinematics in the game are horrible and look like something from the 90's as videos for cut scenes etc. are made with the editor. It makes the making of cut scenes available to everyone but also gives a bad impression of the game. 
- It can be hard for players without programming skills and/or a lot of time on their hands to get into mission making etc. because a certain level of scripting is required for making all but the simplest missions. Arma 3 is way more accessible than the previous games in that aspect, however. 

All in all, this is a great game if you're interested in a non-linear combat sim where you can create your own scenarios."
18862,very guud

18891,good and bad so it is good for me and to 5 play
18892,The game has a fair amounts of glitch and other issues but overall its a really fun game
18893,"Not worth 39.99 at all. you can get better games for cheap.
"
18894,Good game to try after playing many arcade games.
18895,LeL
18896,"just, just dont buy this game, its not worth it."
18897,FUN
18898,fun with friends
18899,This game is great! The sandbox and story is amazing. The multiplayer is so fun to do mission and play King of the Hill
18900,bang. dead. restart. repeat
18901,awsome
18902,nice game with mods good mods
18903,"I'm not mad, just disappointed."
18904,game badd cannot stop the playing
18905,"......
"
18906,"Fantastic game but I must give it a dislike due to the ridiculously high amount of different key bindings. On PC you will have some issues if your computer does not have a number pad and even the default control scheme has key conflicts. 

Aside from that I would recommend getting this game, but only when it is on sale."
18907,"Is a good game if, and only if, you are playing with workshop content. The base game is overcomplicated and poorly optimized, but multiplayer is really fun."
18908,its overall hard and extremly hard to get into lobbys with friends.
18909,just got arma'd. figured i'd write a review
18910,"This game is very fun both on foot and when zeusing, there are a few other game modes but that isn't really as fun as the zeus improv gamemode where a player  creates missions for other players and can spawn in enemies on the fly which creates a bit of a challenge for the player base in the server, though there isn't too many people who play the zeus gamemode which makes it pretty limiting on what you can do and the dlcs have things that should be in the base game like Marksmen which has a few guns, enhancement of gameplay, better sounds, and ect which should be in the game instead of being a dlc, they make every change a dlc which is making them money but having assets like guns and some armor in the regular base game which is very lacking in armor and guns if you don't have dlc (which i don't because i just like playing) 

this game is a must play if you are starting out on steam as it's a very fun game with the dumb stuff and communications that tend to be around

note: if you don't get the dlcs you are called poor because some of the player base are dicks but other than that the game is perfect"
18911,I have PTSD Now
18912,I suppose it's okay
18913,"well first: this is a solid game it doesnt chrash (an awfull lot but i have a crappy pc so yeh)
and second: the amount of stuff you can do is seemingly endless (all thanks to to an good editor)
thrid: it doesnt look bad it looks good for an early 2010 game
fouth: so many mods 
fifth: if you have the money to spare you wont regret playing it"
18914,"the best millitairy simulator i have ever played, many mods that lets experience the game in diffrent settings and maps.
plenty of multiplayer servers so there is someting for everyone!
combat is good without mods, but when you have ACE installed the game just gets a whole lot better and way more realistic.

i personaly played lots of vindicta and antistasi with my friends on a dedicated server. in my oppinion the best senario mods out there.

i give this game a 9/10"
18915,"If you have the time, you will appreciate the detail."
18916,gud game
18917,lol you buy a 35 ‚Ç¨ game and then it says you have to buy many many many DLCs before i can play. What a shit game never playing it again go fuck yourself arma you suck and it is very boring.
18918,yse
18919,"Pros:
+ Overall very high level of realism
+ Map editor that allows to make various scenarios
+ Nice graphics
+ Massive amount of mods
+ Costs only 35$

Cons:
- More bugs than you can count
- Lot of overpriced DLCs
- Small amount of base content
- Only three maps, that look the same and are made of same assets
- Small variety of equipment
- Very bad optimization / performance
- In-game server hosting doesn't work
- 2.0 Update...
- Laughable AI
- Cannot host game using ingame systems. Have to pay for online hosting to play with friends.
- Several aspects of this game have quality of a cheap free-to-play title."
18920,Arma 3 is the best game ever created
18921,controls are way too complicated
18922,"It's ok, I guess."
18923,"Honestly, don't much care for ARMA 3 itself.
But, Antistasi and DayZ are where it's at boi!

Making your own little guerilla faction to topple NATO and Russian forces.
Such fun!
It's just unfortunate that the AI has the most ridiculous aimbot I've ever seen in a game.
Still... much fun was had!
Even if the engine is pretty... unoptimised and buggy."
18924,Best sandbox and realism experience ever!!! Love itt :)
18925,no
18926,I've sat for over 10 hours in a single bush. 12-0! I'm a champion. 10/10 would recommend.
18927,Arma + Community = Make the game you always wanted.
18928,the best
18929,mmm yea it gud
18930,very radical
18931,it is a vary good game if you know what you are doing
18932,I really enjoy Arma 3. I find it to very fun.
18933,trash dont buy waste of 40 bucks games for queers
18934,cool game
18935,"The story was nice, multiplayer is fun, sandbox editor is awesome. Tons of mods to transform your game too! You could play in 2035 in vanilla, the modern age (21st century), cold war, vietnam war, world war 2, etc. Definitely check it out!"
18936,No.
18937,"Great game, love the sceanrio creation tools!"
18938,its cool or whateva
18939,Big Sexy
18940,"It has taken me a year or so to get the right equipment to be able to play this game without stutters at max settings, but let me tell you, it has definitly been worth it. This game is LITTERALLY one of my favorites."
18941,I think I may have learned half the buttons. But its a tough bet.
18942,Requires the all the DLCs to use most guns.
18943,This game has always been the greatest
18944,its pretty good ngl
18945,"the best
"
18946,Better than squad. Arma is better bc you can build your own battle scenario.
18947,A Giant Military Sandbox! Buy Buy Buy
18948,"I had a blast with this and its not limited to one thing despite what you might hear. 

Cant wait for Arma 4 to annihilate my RTX 3090 :)"

18954,great game
18955,I'd give it the full inch. 1/1
18956,Most realistic battle game I've ever played - incredible!
18957,Can i even play this game without ANY dlc!??!! this is ridiculous i cant even join a server . -100
18958,Shit game
18959,This is a great game.  This series has been my favorite ever since Operation Flashpoint.  I hope the developers keep up the great work!
18960,5632
18961,le epic warcrimes :)
18962,Only way to describe Arma 3 is brilliant. Just insane how many things you can create and do within 1 game. Highly recommend you spend the money even if you don't buy any DLC content you will still get a lifetime of enjoyment out of this game.
18963,Fucking shite all my homies hate Arma
18964,Great experience a man named Tod ate my ass in kavala for atleast 4 hours best game ever made 10/10 would recommend this super realistic game with the most realistic physics i any game ever seen super real.
18965,Is good innit
18966,"the game isn't very good. it's just something you play because your friends play it.

edit: its actually ok"
18967,sexy game
18968,I wont know any of the controls til hour 2000
18969,"It takes a certain type of person to enjoy Arma, but if you find the right group of people there's so much fun stuff you can do."
18970,ah yes nothin like the fresh smell of several war crimes in the mornin
18971,Unoptimized as hell but hey atleast I can shoot and pretend to be a real soldier.
18972,gud
18973,"Played it for a bit, it's alright."
18974,"haha, abrams go boom"
18975,"base game is great, DLC makes it more fun and more things to use
workshop is a godsend for AFTER the base game, where you can kick it up to 11, and break the knob off

always plenty to do, will keep you engaged well into the 100+ hours played and even into the 1000hrs played"
18976,"Its an awesome open-realistic-buggy-glitchy-milsim-fps-tps-hardcore-driving- game, btw you wont be able to run the game above 30 fps often as it has alot to load, overall its worth it, or wait till a sale."
18977,nice game with friends
18978,"yes
"
18979,"great game, hard to play at first"
18980,Good game

Comment: Fun but idk, it lacks something even though i still recommend the game"
18988,Good Game Its Like Arma 2 But Not
18989,"Its probably worth the time to download all the DLC's and what not but having to do that just takes away a lot from the game. I can barely find a online multiplayer server to play on cause I'm ""Missing files/mods"" required by the server. This would have been such a great game otherwise. Dissapointing"
18990,cool game
18991,such a great game
18992,Provides a realistic view on combat
18993,YEET
18994,"im shit at the game but i enjoy it :)
"
18995,Very good Milsim for anyone who loves very real like military games.
18996,Ukraine Simulator
18997,Phenomenal game! The game itself has a lot of single and multiplayer content and the community is incredible. There are an infinite amount of mods available to tailor the game to you or your community's desire.
18998,"good game, the game is good."
18999,"Finally the fps ive been looking for. Keeps track of every round in every mag. Calculates trajectory and penetration with some terminal ballistics in play. You have to zero your optics. Get waaay far away from claymores when you place them. Also brings fear of dying (in game) because there is no auto respawn close by. You either have to hoof it out or get a 10 minute ride from base from a real human pilot. No CS or CoD tactics here. No jumping headshots with dual deagles. Real team guys using real team tactics is mandatory. Combat from all sides at all ranges is the norm in every situation. If youre bored of linear fps, this is your game. Most Epic!"
19000,Its fun
19001,Sick game
19002,"Don't download too many mods, you'll never be able to uninstall them after"
19003,Gud
19004,lynx go kaboom

19007,"So I was taking my third bath this decade today and I was feeling pretty horny and didn't want to wait to get out the bath, do I decided ""well, no one is around so I might as well do a quick one"" so yeah I did a quick one and my cum formed like fucking opaque bubbles, that shit was the coolest science experience ever dude they were all floaty and squishy to the touch and I just had a blast playing with them for like 5 seconds then I decided to exit the bath and clean myself off. The cum bubbles don't dissolve. THEY DON'T FUCKING DISSOLVE. So here I am sitting outside my bath waiting for it to drain so I can wipe away my soggy cum bubble remains in hopes that none of my family come to check on me

"
19008,"After playing this game for a while I think I'm starting to understand it a bit. Not sure if to recommend just yet, need to play a bit more to to get the hang of it."
19009,"Fantastic sandbox game for military simulation.  It doesn't have the ""prettiest"" graphics and sometimes the AI can be a bit wonky, but that's because the game is so open.  The real jewel of Arma3 is the community depth and the number of custom missions.  Think more ""D&D / Tabletop for FPS military sim"" than ""this is a military themed shooter""."
19010,Yea... decent game boiz.
19011,cool game
19012,Pretty good game. Would play again. 10/10
19013,realistic and fun as hell
19014,"I like how it is customizable but i don't like that even in version 3 vehicles still have problems with flying all over the place, and i definitely don't like most of the community (like people that runs their clans like a fantasy military unit wtf i come here to have fun not to listen to Privates who couldn't get a promotion irl or issent old enough to enlist yet and believe its the way to go, if people can't be serious when you play they shouldn't be there in first place and if they were old enough and could get a promotion then they have to realise that this isn't the army its a game for pete's sake, take a chill pill , cooperate and have fun).
I don't like all the radio/comms mods that everyone insist on using i was in the army 14 year and i never experienced all the problems and trouble that happen in arma 3 even with the older (ww2 vintage) radios that were originally made in 1935 and used in taxis in chicago.
There also is always trouble with Mods not updating or connecting to each/other.

So yes i like the game but the environment is bad as in way to many immature people trying to relive/experience what they believe is the military experience and have no clue or have a clue and can't relax.
Treat people the way you want to be treated yourself and respect others' opinions and just because they don't always agree with you they are not your enemy until they become hostile."
19015,Arma 3 is the best Military simulation game ive ever played
19016,is gud
19017,What Nasa uses for simulations
19018,proper game
19019,e
19020,"Most realistic military simulator i've played, slow paced and tactical, great game. Only issue is the amount of DLC you pretty much need to be able to drive certain vehicles, but apart from that it's a great game"

19040,You like explosion! Gud game for you comrade!
19041,"I'm sure the game is fun if you have friends to play with, but even after doing the prologue I was still confused on controls, I found myself googling the controls and a few minutes later googling again, if you have someone to play with I would suggest this game, but not if you are playing by yourself."

19057,good
19058,"Solid copy lima charlie dexter jettster piccolo 5-1 we have eyes on richard nixon, requesting immediate fettucine support, how copy chimpanzee 3, over?

Good game"
19059,"Excellent game for Multiplayer with biggest realism in military combat. Once you play this, you will never play COD, MOH, War Thunder, World of Tanks, World of Ships, Battlefield or other."
19060,shot woman in face
19061,where do we start with ArmA 3 well first is dont expect a glitchless game arma is know for some pretty glitchy and bullshit things happening without any real cause example say you shoot an AI and it dies then you get shot after looting the area or moving on and you see the one who killed you was the guy you just shot this i rare but i can happen but with a few mods you can turn a good shooter and milisim such are arma into proberly the best milisim you can get weather you want to turn it into a warhammer 40k fps or a star wars one for even just dick about or lead a resitance theirs mods out there you make your perfect milisim
19062,Give me that arma 4 man c'mon
19063,"Terrifying, difficult, sometimes very clunky but still very fun.  Solo/Coop missions are better on mods than base game though."
19064,Heli go brr
19065,"good game, realistic"
19066,oh god plz halp
19067,"got thretened alot, almost got stolen by the poliza but otherdan that ez life ngl"
19068,"Great game, some minor bugs. Need arma 4."
19069,I got this game to play but I'm lonely and singleplayer costs money (why)
19070,"Good game, needs optimization badly"
19071,Boom boom military shooter veri nice
19072,"Super fun, difficult tactical mil sim game. Fun to learn and tons of mods to install and play. Highly reccommend"
19073,"Arma is now my new #1 favourite shooter.
you can play arma however you want. It can be a survival game like rust, shooter like COD or battlefield, openworld like gta with mods support.
but the game mode i liked the most is Invade and Annex which as per my opinion is the way arma should be played because of its realism.
Arma showed me horrors of war and how messed up loosing a squad mate can be.
it taught me how difficult it is to ride a aircraft or a tank and how hard it is to snipe a target at range. Having team mates that specialize in different role can make stuff and things easier.
sometimes this does not even feel like a game it is not a kill focused game like CSGO and COD this is where your teamplay, skills and coordination will be tested.
i like how the game community is trying its best to make it more realistic day by day and how the tides of war keep switching so no mission ever turns out the same way whitch further provides near endless playability. One simple mistake can negate your 30 min preparation and mission deplyment phase if you are not paying attention.
Do remember arma 3 is not your pick up and play kind of game it is like a skill that you will get you use to by practice/training and time.

there is so much more that arma has to offer that i can express in a review.

Welcome to the Dark Souls equivalent of Shooter games
See you in Arma
 Peace out"
19074,"aside from the few arma bugs this game is great granted its starting to die down  a bit. plenty of servers plenty of random missions, and such but overall player base is falling off."
19075,"its one of the best milsim games ive played in years and for that ill recommend for others
"
19076,Great details in ANY role you choose. Massive.
19077,"Definite must buy for military nerds like me, even if you just spent all the time of the game messing around with the editor. 

Tip: Download all the RHS escalation mods in Steam Workshop, its significantly worth more than buying all the official DLCs."
19078,"great millitary game 
"
19079,"The Game is really good i love it alot but i wish the game have more optimization,alot of time in a huge firefight the fps is just low. i hope bohemia still support this game"
19080,fun

edit: i completed it"
19082,"the game has very few bugs if any at all the mods on the community page are all beautiful and work great and the game is outstandingly beautiful 10/10

19083,barely any keybinds you can change im disappointed
19084,This game gay
19085,"Been playing it for years, and I'll continue to do so, even for a while after Arma 4 comes out. This game is a beautifully crafted masterpiece, and although it suffers from optimisation issues, the devs actively improve the game's performance and are communicating with the player base. Would most definitely reccoment!"

19103,good game !!!
19104,I've played this game 30 hours in the last 2 days and I absolutely love the game. I spend most of my time in the eden editor build new scenarios and it's pretty fun. It definitely takes some practice to learn the controls but I'm telling you it's worth it. i can't really say much about the campaign though haven't really played that.
19105,Play this
19106,"Of course - after some hours the short version:
If you like realisitc warfare simulation - take this, for sure!
If you like FPS, PVP etc. - go away!

The long version:

- The Gameplay
ArmA really is not a Shooter, it is not a Battle Royale, or a ""war game"" ... it is a warfare simulation. Out of the box you will get big maps, many equipment, and nice campaigns. Together wit addons/workshops, just to name ""ACE"" you will get the real thing. After decades of gaming it is the first real game where you can feel the impact of balistic, the speed of sound, the nightmare of combats. You will need to adjust your weapon sights based on the distance to your enemy, you need to hold breath or cool down to perfect hit your target. You have to move wisely.
There are so much functions to reload, to unjam weapons, to hide by smoke grenades, to use tanks, helicopters, airplanes, ships... You can play as a Seal with rebreather and dual-purpose rifle which could fire under water. There are radio-addons (to name TFAR - Task Force Arma Radio) with 3D audio and real radio-communication.

- The AI 
It's a dream. They will counter-attack your position from different directions. They will use cover fire ... they also get affected by your cover fire. They won't see you if you lay down without motion. You can be stealthy... they will take some time to spot you if you use silenced weapons. They will hide, they will run... and they will heal themselves - if they have a medipack.

- The Environment
There is a very realistiv physics engine which will enable you to shoot through walls if you have the right caliber, angle of impact and wall material. You will recognize rebounding bullets from walls, stones and hard materials based on angle of attack. The gras will be flatten if you crouch or drive through or if you start with an helicopter.

Too much to mention ... if you have read until here ... buy it ;)

At least, even after so many years, the Developer Bohemia interactive will support this ""platform"". The community is also so huge and you will get so many mods, workshops, addons, missions, weapons, cars ... and so on."

19115,"Great game if you are in to mil sim, a good community as well. The editor is also fun to mess around with. Only problem is it isn't very well optimised and some servers will give you very bad fps when you play on them"
19116,its legitness
19117,"It's a great game! Only downside is that you need a massive budget to thoroughly unlock the game, personally I can't get most of the DLCs but mods make do! Definitely recommend for playing with friends, or fully unlocked DLC wise if you got the budget! No matter how you play the game, it's always fun and you can easily overlook FPS issues cause the game masks it very well!
9/10"
19118,"Good simulation
relax"
19119,I will return to this review once I actually understand how to play
19120,"Overall great game. I would really recommend. Only things i have against it: lack of jumping, getting stuck sometimes in obstacles, stupid AI in campaign."
19121,"[h1] Let's be honest, I wrote this review for the Steam Awards. [/h1]"
19122,funny game i die though
19123,"If you hate yourself and have no live this game is for you. 
You WILL waste you life trying to get this game to work properly and you WILL enjoy it."
19124,fun game sad its dying lets keep it alive
19125,i don't really recommend this game because i didn't have fun its so hard just to go to the plane then to drop and kill
19126,Game
19127,gud
19128,"very good-physics sometimes break, takes some time to learn and even more to master, (about 1000 keybinds) however really fun, little to no toxicity, everyone is usually very help full, (Dont get go carts dlc) dlcs add many things however most non-official servers use most of them especially jets and helicopters. so could be a bit hard playing just the game alone on the public servers."

19135,"its a excellent sandbox for not just military but anything you want its limitless with the thousands of mods and scripts you can make any thing come true in arma, it also features a wide range of campaigns and showcases, arma 3 is just great in every way (except for the AI)"
19136,Yes Yes Yes Haha Yes Yes Yeah im so cool okay so lets you gotta get a3 launcher now
19137,"is fun

19138,"This game is great, watch out for the physx god of arma, or you will get (as they say) ARMA'D"
19139,"Very Good game, But Not for younger aged players"
19140,"This game is completely dead, why are they even selling it"
19141,quite well developed game with a lot of war techniques

19146,yes
19147,"Keep on getting [Missing File Priviliges] when wanting to re-install the game. For some reason, BEServices.exe is not getting any priviliges DESPITE not even being shown in the install folder.

Will give it a thumbs up as soon as I have it fixed, but until then, fuck it. Not even going to bother. None of the suggested fixes in the steam support worked."
19148,"its fun
"
19149,"A great game with amazing sandbox capabilities that has lead to some amazing community made game modes. The most fun you will have in this game won't be from the amazing graphics or realism, but from the random bugs and glitches that happen while you and your friends play."

19160,"So my buddy and I dropped in behind enemy lines, made our way to a nearby house and held it off from a few patrolling units. Then we made our way north past a bunker, and spotted some guys in the woods on IR. so we called in an arty strike on them, blew up the cache they were guarding, and made our way back to the bunker which was now ominously empty. Not ten meters before we past it, we heard enemy gunfire behind us. We took up position at the bunker, and dropped about 15 guys. We then headed south to get some intel on our target, and happened upon another patrol of about 5-6 infantry. We ambushed them from the rear, and put 'em down cleanly. We searched them for any intel, and pinpointed the target's patrol pattern. We located it northeast of the small town, and stalked it as it moved north. I called in arty as we predicted their path, and pummeled the objective into a crater. Called in a whirly-bird for extraction, and called it a day. *Lights Cigar* 

Love this janky, buggy, barely runs well, old yet POWERFUL game."

19165,"3000+ Hours in this series and still not bored! Arma 3 was a great step up from 2. Its a shame its still not the best optimised, but still unbeaten for me gameplay and online community wise!"
19166,great game just die faster than you can say ....''I FUCKED UP''
19167,"good stuff

19168,"by far one of the most fun games i've ever played, even better with friends. multiplayer servers also help in me giving a good review. is it difficult? yes. are the key bindings funky at first? for sure. but after you learn how things work it is an amazing game."

19177,"The best mil sim game I personally have ever played myself. The sound of war rumbling through your ears with the slight comfort of being able to throw in ear plugs is super immersive, Strategically dominating the opponents is what gives this game its true color."
19178,"worth it. it really is. Even though i havent played multiplayer, i have come to enjoy the editor."
19179,The BEST military game I have ever played! It makes me feel like being in a real battle field!(God bless Sergeant Adams...)
19180,"Clean cut, smooth, amazing."
19181,"Why do I keep coming back to this game after so many years you ask?
Because there isn't any game that replaces the scriptability for custom scenarios, easy to use 3D editor, and the ability to run your own hosted server."
19182,multi purpose battle simulator with great mods
19183,It's pretty good I guess
19184,it is the most realistic shooter yet
19185,"Based game, though the animations can get super clunky at times, I recommend you get the DLC's along with it too, but if you do that, wait for a sale"
19186,"meh

19187,"This may be the worst goddam review but this is a great game. It is a skill to win with cheap dlcs and cheaper dlcs during sale. It‚Äôs also fun because you can‚Äôt jump over bullets and it is realistic and tactically challenging but also fun.

Sometimes the AI has aimbot but idk.

9/10

Great graphics 
Runs great and does not need nasa composer 
Realistic and tactically challenging combat and inventory 
Annoying stamina 
Very detailed in vehicles and weapons and everything
Great selection of mods
Extremely fun to play with friends
Good commanding system but a mod ‚ÄúC2 Command‚Äù adds more features
Terrible vault system but enhanced vault or other vaulting mods fix it or improve it at least 

10/10 
Also before you play this game get training by a friend or by in game story mode training or else you would thing this is COD and then die."
19188,good
19189,"Best tactical fps ever, the amount of mods that this game has makes it last long time."
19190,"Bellissimo gioco, simulativo militare da giocare assolutamente in gruppo.

19194,GOOD JOB GAME
19195,its not what i wanted
19196,Old but good
19197,"This game is an perfectly well and accurate depiction of real life military conflict zone. From the dirt to the sky most everything you would think to depict in this game in comparison to a militarized aspect is just about here. Although I have noticed a few annoyances like piloting a UAV quadcopter which is practically a mental strain on its own, to which my only advice is be gentle with your movements while controlling it. After 4 hours i have completed the tutorial and the first 2 or 3 full missions and have to say I like what this game has to offer and would definitely recommend others to play it. New players to Arma such as myself should enter with intrigue and interest and emerge with cunning perseverance and knowledge. Plus as an added bonus Arma 3 uses the steam workshop to bring plentiful amounts of community mods to all users to which I have not currently experienced but soon will."
19198,caca
19199,fun but play squad first.
19200,"Bought this game a few years back on a humble bundle sale. I ended up getting it to just try it out with some friends who wanted to do small ops together. We played, they didn't like it but I continued to play even after they left finding a server with a welcoming community who played invade and annex. After getting bored of that I decided to try out units I had heard about, so I joined the 501st Star Sim, wasn't my cup of tea so I moved onto the 105th (then) ODST battlaion and played with them for a few years, I really enjoyed my time there and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a simi-serious unit. Now I left the 105th (now) Shock trooper battlaion but I joined other units, went back to star sim uner the 612th where I then learned to make retextures. That brings us up to current day where we are now starting the 612th Star sim and are looking for members. I've had plenty of negative experiences, but not the game's fault, rather the communities. High up on my recommended for everyone to at-least try out. 

TL:DR Arma is a fun sandbox game I highly recommend with over 3000+hrs in game"
19201,Put in a few hours... not bad.
19202,"kinda sucks wee wee
"
19203,two seconds in and i get killed by an apc and i didn't even get to see what dodge charger i could buy with my signing bonus
19204,another shooter game i really enjoy. the AI in this game MOD we are playing on is insane but makes me want more.
19205,this game rustled my jimmies very hard and good
19206,"Game is good, I recommend"
19207,Fun game first good four hours.
19208,fun
19209,i am still a novice in this game but really liked it since discovering flashpoint years ago.
19210,good game
19211,honestly when you're first getting into the game it can be overwhelming but once you have a general understanding its probably one of the best games you will ever play. Once you start getting into the realism mods and all the real time unit uniforms and weapons and start finding the right realism servers its really an experience you cant find in any other Milsim game. this game gets so immersive its almost like being in war. i served two tours in afghanistan with 11 bravo infantry as an infantryman and i give this game a solid 10/10. if you got an extra 80$ or so and a good pc to run it honestly buy the game and all the dlcs. you wont regret it.
19212,this is a really fun game and i recommend for all
19213,good...
19214,this game is way fun i think that the game stands out in the modding department and the coop experience is so much fun. if you like to make missions and you like to play a realistic team shooter then this is a game for you.
19215,"Hard game to learn, but after that it's a blast. Just don't give up while learning"
19216,"Well, what can i say. It's Arma. It's fun, horrible, fun, tough amazing, a piece of shit and a masterpiece at the same time. So many good memories while playing with friends. Whole days spent just piloting choppers from base to deployment zones, avoiding AA fire, dodging missiles like wrenches. It's an amazing platform and many people have developed amazing game scenarios and game modes. It's demanding but rewarding. Get in there! :)"
19217,It's okay.
19218,"Good game, good community, worth the money!"
19219,h
19220,"I do not play this game as it is likely intended to be played, but it is fun to download some mods and turn off the whole HUD to fully immerse yourself in a realistic war game. Graphics aren't too bad on Ultra but I get a bug that causes the rocks and trees to appear floating in far distances. Apparently this is common, unable to be fixed, and breaks the illusion. Still fun though."
19221,lots of fun with friends
19222,so good if you like sandbox game
19223,If 4chan launched a CoD server
19224,best war game imo
19225,"ABSOLUTE AWESOMENESS GOOD JOB TO WHO MADE THIS GAME
"
19226,A great tactical shooter with tons of replay value. Modding community is very cool too.
19227,i never ger bored and the idea for the people to start their own server is so smart
19228,This game is so good but sucks at the coop part. Me and my friend were not able to coop together to play Apex Protocol no matter what we did. Wtf do we need to port forward to be able to play it. Not that it worked anyway. 2021 still getting DLCs but can't fix the goddamn coop. How hard is it? Literally every other game we can drop in drop out without any hassle. 21st century game using 20th century technology.
19229,The most realistic military simulator I have ever played.
19230,Good Stuff.
19231,"thumbs up

19236,"Play Invade and Annex its fun, also its a milsim sandbox so create your scenario!"
19237,"Great game.
Graphics are great, scenarios are great, the world is huge!

About the only thing I wish would change is the way DLC is implimented on the multiplayer servers.
Wish it would filter out ones I can't play by default."
19238,VEry nice
19239,ha ha Wipeout go BRRRRRR
19240,tis' fun.
19241,"Arma, what else!."
19242,very ok
19243,"I literally love this game. If you searching for a close Combat game than this is not one. Except that this game will give you everything. Like role playing, strategy, custom scenarios,etc. You can design the scenario the way you like it. And the physics are mind blowing. Still its not possible to drift on the road vehicle :P. Moreover there are a lot of custom mods to play. The pushed the limits of the game far from vanilla servers.. If you love a strategy + action that I suggest to go for it."
19244,<3
19245,"swagger, very swagger"
19246,Would I recommend this game? Fugg yeah I would
19247,This takes Mil-Sim to the next level. I recommend it
19248,not bad
19249,good game
19250,"Its a great game if you have time
"
19251,"pretty nice
"
19252,its fucking ass shit game poorly optimized controls will hurt your head and just trash
19253,"I can not really say too much about this game having only 4 hours of play time. But... holy hell that 4 hours was intense. And not intense because the starting missions are hard ( although they are long and monotonous sometimes), but more because I am so used to the mainstream FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield - nothing against Battlefield, they are still a homie.

Consider this: CoD typically has a defacto playing style suited to the mainstream and newbie player. Arma, I feel, does not. A lot more keys, a lot more focus required and a lot more critical thinking with missions. Like, you actually have to think about the best way to approach a situation and you have to think how you engage the enemy. Something not typically found in either of the aforementioned AAA titles. I feel those games, having played them enough, sort of give you victory no matter what, and dying is just simply because you are being lazy playing the game or something."
19254,ok
19255,It is fun to mod
19256,"Really good to play with friends, though it does take some time to get used to the controls
"
19257,only good for mods
19258,amazing game
19259,swag game
19260,"extreamly fun
"
19261,
19262,"This game is so terrible, The clunky controls kill the experience for me. If someone shoots at me while i'm in a laying down position, My character won't respond to my inputs fast enough causing me to get shot and die. I understand the game is supposed to be realistic, But that doesn't mean the controls can be completely awful. 
 
The community is completely disgusting, Getting your IP leaked by someone who didn't like you is truly horrible. The devs don't care about reports, So cheaters and Toxic people can roam freely without punishment.

The single player has to be the most boring thing I have ever played. Stealth doesn't work at all and the AI is complete trash. Not to mention Arma 3 has a severely old engine."

It's an amazing game, despite it's age. Campaign was good and the huge amount of mods in the workshop means a lot more fun. Game runs pretty well for my non-gaming laptop too.

Can't wait for Arma 4. OFP never dies."

19290,Currently one of the best shooter game.........
19291,Hm. nothing.. BEST GAME
19292,"If you like realistic war games, this is the game for you.  Based on the same engine that runs Virtual Battle Space 3, the US Army's infantry simulator, Arma 3 is realistic and fun.  Now supporting Workshop, modding the game is a snap, which allows for you to fight in a plethora of armed conflicts from Napoleonic Wars and World War II to modern Afghanistan and the far off planet of Klendathu.  Mods also increase quality of life and realism factor, allowing for endless possibilities for a player to enjoy."
19293,great game
19294,nice
19295,I have honestly Never personally experienced a more realistic Military simulation game yet
19296,"As an ex infranty man, getting on in years, I get a great satisfaction in executing Sceanareos just like in the old days.  I'm not as quick as most of your young players but I bet I have more patience and planning skills.  It also takes me back to my youth when we played war in the woods.  I lot of fun and a great way to burn off excess energy."
19297,runs better than DayZ
19298,Great complete mods available
19299,IT'S ARMA 3. WHAT MORE IS THERE TO SAY?
19300,Fun.

19310,I shoot man in balls thrice and he doesn't die
19311,"Very good game, it's very interesting."
19312,"Great game with great mods, hands down my favourite milsim out there. Yes the AI will see you miles away through heavy foliage, it's a bit frustrating but mostly I see that as part of the fun. The only reason I won't recommend this game is that the engine is out dated, and the performance is crap. If you plan on using mods on a server (which you really should) chances are you're getting sub 20 fps during the majority of an op, and at times under 10 fps. Next gen hardware doesn't change much. If you haven't bought this already, you can probably wait for arma 4 for the performance boost.

Don't buy this if you want a complete single player experience, unless you love saving and loading every 20 seconds."
19313,"loved everything about it
"
19314,"Cool game, 10/10, would play again."
19315,Fun mil sim but multiplayer needs a lot of work. Was very difficult to meet my friend online.
19316,great game. its very fun and real
19317,This is one of the best games I have every played. I only have 20 Hours at the moment but its still one of the best games I have ever play'ed.
19318,"Well, bad game don't buy it. I watned this game, got it, after playing the prolauge deleted it, it was terrible and boring, i just lost all will to play after experiencing the terrible tutorial dont buy pure shit"
19319,"Arma3 is very good as an alternative to DCS,I suggest you do tutorials on driving,flying,compass and etc otherwise it won't be fun and annoying for experienced players.

Give it a try. Defenitly worth it;"

19327,good game
19328,"Generally a good game, but make sure you've got decent hardware. A fast cpu is generally going to result in  better performance than one with a multitude of cores, but any modern cpu along the lines of a i7 4790k or a ryzen 5 3400 or greater should do fine. Game is pretty fun, whether you play single player campaign or modded multiplayer. Would suggest getting any DLCs you can (I never usually say this, but much of the multiplayer community relies on these for content). Game is buggy. Very very very buggy. But in a comical way. Like backing into a tank, resulting in the tank rocketing into the sky, only to come crashing down onto your vehicle, killing you and anyone in a 50ft radius. Just something to know before diving in."
19329,"its fun 
"
19330,One of the best military combat sim
19331,Game is really fun to play. Offers an extensive amount of content for just yourself or when playing with friends. Gme wee wee gud
19332,"Arma Is a fun game for many different people- you can play Exile or Epoch for a more DayZ type experience, you can play on milsim servers for some heavy roleplay, but for the love of every-fucking-thing that's holy, don't play the campaign, It's a glorified walking simulator, with no real meat on the bone, all you'll get Is some cut throat dry dialogue and another 3-4 hours of walking."

19353,yes

19362,"Complex game scenarios and fantastic mods.
Takes time to learn"
19363,"If your getting it to play with friends and have never touched an arma game before, learning it will be a living nightmare. But If your coming in looking for that mil-sim experience STOP! Arma's gameplay mechanics are great, but and a big but at that its physics are so off the walls. Oh you ran your quad into a tank? don't worry about it your quad will fly across the map and the tank will explode. The game itself looks good if you have a good CPU I personally recommend an I-5/ Ryzen 5 2600 or better. For the gameplay of the game, with the amount of mods ranging from zombies to exotic cars the possibilities are endless. If you are coming into this game with friends you will make some funniest memories. If it is that mil-sim aspect your looking for there are still a lot of private operations that do span multiple hours that can be a lot of fun. In the end I do strongly recommend this game to the avid and new arma player! Enjoy!"
19364,"I don't have heat in my office. So whenever winter rolls around I just turn my PCs fans towards me, crank Arma up to low settings (because ya know, it is the most optimized game since DayZ standalone), and the sheer A10 sized blast of heat that comes from my PC keeps me warm for the whole winter.

That....plus the challenge of more key combinations than starting up a 747 for the most basic of actions is a good brain exercise. 

The best part though:

MAN.....100 METERS.....FRONT

19365,very good game if your computer is able to handle it:P
19366,This game is very fun even with 11 hours but if you wanted more fun you could get mods or buy the dlc

19386,"Arma doesn't have a learning curve, it has a learning WALL.
If you buy this game, be prepared to spend a lot of time learning how to play the game through both tutorials in-game and youtube videos. I suggest you watch Arma 3 Milsim (military simulation). It's really cool.
Combat is the most realistic of any shooter ever made! Don't expect it to be as straightforward and easy as Call of Duty franchise. Rewards team play and the use of real military strategy."
19387,"good
"
19388,pew pew
19389,i may only have 19 hours but it is a fun game and you can play with only the basics but make sure you have alot of storage space most units and some games will require you to install at least 10 mods maybe 6
19390,yes
19391,"Arma has one of the most expansive communities I've ever seen and the modding community is fantastic. Ranging across all types of video games, you will easily get lost in the steam workshop looking for content. I've spent 1,500 hours playing this game with huge arma communities and I could happily spend another 1,500. 

Admittedly, the base game can be quite lacking in content, and the combat/stamina system can be overwhelming, but this game has so much to offer and I couldn't recommend it more."
19392,this is such a good game bit of a toxic community outside of milsim servers but thats just my personal opinion also i cant find a milsim group so anyone in the comments  plz inv me to a group or at least tell me of one you know

19397,"Really good addictive game, but has some glaring issues. 

Multiplayer is fun, I haven't tried competitive yet but I'm really enjoying PVE. Really good range of weapon, equipment, vehicles, jets, helicopters, tanks, UAV's. Large expansive maps. One of the maps is based off a real island. The single player story mission and the lore is interesting. 

The anti-cheat system doesn't work, the amount of hackers I have seen on my favourite server is insane. They pop on blow everyone and everything up and leave when they get bored. 
Luckily I play on a PVE server, I can only imagine what its like on a PVP server. 

The lag and frame drops is an issue in MP. Clearly unoptimised and seems to suffer from memory leak. 

They don't do enough with the single player campaign. The maps are massive, but the game doesn't take advantage of this or seem to have the capability to allow the player to do different objectives all over the map- either that or flow of missions is lacking. 

The DLC's. In multiplayer DLC content (that you haven't purchased) will still be accessible but there will be advertisements for the DLC content that you use on the player screen/UI. You don't need the DLC to play the game though. 
I do wish that they had spent more time optimising the game than releasing DLC though and it feels like some of the DLC should belong in the base game. 

The physics in this game (although funny) are terrible - especially vehicles crashing into each other. 

200 hours in (mostly in MP), I'm really enjoying this game - I still haven't learned how to use tanks and jets, and I still have the single player missions to complete yet."

19428,"very very good game even if you don't like tactical shooters, its still very fun"
19429,"It's a sandbox MIL-SIM, do I really have to go further in-depth? 
still has some bugs but the 2.0 update has honestly fixed TONS of the old bugs that really were a staple as well as something you just had to accept about arma, rocks are still indeed glitchy but, they wont kill you in wild and ridiculous ways, however if a teammate revives on you some youre almost certainly going to spawn INSIDE of it. stuff like that, there is still plenty of hilarious bugs but they're a minor thing these days. 

sucks that the playerbase is dwindling but, if you and even one friend can play together, you're in store for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of great times, laughing fits from something so insanely stupid both of your rib cages will be aching & all around good times.

19442,"The best version of Arma 3 is located at Latitude and longitude coordinate : 34.343044, 62.199074

Had since alpha, doesn't seem like the developers know what direction they wanted to go with because they added gokart DLC friggin alien invasion bloody old boy super soldier DLC.
 
Honestly if you want a good Mil sim experience just join the bloody army, after your first tour you should just about be able to afford all the DLC, also that way you don't have to listen to Keith from Luton pretending hes a descendent of field marshal Montgomery and that you will be kicked for not virtually saluting him XD 
 
Honestly Stick to single player it could be a good game but civis take it way too seriously. pretty graphic, excellent sound quality, semi realistic ballistics, 

Oh and its a absolute nightmare to match make with the amount of mods needed for what would be a standard game mode in anything else and before you play you will need to take about 1 hour just to map the controls.

Arma 2 is better"

19465,good game defo say play game
19466,"This is a game I don't play often, but when I do play it I really fucking enjoy it! The best milsim out there without a doubt - so if you love in-depth, hardcore, complicated military sims then this is for you! There's millions of servers to choose from and these could be Altis Life RP to Invade and Annex, which basically means RP's to PvE and the game even has PvP servers if you fancy that. Here's some pros and cons:

[b]Positives[/b]
- This game is very in-depth, from the amount of gear you can carry to the number of rockets to destroy an APC or tank.
- The sheer number of different things to do in this game means it never gets old! There's even campaigns too.
- As raw as a mil sim gets, which depending on if you like them or not, can be a good or bad thing.
- The game is really fun to play with friends and there are so many ARMA 3 teams out there to join!
- The game aint just run, point, shoot! It's very tactical and you need to think tactical to survive.

[b]Negatives[/b]
- I find the game sometimes doesn't look the prettiest, but I'm sure if you have a great PC you can have it look good.
- Same as in the positives, this game is fucking raw! So if you're not into that kinda thing then it's maybe not for you.
- Kinda ties in with above, there's so many controls and it can be overwhelming and complicated at first, but you'll get the hang of it if you stick to it!

All in all, this game is worth it! It's a great game that I have never regretted buying and I'm glad it's part of my Steam library. Whether it be for zombies, RP or just good old ARMA gamemodes, this game has you covered, so I recommend!"
19467,"Best game

19468,"Spend a few houres, just learned all basics.

19479,if you're even slightly interested buy the game
19480,War crime simulator
19481,"I love this game, but the Campaign is so awful that i can't recommend it. 

1) You can't board most Vehicles! I wonder why.. Maybe because the AI is still driving as bad as in Operation Flashpoint (The first Game in the Series). They dont't (barely?) react to other Vehicles blocking the Road. Off Road they are just doomed.. Not once could they drive me home in one piece after a Patrol.

2) The AI seems to be exempt from the Rules that apply to the Player. For example: They can run to cover shoot and hit from a standing stance without having to calm down.. And Vegetation does not seem to block their sight. So in the beginning of the game (when you don't command your squad yet) it goes like this: Your guys rush the enemy in the most suicidal way, some action takes place while you are trying to catch up (Even without a Backpack). Once you're there you can't hit anything for a while because you were running, controlled Breathing helps. Maybe you get a lucky shot, but mainly you are a distraction so that the Enemy doesn't pick of your Squad. If on the other hand you don't try to catch up, half of your squad is dead when you finally arrive.. 

3) There's just too much stupid Drama. It's always an Ambush, a 'Lone Survivor' or 'Horrors of War' Plot going on. In every Mission...

I have not finished the Campaign yet, but until now it was more of a chore than enjoyment."

19484,good
19485,arrrrrr-ma
19486,x
19487,Arma 3 is one of the best out there
19488,"This game has not much bad to say about it apart from the game has real sized maps which is good unless your pc isn't that great. This game has so much potential, the workshop is full of maps, scenarios and much more. Using the workshop the game can be transformed into anything ranging from star was game to all the way back to Napoleonic era. This games is so fun to play on the wide variety of multiplayer servers. And the best of all the Eden editor, this is a mission creator program built into the game, so you can make missions and all you and your friends can play them. The Eden Editor has so much to offer and hours of fun to have. Overall this game is great and by the amount of hours I have on it you can trust me."
19489,"Despite all my hours in this game I still have yet to scratch the surface of all this game has to offer. That's without the DLC, plus the Modding community is always hard at work adding new and fun stuff to mess with. In some aspects however I still prefer Arma 2(mostly minor stuff, not a fan of the MX rifles that are standard issue in campaign). This is definitely a game that requires a good Tower PC or a really good gaming laptop especially if you add mods to the mix. Also final side note some mods will use assets from the DLCs, meaning if you want to use that mod you'll need the DLC as well."

"
19519,good
19520,-.-
19521,"Probably the best milsim available as of now, especially due to its unique and unprecedented customisation and moddability (due of course to its dedicated community).
Regrettably, the game itself is quite coarse, what with its lacking AI (allies and enemies both) and the abysmal optimisation (game engine was quite dated even at the release and by all means did not age well).
Mods can add depth and a more modern touch to many base mechanics, but the above mentioned limitations cannot be easily circumvented.
That said, where the game shines is not quite in its single player aspects, but in its multiplayer (which of course eliminates the issues afflicting allied AI) and as a modded sandbox framework."
19522,"commit war crimes for fun, civilians are acceptable casualties, and use the Geneva Convention for toilet paper"

19525,"A great mil-sim for those looking for realistic military operations in a grounded setting!


I was originally put off of this game (And ARMA 2) by their in-depth systems and not really grasping what to do in the missions or Eden editor. I recently decided to put more time in and learn these different systems and I'm having a blast now! This game takes a small amount of dedication to learn, but your time will be well spent if you're a military enthusiast looking for a realistic shooter! Most of my time has been spent in EDEN using light mods and vanilla game assets- but the modding scene is just one more reason to join ARMA 3 today; be it ww2, ww1, warhammer, Star Wars, or modern day- weapons or maps, the list goes on and on! If you're looking for a multiplayer experience, there are many different modes and servers such as Life, KOTH, Death Match, ect.

The only negative thing I have to say about the game is that some of the vanilla vehicles are locked as DLC- but you can easily get all of them and the base game during one of the many steam sales. In conclusion.. BUY THIS GAME!"

Ich habe sehr viel Spa√ü im diesen Spiel. Man kennt neue Freunde kennen sofern man online spielt und die Anwendung vom Englischen hat mir auch fortschritte in der Sprache gebracht. Ebenfalls kann man mit Freunden Spielen und sich austoben. ArmA 3 hat durch seine M√∂glichkeiten und Mods eine gro√üe Vielfalt. Von RPG bis PvP etc. Ich kann dieses Spiel als Shooter nur weiter empfehlen. In gewisser Hinsicht ist es auch als Roleplay Game gut, sofern es einen Server in deiner Sprache gibt. 
Ich bin zuletzt ebenfalls einer Einheit beigetreten und habe mit dieser sehr viel Spa√ü. Auf jeden fall ein sehr tolles Feature. 
Jedoch muss ich eins sagen. Ebenfalls finde ich es sch√∂n das dieses Spiel einen Editor hat, dieser erm√∂glicht es den Spielern eine Vielfalt zu haben und sich aus zu toben in diesem Editor. Sollte es eine neue Version (Arma 4) geben, hoffe ich das es diesen auch dort geben wird. Die Physiks sowie Fahrzeuge sind etwas bl√∂d. Wenn man sich Rammt explodiert das Auto/Fahrzeug, Flugzeug, etc sofort. Aber des weiteren hat das eher weniger Auswirkungen auf den Spielspa√ü. 
[b]Von 5 Sternen w√ºrde das Spiel von mir 4,5 bekommen.[/b] Deswegen da die Physics nicht wirklich gut sind aber einem jetzt auch nicht das Spiel versauen."

I first got hooked on the Arma series with Arma 2 DayZ mod and have been a fan ever since. I will not lie, there is a pretty steep learning curve to the game even if you are familiar and just step away for a few months, but once you get into it and learn the basic mechanics is can hold your attention for hours on end of fun game play. If you are even remotely interested in mil-sim type games you should check this out."
19579,fun sandbox fun
19580,pew pew pew
19581,shoot shoot funny
19582,"Arma 3 is a realistic military sandbox. It relies heavily on mods, and this is arguably the strongest part of this game. The mod support is really good implemented and this results in endless possibilities if it comes to content.

This game isn't made for singleplayer. You can definitely download SP scenarios from the steam workshop and have fun, but this isn‚Äôt the place where you can get the most fun. The best of Arma is found in the multiplayer or coop segment. Download a PvE mission from the steam workshop, or build it yourself, and play it with 1,2,3,10 or even 20 friends and up, by hosting a dedicated server. Or have a massive PvP battle.
Its also possible to join a big server with 20-100 players on it. The servers are ranging from coop missions against AI, to a big PvP king of the hill battle, or just an RPG of real-life without any combat. There really aren't a lot of limits. Meeting new players and playing a coop mission with them in your squad is so much fun. Communication is one of the things that Arma is all about. 

Well, there is one important limit. While the game is extensive, the massive scale results in performance issues. This is one of the weaker parts of Arma. You need a pretty powerful processor to run the game above 40 fps in big scenarios. A plus is that you dont need a lot of frames in arma, but playing below 40 fps isnt always fun.
Furthermore, the movement system isn‚Äôt polished at all and is maybe a bit too extensive. The game is also hard to get into. Almost every key on your keyboard is bound to something, so there is a bit of a learning curve there. The game is usually overwhelming for new players.

This game isn‚Äôt for all types of people. It is a complicated game, and you can‚Äôt just hop in and have a quick firefight or something, that is not what the game is about. 

Oh and you need patience, walking 15 minutes just to get your whole squad deleted by a single mortar shell, not all players can laugh at that.

19593,"BEST MILSIM EVER! Singleplayer & Multiplayer - both are really fun to play. A game that lived for such long time, bound to have some minor issues but nothing the dedicated community of modders can not work their way around. As Arma IV is still far away, you should have no problem jumping into this and enjoy the ultimate milsim experience. Definitely worth it!"
19594,shooty
19595,Very fun game and if you join a regiment or regiments its way more fun there is things form Halo to Warhammer 40k you can even play Star Wars Mass Effect and much much more plus you can even make your own story's worlds and more you have to learn how to Zeus first yes but that is what the editor helps with or even just base game servers can do to help you its not for everyone but hey at least give it a try before you bash it

I searched online to try and figure it out, and tried different things like app permissions and firewall settings. Nothing seems to work. I've gotten into the game twice out of the many times I've tried. I get enough time to run forward before it crashes. VERY disappointed."

19633,"I've played this game for a little bit...yeah certainly, but let me give you an unbiased opinion on this game at this time.
Pros:
This game has a gigantic community and most of them are really nice people, every game I've joined has a community and a discord built around it. 
It CAN be pretty at times and the gigantic maps do allow for tons of exploring and sight seeing.
Speaking of gigantic maps...that's another pro, Altis is a place that I know like my own hometown, but yet there are still areas I have yet to explore, the map and the islands are areas where you can truly have fun.
This game is almost as moddable as Minecraft, do you want to be an insurgent? A police officer? A clone trooper from Star Wars? A space marine or imperial guardsmen from Warhammer? A spartan from Halo? My answer is you can and I've played them all and they are genuine fun.
The game is realistic to an extent and you normally build your plans before rushing in like mad.
The level editor is the bread and butter of this game and it is fun and intuitive, however, scripting can feel and be fairly clunky.
I could go on, but it's a sandbox full of potential.

Cons:
Bugs...bugs aren't exactly rare, it's not game breaking, but you can get the feeling that it wasn't fully optimized, dudes flying about just...rag dolling after an explosion, things clipping through the map and objects randomly floating about.
This game is BORING if you have no friends to play it with, the AI is not very smart and to be honest , you can't count on it to hold a trench and stand in it without scripting.
The game's campaign is simplistic at best and boring at worst, I wouldn't bother with it, it's just an operation flash point style of campaign.
The game can lag you out and if you're not running a good OS then you won't get your money's worth.

Overall this rates a 6/10 for me, maybe a 7 or 8 when I'm having lots of fun, get it on sale and for the love of god...one tip...get the dlc too...or don't there's wayyy too much of it."
19634,perfect
19635,i commited multiple accounts of warcrimes my first 5 hours of gameplay
19636,good
19637,yea it's a fun game i have fun in it.
19638,"I can tell with confidence that this is probably one of the best games i ever played 
What i do like the most is playing multiplayer Coop 
Never bored me or any of my friends plus the graphics are pretty decent
You can easily spend a whole night playing this without notice it's morning already:)
So much variety when it come's to choosing what u like to do whether it's playing a mission coop or multiplayer alone or with friends
overall i can give this game a solid 9/10 Well deserved"

19658,It's a fun game but when there is 1 smoke and 3 people in the city you get 20 to 30 fps no metter the specs of your pc. They can't optimise the game so that is a big no no from me.
19659,NUT
19660,The only game where handguns are louder than rifles but deal 1/5 the damage of rifles.

19703,"cool game
"
19704,"I had high expectations for this game but after two hours of play, I didn't like it and decided to return it for a refund.  What I didn't like was the controls. The controls were vague and sometimes didn't work. This led to me being unable to zoom in for the majority of my playthrough. If I could have been able to zoom in, I would have found this game to be far more enjoyable."
19705,Amazing Milsim would recommend to anyone
19706,The reality of it is awesome
19707,"14 % done on bootcamp
"
19708,"For players who value tactics, teamwork and immersive realism, this is the war game to play.  The game is polished, constantly improving and beautiful to see.  If you want to run and gun, look elsewhere.  if you want to play as close to a real battle as possible, and you are willing to learn new skills...this is the ticket."
19709,5
19710,"This game has been my go-to game for plenty of years. I have loved this game a lot, many diverse units and opportunities to play with other people and have fun. It's at a very large scale, unlike Squad. Squad is more graphically advanced and is fit to be more of an arcadey first person shooter, while Arma is more for actual Milsims that require land nav skill, infiltration, covert-ops, etc. I would recommend this to anyone."
19711,"Game Is Nearly Open World With Extra Modes And Full Of Models From Vehicles And Soldiers 

It's A Game Of Variations"

19717,Brilliant just brilliant never mind squad never mind that THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
19718,ASYLUM IS THE BEST :D JUST FUCKING RDM AND VDM ITS SO FUN!!!!!!
19719,"I believe that this game is a revolutionary military simulation with a great community. If you are looking for a highly realistic, action-packed, and creative game Arma 3 is what you need. Arma 3 offers a plethora of workshop content for all military units ranging from the basic United States Marine Corps Infantry divisions all the way to MARSOC or DEVGRU. And Arma 3 offers a huge map selection for a change of scenery, it's truly amazing how big and lived in the world feels it's also lively with lots of nature such as snakes and rabbits."
19720,"Worth the buy, a lil hard to learn but once you do it's very fun."
19721,"The mission editting can be as advanced or as simple as you like  to the point you can re create the entirity of a world war all in arma not to mension the gargantuan ammount of mods. In my opinion the only con is that if your not intreseted in making your own missions there isnt much singleplayer content other than the included campaign

True Bliss. 10/10"

19727,Reinstalling after been a long term fan of Arma right from the first game. This game has a ton of depth and replay with the mission creator and scripting. You can set yourself some real challenges and epic scenarios.
19728,Only way to play this game is if u buy all the DLC's
19729,"I play this game almost purely for the helicopter flight sim elements, and it's worth it for that alone. Especially being able to perform various types of combat missions with other people performing totally different types of functions (infantry, armor, etc.)"

19742,"Its a lot of fun when you have friends. But if your friends like CoD so they run around with full auto ARs, the fun can be taken from the game. Find good friends"
19743,"""American Tourist Simulator"" the game.  Clunky and dated, although I can see the appeal.  Aerial vehicles especially control badly but that seems to be a running theme in similar games.

At 75% off the Apex edition is good value, and decent enough if you want a popular military sim sandbox to play with friends."
19744,"Well, its about time I wrote this. 

I have never come across a game that has immersed me more than ArmA 3. I've played Bohemia games since the Operation Flashpoint days back in 2001 before Bohemia got out from under the Codemasters a-holes. 19 years of splendid game play and memories I have, all thanks to the incredible talent of Bohemia Interactive and the beautiful, warm, destructive world they have crafted for us. 

If you're even THINKING about getting ArmA 3 and are sitting on the fence because people complain about optimization, take the leap. Get the game. Even if it isn't running at 144FPS on a 4K screen, its still one of the most incredible experiences you will ever have in gaming. It will take time to learn, so be patient. The rewards and feeling of accomplishment over even the most menial things (like transporting troops/cargo to a firefight or main engagement) is next level. The player base is one of the best on Steam, but like any game there will inevitably be a d***h**d or two. Don't worry though, votekick/voteban is a thing. 

For the price of a meal for two, the Apex edition (while on sale) will give you an incredible start. The Tanks and Jets DLC are absolute must haves as well to get the maximum enjoyment out of ArmA 3. The price may seem steep at first, but ArmA goes on sale ALL the time. I cannot imagine a better use of 40 dollars on Steam than getting Apex, Jets, and Tanks. Thousands of hours in the best military sandbox experience money can buy awaits you, my friend. 

Good hunting."
19745,"When I first started playing this game, I was a bit upset about how hard it was, however I learned you could lower the difficulty by bringing down AI intelligence.

After that, I got better and better and can play well now. This is a great game, singleplayer and multiplayer. It's a classic Military simulator, definitely one of the best out there. If not the best, it's one of the best. I really recommend it if you wanna have an online game night with the boys(or the girls). 

Game is just a great price for the game as well. (Not sure what it is right now, but I recently saw it as a reasonable price).

Anyways, I recommend it!"

19762,"ARMA 3's description calls itself a massive military sandbox, which couldn't be more correct in what the strengths are. 
Arguably, it is the easiest game to pick up and play, including tutorials, scenarios to introduce players to the core mechanics and even a campaign that attempts to provide the player an example of different factions (some of which return from 2 and prior titles by Bohemia) playing a part over the state of Altis. While admittedly the setup and missions are more content to fill in if the player cannot access multiplayer, the campaign is made a little better by it's Law of War expansion, where the highlight is the unconventional campaign. The other island, Stratis, is not really the main focus. Altis is the most developed of the islands, both are based on real life places, in fact, no doubt helping authenticity.

Altis is a large map, transport options can be diverse, even water options open up when reaching the core of the island. The highlight of the island is Kavala, which features a large castle out looking the port and surrounding sea. Even so, what many players consider to be the defining city of the map is only a former capital.
It has an airport, where most military equipment across many game types are usually concentrated. Game modes such as domination (a returning, popular player vs AI combined forces capture the town mode) use these areas to store the numerous vehicles. Something that is to mention however, is that ARMA 3's base game notably lacks a lot of the best or more interesting vehicles. Jets, specialised tanks and more futuristic but not out of touch VTOLs are contained in some expansion packs. 

This comes to be the main problem with ARMA 3. As a sandbox in of itself, it does offer a wide amount of tools. The Eden editor and Zeus functions are arguably the absolute best creative tools added in the games that Bohemia have made, importing over script language from ARMA 2, along with finally giving players a real-time look into what they're specifically placing. I cannot tell you how great these two features are, hopefully the wealth of Steam Workshop content should be able to provide some idea, even made by novice designers or people just messing around. 
The main problem, is the DLC and expansions. All of them are additions to the sandbox, but like many games such as Civlization, you'll find that DLC and expansions become a 'must-have' requirement. There are some really cool workshop levels and mods out there, some of which require them. Rappelling off of structures, an even deeper simulation experience and integration with TeamSpeak are some of them, and they're pushing ahead military simulation. The question is, right now, how much are you willing to put down? I recommend it if you're creative enough to spend some time messing with mission creators or checking out workshop modifications or levels. Sometimes, ARMA 3 can combine together to create a scenario that seems so dumb in your head, but with a little bit of mod searching and editing, you can make something replicating it. 

Otherwise, the controls and movement within the game are as you would expect for a military simulator, but they have noticeably added more positions for the player to take, some of which are unique and provide a different perspective in a firefight. Control presets can be found replicating ARMA 2 or other presets if you would like something more familiar. One thing that is absolutely a problem is the engine. ARMA 3 runs on an engine that is notorious for bugs and general issues. In fact, ARMA 3 is just known for bugs, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that the performance of the game is quite terrible too. While DayZ has been used as a funding and development platform for Bohemia's new engine, Enfusion (Hint, a big reason why DayZ has been in development for such a long time, they were using it as a testing ground for their actual simulators and commercial products) it is unlikely to have ARMA 3 updated to move to a new engine. It would simply break too much, and it would be another nightmare like DayZ.

ARMA 3 is a great military multiplayer simulation game that drastically improves on ARMA 2, while also giving a ton of creative tools that the average player can use to make their own scenarios and content. If you like the sound of this, ARMA 3 is the best Steam game I've played that fits the bill perfectly."
19763,"Filled with bugs. 

10/10"
19764,great fun game even in 2020
19765,Great immersive army simulator.
19766,"    I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes sandbox, level design, modding, or realism. These are some of the key components of this game.

    This game is designed to be an open-world, endlessly editable sandbox. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of different game-modes both for solo, friends, or mass-multiplayer. Best way to think of it is Garry's mod, but with a set of large maps, rather than thousands of smaller ones.

    My two favourite game-modes are Antistasi and Dynamic Bulwark. Antistasi is a gamemode about taking over a controlling, dictatorial government, while bulwark is an endless, randomized survival (and if you get another mod, it can be against zombies too!)

    However, please do be aware, this game will eat your hard-drive. You have been warned."

19799,"The more you put in, the more you get out."
19800,"Alright. This Game. After almost 3 thousand hours in this game, I think its safe for me to review it. 
This game can be a truly fantastic experience. There are a scant few other games where 20 of my friends and I can fight a group of Russian Insurgents, take a prisoner, escape 2-5 kilometers to a zone that has already been cleared by another team until evacuation arrives. The sense of realism is huge in this game, where the squad in front of mine got hit by a mine, or a mortar something. I was the only medic tasked with getting up their entire squad, while the rest of my squad secured the area. After over 3 years and almost 3 thousand hours and being in every position of leadership from rifleman, to medic, to team lead, to small teams leader in a PMC to rising to a force commander in that PMC I have tons of these stories and more. 
That being said, this game has issues. Its Physics engine isn't the best, and there are many stories and clips of vehicles hitting a bush and joining the ARMA 3 Space program. The Campaigns, while they tell a good story, tend to be frustrating as you'll need to navigate out of a minefield. With no mine detector. Against mines that are damn near invisible. I've needed to restart more times than I care to admit to get through that field. 
The Pros still outweigh the cons in this game. At the end of the day, this game is a massive sandbox simulator with HUGE modding community. You want to be in a hyper realistic airborne unit? They have 'em! Want to just run around with friends, blowing up the enemy? You can! Want to do a post-apocolyptic survival/zombie game? You can! This game is what you make of it. No other game does what ARMA has attempted to do, as well as it handles it."

19802,"Arma 3 has huge potential and huge variation of weapons, gear and mod support. Although there is not sufficient online support or variation of online gameplay mods. Most servers are user made and riddled with people who misuse the online settings and generally mismanage the online rooms. The single player and campaign are pretty small so if you are planning to buy this then you will basically be dependent to the online community or to mods from the workshop which only partly fix the problem with the lack of online options and support. Most online servers are riddled with toxic admins who tend to mismanage their servers to the fullest and  abuse their power. For example many of the Official Servers (for example Zeus) of Arma 3 are basically obsolete since literally anyone can become admin and literally do whatever (f.e. kick everyone and cause havoc)  he wants without any single penalty for mismanaging and abusing his power. Even in the servers which are being automanaged by Bohemia there are often people who get kicked because the BattleEye script is bugged beyond belief and suddenly dysfunctions in the middle of the session without any explanation. I am really sad to say this but despite all the realistic components and its theoretically good concept of gameplay Arma 3 is (at least at this point) a honeypot which sucks the new player in (Good Campaign/ Single Player) but throws him down the cliff when it's online components fail to deliver.  If you plan on buying this game i would recommend you to wait until it gets more updates (After Patch 2.0) and gets fixed by Bohemia in the future. In its current online state Arma 3 is majorly in complete anarchy. If you like an experience similar to GTA 5 ONLINE then the online parts of Arma 3 will appeal to you if you dont mind spending multiple hours on something without learning anything about Modern Warfare and ending up completely wasting your time. But if you want a dedicated online experience protected and updated by the Developer Company then Arma 3 is not for you in its current state."

+ You can approach almost any mission from any angle.  Allowing you to plan an operation and execute it as you please. 
+ Holds up well in 2020

- Optimization is total garbage. You will need something decent to run this."
19815,"I used to play this back in the old Arma 2, Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead days. This game is quite fun once you get used to it all and really can feel when and where you are being shot at, and so on. Flying is pretty difficult unless you are using a joystick or practice with their version of ""VR"", which I think is pretty neat to mess around in."
19816,Look I used to be apart of a clan on this game and I like to have fun playing games right like most people I would think but these people playing this game and making clans are etheir vets or current serveing soilders so if you don't like being so strict in games then this isn't for you

There are millions of things to do from playing mil-sims, Altis life RP, mods, exile, KOTH, and tons and tons of other servers and gamemodes. Some of my favorite gaming moments have happened on this game. Great with friends and if you are a sad sack of shit and don't have any you can find a community anywhere for whatever gamemode/server you want to play with. The workshop and mods on this game are amazing as well. After all this time it's still a great game!"
19821,"Arma 3 is an all around game, which allow you to discover a lot of opportunities to play this game.

[b]Singleplayer campaign:[/b]
When you have installed your game, I will suggest you start your journey with the Arma 3 Campaign, it allows you to learn the basic in Arma, such as controls and how the environment pushes your boundaries of your character ( Stamina ) and will make sure you down hit the target before you catch your breath.
The content and story of the campaign is great and you'll have to work your way in to  find the connecting thread of it all.

The DLC's:
The DLC's have a certain amount of content such as:
‚ñ∂Maps
‚ñ∂Gear
‚ñ∂Vehicles
‚ñ∂Campaigns

Online:
Online game servers is wide and are ready to be played on, the playerbase is high and the people inside are ready to help you, if you need it.
There are certain amount of gamemodes for you to play.
If you like PVP, then you should go ahead and play on  King of the Hill servers, where you and your team must capture a zone and protect it against your enemies.
If you seek teamwork or a common cause, the you should head to Invade'n'Annex servers, where you'll have to work together with your teammates and capture a zone infested with enemies and complete side missions while during the main task.

Workshop:

The workshop is an endless library for you to customize your game with varies gear, vehicles and engines and suit your game as you want it to be.


I personally give this game 5/5 ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ for the mass playerbase and opportunities for how to play the game.

I hope this has cleared out your reason to play this game."
19822,So many mods so much stuff to do I've probably got 350 hours in game (sometimes I don't close the launcher) and havent even touched the base game yet!  sure it's got some odd physics and the AI is sometimes a bit good but overall if you like playing shootymen there's a mod out there for you!
19823,good game army machine not broke

I will put it this way..... Buy the game you will love it, and if you don't, well you can always buy an Xbox or a Playstation."
19831,woah
19832,"Like anything else worth doing, there is a steeper learning curve than your traditional FPS. The benefits from the added complexity are too many to list here.

19856,"Arma 3 , though early on has had great potential, it never lived up to the hype. 

Pros: 
- lots of different things you can do with the game

Cons: 
- has the downright worst community. Expect people to leak your IP adress , private information, and unleash personal attacks 
- Lots of sexual predators 
- If you wish to have mods , expect people to violate DMCA/copyright laws by stealing your work
- The games developer does NOTHING if you report players for cheating, violating copyright laws, or Dox you (publically release personal information) 
- Game engine is severly outdated 
- simple easy modding , is over complicated and often very buggy
- hackers are everywhere 
- some servers illegally monetize (charge money for players to gain advantage or entery to server) 
- TONS of scammers 
- The ‚ÄúArma Discord‚Äù server is filled with many self cenetered and vindictive mods (many claim to be employees of Bohemia). Expect to be instantly banned from Discord the monent you ask a question that they dont agree with.
- Single player gets boring quickly
- Most multiplayer servers are empty and have almost no players
- Very stressful and TONS of endless stupid drama from the community
- There is virtually 0 communication between the developers and iverall community
- Game updates happen like once a year and often comes with many bugs and glitches.
- Like the discord server, expect to be instantly banned from the website/forums for asking a simple question if its a question that mods dont agree with. Primarily look out for a mod who goes by ‚Äú-FM-‚Äú hell ban you just because he feels like it. 
- There is virtually NO WAY to appeal a ban. Regardless of the mistake and what you say, all bans are final and you‚Äôre sh*t out of luck if you think your appeal will be granted."

19886,takes time to learn the mechanics but after that a fun game.
19887,War crims simulator
19888,really fun with how much ul be sitting in a helicopter
19889,very nice game
19890,"I love the 2035 theme of this game far better in my opinion than ww2, cold war or modern eras.
Campaign is glorious aswell.

i am addicted to this game help"
19891,"Milsim at its finest, lots of mods to choose from to spice up the vanilla settings. Never gonna look back into other shooting games. Kinda frustrating at times due to technicalities and the difficulty of the game but fun to play with either solo or with friends. 5/5 for me"
19892,"The game itself is ok. It's bug ridden and poorly optimized. My problem is how the game itself works, if you don't have DLC they make continuous pop ups while playing to let you know. To get into a Jet it will tell you to get the Jet DLC, same for the Helicopters, same for some apparel. Don't get the game unless you plan on never using heavy armored or air vehicles. If you do plan to, then know you will have to spend copious amounts of money on DLC for content that should be base game."
19893,10/10
19894,"Vallah, diese gut :D"
19895,oynƒ±cak birini bulunca baya sarƒ±yor community si hi√ß yoxic olmayan g√ºzel bi oyun
19896,"Very very poor guide, mission curation, etc. 
It took for me so many things to google and hours before being able to properly finish the practically first mission ""Infantry"". Not really the realism or difficulty thing, just poor curation for beginner.

Poor graphics optimization. Gtx 1060 would be not enough.

Actually all this poor things that i already expected before buying. 

Yet it has its own clear advantage points : realism, detail, open-modding.

I bought this for good mixture of helicopter piloting  + infantry shooting.

For now its mixture of satisfaction and frustration. And no other alternative. 

One thing, why the vehicle driving physics so bad?

19914,Best game
19915,"Great game, especially with good people! 8.5/10"
19916,"The campaigns are okay but the game really shines in multiplayer, especially when you add some of the plethora of mods available. The game can really be whatever you want it to be, highly recommend."
19917,"good
yes"
19918,very fun game have lost a lot of hrs in this game
19919,"its a good game over all but its hard finding a good server or something like that, Also down side is that if you are looking for a m4, you have to download a mod to get it, But this game is set in the future were everything has changed"
19920,crazy realism
19921,love the game best thing i have got in a long time
19922,ha ha war go brrrrrrr
19923,ok

19933,"Great Military Simulation, play to your own discipline"
19934,"good, very good"
19935,"The game sucks unless you get most if not all of the DLC's, there are 2 missions in singleplayer without any DLC's, you eventually end up asking: ""How do I refund this?""."

19937,play with friends. :-) so mutch fun :-)
19938,"""Cannot fire"""
19939,beep beep boop bop
19940,"I enjoy playing this game. As it is a game, I play it for the fun and the realism that can be found in this game. You need a bit of skill to play it. Unfortunately, it has sunk down to the rest of the rotten games out there. The rot in this world has become very apparent. Using the name Of Jesus Christ as a swear word shows how sick even the gaming community has become. Going through the training really sucks BIG time. I skipped it as i just hate these developers's ignorance. Why not use other gods or deities as curse words? They do not carry any weight, right? Just shows you who is real and who not."
19941,"As an all-round, wannabe combat sim this sim pretty much gives every player an experience that fits the bill."
19942,Really fun to play with friends and really fun to play king of the hill.
19943,"i am mixed on this one. first you need a 100 foot screen to play this game nicely lol. but outside of that the rest of the game is great and fun to play. i give it a lower rating  than i would like, but the the shot box needed to hit a target is so small you need that 100 foot screen i give it a 7/10."
19944,great game
19945,extremely dull dont buy. even on ultra settings the game is bad just showing its age. do not buy
19946,its a game
19947,It is enjoyable to kill terroist
19948,"Game is literal dookie dollars, played for 20 minutes and the game had like 4 people on, the controls are broken, somehow looks like it was made in 1985, game is dookie, don't spend your dookie doubloons on it."
19949,It a good game if you have patience to learn it or a squad.
19950,"This game is amazing if you can put the time into it.

I have yet to learn so much about this game, and I don't have any extensive knowledge of the game, despite playing it for about 80 hours at the time of this review."
19951,War crimes.
19952,"I played a fair bit of this game and have found that you shouldn't play with friends who just spawn in vehicles and blow each other up over and over again on an airstrip for 6 hours at a time. The real multiplayer is fun for hardcore shooter gamers, but it's all just a bit too hyperrealistic and punk rock for me. I did like this game, but in small doses. I would recommend this game to someone in JROTC, or anybody who played with sticks and pretended they were guns when they were young."
19953,Much mods many wow
19954,"good game

19970,Nep nep nep nep nep nep nep
19971,its fun but hard
19972,"(warning I only have played this game for 2.5 hours so my opinion might not matter to you.
so far it's been really fun with friends from sneaking around and poping up and shooting the baddies in the butt to my friend trying to teach himself how to fly mid game and crashing and killing everyone in the helicopter. 
most of my short 2.5 hours was played by myself in zues with mods and i've had some pretty cool memories. nuking a russian controlled island to fighting terrorist groups in the middle east.  
I give multiplayer a 10/10 
and single player a 10/10
overall 100/10 do buy) 2020 review 

(almost got 3000 hours in this game 2 off my good mates got the game this year so ive had a lot of fun and frustrating moments with them this year. the Vietnam dlc was very good ive had so much fun shooting bush people with my mates in multiplayer have found a few fun single player missions on the workshop 
this year i rate the single player a 10/10 
and multiplayer a 100/10 
overall 110/10
very good would buy and this review is almost a year apart on the dot."

19982,very toxic
19983,war crime gaming
19984,"its a great game 
"
19985,"The 2.0 update added a gun and nothing and did not fix the badly needed optimization issues.. the game runs like garbage because it doesn't use all available cores... it is a lagfest with mods, and even in vanilla really. They desperately need to fix this. Downvote until fixed"
19986,One of my favorite games by far. May be hard to get into but worth the investment.
19987,i LOVE EVERYTHING about this game. If your looking to find a helpful and friendly community while playing a realistic first person shooter then Arma 3 is the game for you. It has everything for a person to do while people still have fun.
19988,:)
19989,"Great Game, Physics wise. somewhat average, but the immersion is 100

19990,Literally one of the best games i've played. So many fun times with friends.

20000,game is ok
20001,"I love this game! It really gives you the ""realistic"" battle feeling unlike any other shooter out there. It is a great game but i warn that without friends and a tiny (or large lol) dip into modding you won't experience it in full. There's alot of walking and alot of mundane activity especially for modded modes like Antistasi however if you can get past it it's amazing. Overall would recommend but take your time and check out modding."
20002,its a great game
20003,MY SON DIED WHILE PLAYING DIDN'T CARE THIS IS TOO FUN
20004,
20005,h
20006,"Great game in my opinion. This game is not a fast paced FPS. If you are looking for a game with a lot of action and shooting then this game isn't for you. This game is about taking it slow and communicating with teammates to plan out a strategy whether that's how to take over an outpost or even just rescue some hostages from a building. It will also take time to learn the controls but once you got it down it is hard to forget. The modding community is also another great thing about the game because there are hundreds of scenarios that you can play with friends. One downside to this game is that to be able to play with friends on a private server, you will need to port forward through your internet provider which is fairly easy but can be a hassle for others. My friends internet provider won't let him port forward as easily as it should be so this can be a problem for some people. One way to get around this is to just find an empty server so it's not all bad. The game has lots of weapons and vehicles and even an editor so you can make missions that you and your friend can play, assuming that the port forwarding that I mentioned above works well (it does for most people).

TLDR; Great game, hard to play with friends, I do suggest picking it up one day though."
20007,b :)
20008,"very tactical and thrilling game.
does not run very smooth"
20009,LOVE IT
20010,"Best war simulator out there its a bit too hardcore for my personal taste
Its not a game for everyone
Post scriptum/Squad are the kind of realism most people enjoy and its not over the top

Pros:
So much content I dont know where to start
A lot of mods

Cons:
Runs so bad barley playable sometimes
Walking simulator 90% off the time
Huge potential wasted
Take ages to get into very complicated for starters

If you into shooter simulators you cant go wrong with this one
If you like me ehh buy it only on sale,its not a game for most people
"
20011,very confusing controls not like your normal fps takes a while just too find a good server and when you find one with actual straight forward stuff after a while its most likely gonna be rp so if your not into too role play or dont have alot of time looking threw servers then maybe look else where but when you do find a good server its very fun you gotta get use too the  controls and find a good server it can be very fun.So this game is in the middle for me
20012,find a unit and have fun
20013,"bad interface, bad controls, bad graphics, bad gameplay, bad mechanmics, bad controls"
20014,Amazing game
20015,Poor optimization

20017,Absolutely YES
20018,TRASH.
20019,Fun game

20024,awsome
20025,"Honestly think this is the worst ""realistic army game"" I have ever seen/experienced.

First i'll start with the good:
- Game doesn't actually look that bad visually

Bad:

1. You don't get time to do anything. You are expecting to know everything quickly as possible before being screamed at by your Commander. For anyone that says ""that's the army,"" this was in bootc amp. I'm trying to tread the hints/tips so I can figure out the map and then you get mugged off/talked to as if you're some sort of reprobate. Like f*** off?

2. What sort of ""realistic army game"" doesn't allow you to look down your sights?????? I hit the targets but what is the point having a Red Dot or an ACOG when your character then just looks down the side of his gun like a f****** retard?

Whether they call this realistic or not is besides the point. The few minor things have put me off completely and I highly recommend that people don't waste their time with this is they think it is going to be ""fun."" There's plenty more realistic games out there that you can have a good laugh and enjoy the game play to. The boot camp was enough for me to see."
20026,pretty darn good. :)
20027,"Good game, very realistic, prepare to die a lot at the bigging but very rewarding"
20028,its has a fun mod base so many good ones and bad ones but allot are really good btw what i mean by bad is does't work well for me may work well for u so yeah try it
20029,Very realist and great to play with friends or a community.

20045,"sure, good game. I recommend."
20046,before the mods that let you swap your character model with an anime girl it kinda sucked but now its pretty good
20047,"Arma 3 is a game everyone should try once, if not for the core game itself but the never ending amount of engaging modding content that will give you hundreds of hours of gaming experiences that will stick with you for the rest of your life!

Pros:
- Solid Gunplay (can be jank at times)
- Realistic Military Simulator
- Sound Design is top notch
- Beautiful maps
- Modding scene is large

Cons:
- Buggy and jank physics
- Performance isnt the best

9.5/10 - Arma 4 please!"

20062,"It takes a little bit to get used to, but it's a very fun game, more so when you play with friends. It's a perfect military simulator with full character customization from head to toe. The vehicles are also in depth and fun to use, especially the helicopters. Overall, it's very enjoyable, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who's into military games (honestly if you like COD because of the military aspect, this game is for you)>\."
20063,"Fun game, choose the communities you join wisely, potential for annoying power trips is huge with a lot of milsim servers and units, that's very much like the real military though so if you do encounter it just know it adds to the immersion."

20070,yea
20071,"After releasing this game, they turned Greece into a real place, devs did it again.

But on a more serious note...
Have you ever wanted to get absolutely destroyed by an MRAP, only to restart the mission and do the exact same thing again? 
Have you always wanted to roam the vast islands of the broke fictional nation of Greece with a squad of brave guerilla forces who die the second they get engaged at?
Have you ever wanted to go on a hike, but realized you actually need to leave the house for that?
Want no longer, because Arma 3 has it all, including a fatigue system the Air Force PT instructors would be jealous of. Just kidding, they probably don't do PT.
Get deployed in a virtual NATO peacekeeping operation. Kind of sad there is no mission including cleaning the barracks twice because a senior NCO will be doing inspections, only for that person not to show up or like hours of waiting in attention.

Then there's multi-player mode, which I can't even explain because there's like 30+ different games people host servers for.
10/10 would recommend."

The graphic is looking as in the 2000s ordinary games and how I says the game play is a jock.   Then  I joined to the multiplayer games.  Tried several games but I was NEVER able to play it because I was never teleport into to the battle area.   Tried all the suggestions seen on web sites about how to proceed, but it never worked.  Terrible game."

20095,"This I must say is the best war game you can ever play. It is like the real experience of you being in any war. You can do any war you like because you can download mods (witch just takes 2 clicks to download). There is also every weapon you can think of (again you would have to download some mods), and they are actual real life weapons that were made exact in the game. I would really REALLY recommend this game."
20096,"To say the least, Arma 3 is a fun, Loud, Action Intense, Hurry Up And Wait military sim. Having spent almost 168 hours in game, at the time of the review, most of these hours in the editor because my pc is from the Dinosaur age, and can't run Super Mario, let alone Arma 3. But in all seriousness, Arma 3 is a great game, and most of that is because the modding community is huge. You could be anything from a Caveman, to a Stormtrooper, all thanks to the mods that the workshop has to offer. There's nothing like leading a head on assault against American troops during the battle of the bulge, or listening to the trees speak Vietnamese while Fortunate Son plays in the background. Of course this is all a lot more fun, when you aren't running at 10 FPS. (Please help I need a New PC, Godspeed!) The Vanilla game isn't completely terrible, but It's a lot more fun with mods. As far as game play goes, there is a big learning curve, with all of the separate controls and keybinds, but once you learn them, and tweak them to your liking, the game becomes much easier. Most of the Vanilla Mechanics are okay, but mods make them a lot better. The Vanilla sounds, and noises are okay, but of course there are always mods that improve them. (You see where i'm going with this whole modding thing?) Iv'e heard people say the graphics look kind of old, but the pictures look great! I don't actually know how the graphics really look maxed out, because my graphics look like a child came and threw a bunch of paint colors on a paint pallet, and then went ham on it. There are also lot's of community groups dedicated to Mil-Sim, or dedicated to just having fun. But iv'e never played a multiplayer game, because it takes 30 minutes for my pc to load a single map. All in all though, Arma 3 is a very fun game, with a dedicated player base and modding community, and it's got a lot to offer. but it's poorly optimized as sh*t. So don't try and play on a 10-12 year old PC. Oh and the Vanilla Ragdoll physics, will give you frequent Nightmares. But of course, mods will take care of that!"
20097,Yup.
20098,Game good

20178,Best MilSim game so far.
20179,"I gave it a chance, but at someone who plays with a controller this game is all but impossible. Its largely unsupported and even with custom mapping it just doesn't play well. I bought the game very excited after watching some game play footage, but wow, just an awful experience. I entirely regret purchasing and my request for a refund, almost $60 if i recall correctly, was denied. Complete waste of money for me, I'll never play it again.

Graphics do look nice and the sounds Ill say were nice as well."
20180,Really good game the graphics and mechanics of the game are very well developed and I would recommend this game to everyone.
20181,"I love this game, but ADORE this game with mods (and friends)

A few friends and a lotta mods can turn this game from a realistic infantry focused tactical shooter where real military tactics can be used to their fullest into a chaotic fuck fest where a fursuiter flies a helicopter holding an armored truck being driven by three military dress-up fans and a man wearing S.W.A.T gear and cargo shorts on a mission to kill high-value targets while avoiding cryptids like Wendigos and shadowmen.

If that doesn't sound like fun, I don't know what does."

20225,"Arma 3 is a nice slow pace militarized simulator/ Open world game. It has realistic military vehicles and or gear/ equipment. It provides millions of different ways to play the game, including custom made maps and game modes to enhance the game intensively.

20231,"My PC doesn't run the game too well, but, I have a very cheap PC.

What I can do is use the editor, and let me tell you, it's great! 

This is a review of the scenario editor (Eden Editor) in the game.


You get access to a great number of buildings, blocks, and other items. 
Massive amounts of infantry, and you can even set a player and play as one of your units! (It automatically sets the first unit placed as a player, double click to open the menu to disable the ""player"")

I've got a very shitty HP laptop, and I'm able to run operations with small, medium, and large squads. I've been able to have around 40 OPFOR charge into a choke point of around 5 Friendly forces. It barely lagged.

I would recommend this game for the editor. 

Mods make the experience much better, too.


I'll edit the review, and review multiplayer, and the campaigns when I get a better PC."
20232,"I have been playing this game for years. I have played Arma 1, 2, and 3. For some reason I can neverm seem to get Arma 3 to do what it's supposed to do. I just decided to pick up some DLC with a COOP campaign and BAM! Server failed to respond. If this was the first issue I have had with game I wouldn't be so annoyed. Just seems like every time I wanna play with friends this game has other plans. I am a network professional and have many many years in IT work and everything is set up and should work according to the instructions. I am tired of broken games and spending hours trying to troubleshoot issues that shouldn't exist."
20233,BEST
20234,"fun game as a base, mods are where its at"
20235,"Love this game so far!! Reminds me a lot of Operation Flash Point from back in the day. Fairly realistic and some challenge, What I love most is the fact using real life Military Tactics (Spent some time in the Military) actually is very effective... which normally isn't the case with video games such as COD or Battle Field so thats dope!  I Do recommend this game, especially one sale lol

20259,yes
20260,The game makes no sense
20261,"Good coop fps platform. Single is very much underdeveloped, but the multiplier is really awesome just like arma 2"
20262,"I like this game though the one thing that bothers me is the swaying and aiming. I have never seen such unsteady aim even when I am prone and holding the shift key. it is stupid of me constantly dying cause my guy can't aim people 100m while I can get one taped from 500m by ai in their assualt riffles without a scope. how can I get headshoted when I have a standard military helment capable to stop a .50 cal? I have hold and shot guns before and even my first time had little sways compared to ones in the game, these guys are soldiers, so I can assume that they are trained to be more accurate than what the game is potraying."

"
20266,"Campaign is awesome, cant really comment on the multiplayer but i assume thats great too if you have friends to play with"
20267,Arma 3 is fun
20268,"Overall a good game, there is a ton to do and you will never be bored while playing this game. One thing though is that you should buy some of the DLC, it makes you have a better experience in-game. You can play by yourself or with friends and there are plenty of mods in the workshop to make the game more fun. I would recommend this game to anyone looking into tactical games. I would buy when on sale"
20269,it game
20270,arma 3 is a game that if you want to make your own world and battles then do it. The multiplayer is somewhat alive but the community is still creating awesome content for it.

20279,Beautiful game
20280,Good game but sometimes its toxic but overall good
20281,"A 8.5/10 game cut to 7/10 because of the control system, realism issues in a supposed mil-sim and abysmally poor flight controls. Hopefully they will introduce a voice command (there is a community one for download) or radial command system for the AI Squad in singleplayer in the next Arma to prevent the need for pressing multiple buttons just to get the squad to pick up ammo. Implementing a flight control system like War Thunders would be a huge improvement over what is in Arma, its extremely dated. If you can look past the controls and command menu issues the game is good enough. It is just showing its age. Get it on sale only."
20282,"get on, join a server, get kicked, join another, get kicked, try find a group of ppl on something and  fail ,  get annoyed try one more time get kicked join another get told to buy DLC look at the DLC theres like 15 diffrent ones dont buy it cuz you know when you do youll still just get kicked while trying to join a server.

probably a good game but everytime i try to join anything i just get kicked"
20283,It's a military simulator game. You can't jump around gun blazing. It need communication and coordination to make it fun
20284,"game good, fun a lot

20288,"Nice graphics. You will need sometime to understand how it works, but all in all its great."
20289,it's a very good game. players must have to be patient and strategically sound.
20290,"Finally gave this game a shot while clearing my backlog and this will likely stay in play cycle for years. Unlimited replayability but is better with friends / a squad. 

1. Do the tutorial 
2. Run through a single player mission to get familiar with the controls
3. (Optional) Watch some Arma videos on youtube to get insider info / tips. I recommend OperatorDrewski's Arma KotH playlist. 
4. Hop into a PVP or PVE server. I recommend KotH (King of the Hill). Would further recommend either the Code4Gaming servers (https://codefourgaming.com/our-servers/) or the ArmaKotH Servers (https://codefourgaming.com/our-servers/).

If you decide to play KotH, be careful when visiting the Code4Gaming servers, they have a regular KotH and an RHS KotH. The latter is modded and, although you may have a different experience, I tend to drop frames in the big city on that server."
20291,great game! Koth is my favorite but every game mode is great only complaint is that the direct chat is sometimes to low and you need to turn up effects to turn up the direct chat volume.

There are some hiccups, like when we are attempting to break out of a prison, and the AI guards suddenly walk through the solid wall or door... doesn't happen often, but it is a quirk which pops up once in a while.  There's also the sense that AI can see you through walls, tall grass, and smoke.  But it's still an excellent simulation/game for an FPS.  The detail in the scenery, vehicles, and weapons is fantastic.  Go enjoy."
20331,This is an excellent game with a lot of customization ability
20332,You commit war crimes
20333,very good game
20334,Best milsim game out there PERIOD
20335,it good
20336,"Arma 3 is one of the best games I have ever played. ENDLESS amount of content and hundreds of communities from all around the world. in short buy it

Starting off with the good. At first you do not know what to do and where to start. I started off with single player scenarios, and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to describe them besides bizarre and new. Learning how the game works, using the arsenal creating the ultimate kit and using it in a firefight is just amazing. After a while I started using 3den, I spent over 200 hours making missions and scenarios on the workshop, and oddly enough I still failed to learn any coding. Once I discovered public Zeus I spent days playing with random people doing all kinds of operations and having a great time, I met people who taught me stuff about myself and helped me improve myself as a person, and quite literally improved my charisma and social confidence, which is to this day, bizarre to me, how a video game and its community can change how you act in real life. Once I learned about units I joined a unit called Gamma company, I learned about task force radio and ACE, I went through a Chris Kyle phase where I thought I was a good marksman, spoiler alert I sucked at long range combat and reconnaissance, I found my calling with ace medical, and god is ace a blessing to the Arma community. My experiences in Arma and Gamma company are unreplaceable, and I could not ask for a better game to spend over 1000 hours of my life on. Arma is the first game where I felt no rage and I genuinely had fun, no anger, and no frustrating moments. I genuinely love this game.


And now to the bad parts of this game. God ow god is this game poorly optimized, this game fucking sucks when it comes to frames, do not expect more than 40 frames, although your experience might differ than mine but fuck you bohemia for @ss f-cking my laptop you freaks. AI is terrible, they‚Äôre stupid, god forbid you give them an order in zeus, they‚Äôll do the opposite, heal in the middle of a field file getting shot at by a tank, they‚Äôll run over their own teammates including you. And although they are stupid, they must be some of the worlds best marksmen because they‚Äôll snipe you a mile away like your nothing, and if you want them to attack a position NOPE ILL FUCKING TURN AROUND AND WALK 5 MILES AND SWIM ACROSS THE OCEAN RATHER THAN WALK 100M TOWARDS THE ENEMY. And to my favorite part, the physics engine, god forbid you touch a rock at 10 Kmph and you‚Äôll turn into a mig-29 and break the speed of light and leave the atmosphere. Basically the physics is fucked, you could ram a MBT(main battle tank) with a beach buggy and you‚Äôll send it flying into the sky rendering it dead. The last thing I have to say is that this game is NOTHING without the modding community, vanilla arma gets old very quickly and without the DLC‚Äôs its not even worth 10$. Sway is absurd, not a lot of content, limited stuff to do with zeus, and is simply not as fun without mods. Keep in mind that if you want to get the best of arma your going to need A LOT of mods.


overall arma 3 is one of the best games I‚Äôve played, probably the best game I‚Äôve played behind Halo 3."
20337,very fun mil sim.
20338,add nukes
20339,oftenly crash
20340,I must say it: This game recive a Very big + from me for realistic. You can make fun with your friends or without them if you don't have it :(
20341,I lift my mouse more than the other pro's
20342,game is gud
20343,Great super realistic military sim. A must play if you like shooters.
20344,Altis life is hella fun

20348,Very Good.
20349,TOPS
20350,good tactical shooter
20351,thank you bohemia very cool
20352,The tutorial is taking a while but if the rest of the game is this good then it's worth it!
20353,"the game is very fun but if you are in australia i would highly recomend straya invade and annex
"
20354,"Its arma, you love it or hate it but if done right it's a great time"
20355,Very tactical. Also a lot of fun to just jump in and build a mission with some buddies and blast away. And the community is amazing! The mods are just fantastic! Anyone who wants to get into tactical real(ish) combat should pick this up!
20356,"u kill iranians
"
20357,"Great Game , tons of options in ref to mods ."
20358,"Fun asf,camping is a great way of getting u started,would reccommend to change some of the settings though"
20359,hgviuj
20360,Love the fact that I can edit and mod my own maps I love this game please build an Arma 4 that would support RTX I think that would be Rad
20361,"1. The game is terribly optimized, or rather, there is no optimization at all.
2. DLC. Well, that's it. The game just looks like some kind of PC lacking important components. Without DLC, you cannot sit in half of the vehicle, you cannot use a large number of weapons and characters. Roughly speaking, you are forced to buy the game a second time, because the game costs around 1000 R, so also the most important DLC costs at least 1000 R. The rest of the DLCs are already to choose from, but also are of no small importance.
3. Support for developers. Recently a new add-on, ARMA 3: Contact (correct, I may be wrong) came out, so it is so unplayable that it cannot be described in a word or with a pen. Constant lags, freezes, FPS around 25 are the norm. And with all this, the game is almost 6 years old. Yes, they released a patch that fixed the lion's share of bugs, but more still remained.
So in my opinion, buy at a discount or on various sites like - Zaka-Zaka. Because at the full price it is taken, the hand will not rise. And okay, if it was the only game in its genre - I would have thought. However, there is still some SQUAD (I haven't played, I don't know). However, many say that there are enough problems there. Perhaps this is the curse of such games in this genre. After all, the ARMA series has always been considered the most laggy of all.
Guys, please understand - this is my personal opinion
I will recommend her"

20373,Good game lots of content and fun to play with friends
20374,"I have played over 1 hour of this game, its great.
I used to play on a 32 bit pc with 2 gb of ram and no graphics card. nowadays i play on I7 laptop and the fun is the same.
Its a complex game, not difficult, just complex.
used to play the cracked version but i liked it so much i decided to support the developer by buying the game and all available dlcs at the time."
20375,:)
20376,Am gay lol
20377,"wasted 3 hours just to try to play mp with a friend, lose of time"
20378,"I would see this game to people who have seen a lot of interest in the realism of mil-sim games, I did buy this game with no mods for a long time, then a I began to use them, and it has never been a better way to experience the game."
20379,It's alright I guess.
20380,good game
20381,fun fun fun for every one one one
20382,yes
20383,Louis is trolling
20384,"There's a huge variety of things to do on this game. If you buy it, and make the effort to learn the controls, you will never be bored playing it. There's mil-sim, casual combat games like KOTH, roleplay servers and even the singleplayer/co-op is extremely fun. I will say the learning curve is huge, most people I know buy this and don't like it because it's not very intuitive. If you're looking for a game to casually play a few hours on, this isn't it."
20385,"With only a few hours of play so far the game has a tactical realism that is hard to find in FPS games. With the extensive options for body positioning finding and using cover is not too hard. That being said the AI reacts to your movements much better than I expected, there is very little delay in the enemy AIs ability to lay down cover fire and advance their positions. Also team AI actually aids in the elimination of enemies which is nice since several games I've played seem to have the worst AI teammates with the inability to hit their targets, so having AI that can eliminate enemies is a nice change. I'll continue on and add to this review as/if my opinion changes. For now, Good luck."
20386,great gamee would really recommend

20390,"terrible. wasted my money. confusing keybinds, don't even mention half of useful tools in training."
20391,"Masterpiece, hundreds of games in one. A staple of any steam collection."
20392,While I have very rarely (If at all!) played the campaign; or any scenarios; I can say this. Even if you don't wanna play those; cool. But it's a good tool to make content for other people; or just making scenes.
20393,awesome game all good
20394,yes
20395,"Have fun
"
20396,"Dear Bohemia, plez mak ArmA 4 qwik.

ty"
20397,"Although I have NOT played much I gathered enough to give a short unbiased review.
First, this game is not for everyone. 
The game involves high realism, whether that's a pro or con depends on who is asked.
It seems to be generally agreed the performance is subpar, so expect low FPS.
Overall my personal score would fall around 3/5.
Of course, your milage will vary."
20398,very nice hehe boi
20399,"realistic gun game, fun and play fun but this guy i know, michael kennith walker really sucks although this is unrelated to my review or this game"
20400,I forgot how to shoot gun ngl
20401,"love the game the mods make it alot more fun
"
20402,"Not a game your average normie would be in to, but hey thats why we have battlefield and cod, and for people that can appreciate this game it offers so much more than those two titles put together. If you know what your in to and what youll be getting with this title, dont hesitate, if your a casual looking for a new game to mess around on then this isnt the game for you."
20403,best milsim i've ever played
20404,One of the best mil sims game I have played I really enjoy and I recomend you try it if you like these types of games
20405,its aight
20406,its good
20407,"probably one of, if not THE most immersive games ive ever played, steep learning curve but worth it, and ive only ever played singeplayer"
20408,Play koth kill everyone
20409,"I personally think that in the short amount of time I've played this game I should have played more builds instead of just going for a ""Gun Purist"" build, can't wait for Bohemia to make melee, unarmed, stealth, and Ghillie Monster builds more viable. Shoutout to my homie Ben Kerry for literally being a terrorist and a puppet of Daddy Miller for a couple months and to Nathan MacDade for being a balding EOD specialist that hits up call girls roleplaying as reporters for the AAN.

20439,Really realistic
20440,IMO this game take some getting used too ive jumped in and played around with all of the vehicles (have all DLC) and ive learned most of if not all of the controls in the editor mode ive done some other things like mess around with mods and other things. my overall opinion of this simulator or game is that i approve so please give this title a try!
20441,"Very good game, it got like mods and shit and you can have fun and you can like join some communities and be like yoooooooooooooo i bomb some shit and shoto shit and lkike have da fun u alswa want pew pew"

20453,pretty good
20454,Honestly isn't as good as it looks on youtube. Running around with 30 fps even when I have a pretty high end pc. The only partly fun thing has been the coop missions and the game is absolutely ruined by hundreds of dlcs most servers have guns from dlcs and they're the most common ones you can find. Unless you're absolutely rich and don't mind wasting over 50$ on this game go for it.
20455,"It's a great game, but you really need to play with friends to enjoy it.  There's not much to do on your own without buying DLC."
20456,idk how this game is from 2012 but it is the best game on the planet
20457,It consumed my soul and I love it for that
20458,"decent game. nickle and diming people with dlcs is extremely obnoxious, and the voice acting is one of the worst things ive ever heard. game also runs pretty badly no matter what. 2/10"

Alright we have lost contact with Pishi, he probably has died in the battlefield and now I will write the review instead
first of all, u will NOT find a game like ARMA, no game is like this, maybe u find a game that u like more than ARMA but still, this is a unique game, u can design all sorts of operations or moments in real wars and play your role as a simple soldier who will die with a single bullet
a full scale war? fighting the insurgents? fighting as a guerrilla army? all styles are possible
and now about roles...a team leader who gets all his soldiers killed because he is a good gamer in COD but not a smart tactician in ARMA? do u know how logistics are important? did u know providing CAS at the right time can change the outcome of a war? have u ever used a tank to force enemies break their formations? a deadly sniper who is hard to be found? an engineer who places nice traps against enemy convoys? a highly skilled transport pilot? a UAV operator? a Medic can sometimes save an entire squad! 
what ever u want! depends on your style!
there is also an unlimited amount of mods for this game that change the gameplay completely!
I highly recommend this game with all official DLCs
some unique moments are waiting for you! hope u enjoy it!"
20509,"very good game

20519,"If you have a halo mod, it is basically better than Halo's AI battles you see on Youtube."
20520,.
20521,"Even for 7.49 I do not recommend this game. Sounds are decent, that's about it. Such a bad game, not to mention its made by the same fraudulent devs that brought us DayZ. Not only is the game insanely bad, it's also DEAD, took me 30 mins to look for a server with people in it. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
20522,epic
20523,+
20524,long range pew pew and brrrrrrrrrr
20525,best milsim
20526,"Great Milsim style game for those that like true ballistics of bullets, rifles, and movement. Deeply enjoy this game."
20527,"the end ,many questions in game, i cant to search normal , i cant go left or right, i cant to see another sides, need time for game, difficult, cuz how many powers was lost to enter game , XDDDD
Not for girls, need to find some info how to play or not ?wrong, cause this game something ugly, u bought with contact and nothing to have , was be funny , but not even time when u bought game"
20528,Game is great places 930 hours
20529,Really enjoying this game. And was well worth buying
20530,"Great sim, fully addicted."
20531,"AMAZING
BEAUTIFUL"
20532,"Arma is a game that's never hard to come back to - once you've learned its many controls. With the amount of things you can do ranging from serious, tactical milsim to something as goofy as a roleplay server; Arma 3 is a great foundation for many game types. Though its main, and likely intended application is to be a military simulator or just serious, huge scale combined arms war game, it excels at that and more. Chances are, if you're here reading this you already know what you're in for. If not, I would highly recommend looking at some videos first. You won't get a proper sense here from reviews."
20533,Its like vietnam. but without the asians
20534,"Froze my PC for several minutes several times crashed it once broke the audio on my headphones runs like trash constantly displays ads if you don't have a DLC the server has the game also freezes constantly and crashes there are also heaps of bugs, never buy it for full price"
20535,"C O N T E N T

From Servers, to DLCs, to Mods. The Game has SO much to it. I have loved it since Day 1. Would highly recommend for ANYONE looking to play DayZ again, King of The Hill, TDM, RP on a server ect. There is EVERYTHING. And its still highly populated!"
20536,The homie keeps vibe checking me.
20537,Fun times for all and getting ARMA'd is a personal tragedy.
20538,Best coop. PERIOD !
20539,me have fun yes me
20540,this game has hit my expection when i played it
20541,"Played a little, good fun I guess. Looking forward putting more time on it."
20542,great for milsim
20543,good
20544,"This is a game that your either gonna love or hate, if your unsure get it on sale. The controls can be intimidating but are oddly quite intuitive, if you give it a chance. The game is pretty buggy but really doesn't take anything anyway from the game. This isnt a rush game and you can easily look back at your last hour played and start wondering why your wasting your life lying in a bush or walking across the map ( there's a lot of walking ). This is one of the few games that I play online as the community in my experience is welcoming and fun to play with."
20545,yes very good very good
20546,my pants wet
20547,is good
20548,virtual war crimes
20549,amazing game and is epic
20550,"yes good game

20551,Great game
20552,its really fun making your own missons in the editer and there is tons of mods in the workshop many hours of plkay time
20553,Great Game A Must Play!
20554,Getting robbed simulator.
20555,nope
20556,been coming back to this game over and over again for years...love it
20557,"One of the few games I spent a 1000 hours on. 
It is what you make of it and how well you fit in within the community.

Arma is simply put, the real deal.

"
20558,played Altis Life and a cop arrested me when I said I was black. 10/10 so realistic
20559,"Yes
"
20560,"Nearly 500 hours in and still enjoying it. Get it while its cheap, join a MILSIM, lose your life. Job done."
20561,Is a good game
20562,"its good
"
20563,"Hmmm, yes. Good game. Asthmatic walking simulator. Fun"
20564,Simply put amazing 10/10.
20565,very goooood game
20566,good game would recomend it for sure. The singleplayer is okay but this game is amazing for milsim  (if you have a high spec pc)
20567,"Graphics may be dated but add 30 or so mods, a group of 10+ players and a good Zeus GM and you won't find a better, more complex pretend army game out there. 


The version I play is nothing like the vanilla version due to mods. Personally I wasn't a fan of the single player campaigns as I purchased this game for teamwork and die too often alone. There are some great vanilla co-op scenarios from the developer available and workshop missions if you don't want to use mods."
20568,It's ok
20569,"Arkada≈ülar ≈üimdi kesin bir ≈üey s√∂ylemek zor hikaye i√ßin oynayacaksanƒ±z √ßok g√ºzel DLC paketleri mevcut onun dƒ±≈üƒ±nda at√∂lye de var biraz, fakat RPG i√ßin oynƒ±yacaksanƒ±z biraz sƒ±kƒ±ntƒ± ya≈üarsƒ±nƒ±z."

20571,i am having fun playing it
20572,Find friends to play this game with and go on the hunt for quality mods. Do those two things and you could play this game until you die from old age.
20573,l
20574,It's the perfect military sim that offers players to continue to add to the game through player created content.
20575,I dont like aidan
20576,nah
20577,it is good to play
20578,Very unorganized menu. No clue about anything.
20579,"Is bretty gud, basically military g-mod with a popin' community. 10/10 would feed military industrial complex by also selling it as Virtual Battlespace 3 again!"
20580,Still the best and still going strong. Pick it up now in the sale and get stuck into the best milsim game around
20581,g
20582,eh shit game really but maybe fun with friends hat like to LARP
20583,poop fart
20584,"other than having 100000 keybinds, extremely fun sandbox"

20589,Obligatory war crime joke haha
20590,"Just like in real life, when you get shot you almost never know where its coming from unless they're right in front of you."
20591,"Played the Prologue, knew it was worth it. If it's on sale, buy the game with every dlc."
20592,fun
20593,Best military sim ever
20594,my chink down the street offered me 2 toenails for this game and i said no only because mr.crunk wanted to buy the game for 200 spollings so yeee. ching chong
20595,"Warcrime and Walking simulator.

Play with friends on small custom missions or with a large group of strangers doing MilSim.

Optimized for sh*t and barely runs on a 2019 upper midrange pc at max settings. Luckily, these max settings don't really do much."
20596,GREAT FUN IF YOU ARE LOOKIMG FOR SOMETHING REALISTIC

20609,"Pretty fun, not many players though. kinda sucks that  you have to join a giant map and wait an hour to kill. A lot of vehicles and weapons need a dlc."

20611,the best mil sim out their
20612,Awesome game with tons of opportunities for expansion.

20635,"very fun, especsially with a group"
20636,i no get kill. i only die
20637,"I enjoy the single player missions, especially amalgamation.  You can cause an infinite amount of chaos and run your little war the way you see fit.  Although, I would recommend 32 gb of memory.  That makes all the difference in the world.  This is still a very enjoyable game."
20638,good first shooter game and the editer is insane for making your own battles
20639,Love me some war crimes
20640,"The game is good if your looking for a realistic military simulator, Please note the keybinds are hard to learn but when you do it is a blast to play
"
20641,HEAVY
20642,"Amazing game, The best Mill Sim out there.

A few things of note although; This game does have a steep learning curve, It will take more time then most games to become proficient at. Along with this you will also need a decent PC to run it.

- Yeah, I see that. Daddy gave you good advice!
- It gets bigger when I pull on it
- MMmMmmMmM
- Sometimes I pull it on so hard I rip the skin
- Well, my daddy told me a few things to like uh, how not to rip the skin by using someone else‚Äôs mouth instead of your own hands.

- I‚Äôll be right happy to!"
20646,"Arma 3 is a game where you can just suck hours into for a reason, not only is the support from the developers very high with new DLC throughout the year but a huge following of fans that create their own mods for the game. Arma was also the foundation for Project Reality which subsequently became an actual game of itself called SQUAD. Arma is the best sandbox out there from Roleplaying to kicking down doors on extremely hostile enemy forces. You won't regret purchasing this game!"
20647,"fun
"
20648,Cmon its arma 3
20649,kk
20650,Top
20651,"this is a game with many glitches and bugs but still fun to play. (always a plessure to see someone flying to mars on an rp server)
movement is weird and chunky. 
but over all a fun experience"
20652,"I played this game for like 3 hours and i tried giving it a chance but i just could not find it fun, one of my friends told me to play this with him because it's really realistic and fun but it's not fun. Sure this game could e classified as a realistic military simulator and if you're into that i completely understand, that's cool, what I do have a problem with is that this game is barely optimized even thought it has been out for 7 years and counting and it's not very fun unless you are super into these types of games. I refunded this game shortly after playing it"
20653,"I like milsim, this is very milsim.
This is the most in depth milsim I have ever been able to find.
It is by no means flawless, but I cannot find a better alternative for now."
20654,"Arma has the potential to be one of a kind. If played how it's meant to be it's a thrill. But in my experience it's dominated by hardcore excessively controlling hierarchy on guilds or a complete circus on public servers.
I've withnessed endless ours of 40 coops players sniping poor bots at 1 km range. In other words, the game mods don't protect the players from themselves. The engine is bad.
How to play it then? Coop with coordinated non hardcore friends, or go find another game for you."
20655,its arma
20656,"Um dos melhores simuladores que conhe√ßo, com v√°rios DLC's e uma infinidade de mods que tornam o jogo mais din√¢mico e imersivo, vale com certeza a compra, principalmente se voc√™ tiver mais amigos com o jogo. Se n√£o for o caso, pode entrar em partidas online e rapidamente criar um esquadr√£o, esse aqui vale demais a pena!"
20657,can get a couple hours out of it
20658,/
20659,download the unsung mod its fucking awesome
20660,"They got buggies, there are hellachoptros and jetboys. modify things like stuff and guys, or find a server and download all the stuff required to figure out you want to play somewhere else, and then do it.

Arma 3 puts the 3 in Arma 3"

20667,Machine gun goes brrrrrrrrrrrr
20668,very good game. one of the most realistic if not the most realistic modern warfare game. need some optimizing to make it run smoothly on most of the devices. my pc has the requirement graphic card and cpu etc. to run this game yet i cant hit the smooth 60 fps or above in cities. gameplay wise very good a little bit slow but thats the point of a game like arma 3 . i can recommend this game its another experience if you have friends to play with. good game 8/10 -1 for optimizing -1 for the f*cking dlc adds that pops up every time im in a chopper or something
20669,Yes
20670,"this game has made me erect for multiple hours at a time, please consider buying, it will make you cum in 30 seconds!"

20675,Piece of overambitious spread thin garbage Single player experience. I want to play and I can't say it is because is much of a challenge but more not doing enough on their part of the deal. The Team control interface in the second camping mission where you have to intercept the convoy is a complete piece of trash.

20710,Nice
20711,Arma 3 is such a wholesome game no cap... i don't play comp i play RPG mode and co-op and its sooo much fun i may be fortunate that i found a helpful and fun community you can lose yourself playing it  and i would recommend it to lots of people ... you like shooty shooty game ... it has it ... you like shooty shooty fast get go zoom zoom ... it has it... you like tuff tank with guns that go boom boom ... you guessed it it has it... you wanna just play your role as a combat medic heal people or a pilot who just drops of people and tanks  in combat zones its all there and you are not just fixed to 1 role ... pick up a sniper rifle ... or get a rocket launcher. PLEASE AND I WILL BEG AGAIN PLEASE DON'T GET TO A SERVER AND TRY LEARNING TO BE A PILOT IN THERE ... LOL it will end in tears... so by all means .... buy this game and play it... if you can get the DLCS too coz it kinda sucks without them
20712,amazing game so much customisation available for person and vehicle
20713,I didnt wanna type anything    Gud game
20714,Best ever!
20715,"Friend gets me game to play realistic milsim roleplay with mission via zeus. Was fun.

Then I helped a random greek warlord named Petros liberate Altis, after hijacking an M1 Bradley which was second to none. Then it flipped over and my teammate tried to unflip it for 5 seconds before our bullet retardant vests became tonight's biggest loser.

Americans got really mad and started airlifting tons of special forces who had laser sights that made them literally stick out the minute you turned on night vision.

Then the Russians didn't do anything while the Americans kept fighting, so they remained small and unthreatening, which was very cyka and much blyat.

10/10 would liberate Altis again

P.S. America please drop more special forces with their funny laser sights, I want your M4 Sopmods.
Only at 7 out of 15 required for infinite, please.

Antistasi is fun, and the F-15E is based"
20716,Best Military sandbox simulator out there!
20717,"Lesson's learned.  Must have a mouse or controller.  Only thing I don't like is that there are commands that require a mouse and can't be done from a keyboard, or I can't find the command.  Second, for what ever reason, I have to crouch and stand back up all of the time so that I can turn using the mouse pad on my laptop.  Other than those two things, I have been loving the game play!!  Graphics are incredible, lots of stuff to do, and just an amazing game."
20718,''
20719,"One of the best sandboxes of all time, despite it's age and bugginess sometimes, this game holds true to this day and age! I Highly recommend joining up with a Milsim unit of some type, it'll boost your experience and time with the game even further! Even with fictional weapons and forces (somewhat), this game does a pretty good job with it's mechanics and realism, and nails it to a 'T! 
If you haven't played this game before, you're missing out, specially since it's an oldie but goodie!

Also, if you're looking for a Milsim unit, slide into https://www.taskforce121.us/ and tell 'em I sent ya! 
We're a group of cool, laidback dudes with a passion to game together every weekend with other stuff going on during the week as well, we'd be glad to have ya!"
20720,This game has been a real treat for me even though it says I have less than 100 hours I do actually have much more than that logged into the game on different accounts. I love Arma and cannot wait to see what the developers bring out next.
20721,"runs as smooth as a slideshow

don't drive into static objects or else the physics engine will send your 60-tonne tank to space

10/10, great game"
20722,"Hands down my favorite game of all time.  Challenging, huge open world, pilot/crew any vehicle, air, land and sea operations.  Mod-able to the nth degree.  Scenario editor leads to infinite replayability.  Simply the most fun I've ever had over the years I've owned the game.  I've played it in spurts, but have always come back to it.  I leave it installed because it is a mainstay."

20729,Took this long to finish all the campaign.
20730,"Good, but hard game i'm not complaining though."
20731,Game is trash.
20732,Games alright I guess
20733,don't know how i feel yet
20734,look at my hours. find a milsim. stick with em.
20735,I got these 55 hours in a week and a half span. mods help too. eden is fun if you like playing by yourself.
20736,very cool
20737,its really fun
20738,Obama Drone go boom
20739,"A large lering curve, bt if you stay commited, or if your steping up the laddre of difficulty, you can get really good
"
20740,"Arma 3 is a comprehensive take on military simulation. It may seem dated to some at this point, in 2020. but rest assured this is easily one of the greatest shooter style games ever created. Be warned - if you are expecting a Call of Duty or Battlefield experience then you will be disappointed; however, if you give this a chance you will see the richness it brings to the genre. Whether you like story driven, or simply shooting multiplayer, there is a part of the Arma world which will satisfy your needs. This game has the best campaign created in a military based game. It is expansive, requires varying skills and tasks, as well as allows the player to take part in scouting missions between regular missions in which you are free to roam the countryside looking for loot. The best part is that the campaign tracks your weapons and equipment inventory throughout - so if you don't scavenge some NVGs and come across a night mission... well you don't get the handout of a free set. Likewise, if you find a gun that you really love, be it a .50 cal sniper rifle, squad weapon, or even a static grenade launcher and tripod, you can loot those items and use them in your upcoming missions. The game is difficult in some ways, but is also very easy to learn and a wonderful experience. On top of that the devs have worked hard on additional content. You can battle on a Greek Island, in the jungle of the south pacific, the dense forests of Europe or the classic island of Malden, if you are familiar with the original Operation Flashpoint (re-branded Arma Cold War Assault). This game is still worth every dollar even in 2020, but if you get it on sale, then it's a no-brainer!"
20741,fun
20742,"Has some bugs, and optimisation issues with mp servers. But overall a very good game!"
20743,"gun shoot bang, realistic"
20744,bing bing bang bang
20745,"I have officially played this game for 6090 hours hahah funny number ree. fun game, physics, non existent. Easiest way to get the moon in a video game."
20746,.
20747,gud game very recommend
20748,"Arma is a great game, that even after 800 hours+ I havent fully mastered. Lots of mods and ways to play this game. Join a unit and get linked with some like minded people. This is a game for not only for tactics but also social."
20749,Ace
20750,"I only ever play editor, and I only make scenarios for myself so it's alright I guess."
20751,It's good.
20752,Buy it on sale and play with friends
20753,The hours speaks for itself.
20754,"Cant beat it.
"
20755,"Pretty good, better than Cyberpunk"
20756,it make pp hard.
20757,This game is confusing but fun at times
20758,"Its pretty good yo

But for real, it's really fun. It's community is fairly good, unlike COD, or [Insert Currently Popular Battle Royal]. The way that NOT having DLCs works is really good too. After over 5 years of existing, there is no lack of populated servers, Discord communities, massive overhauling mods, etc. I haven't had it for very long, only at the time of this review having a little over 100 hours into it, but playing multiplayer, I don't feel that separated from the people who have 1000 hours. It's far harder than most FPS games, due to being a Military Sim and not something like COD or Halo, but that holds its own fun in itself. Even though it was released back in 2013, its still getting a little bit of work here and there to this game, compared to some modern games who where dropped after 2 years. If you're a modder or just someone who likes using them, you're gonna have LOTS of fun. Solid 8.5/10."
20759,"
realistic"
20760,"it's arma, you know what you're getting into with a realistic militairy sim and this one takes the crown. just be sure you really like these types of games or else it's a waste of money"
20761,"games awesome with all the different stuff you can do
"
20762,.
20763,good game
20764,fun to play
20765,.
20766,Absolutely love this game! If you want to squeeze everything out of it you will need a bit of a modpack.
20767,"It's really fun, there are some things that aren't perfectly accurate, as many things in reality. For example, fall damage, if you've got a little bit of experience in falling you can reduce the damage you do to your body substantially. Falling 10 feet is falling one story, it's not that bad, most people can not be harmed just because you're going to buckle your knees and you might be slightly hurt but it won't be serious and you'll be fine in like a minute, in this game the damage isn't proportional to that at all. But the guns are what I perceive as accurate. Overall a really enjoyable game. Play Antistasi, it's dope. Don't put an ied down near your commander tho, you'll be thrown in the ocean for a minute and more if you do it again. It's easy to do it, so expect it to happen at least once if you play it for a while. Not a good interface in antistasi."
20768,Goooood simulator
20769,o;asdizhf;laskjhdf
20770,Very fun with friends.
20771,this game is one of the best mill sims ive ever played with the right mods ofcorse
20772,Fun.
20773,"Cool game. Walk for a long time, shoot 3 people and die"
20774,tis good
20775,"doodoo 
"
20776,My most recommended army RPG
20777,Game still holds strong. High learning curve and lots of different aspects to master but still very approachable and engaging in any mode. The community plus modding potential make this a game of limitless possibilities
20778,good but it crashed and i deleted battle eye
20779,lit fam
20780,Very additive
20781,War crimes
20782,"Its alright i guess

20783,It's cool.
20784,pew pew
20785,Ive been laying this for years by far one of the top 3 most realistic military shooters out there.
20786,Yeah it's a fun game.
20787,BRI'ISH PEOPLE BE LIKE 'AY LOW FREE
20788,berry fun
20789,"A game not intended for competitive people, if you expect a bug free experience or a skill based outcome I would say you have the wrong mindset. This game is meant to be played for personal enjoyment and fun, if you play for any other reason expect to not enjoy your time. Bugs happen, missions get ended early, and games get lost for various reasons but if you enjoy the satisfaction of military weapons in a long term based game, then you will love this game more than any other game out there."
20790,suck
20791,good game :D
20792,":)
"
20793,i love having 40 frames max
20794,"Ok So for my first review i will do this game? Why? Well let me explain... See when i first heard about this game, it was watching someone do a roleplay on youtube acting as a cop and such. At the time I could hope and pray to play a game like this because all i had at the time was a EEE netbook XD(Still was able to run San Andreas with mods and SAMP and all) I watched some guys who i forget do a roleplay of being cops in all types of scenarios and i comepletely fell in love with the game and what you could do. Then i found out about Zues and live map editing and the scenarios you could make with it like man. The hours i have on this game alone do not give it credit because it should be double what it is... Why? Because it just should... Zombie Apocalypse check(Must), Military scenarios hell even black ops or some kind of heavy operations you want to customize to your likings... CHECK!, Alien Take Over? Check... Old Man Life Simulator with guns. MF CHECK!!! It has it all. Literally any kind of setup theme or scenario you can think of you can make in this game or already has been made and that makes me think of the workshop. With a great community and the contributors have made and awesome number of content that u can add to the game to customize even further. There are also challenges which honestly i just found out about a month ago. See when i first got my chance to actually play the game, I dove right into the editor and tried to make my own custom game. Never will i forget the tank at the end of the road in the forest one shotting me the second i peeked behind a tree thinking i was slick. I will never forget it nor my fuck ups... Get the game yall stop playin and start playing"
20795,"Arma 3, would recommend, if you have a powerful computer that is lol. 

Multiplayer's great, the editor is amazing.

The main campaign is decent, the story is basically, small island nation suffering from rebellion NATO sends peacekeepers. It's a bit like arma-1's campaign but set in the far future. Still would recommend playing through it."
20796,"Unless you already have someone to play with, you will have a hard time finding someone to play with normally."
20797,"ARMA 3, I just love it."
20798,I've played may hours of this game. Cannot wait until the next one. This is a great game.
20799,Pretty good
20800,its fun
20801,10/10ING BEST GAME EVER
20802,ÿ®ÿØ ŸÜ€åÿ≥ÿ™
20803,good
20804,This game is super confusing for new players the menu's and controls are confusing to me and all my friends. the combat is fun but hard to get into wouldnt recommend fun if you pour alot of time but for a new players its not good
20805,"its arma, pretty much you get what u expect"
20806,"At first i founded that game very hard to learn and that make sens there was a lot of content and i knew almost nothing about weapons how they work , what type of ammo etc .... 

but in result i founded the game very enjoyable . out of my 590 all of them are mostly KOTH mod and wasteland if you play other mod the experience might be more or less enjoyable ...

one last thing game poorly optimize and you will need a good CPU to run it correctly ...



"
20807,Gud game. Some missions make me want to scrape a fork across a plate and kill myself.
20808,i like the part where my abrams got launched into space at mach 10 by a quadbike
20809,"good game
"
20810,Nothing compares to it. In the top 10 best games ever created list.
20811,"One of the best games ever. Great to play with friends. But also has brilliant campaigns and showcases. However, there is quite a learning curve, but there are very good playable tutorials that explain all the concepts. There are a lot of online servers and your experience will vary between each one so just be patient and find one that matches your play style. I would recommend warlord and zeus servers."
20812,this game has been my life for the last three years
20813,its the best MILITARY game ever

Quiero ver esa sonrisa, en mi cama al amanecer
Siempre en mis sue√±os vi una luz tan tan bonita
Cantando pensamientos libres siempre fue mi favorita
Ay, como me enamor√© tan pesadamente
Ten√≠a mil kilos rompiendo espina, pero no importa si est√°s presente

No one noticed I was missing until I told them after the op ended, and I was still alive.

20868,"Ah ArmA... 3,000 hours now. where do i even start? boy, this game is everything i ever wanted in a game - The ability to make, manage, and play in your own wars. The only limits are those of the engines and i will get to it later. So, what is ArmA 3? it's not just simply a shooter, actually. I used to believe firmly that ""ArmA 3 is a shooter, and every mission maker needs to focus on that!"", but the shooting is not the focus of it. If you know what you are doing, and are good at mission making - you can make a good mission without your men even shooting once. That's not to say it's recommended, but when making a Vietnam mission for example i prefer to have the silence of the Jungle around you as you try to look for traps and mines give you fear - because while machine gun fire is good at surprising you with a scare, it's not as good as say - the fear of being watched and the possibility of it. A perfect example of this is an operation made by Rimmy DownUnderGaming, a youtuber who makes ArmA videos and other content, he once streamed ""The Forest"" mission, which was the most fascinating mission i have ever witnessed (by watching it), and changed my mind regarding ArmA 3 being known as a shooter game. 

So what is my experience with ArmA 3? long ago i started playing, usually played some open co-op server missions, and messed around in the editor, this was back when there wasn't even a 3d editor and you would struggle to put something on a table.. i took a break and when i returned once more i joined a community - Digby Tatham-Warter's Discord community who ran Zeus (a ""game manager"" who can control units and assets as a sort of a god, like a DM) missions. I never got around to lead the missions myself, but i did enjoy some squad leading. From there i went to also try and find other communities, and on the way have made my own - with my group of friends, to try and see if they would enjoy ArmA as i have. And so, currently managing this small group of about 13 people (though, we never manage to get many on one day) and i am still experimenting with what's good and what isn't. ArmA is not the type of game you buy to get your fun here and now and throw it to the corner for eternity like many recent releases, it's a game with the same appreciation we had to old games - you can spend any given amount of time just messing around in the editor, and i would honestly recommend properly learning mission making once you do. 

The engine of the game is the main issue - you will see this a lot, ArmA doesn't like things smashing into one another. Most of the issues people complain about either come from mods, or can be fixed by mods, which is something some people still need getting used to. The game is not easy to run, and definitely not easy to learn or manage, but if you know how to make a mission and know the strengths and limits of the engine you can play it to a way that makes things you wouldn't be able to in most games - let you make your own video game ""Campaign"" mission, my childhood dream basically. Back when i played CoD 2 Big Red One i always thought ""hmm that's interesting, what if i was able to go to this other side of the airfield and find cool stuff in it? what if i could just get on this vehicle? why am i bound to this path?"" - and ArmA 3 allows me to make that, as someone who loves to make missions i can enjoy making a mission with those small details - script a squad to spawn if players choose the ""wrong"" path to the objective, have them get into cars the guys passed over earlier, and hunt my players. Have an entire dynamic status for everything - enemies will reinforce positions if the players clear it and leave it, and so the players can be surprised when the AI literally solid snakes it's way behind them - following them until they are grouped up and start to gun them down, and yes - it is a possibility. 

The AI, i have seen complaints about it - there will always be complaints about it - It's not perfect, but it deserves far more credit than it deserves. Many hate it for being ""too good"" - perhaps because unlike most games it can actually aim, and you dont have an insane amount of health. Perhaps because it can spot you through bushes sometimes, and no when it fires at you from inside a building it's not because it can see you it's because it heard your gunfire and or steps and knows you're on the other side. Others say the AI is too bad - that it's stupid, doesn't follow orders, and isn't compliant - you're right, they won't just rush the players like idiots, they wont just run in the open field like a Battlefield Singleplayer AI, and there are ways to override most of the limits, you just probably never heard of them. 

To conclude, it's like a game from our childhood on modern standards - back then we didn't complain about every frame drop, we didn't cry when things weren't perfect, we found ways around them - and that's what i love. 10/10 would sacrifice 50 toasters for my based Vietnam mission to work again."
20869,best milsim
20870,"Are you looking for high paced combat with action packed adventures like call of duty and battlefield?

Then this isn't for you, if your new to the Arma franchise or a Veteran returning to it. The only way to put it easily is that Arma is as realistic as can be, although its quite frightening at the start with new key-binds and a dozen ways to move and shoot, after your first 10 hours you'll understand. On the subject of call of duty games like my first point, arma 3 is tactical, you move as a unit, no being rambo. The campaign is a blast with so many sides to the wars involved, however you will have stamina so look out for it! and multiplayer can be fun and just an absolute laugh at times!

Arma 3 is a community i personally am happy i joined, so if your interested, join!"

20874,love this game
20875,it's a miracle this game has lasted this long.
20876,Arma Has literally taken over my life from dayz mod to DUWS. I just want to find more war sim's where I can take control.
20877,Despite the bugs. Arma is always a hoot to play solo and multiplayer coop. A lot of memories dating back to operation flashpoint days then ARMA then ARMA 2. And now 3. I know everyone is looking forward to a 4th installment. We will see how that plays out.
20878,"It's a hellhole but hey, fun's fun"

20883,"if you love realistic FPS games and want more in depth than Battlefield could offer, look to Arma 3.
"
20884,"Time-defying game. As good as it gets. Funny to think that PlayerUnkown started his career here. This was the game that made Battle Royal a thing. Well I guess it was Arma as a series that did that but still. The community, the developers, and the modders make this game that much better."
20885,"I did like the game overall. However, this was more of a time investor for me and was not something I could pick up and play. If you are a FPS or TPS type of person who likes PUBG or COD, I will say this is more realistic and challenging."
20886,"Brilliant realism and immersion, truly can make you believe you're in a firefight."
20887,"Yes it looks bad and has really bad optimization and yes it has bugs but the bugs make the game hilarious and its always fun to sing country roads while jumping out a CJ-130 or driving down the road in an MRAP or Humvee listening to  Metallica, black sabbath, ozzy, and sabaton."

Nightmare to play multiplayer. Every server has a mod which you cannot see in the multiplayer screen. 

Maybe allow for the mod to be downloaded? 
No, just go back and try again. 


Lots of bugs and they keep releasing new DLCs.
Game was never finished, they completed it at 60%. 

It's a nightmare, people play it because there isn't really an alternative.

20929,"Mods, Zeus, and having a good friend who's willing to spend days in the editor, make this game amazing."
20930,"A great mil-sim for those looking for realistic military operations in a grounded setting!

 
    I was originally put off of this game (And ARMA 2) by their in-depth systems and not really grasping what to do in the missions or Eden editor. I recently decided to put more time in and learn these different systems and I'm having a blast now! This game takes a small amount of dedication to learn, but your time will be well spent if you're a military enthusiast looking for a realistic shooter! Most of my time has been spent in EDEN using light mods and vanilla game assets- but the modding scene is just one more reason to join ARMA 3 today; be it ww2, ww1, warhammer, Star Wars, or modern day- weapons or maps, the list goes on and on! If you're looking for a multiplayer experience, there are many different modes and servers such as Life, KOTH, Death Match, ect. 

 The only negative thing I have to say about the game is that some of the vanilla vehicles are locked as DLC- but you can easily get all of them and the base game during one of the many steam sales. In conclusion.. BUY THIS GAME!"
20931,"its pretty intense and fun when you and your squad are invading a town, with tanks covering you and choppers flying around over head firing missiles at ground targets, paradropping, fast roping out of choppers its pretty cool the game types and mod community make it awesome."
20932,Maybe the real warcrimes were the friends we made along the way...
20933," Oh my, this is a great game. My internet is garbage and I can't really play multiplayer. This game is shown by a lot of people playing only multiplayer and that leads people to believe that this is not a single player game. WRONG! If you want an amazing single player war-sim, this game is for you.
 On the workshop you can play thousands of mods which is great and all but who really cares about mods? What really makes the single player aspect of this game so amazing is the scenario tab. The scenarios range from zombie apocalypse, squad leader sim, front lines combat, stealth mission, etc. A lot of the scenarios have a lot of replay ability and some are short story driven campaigns.
 This game is like a chess game, every action has a strong reaction, needs precision, and can be played a million different ways. I recall failing a mission because my medic vehicle I was transporting got destroyed. Later I thought ""What if I walked 400m ahead of the vehicle as it follows me and scout with a small recon team"" and it worked. This game will make you use your brain so don't be scared to use it!
Anyways, 4.7/5.0 stars from me, -.3 from slight frustration with freezing and small stutters. Stutters and crashes happen rarely but are still an annoyance. Either way, I highly recommend this game."
20934,good
20935,"very good game

20950,There is so much playtime with this game. I currently have 282 hours logged. I love the editor game mode and enjoy creating different scenarios to play. Arma 3 is highly realistic and has many player controls. There is a learning curve with controls but couldn't recommend enough.

Immersion is 100% though.

20969,"pewpew nice with friends, mission making cool. mods good and many, i like game"
20970,"Amazing game with amazing mods, I recommend the OPTRE mod."
20971,"It's fantastic

The Arma series has sat in a special place for me, offering a longer, more satisfying experience that is incredibly dynamic, even moreso with friends. In it's most hardcore, Arma provides some of the highest stakes engagements in gaming, and some of the most varied combat possibilities. It is janky, the AI is good but not great, where this game shines is in multiplayer.

Zeus mode, my personal favourite, offers the ability to skip all that troublesome map making, scripting and testing and lets you build your multiplayer mission as it happens. This alone reinvigorated my love for the series and provided some of the most intense, ridiculous and fun missions to date.

Where the base game fails, mods and workshop content bring it to life, total conversions, maps, factions and weapons. Hell you can download a mod that gives you Goddamn mechs, the modding community is vast and the potential is almost endless.

All in all, it's a must buy for me. Servers are always full, play with friends if you can."
20972,Good? Yes.
20973,Such a good game I recommend it for people who like realistic/military games.
20974,freaking amazing sandbox game
20975,The fact that this game has been around for 7 years and has held up this long is insane to me. Not buying this game is a mistake.

20980,"Nice game. LOL
"
20981,"This seems like its the best, I dont know have to play a little more to truly see."
20982,"WARNING - it does have some serious issues, but I am still recommending it for those who would like to create their own missions, and maybe for multiplayer.

CONs:
- Multiplayer might NOT work for you, because the game still does not have IPv6 support (in 2020!?)
- Various movement glitches; you frequently get stuck on rocks, in shrubbery or just trying to step over a sandbag
- If you expect it to be as realistic as some people say it is, you may be disappointed; AI units don't follow even the most basic tactics, don't take cover under heavy fire; enemy AI shoots you through dense forest, from 400m, standing, with iron sights; it might work better for multiplayer, can't really say, I have not played much MP yet
- The worst part if you are looking for realism are the arcade game-like singleplayer scenarios and campaigns; those about as realistic as an action movie
- Some pretty basic weapons/scope/equipment mechanics are not modeled accurately

PROs:
- Fun tacticool FPS with lots of customization options for your avatar and your equipment
- In-game map, GPS, compass, wristwatch help with team coordination
- Much greater number of shooting stances than a regular shooter
- You can change equipment while playing, hand it over to other players, load it into vehicles, etc.
- Moderately realistic small arms ballistics and player stamina (your avatar gets tired if you sprint, etc.)
- Very extensive scenario editor with scripting capabilities; this is the best part of the entire game in my opinion, and mostly the reason why I am recommending it. I probably spent more time in the editor than playing the game.
"
20983,yes
20984,yes
20985,Such a broad content base with excellent workshop scenarios and full server campaigns.  An amazing amount of game with configurable difficulty for any level of virtual soldier.

20987,Ye
20988,I'll be totally honest the only reason you'd play this game for more than 10 hours is because flying the helicopters is really fun
20989,its cool  idk what else you expect from me
20990,the game is not perfect. but what the milsim means can be understood by it. it is the real definition of what modders can do. Highly Suggested.
20991,"Fantastic, Realistic Military Sim!
Arma 3 is the game I was always looking for. It's a massive sandbox, military simulator. I can take to the skies with a variety of weapons, run around in a squad, use tanks and artillery and much, much more.

the game allows customization, one can play night or day missions. with the help of community mods one can launch cruise missiles from land and sea, fight zombies and aliens or play it as a hardcore milsim.

A fantastic game."
20992,Very good game
20993,"first of all, Arma was a piece of fucking shit which i wouldnt have even wiped an australians dead blood clotted forehead with sand. second version arma 2, was like my best wife i loved her, she went hunting with me, we fed, we lived and we died together but then the bad thing called reincarnation happened. obviously i wasn't with my wife because this fucking tumour i was born into makes me want to wretch over my dogs prostate cancer everyday. everybody on these servers, if i had a machette and the power to go into this computer i would hack all your heads off and make your daughters drink the blood from your thighs. anybody who plays this game who is a male should be chemically castrated and any women who play this who should die anyways, go clean up my kitchen anyways you whore."
20994,"i play a lot
"
20995,I have spent over 5 hours trying to get this game to run on my PC. I have a multi monitor setup and I have tried everything to get this to play how I want it. What's worse is it completely wrecks all my settings every time I launch it. Now after a hard reset my PC is not displaying on any monitor. It takes about a hour to fix my settings and get everything back to how it should be from just trying to launch this hot garbage. I am deleting this waste of time.

21012,"You will quickly learn what ""getting arma'd"" means."
21013,Most realistic sim I've played...
21014,war crimes
21015,its tight but not like sasha
21016,"ARMA 3 is an awesome military simulation game. Slow paced, realistic and serious. When i originally purchased this years ago, i was disappointed that Arma 3 takes place in the future. Futuristic weapons, vehicles and technology. Nothing sci-fi but not modern day. Luckily, the modding support and community is HUGE for this game. I have mods from WW2, to Zombies, to Modern day. Personally, i was never a fan of the multiplayer for this game. Just a bit too slow paced for my liking. BUT, this has a scenario creator, basically a ""mission creator"" where literally almost all 300+ hours of my time was spent. With that, the possibilities are endless of what you can do/create."
21017,Extremely buggy and crashes a lot
21018,im pretty sure its spelt 'armour'
21019,"Yeah I'd say it's pretty good
and more than worth the price especially since it goes on sale half the damn time"
21020,liked  it
21021,great fun for all ages
21022,"An amazing game with an endless amount of fun. 265 hours in and I'm still not tired of it, so I highly recommend this game. You won't be disappointed."
21023,it good
21024,"bad performance bad ai
good game"
21025,impossible to do anything involving playing with friends
21026,good rp game
21027,"Mm, I don't like it."
21028,"You want to be a soldier, but not risk being killed? Play this"
21029,"Starting off, this game is way over hyped. After playing all of the ARMA series besides ARMA 2, this has to be the worst one. The graphics are nice, but even coming from earlier games in the series, the story is very confusing. It really just feels like you are shooting people for no reason. Sandbox is fun but campaign is not in short. Very realistic but only get if you are going to play sandbox."
21030,good game yes fun
21031,Tanks are scary
21032,"I definitely recommend this game, a lot of fun"
21033,This game has been out for awhile now but is just as fun as the day it came out! Arma 3 takes some time to get used to but its a great game and has so much you can do whether its in single-player or multi-player. I've had a ton of good times an laughs on this game.
21034,"Excellent Millitary Simulation Game....Single player a great starting point for those wishing to try  a more realistic Military Shooter for the first time.
The learning curve is quite steep but very rewarding for those with the determination to see it through (kinda like real world Military Training)
After you have completed the Single player main campaign you can choose to further hone your skills in Single player and CO OP DLC Campaigns  or those Community Mods which further extend playability. If you want a real challenge Try ZEUS feature.
Online is simply MILSIMP!"

21049,Hands down the best ever. Whatever era you are looking for is here in TACTICAL REALISM. Even with the very basics of the editor. Especially if your tired of the toxic online game play of other titles. Make your own conflict or battle. Larger scale missions will still run great on low to mid spec systems with a few minor tweaks if you have to.
21050,"I love to play Arma even though it can be laggy sometimes but it's fun especeally when driving helicopter in high speed, anyone who loves to shoot, drive and save lifes in games should be able to get in to Arma 3 and it's DLC's and MOD'S"
21051,Unbelievable. Better than chicken and waffles.

21058,"Lets talk about this absolute shit show of a unit we got here! Bohemia Interactive really out did them selves with this cash grab. If you bought this game because you watched youtubers play amazing matches and have super creative content come out of this game , but that's just like the luckiest man alive situations there and that youtuber forked over all his money for all the god damn packs in this god forsaken game."
21059,"You folks must try this game, Its absolutely Fun, Amazing and Realistic........and totally recommended for Military Simulator lovers."
21060,"Buy it, play it. This is the way."
21061,"This is the best millitary sandbox of all time in  my opinion it is not perfekt but almost you have endless posibillities in this arma3 i would recomend it to everybody that has the intrest and patiens

21069,"Would still recommend in 2020. The game offers enough content official content to get your monies worth out of it, but my recommendation would be to join a group and enjoy the wide plethra of mods. Imo zeus ops with groups make this game what it is."

21079,Pretty Good game for much of a Lag and Pc destroyer of a game this is. So overall its a game thats worth buying if you are into military simulators.

However I have sunk over 7000 Hours into this game.

Il keep it simple,Arma3 is in a league of its own.There will never be an Arma killer,and if there is i can only imagine how amazing it will be. Bohemia interactive are by far the best and hardest working dev team i ever saw. Arma3 is 7 years old,this was my 1st ever PC game...talk about thrown in at the deep end. 

I cant recomend this game enough.It can be whatever you want it to be. Its a game within a game waiting to become a game."

21135,"played it for a bit, seems okay"
21136,"Great game, great community. Lots of mods and the DLC is worth it for the most part"
21137,"Arma 3 is an excellent game, One of my first games I have many memories of it.
If you like Military Simulators than I would have to say you have to play Arma, This absolute record breaker of a game will suck you in especially if you like making various scenarios, or even just playing other peoples scenarios. If you dont have something in the game that you want im sure you will be able to find it on the workshop, this is because on the workshop support for this game is astonishing and there are literally thousands of user-made content on there.

Also, If you ever play Arma and you really learn it, you'll learn that the 'bugs' in the game aren't actually bugs, they are peices of art stuck in an old generation of Military Simulators. Or just dont be a retard and learn not to drive full speed into a rock.

I highly recommend Arma, even if you believe its too old for your liking. You wont find another game like it."
21138,it fun
21139,"Arma 3 is as realistic as you can get with military shooters, unlike games like squad and rising storm Arma has a slower pace with some intense moments. Multiplayer game modes and missions are mostly built by the community with a few dev made missions. Arma 3 also has great moding capabilities which just brings the game together. Overall Arma 3 has a strong learning curve but once you get the hang of it it‚Äôs a very enjoyable sandbox realistic shooter."
21140,Arma is such a great game good simulator game
21141,"The original and best sandbox to date.

See what games like 'Squad' end up coming out with.

I'd prefer an Arma 4 with full creator-capabilities though!"
21142,good
21143,"All around great game, the few bugs and glitches just add to the fun!  The community it awesome and there are tons of mods you can get for either RP, Milsim, or anything you can think of.  The vanilla game has tons of game modes which are equally as fun as modded games."

21152,"7 years and counting, i dont know any other game that compares in quality to Arma 3. No other game can keep its community coming back time and time again for countless hours and endless possibilities."
21153,Classic game with a steep learning curve. Weird controls but once you learn them you love them. I've started changing multiple games' control schemes to Arma's because they just make sense once you learn them. Lots of players still play this game so multiplayer is hot and based on servers. Campaign is great too. If you like realistic shooter with a great campaign and amazing multiplayer this game is for you.
21154,:) :) :)
21155,This game is AWESOME But it runs like pure ass at times so if you dont have a nasa super computer at home prepare to witness a film from the damn roaring 20s

21162,I recommend this game to other players.
21163,"Great Game, whether you like milsim or pretending to be a civilian this game is awesome"
21164,"Arma itself is great... The devs,  maybe not so much.

Iv'e had arma for quite a while, it was one of my first and my favorite game. 
Arma has been a great game from the start, years ago when the community was much much larger, it was better.  Roll play is a ton of fun, KOTH is super fun, sandbox, all of is fun, but at the end of the day it's only what you make it.

The Arma community has shrunk A lot in recent years, and it's really sad to see it, but at the end of the day it's the fault of the Developers and whoever priced DLC's.

The DLC's aren't all worth it.  APEX was NOT worth it when it came out.  Even still, Unless you really play Arma A lot, it's not worth the money.  DLC's shouldn't cost 2/3 what the whole game itself costs.

The DLC's that were released didn't cater to what the community really needed, nearly ever.  The most popular PvP servers were ones without tanks and jets, but the devs release tank and jet DLC's?  Even the ""Karts"" DLC was more enjoyable.  

I usually recommend arma 100%, but seeing that the games only $30 and theres DLC that aren't huge game changers for $25+, it's just not worth it.  The games dying, and it's too late to recover.  I'm sure there's going to be more DLC's released, but there wont be any chance of recovering the population it once had, if the dev's would have been smarter about DLC's, this might not be the case.  

My advice for anyone looking to buy Arma : Wait for a sale, and the expensive DLC's aren't worth it unless you're going to put 800+ hours in atleast.  Marksmen is the ONLY DLC that I recommend.  The game is going to continue to lose players, and will eventually die.  Hopefully there will be a Arma 4 in the next few years, but my hopes aren't high."
21165,Realistic
21166,Fucking class game you gotta buy it
21167,Haha war crimes go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
21168,"Before I played this i had a small penis, no girlfriend and no will to live. None of these things have changed, but the game is pretty good"
21169,"FUN
"
21170,"As You can see I dont have A lot of hours On Arma But I Just have To say I played just a little bit and this game is just for me its very realistic and There are zombie servers you can join and you can talk to people and do alot of emotes and different tactical movements the game takes time though so say if you joined a lobby or just a single player it might take a while for you to get into it because its very boring to other people because of how long it takes to find people or to find objects or items so you just have to explore and see if you can find anything, but in my opinion this game is made for people that want a game that takes time and the time will be worth, the only complaint i have is none. Recoil is very realistic which means its very hard to shoot i usually single fire because of how hard shooting is. The Game has Jets, Helicopters, Cars, people, Zombies in servers, cool guns, and overall good gameplay and the graphics are ok just because the game was made like 5 years ago. Gived a Big Thumbs up!"

Shoot refugees because someone bid higher
Return to base
Do it again but label them as enemy combatants"
21179,yes

21205,this game is very hard to play. 1 thing that gets me the most is when other players kick you out just because you don't know how to play and then it takes for ever to get back in a lobby. I had googled multiple videos to learn this game but I guess it's to hard for me. I tried to get a refund but steam says I played the game more then 2 hours when I actually played it 1 hour tops. It took 3 plus hours just to set it up and do the tutorial. now I have a 30 dollar game sitting in my library that I cant play. First and last for everything. Will be downloading games from Microsoft store for now on. Microsoft has a better costumer service.
21206,
21207,uh huh
21208,"It is definitely a great game.

The campaign was quite fun and introduced a lot of different mechanics and types of gameplay.

I would recommend buying it only if you have a large number of friends who also play multiplayer with you."

21223,Best Game on PC if you're willing to take the time to learn the ins and outs of the game. 10/10
21224,tHE BEST WAR SIMULATION EVER
21225,.
21226,"very fun, very hard."
21227,This game has been a constant for me over the years. There isn't anything else out that has the same feel of ArmA. Great dev team and a powerful modding community has kept ArmA 3 going from 2013 to now. Nothing is better than a good old operation with the crew.
21228,i dont like it
21229,A truly immersive combat experience.  I recommend finding a player run server with modsets to get the best out of this game.
21230,"if your on Winblows buy it..if your on linux buy it with a shit load of pain. Arma was and WAS is the key word. They started the port it to linux and just friggen stopped..now the new buzzword is ""proton""..but battleeye doesn't work under proton and since Linux is only available at version1.83.XXXXXand Winblows is now on 2.0.XXXXX you can't fucking shoot them if you wanted too. We are on the wrong version...linux is Wounderful, if you love to kill AI but get used to PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN"
21231,"good, run and realistic would recommend"
21232,best game
21233,"I have played console games most of my life (well childhood) as an adult I have embraced graphics an have learned when you play games 24hrs  straight graphics are key to immersion an staying in the game that PC can only deliver ,as PlayStation & Xbox are just becoming PC ! From a kid in the 80's playing ATARI an then Super Nintendo to what they have now in 2020 in my lifetime games have made leaps an bounds ! Arma 3 a 
(virtual world) Military sand box delivers Military Engagements unthinkable in 80's playing pong ! 
As traveling threw space to another world becomes more attainable it will take many lifetimes time to reach a habitable planet an along the way I hope they a playing Arma 3 to pass time !  Definitely a game I would recommend an cheers to all the mods made an being made today !"
21234,"Ive only played a little but its okay i guess, sefou ramal is dope tho"
21235,"DO IT , GET IT NOW"
21236,this game is awesome
21237,"Personally I liked this game, although some aspects are too realistic, specially finding enemies in the normal jungle environments is hard without AI Guidance.
bullet trajectory is somewhat realistic , although you won't be able to know if you will hit a distant target , the shots land almost around the same area tightly.
driving is a bit odd.
Overall it is a good experience. bare in mind i haven't had the time to play multiplayer matches yet since buying this."
21238,I know its just 25hrs of gametime since i bought it but it was the best.(I am not a bot)
21239,Great game !
21240,"you can commit unhumanitarian aid and war crimes without doing the time

21245,.....
21246,"mmmhmmmm 

It has its quirks, but its pretty af, realistic, and fun to play. you like shooters with lots of options/content? you`re gonna like arma. 

They pushing it with all this dlc bull shit though.
(never been a fan, always feels like 90% of most dlc in any game could be part of the original release)

But still a good game with tons of mods and playability.

8/10

21247,bad boring
21248,"Very fun game with a lot of mods and different servers, so you will never run out of things to do.
i recommend playing altis life rp, that's where i spent most of my time on Arma so far."

21257,"Arma 3 is the best military simulator out there. Nothing really comes close if you want to simulate a war, but the amount of time you have to invest to understand the mechanics and steep learning curve make it very difficult to get into. I would recommend, but only if you are dedicated enough to find a group to play with."
21258,fun.
21259,"It's a game for almost everyone. It has king of the hill, Arma Life if you like role playing, zeus if you fancy creating stories and missions for strangers to come enjoy, and so much more. If you want to play a military sim game or just have casual fun with friends, this game is perfect. It wouldn't hurt to try out. you can always refund it if you don't like it"
21260,its a fun military shooter. I feel like it paved the way for many more modern titles. (Besides PUBG and DAYZ and subsequent clones) I recommend giving it a try. There are still lots of good mods and player servers.
21261,geneva convention? more like geneva suggestion
21262,very good millitary simulator
21263,third person fps
21264,"This game is amazing, it's astounding. It almost fully immerses you in combat situations in the vanilla state of the game, especially in game modes like combat patrol, and Zeus. Bullets crack past you, and gunfire lights up the night with this game. It's a solid 8/10. 

Cons: With that being said, the physics in the game are bugged a lot of the time, things just explode randomly, and the AI are retards. Other than that though, it's a good game."
21265,x;lkdcfgvnjpfsdjg;a

21293,"Arma 3 is a great game. You can spend hundreds of hours in this gaming building missions and fighting in them. There are also countless dedicated servers up running milsims, king of the hill, and other mission types. Arma shines in it's sandbox. The campaigns are alright and are sometimes fun, however user made content is amazing. You can get any mission from a recreation of a historic battle or a zombie survival. That being said, the mods keep the game fresh with content allowing you to transform Arma into any game you would like. Bohemia still supports this gem, releasing many dlcs. The dlcs are worth it in my opinion, but with all the mods, you don't need them. As with everything in life, there are some draw backs. The one biggest thing is optimization. To be fair to the game, there are many countless calculations being made by the games engine every second. Bullets are effected by wind, gravity, humidity, and penetration factors. In large scale battles you will definitely notice a decrease in frames but smaller missions won't be as noticeable. Now at it's core, and how Arma was designed to be played, it's all about the struggle. All the tools are given to you but Arma doesn't hold your hand. It will punish you. However, careful planning and movement as well as conservative decision making will help you succeed. This is all according to how realistic you want to be and it can be more in depth then this with supporting roles. Arma also benefits the supporting role like CAS, transport pilots, fire support, and many more. To recap on everything, Arma 3 is a huge sandbox that can be whatever you want. Countless user made content can keep the game fresh and it's constant support is a very nice bonus. It's combat favors all personal to the front line fighters to the supporting roles getting them there and protecting them. This is a must have game if you want either a huge sandbox and or realistic combat."

I'll bet you a tener that it won't be dethroned til they release ARMA 4 and the first batch of patches for ARMA 4."
21320,Great game especially with the workshop availability.
21321,"Yes
"
21322,j
21323,"super fun with friends, good game"
21324,There's a unique kind of fun to loading in with the whole squad and rolling up to seize military bases.
21325,If your into Milsim and have time to learn the controls this is an incredible game with a lot of mods to suit any player
21326,"Ran like shit, might give it another try"
21327,"Over the years with this game I've had some OK moments but it's the kind of game that bites you in the ass any chance it gets. Mechanically, it's complex (especially with mods) but also breaks easily. The community ranges from raging 13 to 65, but any age in that range is equally capable of demonstrating mental illness. 

Moreover it's a game where you spend 6 hours trying to accomplish something and then lose it in a split second. Then you have to choose: start that task over or quit.  But the game's magic is when it draws you back, hoping for that wonderfully complex experience that you really only get with ArmA. The sheer amount of controls, dials, knobs and buttons is ludicrous.

I could go into further detail but it really boils down to this: if I didn't already own this game, I wouldn't buy it. The community is starting to feel small, countless forum/reddit posts over the years have been asking if ArmA is dying due to the shrinking playerbase. And unless you want an ultra-serious clan or server that's going to require you to stay awake for 16 hours (Fisher's LIfe server rules), this game isn't for you.

And that's multiplayer modded servers. So what about the singleplayer or vanilla multiplayer experience? It's empty. You can get into the first 5 missions of the singleplayer and feel like you're in a running simulator. What little combat you encounter is between 3-6 enemies at a time because the game is so poorly developed that it can't handle anything more.

I could go further into detail and give horror stories but I'm sure no one wants to read that. Just save yourself the exposure to more psychosis and stay away from this game."
21328,Really good game
21329,gud
21330,Solid! Turtle runs made me rich :)
21331,"very complicated, slow to start but after a bitit starts to all come together"
21332,"If you expect action packed, in your face gunfights like COD, Crysis, Doom or any of that nature, this game is not for you. If you expect an immersive and captivating story like Far Cry 3 or Metro 2033, this game isn't for you either. This has a bland story TBH. 

But it has amazing graphics. Thorough controls which take a lot of time to learn it but very satisfying once you do. Gameplay is quite unique unlike typical FPS games that you spray and pray then let God sort them out kind of gameplay.

Really one of the best. But again, this isn't for everybody. So if you are into realism, tactical FPS gameplay in an open world setting, you will love this. Also, you need to have plenty of patience learning stuff on your own because the Rangemaster doesn't tell you shit."
21333,"decent warcrime simulator, best with friends or a unit"
21334,Most realistic militery game ever
21335,"yeah bro, it's arma"
21336,haha a-164 go brttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
21337,gun go pew pew
21338,"200 meters, man."
21339,Man oh man. This game really just runs like shit.
21340,"Arma 3, You need patience and a good sense of your surroundings. Enemies can come out of nowhere, and a typical run can take anywhere from 2-3 hours which is what I find the best part of this game. It's not just your typical team death match, it requires constant vigilance.

Over all, very good graphics, and gameplay. Recommend to anyone."
21341,"Haha drone strike go brrr
Cluster bomb go boom
Civilian go dead"
21342,THE WHOLE THINGGGGGG
21343,"I moved from ArmA 2 because of a friend's recommendation. I came in hoping to see improvements, especially with the vehicle movement, UI, weapon/vehicle variety, AI, and mechanics. However, I am quite disappointed.
I knew that the game took place in the future, but everything looks like it's out of a Halo/Modern Battlefield orgy. If you like American weaponry and vehicles, don't expect to really see anything familiar out of the base game.
With the workshop, you can download plenty of mods but I find the gameplay mechanics just inherent in the game to really be a problem. In addition, it seems that vehicle realism has absolutely dropped from ArmA 2. Humvees taking RPGs, crewmen surviving after a tank goes up like a nuke, armor values for outdated vehicles way too high while modern ammunition power values are way too low. I set up a large-scale vehicle battle on Takistan with the enemy using T-72As and T-55s and my team using M1 variants with M829A2 and M829A3 APFSDS, only to find out that those rounds are incapable of piercing through their armor while their ammunition cut through mine. So, yea, vehicle realism really hit the fan.

And do not even get me started with the AI. Holy crap, whether it's base game or modded game, the AI is horrendous... Or, should I say, the enemy AI would make you think they're some super soldiers constructed from the DNA of the best spec ops operators in the world while your guys are only capable of standing and walking in one direction. The enemies can nail you in excess of 700 meters with iron sites, but your guys will fail to see an enemy on thermal from 10 feet away (Yes, this is a regular occurrence). Even with enhanced AI mods, this problem is still prevalent.
Then there are the actual characters themselves. Talk about super soldiers physically... well, your enemies at least. I was just playing yesterday with my friend and he was shot in the arm while manning a vehicle turret, and died. But then me and him would hit an enemy 5+ times, a few times in the head, and they would continue running and firing on us with precision. Inspecting them with the ACE medical viewer shows that they were, indeed, struck multiple times before dropping and that it wasn't just game lag that made it appear they were hit. This problem is especially problematic in the vanilla game, where your enemies really are super soldiers for whatever reason.

So, overall, this is what I can say when compared to ArmA 2:

Pros:
- Many more mods for you to tune the game to your liking
- Scripting is way better, increasing FPS (I can run this game smoothly on maximum graphics even with all the mods installed, but had a hard time running ArmA II on medium quality)
- Movement for both infantry and vehicles is a lot smoother, especially with movement enhancing mods
- Active online community
- Weapon customization, especially in Arsenal, is definitely a convenient thing
- Zeus and Eden Editor make game editing a lot easier
- UI is much more convenient

Cons:
- Futuristic combat environment that seems completely isolated from previous installments (A personal bias of mine)
- The vanilla game lacks a wide variety of weapons and vehicles
- Enemy AI is ridiculously high while allied AI is absolutely horrid, leading to you being the only effective member of your team in an environment where your enemy has no problem hitting you with iron sites from 700+ meters away
- Vehicle realism is horrendous compared to ArmA 2. This is due to armor values for certain vehicles being way too high, and power values being for certain anti-tank munitions way too low. (This is being said using ACE2 for ArmA 2 and ACE3 for ArmA 3)
- Enemies have way too much health while your allies seem to be made of range target paper. This is bad to the point where head shots to the enemy will often fail to drop them while you could die from a single shot to the leg or arm.

TLDR; Many small things improved upon, many big things got a lot worse. Makes game play a lot less fun and much more frustrating.

But you must work for your fun and get use to bugs and glitches, and take the time to learn how she runs. I mean this game is massive so its a given. When I think of Arma 3 it is the literal definition of military sandbox. You can literally do anything you want, from future warfare like halo, to storming the beaches of Normandy. Yes you can play this game solo, but where the true fun is is the Arma community. There is every form of unit or community out there. From the hardcore, to the laid back and chill style. You play how you want that's it. You will have the most fun in this game if you learn her, find a community or unit that you like make friends, help each other. I hope to see you on the battlefield one day."
21400,"This is honestly one of the best military simulator shooters ever made. In my honest opinion this game takes you as close to combat as one can get from a video game. You can do everything from ground to air warfare, this includes the ability to use drones. The developers are constantly updating this game plus it allows the workshop so if you do not like something about this game you can modify it. (Mod at your own risk) The game may have a few bugs, what game doesn't? Teamwork is a must in this game, even if it does make and break friendships sometimes."
21401,Multiplayer servers are buggy with constant crashes. Too many paid DLCs. What a ripoff.

21404,"Step 1: Make a loadout

Step 3: Get killed
Step 4: Respawn & Do it all over again"
21405,It's pretty fun I guess.
21406,fun game yup
21407,Good game but you need to learn how to play it to enjoy it. In the beginning it might be hard but when you get good at the game you can have a lot of fun.
21408,yes
21409,"GOOD
"
21410,Took a few times to get used to controls since I came to this from straight console. One of the more difficult PC games I have taken on and I thoroughly enjoy this after 4 hours.
21411,"It is a fantastic game to play especially if you like shooting games and yeah.
"
21412,"sucks! too many issues to list, i wasted enough time already."
21413,"Military simulator with a very extensive map editor. It's pretty staggering with how much you can do in this game. Just about every type of 'realistic' military scenario can be built and played; and even some not-so-realistic. If you're into that sort of thing, you can get lost in this game for literal hours.

However, I'm not a fan of it's DLC practices - a lot gets cut from the game and tacked onto expensive addons. If you happen to play a map that uses some content of DLC that you don't own, it makes you wait and advertises it to you like a shitty freemium title and not a game that you paid for.

If you can look past that for the gameplay and/or don't mind spending some coin anyways then it's prob not a big deal to you anyways."
21414,this game sucks my dick until i nut then spits it out on my dick and sucks it up all over again
21415,it sucks

21424,too much DLC but a decent base game if you can avoid the constant money grubbing
21425,"best game to cure my depression 
"
21426,"I'd recommend getting it only if your PC can handle it.
The game is extremely fun with friends or a unit to participate with, thus I'd recommend finding a group of people to partake in operations with. It does get tryhardy occasionally , but overall, it's fun as fuck.
8.5/10"
21427,"I have played this game a bit,and find it good."
21428,"Very fun game to play. Now some things I will say I don't agree with like the price of some DLCs, I can kinda get why some are pretty expensive but i mean the price could definitely be lowered a bit imo, but other than that, its a very fun game."
21429,THIS GAME IS TOTALLY UNFAIR AND SUCKS IF YOUR DONT DONATE THE ADMINS MONEY THE ARE SHIFTY LITTLE FAT FUCKS THAT WILL BANNED YOU FOR NO REASON DO NOT WAST MONEY BUY RUST INSTEAD

21448,"The game has very mediocre graphics even on ultra settings. The sound is like OK, but it is still almost impossible to accurate recognize  direction to source.  All game play is about of trying to survive under crossfire of invisible enemies, that capable to see you through trees, bushes, rocks and trying to aim something by uncontrollable weapon.  One of the worst games I played."
21449,Bought this in Beta in 2013 and I still play it. Nothing comes close.

21452,nah
21453,"just love the game. mainly play it for world war 2 mods

the new DLC to come out for Arma 3 is amazing, its cool to go back to the Vietnam war and patrol through the jungle in the missions and with the eden editor"
21454,"Game simply will NOT stop crashing, campaign is stupidly glitchy and very very short. I reinstalled probably 4 times.
Also the game is not even really a game unless you play these janky custom multiplayer servers or you spend hundreds more in dlc. Such a shame because the game play i was able to experience was for sure, ridiculously fun."
21455,perfect game
21456,"I've dedicated 2067 hours of my life to this game. That's almost 3 straight months of playing it. I log into this game almost every day because of the absolutely endless options it provides.

21468,
21469,confusing but it still fun
21470,"Love this game. Milsim units are where it is at. I have over a 1,000 plus gameplay hours. The mods create a huge replay value."
21471,"Very fun game, good community. Maybe not so good if you're playing with Russians but some are really nice. The game has tons of game modes and all of them is fun. You should buy this if you're looking for an awesome military milsim or just to play some pvp's."

21476,Overall Epic Game
21477,this game is awesome the fan base is great with so many experienced people willing to help new people like myself. This game can be as hardcore as you want it to be but on the other hand you can go into the editor and get 10 squads or AT soldiers in and open field and have them face off.
21478,"I had some troubles my first few hours playing, but stick to official servers and you'll be fine. Gunplay is tight, controls are intuitive, if a bit overwhelming at first, and the game excels in offering a more realistic military shooter experience."

21486,i love game
21487,"its good in the sense that it is quite immersive but the gameplay can get extremely irritating with how it bugs out alot with the enemies and they end up doing crazy things and kill you, also, the flying countermeasures are rubbish and controlling units hardly works"

21500,i don't have this game
21501,very good
21502,"Avoid this crappy game more than COVID-19, maybe covid will hurt you, but this game will permanently damage you. I have bought this game and for the past 7 days i have been trying to download it and play even one time and i failed.
I first installed it and after going into the training, i restarted and the game disappeared without a trace! so i installed it again, and it stayed for unknown reasons downloading mods for the past few days. 

I have tried tirelessly to access with or without mods but i get booted out instantly or it gives me a message that there is no server. 

I have finally decided to watch training on Youtube on how to play it and OMG the game is super complicated to even start mind you play. 

I work in advanced analytics and artificial intelligence programming and i have never seen such a level of complication in my life, this game is more complex than the most complex math problem i have seen. 

One word i will describe this game ""DISGUSTING"""
21503,War crime military simulator.
21504,"Find the right server and you're hooked for life. DLC are overpriced though. Get them on sale or on key shops, and support your local workshop creators. There are amazing creations for this game that add magnitudes more content than the devs for free."
21505,"The 6hrs i have logged on the game i spent the majority of them just trying to join servers, being disconnected from servers, disconnected because of battle-eye or crashing due to funky status violation errors so honestly its a waste of money for me. Most of the servers i tried to join also required a whole bunch of dlc I totally don't have."
21506,GREAT GAME!
21507,"this game will leave your pants PISSED, your marriage RUINED, and your wife/husband SPRINTING to a divorce lawyer like redditors when there's a woman working at Game stop."
21508,I mean its okay I guess
21509,yes
21510,"This is an amazing game! The modding community is very involved. Whether you are interested in downloading some mods and doing epic battles with your friends, or playing single player, there is something for everyone!! 

If you're a helicopter pilot like me, you will be fascinated!! So many options, and the moders have based vehicles on the physics like (Gunships, Hornets, Banshees, Falcons, etc.)

Personally, I would say this game is 10,000x better with mods, but you really can't go wrong. 

BIG TIP: Be sure to buy the game/the DLC when it is on sale because sometimes it's nearly 80% off!"
21511,Clearly I don't understand this game but it is a buggy mess. I still can find some fun but still it really is broken sometimes. (7.1/10)

21523,"Its Arma, if you made it this far you probably have better insight than my review. Its the greatest game, and the most frustrating game at times, but there is nothing at all like it. And thats what makes it incredible. Coming from a casual single player, mission editor player."
21524,Good
21525,"very realistic with mods, however the basic game needs some additional touches."
21526,Very engaging military simulator only limited in scale by your imagination.
21527,"Yes Arma 3 has glitches but it's one of those things which lightens up your gaming every once in a while. Great for fun, better with your pals, plenty of missions and different game modes, which makes it unique I guess."

21549,If you want a more realistic military shooter experience then this is for you. The campaign is a good tutorial to teach you the basic mechanics. Mods really spice up the game and the community is great. None of my friends play Arma but I had no issue finding people online willing to show me the ropes and run ops with.
21550,
21551,I have almost 200+ hours in this game and they have all been spent in the eden editor/sandbox
21552,I love this Milatary Simulator game in my honest opinion it's is the best milatary simulator I got the game a week ago and I i have 50 Hours play time it's my fav game from now on I reccomend buying all the dlc if you're gonna buy the game there is a few bug but they can be fixed with mods

21554,"It Fun, Great Enjoyment."
21555,"Put a few hours in and it's about time I wrote a review.

Pretty Jank game overall, running on a jank engine from a decade ago.
Haven't played the campaign, so won't comment.
DLCs are very pog, the vinilla content is well made, very cool and creative ideas along with real life counterparts.
Mod community is active but upto you on how to judge them. A lot of the ""good"" mods are just ports from ARMA 2...so. In my personal opinion. The mods the introduce guns and vehicles are piss poor. There are a few good ones, but I mean FEW.
The community is everything. You find a good server and you can spend years playing this shit game. Once you find your group, you're good for life. 

You want to get into this game? Get into the community."
21556,nice balls
21557,This game is just amazing if you love realist games
21558,"Very fun and fast paced gameplay. There is a major learning curve,but overall it is a well bought product."
21559,"Best game to play if you like realism and tactical fights...also it has a great modding community and a huge scenario creation platform.
The only downside of this game is - not having any official Asian servers, there are dedicated but it would be better if the devs would provide one...
above all of it, the game's just fun to play....and even more when you've got friends to play with!
"

21562,very nice good game. fun game. pretty cool. not bad. fucking nice
21563,The franchise that got me into PC gaming in the first place.
21564,Good shooting mechanics lots of freedom
21565,"Arma 3 is a really good game without mods, with mods it is on a whole other level. There are endless options to choose from, from WWII to undisclosed franchises that irritate Disney. I really enjoy the USMC mods as the uniforms are very accurate, they use appropriate aircraft, and the weapons are very accurate as well. The modding community on this game truly enjoys what they do and I enjoy using their creations."
21566,"YES
"
21567,"Overall Arma3 is a continuation of the true milsim genre, which started with the likes of Tom Clancy, Jane's Simulations and Operation Flashpoint games. It doesn't hold your hand and point out where enemies are, give you medkit pickups or allow you to simply walk out in the street and lay waste to entire platoons. 

It's complicated, got a severe learning curve and the AI is not quite as good at path-finding as it was in Arma2 or the previous Bohemia games, but it is still merciless and will teach you right away why cover is imperative in warfare.

More fun with mods, and an absolute joy when you can mod your kit using a virtual ammobox to fit your preferred weaponry - and artillery works like it should; user beware.

So despite the bugs, I'm loyal to Bohemia for always trying hard to make good simulations; and more for actively encouraging mods to make things better when people have the gumption to make something on their own!

10/10 for being able to learn about the conventions of modern warfare, which ban landmines and reckless use of explosives.... Then go on missions which allow you to use both.

Yippeekiyay, Motherf***er."
21568,"Armed Assault (or ArmA for short) III is the latest and weirdest foray into the world of a near-real life like simulator of an actual military. However, this has some serious drawbacks, and I hope to cover them thoroughly in this review. I'm going to put a disclaimer out there and say I'm not saying you shouldn't buy the game, because it has some moments you can't get anywhere else, and it's certainly fun when you have friends, but if you play solo or are looking for a quick game, you won't find it here. If you want quick solo fun, I suggest you go play Squad.

The first thing to talk about is how ArmA III compares to its older brethren. To put it bluntly, I feel Bohemia put out ArmA III as an excuse to have more money retained to them as parents on their next tax return. ArmA III doesn't feel like a labor of love as much as ArmA II did, which is my personal favorite staple in the series. ArmA II had actual real life vehicles in it, like the T-72 and the T-55, the M1A1 and the M1A2 Abrams, the M3 Bradley, just to name a few. In ArmA III you get these weird GTA-inspired knockoff vehicles that are either amalgamations of different IRL vehicles or just real life vehicles under a different name, like the M2A1 Slammer is just a Merkava, or the T-140 Angara is LITERALLY the T-14 Armata. I don't know if it's because Bohemia isn't permitted to do that anymore, or they just didn't have enough money to buy the licenses to put said vehicles in the game officially. Which, doesn't make sense considering their DLC's like S.O.G. Prairie Fire and Global Mobilization have IRL vehicles in them. It's a mixed bag. 

What about optimization? Is it any good? ArmA III is literally the most poorly optimized game I've ever played next to Dead Rising 3. Before you scoff, ""ugh, his rig is just bad,"" I'm just gonna lay it on the line now that I'm rocking an NVIDIA RTX 3060, Intel i7-10700, and 16GB of RAM. ArmA III is also installed on a Western Digital Black SN750 NVMe SSD. I upgraded because I was trying to run this game on a ""gaming"" laptop with a GTX 1050 Mobile, 8GB of RAM, and a Toshiba HDD. Pro tip: NEVER install and play ArmA III on a hard drive, or even a hybrid hard drive, install dat shid on an SSD/NVMe. With that pro tip out of the way, ArmA III, on a mostly empty server (we'll say like 5-9 people), for me, on ultra settings, runs at 30-50 FPS. Pathetic. A game from 2013 can't be optimized? What a poor excuse. You need a literal supercomputer (RTX 3090, 32GB RAM, Ryzen 9 5900X or Intel i11 series) to probably even manage 60+ FPS in this game. /end of rant. 

Now the second to last thing to cover is the DLC. ArmA III doesn't exactly pile high with DLC, but if you want to have any fun, you better be ready to pay for it. The top two DLC's you need are probably Apex and Contact, plus the vehicle DLC's like Tanks, Jets, etc. If you try to go into a server and use something from a DLC you don't have? Be prepared for the watermarks. If you use, let's say, the SPMG .338 (a really good LMG, mind you) and you DON'T own the Marksman DLC? You'll see a big square in the right hand corner of your screen that says LShift+P with the Marksman DLC logo over it. If you refuse to buy the DLC whenever they prompt you with this message, which stays there forever almost, they flash the DLC's logo OVER YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN. Can you imagine being in an intense firefight and all of a sudden your line of fire is ruined by some tiles going across your screen telling you to spend your money on the DLC that contains the weapon you're using? Oh, and don't even try to buy a DLC vehicle either. You want to use the T-140K Angara but don't own the Tanks DLC? Have fun trying to get into it. The moment you click ""get into T-140K as driver/commander/gunner"", it hits you with the ""buy the DLC first, d*ckhead"" message. This is some EA level of tactics and treachery. Shame on you, Bohemia Interactive.

Finally, there's the multiplayer. ArmA III is like War Thunder. Yeah, there's a campaign and single-player missions, but are you really here for that? No. You're here because you wanna make some people have PTSD. What gamemodes do you choose? Granted, ArmA III has a handful of different gamemodes to play, my personal favorite being Wasteland (called Sandbox in the game's settings), which is, as you would expect, a wasteland. You spawn in with whatever the server decides to spawn you in with. The server I play on (509th Altis) gives you 1500 dollars in your pocket and 20K in the bank (chump change, really) and doesn't guide you. You buy yourself some good equipment from a gun store/general store/vehicle store that you find on the map, and pray someone who's spent 2 years of their life on the server doesn't kill you for no other reason than to assert their virgin dominance over you. That's generally how a game of Wasteland goes. Oh, how do you get more money? You do these missions marked on the map (big red crosses with the names of the missions next to them) and complete the objectives to earn money. Just be careful, the AI can see you from like 50 kilometers out and have pinpoint accuracy. Kill the AI, take the money/weapon crates/vehicles, run for safety, deposit your money (or sell the vehicle or the weapon crate at any shop) , rinse and repeat. Just be wary of other players. There's other gamemodes, like King of the Hill, which is tedious, but leads to quicker action and vehicle usage, and there's Exile, which is like Wasteland but usually has AI that can see you even if you were in outer space, and are able to kill you 25km away. There's other gamemodes, but I rarely see anyone play them. Wasteland servers especially aren't popular unless the server gives you $2,000,000 off the bat and has all the vehicles at base game price. The player base and Bohemia are to blame for this really. ArmA III doesn't do a great job of advertising or even explaining their gamemodes, and there aren't any of the fun modded ones (although I COULD be wrong on this) like in ArmA II (like DayZ). And usually, most players flock to either The Trailerpark, a hectic Wasteland server that gives you a lot of money right off the get-go, or any King of the Hill server, because ""hehe, realistic Fortnite""

How would I sum up ArmA III? Basically, buy it on sale. Buy the game when it's super low in price and do the same for the DLC. The vehicle DLC's will cost you like 3 bucks each and the big DLC's like Apex and Contact are like 10 bucks each (on a good sale, BTW). If you're not willing to take the time to learn the ins and outs of ArmA III, and take the punishment whenever it dishes it out to you, then don't waste your money. This review may seem negative despite my hours in it, and I'm also a department lead in an ArmA III Discord server, but ArmA III is not the the ""bang for your buck"" labor of love that ArmA II was. Arma II had DayZ, it had custom gamemodes, REAL LIFE vehicles and weapons, and it had a strong playerbase. ArmA III is trying too hard to be a futuristic military shooter that just has different elements mixed into it. All in all, if you're looking for a game to play with the mates, ArmA III might be up your alley, but if you're looking for fun, you're going to spend a couple real-life hours trying to have some."

21578,Its cool
21579,its addicting for beginner players
21580,"Love this game, Remove thermals tho lol"
21581,"I don't mind the gameplay being complicated or hard to learn hard to master but this game, not the gameplay but other things in this game makes me sick very complicated and poor UI the menu is from 2013 and nothing is straight forward bought this game to play with my friend but there is no easy way to join them also this game is very old and devs haven't improved anything they have just released a bunch of DLCs without paying attention to other things also very poor optimization getting 12 fps in multiplayer with my high-end PC and when I researched people were saying that this game is CPU independent and multiplayer is like this until you overclock your CPU or get a very powerful one"
21582,It's fun.
21583,g
21584,"Not much of an improvement from the previous Arma games besides the graphics. It's buggy, physics are buggy; drove a tank, ran over a dead body and it flung the tank miles away. Animations are so odd, movement is stiff. Simple movements like jumping or vaulting are not in game but are solved by mods which is very disappointing. AI is so frustrating, they can hit you through thick foliage or smoke with good accuracy. Commanding AI is even worse as they can't seem to understand waypoints, and get stuck most of the time getting to most areas. The game feels rushed with all the issues, but hey look at all the DLCs that you can buy. It's a Mil-Sim that goes for realism but seems to be going away from realism.

It's a damn shame there's not much games in the Mil-Sim category.

If you can withstand the bugs, It can be fun if you're playing with certain mods and scenarios (like antistasi) specially if played with friends and if you're still interested I would suggest to get this game when the price is discounted.

Disappointing.

"
21585,Great game I guess...
21586,"Look guys. I've owned the ENTIRE arma series, all of them. I even bought Arma 3 as a pre-purchase. Arma 3 is buggy, laggy, hard on computers even today for a 7 year old game. You will exit the game in anger of some glitch or whatever else but what i can promise you is you will ALWAYS end up reloading the game at some point. I've uninstalled the game multiple times but always ended up re-downloading it because this game is just an amazing war game. You simply won't find any other game on earth quite like the arma series, i'm really surprised it hasn't been recognized officially in the game history books as the greatest military series of all time. This game has literal endless possibilities if you take the time to learn how to use the editor and all the goodies that come with this game being a PLATFORM. Remember, this game is a platform you build on, not just play in it's base form.

Download the game, Arma 4 wont be around for atleast 3 more years (Bohemia usually releases the series around a 7-10 year gaps)"
21587,"Best Mil-Sim ever! From Flashpoint to ARMA3 very good evolution, thanks to Bohemia and the community, keep it up..."
21588,its arma
21589,i like it very nice
21590,This game is army. Very gun and boom.
21591,"My hours our spread out over many different mods and game modes, very fun game with massive amounts of variety. A control scheme that takes a while to get the hang of but once mastered provides a very fluid gameplay experience. (save for occasional performance hiccups on high load servers or big missions)

Active mod community provides a near endless supply of game modes, weapons, maps and missions. 
Also a good game for trolling people if that's your shtick, direct communication channel in PvP or survival modes show this especially.

21592,this is a fantastic game for miltary rp
21593,-
21594,"Best game ever!, Keep it up and release ARMA 4!"
21595,Didnt know I love milsims so much until i bought this game. Im fairly new and the game is hard to learn but its fucking fun.
21596,Issa lit.
21597,mint game that is all lol
21598,"this game the best realistic shooter there is rn , the true sandbox experience"
21599,.
21600,"Arma 3 is really the only military sandbox of this scale on the market. It offers an infinite amount of gameplay opportunity through its powerful simulation engines, Eden Editor and Zeus interfaces. Paired with a massive and thriving community, Arma 3 has more content than any other 5 games combined.

However, buyer beware. Arma 3 tends to test your patience. Countless bugs, an aging platform and large optimization issues hinders the Arma 3 experience greatly. Though, through many years of patches, updates, etc. Arma 3 has gotten pretty stable as of 2020. Also along those lines, Arma 3 has many out-dated mechanics. Because of these mechanics, I would say Arma 3 has a non-intuitive learning curve for new players. I would not say the game is ""hard"". You have to learn just as much as any other large-scale AAA game. But, the learning curve is not straight forward. It's greatly bogged down by old, and poorly implemented UI/UX design.

 All that said, I have played over 1K or something hours and until Arma 4 or a competitor comes out, I will continue to bank hours on Arma 3. There really is a wealth of opportunity for simulating any style of military conflict you could imagine. And as of 2020 I would honestly say this is the best time to get into Arma 3 if you haven't!"
21601,Very Fun
21602,adequate
21603,...
21604,What can I say. It's EPIC!

21613,If you havnt bought this game ur not worthy
21614,"arma series is one of my favorite series. so much things to do, easy to learn difficult to master.
you will need the dlcs for best experience thats the only negative"
21615,"Holy shit where do I begin. Well for starters this game has got so much to do in it, and i'm not even counting mods yet. With Zeus you can make and put people through endless amounts of missions and what makes it better... or worse.. is that you never know what type of Zeus you are going to get. You could get a shitty Zeus that has no idea what hes doing. A Zeus that has some experience with Zeus and is competent enough to make a mission. A Zeus that has a decent amount of experience and can make a pretty good mission. and then there is the off chance that you can get a god tier Zeus that knows his way around the Zeus features that can make a mission that is fun to play, pilot, plan, command, and drive in. Also fuck every other game mode Zeus is the better one. Now onto the mods. This game has a metric fuck ton of mods to use and Zeus with. Each mod has content for any mission you want to do. Say you wanted to to a mech war against the Starship troopers Arachnid bugs, you can do that. Or how about Space Marines fighting Nazis you can fucking do that. There are endless possibilities to the shit you can do with this game. I know I don't have that many hours compared to some people who play this and there is alot of other things to cover about this game, but I don't have all the time in the world to write this and you don't have all the time in the world to read this. So if you have seen this review I really hope I somewhat convinced you to buy this game or if you already have it to check out the mods for the game. I leave"
21616,"There are very few game developers that not only allow but actively encourage modification of their game, to the extent that the modifications totally change the game itself; that is, however, what defines the Armed Assault franchise and the developer, Bohemian Interactive. With some time and effort, you can do anything, so long as it doesn't break the game engine. Just look in the workshop or armaholic to see the breadth of modification that is possible."
21617,i have no idea what the fuck im doing or what is going on. Just like IRL. Very realistic.

21650,"Wow. What can I say about ArmA 3. (Armed Assault 3, that is) This is an absolute phenominon of a game, and that goes beyond the core gameplay and fun factor delivered in the executable file itself, but in the knowledge gained from partaking on this veritable adventure. First, there is the transferablle tactical expertise, which when gathered from playtime in this game can be moved to other games like CSGO, or PUBG, or even the Witcher 3, to further enhance your experience there. Upon seeing the loading screen of this game, your mind is injected with subtle yet core changes to its strategic stratephos, allowing calculations on a grand scale to be conducted in lightning speed. Next, we see that the game actually makes you an immediate comedian. Simply saying in game catchphrases like, ""Contact Contact Contact"", ""Im taking overwatch"", or ""Calling in CAS"" will have your friends, family, significant others, and neighbors sprawled on the ground laughing. Finally, this game gives you a complete rudimentary understanding of everything military based, think of it as being in the army for a year or two. When you see a veteran in public, you can now approach with a wide variety of conversational topics, such as PTSD, or how black NPCs are worse than white ones. You can tell them you fully understand how heavy a pack of gear weighs, and how long average in operation transport flights take. If you dont understand some of the ""terminology"" ive been interspersing throughout this review, I think that just goes to show how simple minded your brain can be pre-ArmA 3 experience. (Armed Assault 3, that is) Talk to me when you barrel roll your first helicopter inside of a friendly APC while blasting trap music over the stereo system while 600 invisible objects explode around you, sending you flying under the map, while your CO applauds you on your incredible dedication to immersion and realism. Silly casual. Maybe (Scoffs) COD, or (Chuckles) Battlefield is more your thing."

21658,"Arma 3 is a mixed bag of good, bad, and ugly. Overall, my time with ARMA 3 and the different units I've been in has been positive.

Lets start with the good:
If you're looking for a true military sandbox, this is about as good as it gets. There aren't many games that can simulate full war-games with a server full of real people. From running as infantry as a fireteam leader, to a gunner on a battle tank, to dogfighting in any kind of weather. The modding community is very active, everything from Star Wars, Halo, Warhammer, and Proper Modern/NATO can be roleplayed thanks to the modding community. ARMA's development tools are freely available and allow you to make whatever you desire.

One big advantage this game has is the amount of teamwork that can be made to be required. From squad tactics and dogfighting formations, to logistical and medical challenges that make for a one of a kind experience that other FPS games can't even come close to. Because of the vast amounts of units out there, you are sure to find something that fits your taste.

The Bad:
TLDR: Pricing and Performance

From time to time, there will be instances where you will be using vanilla weapons, especially if you're in a modern day unit.
At least a third of the weapons and vehicles are locked behind DLC paywalls and feels pretty empty without them. If you don't do modern stuff this shouldn't affect you as much since you'll be getting your weapons and stuff from mods.

Something that you will notice a lot of if you don't have a beastly computer is the frame rate. Despite the PC standard being 60 fps, pretty much everyone that plays modded and doesn't have a good rig will usually get less than 30 fps depending on what you're modlist is. Considering this game has been out since 2013, it's a little frustrating to have a game run this poorly that was released 7 years ago and is still getting DLC packs released. 

I've talked a lot about the multiplayer aspect of this game because it's really the main drive behind this series. Yes it has singleplayer content, but it is nothing to write home about. If you play this game as your main time sink, 99% of your playtime will be on multiplayer servers. 

The Ugly:
The ARMA community is.... interesting to say the least. Like many servers and units in different games it's a constant rat race. The people you can meet in these units can range from 14 year olds who think they are god, to power hungry members and admins that do not care, and the occasional racist/hateful unit that are very open about what they think. Despite these negative attributes, you can find a group that clicks with you, and even make IRL friends from this silly little video game.  

As stated at the beginning, this game can be fun with a proper group of people, but beware of higher performance requirements and game instability from using mods."
21659,best

It will beat you senseless. You will die a bunch, for reasons that feel bullshit, because someone half a klick away shot you before you even realized he was there, or a mission objective will be described as ""here, do this thing"" and will wind up being a thing that eats hours until you finally _get it_...

But man, it's fun. When things are working, when you're immersed in the simulation, one with your weapon, approaching an enemy squad and clearing rooms, peeking around corners, crouching behind windows, managing your magazines, and listening carefully for footfalls, engines, helicopter blades or jet engines to tell you where your enemy is and what you need to do to defeat him.

Be prepared for a learning curve. Be prepared for some hilarious glitches. Be prepared to retry. A bunch.

It's a Bohemia game so you can expect some bugs and some instances of ""WTF"" which has sprung the term ""Getting ARMA-ed"" With that being said, this game is fun as hell. Go grunt and wipe up your opposition with a decent list of weapons and equipment, or take to the skies with one of the many aircraft that the game provides right from the start. Once you feel like you have a basic grasp of the game. Get some mods and join a unit, and see a whole new side of this game."

21695,"Played it a bit, seems alright"
21696,"Umm what year is it.....guess i should write something as i have a fair few hours on Arma 3.
Amazing mil-sim one of the best ive played in my life, I feel nowadays its kept alive by the community and it has a great one of them.

Love Arma for life but will say better with friends although you do meet some great squads online,, and i ill say i wish it was bigger and more populated with more servers like it used to be.
tanoa is a great map but never really used on the game as not as many players as used to be ,,,,but still going strong and hope to see it get better and maybe updated with more stuff and just kept alive for years."
21697,Very good mil-sim. So much you can do with the game a ton of mods. I give a big thumbs up with the money.
21698,Great game to put my time in... if I had the time.
21699,Probably one of the worst games I have ever played. That being said I will still play it because I can't stop.
21700,"nice
"
21701,Takes some getting used to but brilliant.
21702,Very cool Army Simulator. Very complicated but fun with friends and alone. Imagine a really complicated COD with custom stories.
21703,This. Is. War.
21704,military good goood graphic
21705,"pog champ
"
21706,"i tried it out, i guess it's pretty cool"
21707,very good could changed the eden editor up a bit so it is easier to find helicopter cars planes and things like that and change the transport planes so you can walk around in them. I can also never get in a multiplayer game because they all have mods so i always just play in eden editor but overall it is a very good and realistic game.
21708,"Fun- hard, but not too hard to get into at first. But, do not play the campaign. It's just a walking simulator."
21709,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless."

Arma 3 is quite simply a [strike] sandbox [/strike], a toybox, its has everything you need to go from a highly scripted insurgency campaign, to deep and detailed recreations of an entire conflict, to completely fictional D&D esque community campaigns."

21737,"This game is still going strong. The Mods are getting better and better.
Gameplay is still a learning curve but once you learn it, it's hard to forget.

Only problem is the way the Devs think separating new DLC is a good idea, can't have everything in one package. You can't run the game with all the DLCs at once and they won't port the Guns, Items, maps and Vehicles over so you can't play with em in a base game. You have to individually run each new DLC from the launcher.

But the game is still pretty fun."
21738,"Wow! been glued for eight hours. . . Ok, I should probably go to bed now, No! . . not probably. . . Definitely! Yes! Definitely, trying to go to bed, a gift, cheers bro, good morning, creeeeeeeeeeeak thump! moan wheeze, cough snore."

21745,"Buggy, horrible, CPU battering game. Yet you always come back for more. The community is okay so long as you find yourself a private group of like minded wankers."
21746,ah yes
21747,it good
21748,"Is very meh game in todays standard, but is GREAT game with tha community."
21749,Probably the most comprehensive and best mil-sim experience you can have outside of a Real life larp group.
21750,"The greatest sandbox out there waiting for each and every one of you to boot it up and witness the wonders that come to life when developers and community combine their love and dedication for a game that in turn grants us memories, joy and friends (or brothers). Enjoy!"
21751,Highly recommend playing it from an SSD for best performance.
21752,"The base campaign of Arma 3 was not especially fun in my opinion. The AI is sometimes near omniscient and capable of hitting you with a buckshot shotgun from 500 meters. The vehicles sometimes launch up several hundred meters into the air due to physics collision anomalies. It can get frustrating and would benefit from improvements, for sure.

The modding and the sandbox nature of the game make up for all the quirks and problems in my own opinion enough to justify recommending the game. It works well enough most of the time to be played and enjoyed with friends and provides a platform for a host of different combat scenarios. Far from perfect yet good enough."
21753,"Insert mandatory ""Played a bit, was nice"" here

Jokes aside, both the game and the community is nice. The amounts of mods you get download even enhances the gameplay even more. Most servers you join would be really helpful towards new players, introducing them to some less known features or help out with some mechanics.

Finished all of the campaigns I could (except the Contact DLC one) and I liked all of them, each of them used a game mechanic that helps you get adjusted to them easier while still leaving you with a sense of enjoyment. 

Sure the game has some optimization issues that need to be addressed instead of more content. In multiplayer, when servers are populated, in towns the fps tends to fall a lot so that's one of the issues. There are several ways to glitch through stairs or walls and be able to shoot through them giving a total advantage, but since it's the fault of the engine, I doubt it will get fixed.

In the end I still recommend people to play this game, try it out and share their experiences. Arma 3 keeps community alive because of it's such expansive workshop content. Whether you are a singleplayer fan or a multiplayer one, if base game gets boring, you can always download mods to ""expand the horizon""."

21761,"900+ hours on this game and I still haven't had a single  minute where I wasn't enjoying the game or having an amazing time. Also one of the most realistic games/simulators I've ever played, feeling almost as realistic as EFT.  One of the friendliest and least toxic communities I've experienced so far, sadly, none of my friends play the game, which is partly what makes this game so special in the first place, but it is still incomprehensible how fun it is even without friends, and you can either take my word on this review, or find out for yourself by playing this game. (For ultimately the same outcome. (You'll enjoy it a ton.))"
21762,This game has the same performance as  garfield kart 10/10
21763,Most amazing game I have ever played in my entire life. There are endless possibilities that you can do. Put your mind to it and you can do it. Just got done watching an awesome action packed war movie? Well you can literally recreate the movie in the games Eden editor and play and experience the movie for yourself. I can go on and on but I'm hoping you're picking up what I'm putting down at this point. I only hope that they continue to make more Arma in the future because life without Arma is no life at all. Nuff Said
21764,is cool
21765,Great military sim.
21766,The editor plus the workshop content is endless entertainment.

21771,"This game needs up to date and powerful CPU and graphics card with minimum of 16GB RAM and with the game installed on an SSD on a computer that has a very good cooling system. On top of that we need to buy the base game with DLCs to enjoy the game. And beyond that, there is a good learning curve behind this military sandbox. Add another hundred hours of finding and gelling with an Arma 3 unit for multiplayer experience and community building. Is all of this worth it. Absolutely. Yes! Hardly you find a game with developers with the passion and customer support like that of Bohemia Interactive. The community of modders are great and this game is standing on their shoulders. For a lean experience of this game I suggest a CPU that runs at least 3.4GHz base clock speed 4-6 cores with a good 4GB VRAM graphics card.  And nominally have the base game, marksman DLC, helicopters DLC, Jets DLC, Apex DLC others are good and have really good storylines, but if you are like me who primarily tries to push his budget and hardware for great multiplayer performance, these DLCs are all that you would ever need. Stories in all the campaigns are good. Weapons and ballistics perform close to what one would expect on a real life counterpart. Vehicle physics and that includes boats and airplanes are mostly done well. Mods are usually running stable till a drastic update comes from BI. Community in Arma 3 is possibly the best in the PC gaming and this includes modders to 18 year old digital Sgt.s  Graphics in this game are splended, night missions and fog missions feel incredibly immersive. With the right set of mods this feels like a simulator for infantry combat. And possibly the biggest one yet, some mods in this game get Arma 3 a couple of levels lower than DCS. This is a true sandbox experience with something for everyone. Add a great Arma 3 unit in the mix and you have the best Arma experience, I promise you. Now the game does have its flaws. Lack of optimization, clunky mechanics and some (rare) ridicules glitches to name a few. The game is perfect for large scale combined arms gameplay. But in scenarios like CQB the game really misses a lot and I am not saying because it cannot, I am sure the issue is fixable. But the game should improve the CQB experience. Removing AI glitches in buildings is a start and making the movement for both AI and players in the buildings as smooth as possible is the hopeful end. I have played Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis and it used an Action menu. Decade and a half later Arma 3 continues to use such an outdated interaction menu with lots of issues. And lack of a functional radio in game is something that should be fixed in the game's official release and not be patched up using ACE or ACRE. Bohemia you must improve the Optimization and Mechanics. Editor, Zeus and Mod ability is second class to none in any gaming genre. Cons, though few but significant are far overshadowed with the many many great things this game has to offer. This is the most unique thing out there and it deserves support. This is a game tries to do a lot of things and I hope they try to innovate in the next iterations of the series. This is a game of special significance in our culture. And this review box isn't big enough to talk about the best in this game. If you are a rich person with a top computer hardware and a  curiosity and willingness to dive into the rough yet rewarding sea that is Arma 3, I suggest you go ahead and buy the game. It is worth it keeping in mind the things I mentioned. And if you are someone looking for a friendly and fun Arma 3 unit, there are many of them there very good ones. One of them is TheSpeshalPlatoon. Free to join. Buy this game. Go now."
21772,"still barely know how to have fun with this game. My 13 hours is spent playing the first 30 minutes of scenarios then realizing its insanely boring and not going anywhere, then trying another one. All the while having no idea about a vast majority of the games mechanics because it does not tell you anything. Just trying to get my feet off the ground and figure out where the fun is in this game I still have not learned how to play it what so ever. Skip this and get some of the newer military sims."
21773,"This game is terribly unoptimized. Unacceptable by today's standards. 
Go find a game that doesn't give you insane performance issues on a good build."

21806,"If you like any kind of shooter style, (tactical, PVP, Survivor, etc) then this game has it. Mods made by the community are wide and varied, and some amazing work has been done that helps the game get even more exciting.

To run this game,  My pc is about 6 years old and I can still play it at about 50-60 fps, (Medium graphics) so you don't need to have a beast of a pc to enjoy it.

The game controls are a bit difficult, but you will need to learn some of the key controls, which you can find out from the campaigns or from other players, but once you do.. mate... kiss any spare time goodbye. (Gfs will hate this game... mine does... lol...)

I have played this game too much... (3200 hours... that's 130-ish days... wtf) and I'm still learning about it... 
You can easily loose HOURS in this game... (played for 24 hours once... gonna do it again soon... lol) its crazy. But I still love it and keep playing.

But the other reason I play this game is the community. Playing with your fellow Arma-rites is always great too, you get to know us regulars. The Arma community is amasing, with everyone helping each other when they have a problem (like running a server, creating a mission, creating content) or wanting to learn. I'm not saying there isn't the toxic side of it too, but get in, join a team and play... you will really enjoy it and keep coming back."
21807,This is a good game
21808,very cool and fun i play this game all the times and it is fun yes
21809,Great gameplay and even a solo campaign. Skip the COD and go straight to the real deal!

21822,"Amazing game was actually worth the money, still play it to this day when iv'e got nothing else to do. Therefore, it can be said that it has a good replayability. I just wish they made Arma 4 instead of releasing DLC's that are lackluster."
21823,Wish the engine was better or if they were to release Arma 4
21824,a wonderful waste of time
21825,GREAT GAME
21826,"Expecting military simulation like in previous installments was a mistake. The game is set in near future ""lite sci-fi"" environment, which is not bad on its own, but  just does not really hold a candle  to previous contemporary or historical settings. Infantry combat is somewhat arcady, with enemies being quite resistant even at very close range. Arcade feeling goes to the missions as well. I guess the game is not bad if you dont expect the same kind of play as in previous games, but for me, this is a big let down.

Edit after some time: After some playing I actually change the review to recommend the game."

As an avid Arma 2 player before this release, I still return day after day to mess around in the editor, sandbox Altis and online servers. Spent the majority of my time in online and in Life/milsim servers. I would rate this game a strong 9/10. Love this game and provides not only masses of content, but masses of stunning, realistic and overall enjoyable content. 

I cannot wait to see what Arma 4 has to offer in the future."

21848,Would you recommend this game to other players? Yes -- No -- Maybe Later -- Stop Asking Me
21849,"Imagine a hyperrealistic shooter, with a story, and an open world.

Then imagine that it didn't have wonky physics (trucks that do barrel rolls from bumping a rock). Imagine the AI wouldn't 'aggro' and shoot at you from beyond the draw distance (even with a scope). Imagine that enemies had to actually draw line of sight, and not just shoot through any and all cover/concealment. Imagine that you could edit your guns and change out parts from guns you find on the fly. Imagine an interface that doesn't exhaust you by virtue of it's needless complexity.

If you stopped with the first line, that's ARMA. If you want the paragraph below, go play Escape from Tarkov. In Soviet Somewhere better games are made for you."

21866,"I bought a Logitech x56 because this game made me fall in love with the planes in it. Complex, fun and explosive gameplay"
21867,Big boom boom
21868,"10/10 spend way to much time playing this
Story is pretty good 
graphics are great
find yourself a group of friends to play with and you will have a blast"
21869,fun game for mil stims
21870,"Realistic soldiers. 10/10
I flew to the other end of the map while crushing one of them with a tank."
21871,this game is amazing over the past few years ive only face a couple of bugs which the support team helped me sort out
21872,so real war
21873,"played peek a boo with an enemy tank...


then the house me and a few squadmates magically turned into a pile of rubble.."
21874,Played this game a small amount. Not bad.
21875,Ebin.
21876,beste sim game i play with friends ever
21877,dont  get honestly half the people get a code that makes u fix half the files for an ok game.
21878,Its aint for no weebs just dweebs
21879,...
21880,A good game.
21881,Good game
21882,You become completely absorbed. The sounds sell it. the graphics compliment it. After its over you get a sort of PTSD sensation. Imagine what the VR version will be like in 10 years from now!
21883,This game is hardcore AF. As a military fanatic I absolutley adore this game!
21884,"Best Milsim, well maybe i cant say it because its my first milsim (unless you consider CoD and MoH a mil sim game), but its the best i ever played, the community is nice, in game player are nice, but the dlc ads are annoying especially the pop up window that cover the middle of your screen"
21885,One of my favourite games. Never gets old. Deserves an Award!
21886,"Looking for an actual military sim? Here's the game for you. Sure there are many bugs and glitches, but they all add up to the fun of it! Would suggest to play with some friends!"
21887,"As a guy that likes army-war things (movies,games etc), i find this game one of the best for me.
I haven't played it a lot, but from the videos i was watching on youtube i saw tons of potential in it and decided to buy it on the Black Friday on November 2020.
The campaign missions and scenes are incredible. Last night i hopped into a multiplayer co-op mission and the community seemed pretty helpfull for the newbies and were extremly happy that the game is still getting bough and shit( Og shit ye).
I'm looking for an amazing time spent on this game.
"
21888,"Even in 2020, this game still Best Shooter game"
21889,Great game and love the community ive been playing for almost a month now and i love how easy it is to get lost for hours in the world
21890,An amazing game with so much to do and a great workshop
21891,Good Soup
21892,love and hate it at the same time...
21893,"ARMA never gets boring, its the ultimate mil sim sandbox playground!"
21894,Best war-crime simulator out there.
21895,"DEAD GAME DONT WASTE UR MONEY!!!
"
21896,"Clickbait, there should be more arms."
21897,"OK, I have 60 fps at max setting with 3080. What campaign should I start ?"
21898,"someone air dropped an ambulance in to save a fallen soldier

10/10"
21899,"Played a lot of sandbox mode when i first got the game, that got stale after like 80 hours. This may not sound interessting, but the most fun i have had in this game is by my self. Setting up scenarios i try to beat in the editor. It's enless hours of fun. :)"
21900,i feel like i'm in nam best game 10/10
21901,"Obviously this game has a lot of flaws, mainly the abysmal performance, but if you manage to look past those things it‚Äôs one of the greatest Sandbox games out there. With nearly endless possibilities in regards how you play the game and a huge dedicated modding community, you can easily dump a few hundred hours into this gem."
21902,"Great military simulation co-op game. 
Check your surrounding!"
21903,yas
21904,Love playing this game. This is one of the most fun games i have ever played. I just keep playing and playing and cant stop lol. I would 100% recommend to everyone. The player base needs to grow back up to where it was a couple of years ago.
21905,alot of fun especially with friends
21906,"very good game, fun when played online via a specific launcher, great with friends, all around interesting game, use IRL weapons, play some event, or pvp against each other in and open world maps"
21907,Really gooooood
21908,"Best Mil Sim Ever created for me personally, sky is the limit !"
21909,"Fun game but missing a lot of the fun from war if you know what I mean, why are we presented with little to no opportunity to commit war crimes? My potent seed deserves to soil the womb of every unfortunate that crosses my path. Even now as I‚Äôm sitting here, retired after 20 years I can feel myself.. getting hard at the thought of bodies turning limp before me. What is a more beautiful sight than a chest exit wound big enough to jump through? This is the reality of war.  Women fear me, dogs fear me, men turn their eyes away from me as I walk, no creature dares to make a sound in my presence. I find myself alone, among unequals on this barren earth."
21910,"Endless lego for military freaks (+ tons of awesome community mods)
11/10"
21911,"best game i have ever played, i would suggest looking up more information about this game before you start playing there are a bunch of mods that you can use for RP, milsim ,and more"
21912,"Still one of the games which is the most replayable. The love is still there, the bugs are still there. Life is great!"
21913,Most fun ive had in a while
21914,"This is one of the few games i am confident will stand the test of time for years to come. So far it has with stood 7 years with out a sequel, i am very impressed by this and have played it for many hours."
21915,"Good gam, many warcrimes were committed."
21916,Really fun but control the character is harder than controlling a jet irl.
21917,very fun
21918,This game is fun until someone decides to spawnkill everyone in the server lmfao
21919,"you can literally make your own missions with mods and or dlc, from zombies to anything you want"
21920,"Great game. Doesn't punish me for ""accidentally"" killing civilians"
21921,Got it when it first came out and im still playing it. If that doesnt say something idk what will
21922,Please make a 4th Arma with a better engine
21923,is very good
21924,pretty ass game
21925,good game if you have an imagination. plenty of mods. really wish more players would play
21926,It gud
21927,"Amazing game, a shame no one I know wants to play nor is the community of the game in my country alive. If you are from an english speaking country or from europe, buy and play it with friends or find an unit to play with; guaranteed fun for hours on end."
21928,Could be worse
21929,cute
21930,"Find a group of friends, play the shit out of this, and laugh and cry at how much you love to suffer semi realistic mil sim"
21931,"Good game, hard bushes."
21932,"Always fun to play, mods and friends make it shine."
21933,Great combat game...worthy experience.
21934,"Alright this has needed to happen a LONG time ago.

I am 1500 hours in to my Arma journey, and there's a lot I gotta say. Bohemia has released a masterpiece of a game. This milsim is not too much in your face to the point where it's confusing, and everything is easy to understand. Modding the game can give it a lot of depth and expand upon already simple concepts if you find it too easy. Maybe you don't like shooting a rifle and hate combat? Well there's Zeus and Editor which allow you to sandbox the game and have fun making scenarios in which the AI will fight each other. Maybe you don't like firing a rifle, but you find Zeus and Editor boring, no problem! You can be a vehicle driver and operator, a extract and insertion pilot, you can use your wits to assemble Mortars and operate artillery for support to your unit. The community itself is also okay, I won't say it is good or awful however. I do find that most of the community is pretty funny and although hard on one another, do it out of fun and sarcasm. But there is the armpit of the community which exists that do like to be problems and enjoy making people mad, but what community DOESN'T have them? Overall, this is a neat and amazing title to play, I guarantee with mods and the frequent community attention the devs give this game, you will never be bored and always find something you want to try or do."
21935,"The best times I've had in this game are riding with the boys in the techi singing on our way to ""liberate"" supplies for our resistance. 10/10 formed many a brotherhood and friendship on this game. Remember habibi stay hydrated."
21936,Arma Life.
21937,very good game if you like battle sims but if you think its another cod ripoff then your in for a suprise
21938,"GOOD WASTE OF TIME, GO OUTSIDE AND CHANGE THE WORLD LIFE IS A VIDEO GAME TRY PLAYING IT"
21939,Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
21940,"Its a fun game, its even more fun with friends but avoid the drama of milsim groups."
21941,"Great mil sim, lots of details, hard if your a noob like me but fun non the less.
Sappers lead the way"
21942,solid game always a good time and great graphics
21943,"Still new. Its ok I guess.
Will update with more hours"
21944,"Wonderful game, especially with friends."
21945,Dsync and plenty of fun
21946,Still one of my favorite game after years!
21947,JMNILO 'K
21948,.
21949,"kinda, kinda bro."
21950,noice
21951,its good far better with ACE. get some mods. also find some friends or join a unit to play with or it might get a bit stale
21952,still good
21953,Review.
21954,Good game
21955,"[spoiler] As if it were 2005 games, its system is very rudimentary and falls short of this generation's games
save your money There are many games that surpass it by stages [spoiler]"
21956,"yes i likee game i shoot evil pepple yes very recommend very hungry i am i crazy man yes
very nice jes
"
21957,Its very good
21958,10/10 would commit war crimes again
21959,This game fucking sucks
21960,very epic
21961,vary fun easy to get use too lets u have a lot of freedom
21962,Best game.
21963,e
21964,"This game is slow, it is not a fast paced fps game where you just jump into a game right after getting it. It is not for everyone, but if that isn't a problem for you and you are willing to put in hours to learn, then I implore you to try. Arma 3 has an amazing amount of detail, the campaign is well-made and manages to make walking and standing in bushes for an hour or two tense. You don't get coddled and have an incredible amount of freedom."
21965,I'm only here to get a steam badge.
21966,Endless possibilities
21967,arfe
21968,The best military simulation game that exists.
21969,If you wanna waste your time buy this 10/10
21970,very great if u have frenz yes mlg
21971,
21972,multisim at its finest
21973,If you wanna play play with 32 yr adults that know what they're doing and you dont know shit and sit silent the this is the game for you
21974,ITS GOODS GAME JUST MY FPS IN GAME ITS 12
21975,I can't get enough of this game.
21976,"(positive) I've played 99 hours of this game, I couldn't stop playing it, Its a really good Shooting game, if You want to edit your own maps to make your own mission's or to make your war games realistic, This is the game for you, (Negative) its a Bitch to install."
21977,GaME.
21978,warcrime simulator is the best game i've every played
21979,"I've enjoyed Arma 3 off and on for a while now. There are a multitude of game modes, I personally enjoy sandbox servers where you can typically play any role and work together with team mates and friends. I recently found a friend of mine had a unit and joined up. We go on operations at least once a week and our whole group has fun. Arma 3 is great for making new friends, and playing with the ones you already know, the community is friendly from what I've seen and I enjoy every moment."
21980,Game without an error is not a good game.
21981,"Ah yes, a review for Arma 3.

Arma 3's a decent game, though it could do with some fixes here and there, especially with the physics engine.
I've been killed a few times thanks to it acting up when im operating a vehicle.

Overall, the main campaign does require save-scumming at times, but generally, if you know what to do, how to do it, and do it well, you'll mostly end up only having to retry once or twice. I (accidently) went for the ""Bad ending"" (im not going to spoil what that means.) 

The Tanks DLC is a good DLC to buy, if you want to play with 2 of the 3 (I count the Angara's as one.) vehicles it adds in a ""Campaign"" setting.

The VANILLA Multiplayer scene is kinda isolated to Livonia, making getting the Contact DLC a pretty decent priority if you wanna play VANILLA Multiplayer.
Overall, when it comes to Multiplayer, try and find a unit with a friend or two in it, that's the best way to enjoy Arma 3 in Multiplayer.

My advice, get Marksmen, Tanks, and Apex, then join up with a unit you like."
21982,It is a labour of love that if you can stick with will give you countless hours of fun especially if you find zeus groups
21983,very fun?
21984,Very Good. I recommend.
21985,It's okay
21986,"This game is my favorite game I have ever played. You can do anything from being a clone trooper fighting battle droids to being a civilian building a crime syndicate. There are countless mods and communities out there. If you enjoy military sims like SQUAD, join a milsim. If you like life roleplay you can play either modded or vanilla. Theres countless things you can do. The only thing I have to say is... give it a shot. It will be boring at first but once you find a community to join, the fun never ends."
21987,god DAMN this game is good

22000,"i love it 
"
22001,"vary good

22002,"Best to enjoy with some community/clan, organized zeus-controlled scenarios are way better than anything you'll get from official servers or random Invade and Annex etc. coop game modes, wish i found that out earlier than after 1000 hours of game :'D"
22003,Find a good community and this is the best army sim
22004,"This is a great game and the fact that they are still developing on it is amazing

1000 hours in Roleplay and the rest in KOTH"
22005,"After 7.5k hours of Arma 3 I have finally decided to write a review. I bought this game back in November 2013. Today I have played this game 7 years on the day. I love the game and must say that after all these years I have seen amazing and bad updates. But it's still being worked on by the Bohemia team. I hope for a grate future for the Arma series!

Patiently waiting for Arma 4...."
22006,"Please help me, this game forces my attention and destroys my memory but I just can't stop playing, its just too fun."
22007,"Probably the best war simulation. It has a few cons, but they are acceptable.
Extremely moddable and fun in multiplayer."
22008, I've played for 100 hours now and have to say that the game is great. The community is kind and very milsim. If you want to play a rp or very realistic military game this is for you.
22009,Bought it yesterday and I'm hooked.
22010,yes
22011,"haha gun go pheweeeeur brrrr wooooooo boom pshiottu wso and all of the ppl are dead haha

update: afghanistan 2 electric boogaloo"
22012,"Arma 3 is not a game, it's a hobby."
22013,"Join friends, shoot friends, crash twice, play at 26 FPS, bleed to death because of crashing into a small bush, AI sees through smoke you cant, held at gunpoint to nominate for labor of love award, had to write this and recommend game so my family lives, good game would play again."
22014,"It's quite realistic & fun, had fun even though i was losing on multiple KoTH matches"
22015,"Love the game, honestly pick it up while on sale as the Apex DLC is pretty much required to have any fun. Once you get Apex there is hours of fun to be had with friends and new friends you make along the way. The game has a generally accepting community that are happy to help you learn to play. Sometimes you run into a toxic player but they can easily just be ignored. Fully recommend picking the game up now while it's on a big sale, also pick it up once it's off sale if you can spare the money.a"
22016,"If you're looking for a realistic military sim, don't buy this game.
My most fun memories come from it breaking in stupid ways, and things not working as they should have. The base game leaves allot to be desired. It spreads its self so thin there's not much to it if you're not an infantry man. The bullet physics are okay, but the explosives seem like a dice throw. Driving is like its on ice.
Its good to play for a laugh, but nothing more."
22017,RLLY FUN BUT TAKES TIME
22018,"Mods, DLC, and extended support prop up an aged engine that Arma 3 uses. Overall, the community is alive and well if your PC can handle the CPU intensive game. Also can be found pretty cheap during every Steam sale"
22019,A true and elegant masterpiece. An experience like no other. And you must play!

22025,"It's not about the realism. Many games claim to be realistic and what that means to a player could be different for another player. What Arma 3 is about is the experience. It's the scale and the details of the game that make it feel real. There are times when I am driving down a road and I feel like I had been there before. In combat, I want my soldiers to make it back. On the same map, with the same units, the battles will always play out differently."
22026,Haven't played this game that much.... but it's kinda fun if you have a group to play with.
22027,"Basically ill give it to you plain and simple, if u want a realistic army/war simulator this in my opinion is the best one by far."
22028,good way to have fun realistically
22029,its a great Milsim
22030,Weak single player campaign
22031,"really fun to play and has an amazing community to play with. so many different things to do that it is impossible to get bored of.
Highly recommend!"
22032,"Great game, but badly optimized! 
The mods are the core of this game usually, but I still recommend it! A good game to play with a lot of friends!"
22033,"Oh yeah, this game is awesome, mod it and it's ever better 
"
22034,"If you like tactical and meticulous instead of run and gun, then this game is outstanding"
22035,The Chad Simulator.
22036,"Still a good game, hands up for devs for still managing this game and adding new content."
22037,Very Good!
22038,"I play this game a lot but I can definitely see why it is still popular is because of the modding community (2020)

The game is still going strong after 7 years."
22039,still fun
22040,beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeest game
22041,"I mean, It's hard to me to put a lot of hours into a game, And its taken years, But i always love coming back to this game."
22042,Listen to the experts out there! This game is a must-have for military lovers!
22043,Before having this game my sense of humor wasn't made up of war crimes .
22044,"My antistasis campaigns in this game are a lot of fun. The game needs more optimization so people get more fps and less stutter, even on good computers. The equipment and mechanics of the game are often realistic (apart from the physics that can make a vehicle go boom)."
22045,The King of the Hill Mode is chill.
22046,Amazing ! My friends took my out in the combat and left me there to die !
22047,√ñ √Ñ
22048,"Gud game, eaz spend couple hundred hours, better with communities"
22049,good game

22051,"- Kerry, what the heck are you doin'?
- Uh, writing a review, sir.
- You what? Stop playing around, Kerry, these greenbacks aren't goin' to train themselves!"
22052,hard AF and u need a very decent pc to play it without lag( AMD not recommended)

22054,"My ABSOLUTE favourite game of all time, I've had so many fun times while playing by myself or with friends!"
22055,Cannot be bested
22056,You wont get me alive Geneva Conventions!
22057,This game has given so many memories and is probably one of the best games ever made despite the bugs and constant glitches it just makes the game better
22058,"would defo buy. had it for quite a while now and its kind of the game you take breaks from, but never actually stop playing"
22059,"Warfare simulation classic. 10/10
And if you ever got enough of realistic modern combat, use mods or make some yourself."
22060,still great content
22061,"A fantastic game with mods.

Its fun to play alone but it is best with friends but that should be a given."
22062,"It's really fun tbh i recommend getting it.

- Amazing Graphics.
- A lot of good Updates.
- Kind Community.
- Amazing Gameplay.
- Missions and Tutorials.
- Online Servers(Online Missions, RPG, etc.)
- A lot of Controls(Over your Own Body(you can even Bend down), Over Vehicles)
- And a lot more to explore."
22063,Game with best support by devs
22064,"play with a group of friends 
Need to download mods which has more/x5 size than the orginal game"
22065,Even after Years the developers and the modding comunity are keeping the game strong! Lovely to spend evenings with your friends. Clear recommendation to everybody :)
22066,One of the best games ever played. A game that is able to reflect the reality and draw us into the world of armed conflicts.
22067,"Super fun with Frinds
"
22068,"Still the best war game ever, for me, it's very fun with mods tho"
22069,Pretty good
22070,"I was looking for a game which makes more sense where I can do something that I could not do in my real life. This game has more realistic military simulation than any other game. Just go for it. 
"
22071,"bought this game some years ago and haven't played it for some time so when i decided to come back i thought i would go through the training to re familiarise myself with game play and catch up with changes so after having to go through the bohemia sign up again which was a pain i went straight to training tried to start the training course 22 times the start point gives nothing to me in the way of direction or course to take i gave up and decided to commit this game to the list of games i no longer play sorry guys but i think along with the extra cost of addons and weapons and vehicles this has joined the long line of games that just wants to take money and is not interested in the players.
as a quick calculation it would cost me around ¬£60 to get all the updates not worth it after paying full price for the game itself nearly 7 years ago 
if you have the time and dedication this might be the game for you if you want a game you can pick up and play look for something else"
22072,"great game, great community, great mods, great devs, great bugs"
22073,"ARMA 3 is not for everyone what with it being a Mil Sim at heart, and it is far from being a perfect game ... especially in the performance and DLC departments.

But the simple fact is, the vast amount of (free) official and steam workshop content there is for this game makes it an absolute no brainer for me to recommend. 


"
22074,miller took my kids
22075,"fun+time consuming
"
22076,I've spent to long on Arma 3 dear god please help me.
22077,"uuuhh , i cant hear anything in arma 3 , what should i do?
"
22078,"Really Amazing Game for Years to come, this always something to do. :D"
22079,"Aram 3 is one of the worst games i have every played and the best games i have every played, if your looking for a very custom game that you can do anything with then this is the game for you, i meet a lot of my oldest friends on here, Arma has a very good community."
22080,it works
22081,"I once sat on a hill for 30 minutes, laying siege to a dump, a literal dump. Upon entering the dump I was greeted with a functioning heli just sitting there... in a dump.... After spending another 30  minutes defending the dump from attacks we finally decided to flee, now this would of been a picturesque ending to the battle, getting away with 2 ammo trucks and helicopter. But about 20 seconds after taking off a hill suddenly and violently appeared in front of me.


10/10 would raid dump again"

22090,Great Mil-Sim. 10/10
22091,i LIKE VERY MUCH THE GAME.
22092,Good gameplay mechanics. Best SFX.
22093,good :)
22094,Too many DLCs to buy and honestly starting to feel a bit clunky but otherwise pretty solid
22095,I yeeted a car so high into the air it took me clear to 2021! so glad there is no rona-19 here! Love this game!
22096,"Best game for the military freaks. 

Cheap review for a badge. I'll do a better one later. 
"
22097,its a good game
22098,"The classic. Whether modded or vanilla, there's something for everyone in this game."
22099,:)
22100,good game
22101,very pog if you are zeus
22102,great game. takes a while to get used to and become good but it all becomes worth it when you play seriously.
22103,its alright
22104,"great game, especially with mods, really isn't anything else out there on the market, however fully expect to get arma-ed quite a bit."
22105,"I've only played online with squad but far enjoying it. I do, however, recommend modding it. Besides the base game I have over 60GB of mods installed."
22106,"I wish I could recommend this game but unfortunately there's too much wrong with not only the game but also the community and developers. I will admit here and now that I have had many hours of good entertainment with the private groups that I was a part of. This game can be very enjoyable with the right people and if you're willing to overlook its many flaws. 

Compared to the previous title where $20 could buy you a whole new campaign, terrain, weapons & vehicles this game is overpriced with much content missing from the base game added through overpriced DLCs. It is rife with in-game and full screen advertisements if you try to use any of the DLC content. They will even take unpolished mods and slap price tags on them. The only good thing about that is that at least the original developer gets a cut of the profits. You will encounter poor multiplayer optomisation which will be blamed on the specifications of your computer and many bugs the developer has known about for years. This is allowed simply because they have no competition on this scale. They essentially have a monopoly on large-scale military simulator sandboxes.

The only way I could recommend this game to someone is if they already have friends who play on their own private server or if someone is willing to sink hours into simply trying to find a group that best suits them. You'll most likely have to try out many different groups before you find one that's good for you because just like the rest of the community you'll find lots of power hungry men trying to control other people, blatant racism, misogyny, homophobia and general anti-queer sentiment. Essentially if you aren't white, male, or straight you will have a hard time enjoying yourself. I would never recommend someone play on a public server. However, if you're willing to overlook the toxic community that the developer seems to willfully ignore then you might just have a good time. 

In the end this game is a huge disappointment. I can't say I'm looking forward to future titles from this developer."
22107,very nice
22108,"Very fun milsim, spent most of my time on KOTH servers or playing the campaign. I will warn, it is very difficult if you attempt to play this like other shooters on the market; it's called a military simulator for a reason.

I was amazed with the variety of weapons and vehicles in the game(with many locked behind paywalls, which seemed reasonable to me) and the vast methods to customize your weapons. I sat down one night customizing just a few loadouts for what seemed like eternity, comparing all the similar scopes, judging for clarity, zoom, features, etc. They really put effort into every aspect of this military experience. Hell, I even read a few wikipedia articles on aerodynamics to help me fly a helicopter!

I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in an immersive military experience."
22109,"Great game get it when it is on sale!!!!, its very cheap on sale, and fun with friends. The DLC is worth-it if you want the game just buy the bundle with all the DLC."
22110,"I'm sure the amount of hours I have in this game speaks for itself. The possibilities are endless. The built-in 3D editor and the modding resources are made specifically so you can let your imagination run wild - and if you just want to play, then there is no shortage of content available on the Steam Workshop."
22111,A very  good milsim and a good game to play with friends.
22112,Very cool game needs some optimizing but other then that its awesome

22117,VERY FUN
22118,good
22119,SIM SHOOTER 10/10
22120,Its alright
22121,"Definitely a game worth playing for 'serious fun' 
Playing as military personnel, to guerilla forces, making sure the mission gets completed.
A bit of a buggy game, but the bugs are really the only setback on a great strategy game, where you have to be really careful of your next move to survive. 
Wayyyy better with friends.
definitely a game worth getting, even if its to play every once in a while
"
22122,im still yet to find anything similar to this piece of art
22123,I played it a little bit
22124,"I have gifted four people Arma 3 with all DLCs up to the Apex expansion and they've only played the game once.

I have an addiction."
22125,"If you're reading this, you already know you want this game."
22126,Probably the most realistic tactical military experience out there. Definitely buy. It is kinda frustrating how they have handled the DLC and some updates but still nothing to make you not enjoy the game overall. Much better game with friends too.
22127,"Cool, cool."
22128,could be better
22129,Very good milsim game.
22130,Truly an amazing game
22131,"Arma III‚Äôs complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you‚Äôre comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you‚Äôre able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that‚Äôs simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma III‚Äôs nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know there‚Äôs a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light."
22132,90% of the controls are for movement
22133,Good tactical shooter with decent to good multiplayer
22134,It is just good
22135,"I have 1,537 hours in this game and i mostly just goofed off with the editor and Arsenal. If you can't find at least a little enjoyment in Arma, your not trying hard enough."
22136,I like racism.
22137,This is a great game would recommend but it does have a massive learning curve
22138,A lot of content and mods. Good community and fun game modes. Worth it's price.
22139,One of the best milsims ever
22140,"Very fun, the community it funny and isnt toxic like Squad. Just yes from me."
22141,"This is an amazing game for FPS.   Its a sandbox milsim sorta type game,  lots of Multiplayer, MilSim groups.   Endless game play and more mods than you can shake a stick at."
22142,pretty good
22143,supa realistick lol
22144,good game
22145,"It's alright
"
22146,there is real war men
22147,Warcrimes are pretty fun
22148,"√ìtimo jogo, mas infelizmente sempre foi mal otimizado para muitas m√°quinas."
22149,I am pretty sure Ricky Berwick can run better than this game.
22150,"Guns go pew, dont see where gun is, die 3 seconds later from a cluster bomb"
22151,Good with mods and friends
22152,top
22153,"Decent game. It has good graphics and has lots of mods to improve the experience. The engine itself is really starting to show its age though. Compared to the more new Realistic Military Fps Games, this one just feels too complex and clunky in comparison. Other than that, it's overall a great game for the price, you'll for sure get a good time out of it especially with friends."
22154,"EPIC GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS , WISH THERE WAS MORE HELICOPTER'S AND SNIPER RIFLES BUT HEY HO"
22155,I believe the game is great for someone just starting to get into big milsim based games.
22156,"Great game and endless fun.
"
22157,really good game play
22158,"Fun
"
22159,"arma is just arma. :)
buy it, play it"
22160,It's a game
22161,How did I get here
22162,"One of the best games you can play on steam. It has some campaigns that will last about 30-40 hours (including the expansions) and some extra missions to train and fight. The two best things about the game though are 1) the unlimited possibilities that the editor has along with the easiness to create objectives ,automations, commands and stuff and 2) the cooperative multiplayer mode that you can play with your friends which is so realistic and has some great mods to explore."
22163,"I love this game. This game has soo much realism in the game. It might be hard to remember the controls but its very good overall,"
22164,"Good game!
"
22165,YEs
22166,"its great to play with friends if you make your own ops

also funny to screw around in"
22167,My favourite!
22168,Best milsim at the moment. Great sandbox.
22169,Great game and amazing amount of mods pick it up with APEX
22170,fun
22171,its good
22172,love it
22173,"Still a fantastic game
"
22174,it good
22175,Shooting terrorists with friends is pretty fun
22176,"Customisable, infinitely changeable, mods, yes."
22177,The best Mil-Sim game to play with the boys.
22178,Best army sim out there!
22179,"AT does BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MG does RATATATAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
22180,"Very epic game, release arma 4"
22181,"Arma is a great base game without mods, but with help of the modding community we have been able to play Arma with modern day technology that the military would use today. Joining milsim groups for operations is a great way to experience this game and have fun."
22182,Good game
22183,"Broken game, but if you get a group a friends and some good mods, it's bearable."
22184,"This game is great. Even in 2020, it holds up better than Battlefield 5 or Fallout 76. Voice acting is 10/10, strategic and realistic value 10/10, and AI rating is 9/10 due to some hiccups, but this can be worked around. I very strongly recommend this game to anyone wanting to experience modern (and somewhat futuristic) battlefields in a first person perspective."
22185,man 100m front!
22186,"sick game, defo buy it. i recommend the apex edition bundle"
22187,"Whether you get 5 FPS or 60 FPS with this game you'll have a blast, as long as no BMP's role around"
22188,had this game for 7 years well worth it
22189,Only played it a few hours but it seems to be quiet nice.
22190,best sim
22191,"good
"
22192,Still makes fun after 1k hours
22193,"good game
"
22194,This game fire
22195,"the AI won't stop screaming in my head when i try to sleep
~9/10"
22196,Very fun game to play with your friends and also by your self but with friends is even more fun cause you can make great memories and a lot of funny moments if you haven't tried this game you missing out and also the modding community is amazing with a lot of greats mods coming out each day fitting a lot of play styles this game is worth the money that you will spend on it
22197,"I might only know at least thing or two about this game so far. But out of all the games I've had for a long time, this is the one I keep going back to for a beating. Arma 3 has a scripting system designed for simple missions. However, there no comparable experience as to making long and complicated CTI's in A3 (Or maybe it's what you call Stockholm Syndrome). If you like coming back to the same reliable and consistent abuse with the timeless AI and flying tanks, this is the game for you."
22198,Always a good game to come back too from time to time. The logic and Ai's never fail to piss me off though.
22199,I can tell that this game is gonna slap
22200,overall probably the best milsim game out there. although they could fix the servers its still a good game
22201,Great mil sim. Diverse content. Love helicopters!
22202,I guess it's ok
22203,–æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ
22204,Its good.
22205,Bad game.
22206,"The is the best military simulation game that you can find, the amount of mods and the super and adult community makes this game one of my top games even after 7 years.
The Devs are updating and fine tuning the game as they have been doing at its launch.
The game has a huge arsenal of weapons, vehicles, planes, helicopters, tanks, boats, weapon mods, forms, and much much more... Add to that the supper community on the workshop, the game is limitless.
I would definitely recommend the game for any military sim lovers, this is the peak game for them. The game is a bit hard at the beginning, but once you get a hang of it you will fall in love.

Graphics are stunning, the gameplay is awesome, the workshop is bursting, the community is super, the devs are gods!"
22207,C'est bien !
22208,Very fun game
22209,"Arma 3 is not just a game, it‚Äôs a place where you can connect with the people who play it. After several hundred game hours you learn team building, and get to know your friends very well.

Not matter what you do as a player you‚Äôre always having fun because there‚Äôs always a challenge that you need to overcome. Most often your team mate does something stupid and you have a good laugh.

I can recommend this any day!
"
22210,"A nice mil-sim game, don't expect to a ""pick up and play"" experience however. Arma 3 has quite a learning curve but once you get past that it's good fun"
22211,love the realism
22212,"Definitely a game that you could play over and over, at least until Arma 4 comes out. One of the best things is easily the Zeus mode, with missions being created on the fly by players for players. Practically anything is possible, and I will be shocked if we don't see a Zeus-style mode in other games, in addition to the amazing modding community which is literally free new content made by amazing authors adding to the replayablity value of this game, and makes the DLC stand up to a higher standard and making it worthwhile to purchase due to the high standard as it adds so much new content.

 I may sound like I'm being paid to write this, but I'm just trying to write this review so that if the developers see this they know its a good idea to continue support and accessabilty for mods from not only a community perspective but also the business side :P"
22213,"Favourite FPS, please come back Australian players."
22214,gamer time
22215,"Realistic, high attention to detail. My 2600 hrs on this game tell everything."
22216,"These greedy assholes started with a 32-bit game during the Alpha, made a mess-of-a-game on release, and then they switch to the aggressive DLC upselling DURING the gameplay..?
It's the same shit they're pulling on their unfinished DayZ disaster, and they deserve NOTHING out of your pocket.
It might seem cool on some edited YouTuber's video, but these greedy assholes took the profits on both of these games, while not delivering a finished product on either in the first place.
FUCK...!"
22217,beautiful game play and it looks very real
22218,Complicated af for begginers.
22219,very epic
22220,good game very fun
22221,Amazing game espically if you like to RP
22222,"An excellent game that rewards planning and a careful approach, not just reflexes. Not exactly relaxing, but it is very enjoyable, a thinking person's game. Highly highly recommend LAN coop modes with small groups of people. Playing on giant servers with a bunch of strangers is a wildly different experience and not a good one. There is a wonderful community of people out there who continue to create great maps and mods, which is what truly makes the game."
22223,tis good
22224,its nice
22225,"Rainbow flashing, music blasting blackfish dropping troops onto roofs/10"
22226,good
22227,iz good
22228,"Playing games cooperatively with your spouse is the key to a healthy relationship.

Probably put more into it this winter."
22237,Absolutely love this game the devs keep working on it and adding new things in. As well as that the mods this game supports are unreal. Had this game for ages and always try talking my friends into getting it.
22238,you know what im thinkin its pretty good yeah
22239,Really wanted to get in to this one but I could not figure out controller use. Settings screen only allowed me to change sensitivity and after searching forums I eventually said the heck with it and uninstalled it and asked for a refund. Looks to be a fun game but I could not get past having to use keyboard to play. Made the experience very clunky and not enjoyable. A game for keyboard and mouse players only
22240,Can play year by year. Hope that new dlc come again.

22262,"Arma 3 is probably the best thing after the invention of the CheyTac. Ace3 makes it all better for really long range realistic-immersive ballistics experience. Kudos, Bohemia..Antistasi was probably that immersive sandbox which everyone needed."
22263,good game with friends
22264,goood
22265,"this is a wonderful game, especially with friends, but get mods, they make it even btter"
22266,"its just so damm good, with mods ofc just the game itself is like yeah ig this is good. But when you get mods and stuff like that its like ""oH yEaH dAdDy I nEeD mOrE"""
22267,"bang bang. sway sway. shoot shoot. 

***BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT****"
22268,best fucking game ive ever played
22269,Good. Kinda.
22270,Astounding!!! Make sure to have a good PC!!!
22271,"Still playing, still loving it"
22272,My all time favourite milsim game
22273,This game is made by the community.
22274,good game
22275,very nice but i keep dying cuz dis game hard
22276,"noice
"
22277,It worth the price for me and the fun part is you can put a mod into this game
22278,"Love this game it amazing, however now that times getting on things need to improve, graphical and user wise."
22279,I've played it a bit. Good fun.
22280,10/10 so realistic that news outlets use ingame footage as combat footage in actual reports
22281,.
22282,Very enjoyable to play with friends.  Single player missions are fun as well.
22283,This game is hard as hell
22284,Toxic pilots and derpy medics. Gotta love it.
22285,great game worth it
22286,arma 3 logic: *runs 1 mile an hour*
22287,The best game in the world but run on an outdated engine. Highly recommend.
22288,it big fun
22289,"I wish I had more hands, so I could give this game 4 thumbs down."
22290,its dope
22291,"One of the best realistic military simulation game found so far. The essence of the game lies in its diversity of game modes starting from KOTH, Antistasi, Exile to the world of milsim experience. Definately worth a try!"
22292,good
22293,Its just a huge war crime at the end of the day
22294,"Immersive, realistic and challenging"
22295,shoot the people game
22296,B.G.E
22297,It's a buggy mess and I love it (note: the bugs can get on your nerves at times).
22298,YEET
22299,pog champ
22300,War never changes!  Well unless you add mods
22301,oh cool
22302,Hands down the best game out there.
22303,si
22304,Why!
22305,Awesome game
22306,"Very fun game with all the mods and servers, reminds me of the good old arma 2 days"
22307,"Very Very Good 
"
22308,Simply the best.
22309,"very good
"
22310,"Nice game, now I have PTSD. Thank you."
22311,Gooder
22312,If you are looking for a realistic military simulator then this is the game for you. The graphics on this game are pretty great however the gameplay seems very clunky. There is an abundance of controls for you to learn which takes a while to get used to. The game has optimization problems as it appears to rely on the CPU. Online servers are fun but some may not run very well. King of the Hill servers run terribly even with high spec machines. I would recommend getting at least the APEX edition of this game as it goes on sale for a good price during the major sales. Overall this game is fun and very time-consuming.
22313,15 fps on the IO on a KOTH server. Arma 3 performace sucks!
22314,it's rlly fun
22315,"It was the best of times, It was the blorst of times"
22316,Worth every penny
22317,"Very good game!
makes me very hard 
very good"
22318,There are so many control you would need NASA's control systems just to do everything. You would then need to hire 15 guys to tell you what does what.
22319,Its a good game....
22320,"the sky is the limit when it comes to things you can do in this game..
Been a big fan of the series since arma 2 days and it just keeps getting better and better."
22321,Its alright
22322,yes
22323,"Realistic, good game play, even has a small story."
22324,Yea I like it
22325,Absolute Banger.
22326,some construction required but after that its really REALLY FUN
22327,"I've made a mission where my players are post apocalyptic survivors driving around fire traps.

10/10"
22328,you need to imagine you are having fun
22329,"very good graphic and great story mode. The only hard thing is how realistic this game is, it's not like some first-person shooter, your aim is not like the same as ""game"". A lot of control binds, but that helps add on the realistic of how much you can get from this game. It's worth the price. Recommended to try it out! you will love its realistic (not fun when you have to bind more than 15 keys though)..."
22330,Thank you for teaching me that 15 frames is playable.
22331,Nuts
22332,"Many mods, great community"
22333,11/10
22334,Pretty fya
22335,Hard but fun game!!
22336,A very legendary game so much gameplay and stuff to do!
22337,"this game just cant get old with all of the available mods and addons. bored of military?
go and install star wars, warhammer etc etc"
22338,Fantastic modding community.
22339,"Great military simulation, with many other possibilities! 
Bohemia Interactive created a masterpiece with that Game. I played it for several years and had a lot of fun. Especially - I enjoyed the Altis Life Mod, with a huge community who all love roleplay."
22340,it's aight
22341,game a soo good but need a optimiziation on online. and need more stablize on low pc's
22342,"One of my favorite games. It's the reason I bought my PC in the first place.
"
22343,"Really good game play, although it can sometimes lag. Probably one if not the best milsims out there with a really cool community. Much more fun with friends too."
22344,"ArmA is love, ArmA is life... You may end up with accurate PTSD.
Now seriously, ArmA has two parts. 
The first one is a buggy, glitchy mess where hitting a 40ton tank with a small car will end up in total devastation of the tank. You laugh in here, watching the physics engine doing it¬¥s best.
The other one(with the right people and some mods) is military simulator so serious that I sometimes forget this is a game...
And the modding comunity... You ask for something, there is a high chance that it is there...
for me it¬¥s 9/10
why 9/10?
ArmA is not the moooost optimalised game in here, so running it on 60FPS may be a challenge
The physics engine... yeeeaa, sometimes there are moments when you just say: WTF ArmA?
But it¬¥s not that bad.
Aye, now I¬¥m going to play some..."
22345,"Bohemia Interactive, stealing my free time since 2001."
22346,What is the best way I can put this.... this game is so dead it's most populated server on average is some dollar store version of GTA. Save your storage and money (counting this games 100 dollar DLC that unlocks what should exist to begin with) Oh and did I mention the actually awful optimization? ... just do yourself a favor and buy squad.
22347,Physics go brrrrr
22348,"I played it a little, not too bad."
22349,"The DLC model for this game is garbage. Half the DLC for this game should have been included in the base game. Dont buy this game unless it is on sale, if its on sale pick up the Apex edition for like 20 bucks."
22350,one of the mod frustrating yet absolutely satisfying games my friend and I have ever played couldn't recommend it enough
22351,"Very good game had some great laughs on it with my mates. Played the game for years, sad to see the game slowly losing players and not as fun as it used to be, but the game was great fun, well the vehicle mechanics  are a topic not to discuss......"
22352,Its a very good and open game you can make any military mission you can think of thanks to the modding community. I would really recommend this game to anyone that loves large military sandbox games.
22353,Still great
22354,I guess it's ok
22355,Yes.
22356,"Arma 3 as a base game is fun for a while and sure has it's problems, but the modding community and the workshop is really where this game shines. You are able to play warfare from the 1800s to this current day in any way, shape or form. It also supports all play styles, from single-player, co-op to multiplayer. If you really want to step it up a notch, consider joining a Arma 3 Milsim Unit. And if you are the more creative type, and you can always try out the editor to create your own missions and scenarios for yourself or others to play."
22357,"Very epic game, I loved the editor mainly and some milsim servers,"
22358,best game 10/10
22359,"Run to the battlefield for 30 minutes and die from a sniper's bullet half way.
BEST GAME"
22360,"Ja geiles spiel ABER es gibt neuere spiele und eines davon √§hnelt dem sehr und kriegt noch viele updates es hei√üt Squad es hat viel bessere perfourmence weil es auf der neusten unreal engine geht soweit ich wei√ü also mega geil aber noch ziemlich teuer, und braucht auch einen relativ guten PC, arma lagt halt bissl"
22361,"I recently Got this game, Yeah I can see how this game survived for 7 years with even having its official server online until now, Modding community is just as on par with any other game companies, I question only why isnt this just as mainstream as COD or BF these have those game packed into it and even more with only its base, and with the addition of mods there's plenty more.

Edit: I forgot to mention the large amount of Units you can join and find no matter where, If your looking for an RP unit? There's more than one, and they even have different types of RP units. Hardcore Milsim? Your in luck just find a Unit that has a real life counter part you would most likely like it in those. Casual? Of course you might not even need a unit for that."
22362,Always a great game to play with friends.
22363,Meet some amazing people in this game. It's probably the most intense military simulator that is an absolute goof to play. Would definitely recommend.
22364,awesome base game its a must have in your game collection! and once you start adding mods it becomes an endless amount of fun and enjoyment
22365,ye
22366,gud military pew pew gaem brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
22367,This game is like chocolate. Sweet and addictive.
22368,its alright
22369,"Singleplayer non DLC: Nothing special. Play as an American NCO apart of a NATO peacekeeping force, get attacked by the local army that has better hardware than you do, meet a British Officer (He's a dick) join him on his mission whilst you and eventually a group of farmers dodge bullets from a army of hexagonal squid people."
22370,Great game! Simply lovely!
22371,11
22372,good game
22373,lots of fun to play alone with saneros and with friends
22374,Great Game worth buying on sale tho.
22375,Great Game!!
22376,Best game I've ever owned. But too many bugs and cheaters these days. And because of that lot's my friends quit playing it. Now It's up to Bohemia to take care of these things. And seems like they don't care anymore since they're too busy with new engine and games.
22377,Good game 10/10 fuck UN
22378,"This game is whatever you want it to be. There are multiplayer servers, custom missions, the editor, DLCs, and various mods. Whether you want to fly jets or helicopters, drive tanks or trucks, or just be a standard soldier, there is something for everyone here. The performance is horrendous though, especially in multiplayer. The game dips a lot, and can easily go from 70 FPS down to 20. It is a fairly old game, and still holds up very well. I would look out for Arma 4 when that comes out. Great simulator, sandbox, multiplayer, and co-op game, somewhat ruined by the performance issues. 

9/10"
22379,l
22380,It's quite fun for a milsim
22381,good games!
22382,"One of the better mil-sim games out there. ArmA games are well known for their clunky movement and the games get a bad rep because of it. This game (and the other games in the series as well) have provided me with hours and hours of fun. From the amazing KotH game mode in multiplayer to a tactical and engaging singleplayer campaign (actually, multiple campaigns), this game is definitely up in my all-time favorites. I haven't even talked about the editor yet, literally endless amounts of fun there, create your own scenarios, play them out and share them with people!

Don't even get me started about all of the available mods for the game, if the base game doesn't have enough content (which it definitely does), look no further than the community workshop, so many amazing mods there.

I love this game man."
22383,"dont buy it... its given me severe depression




help me"
22384,"Realistic, Fun, Hard"
22385,The Game with a hundred games in it ))
22386,I love this game
22387,You need to get 2 things for this game. Mods and friends.
22388,"I have played this game for 570 hours mostly spended in the editor. And I still have fun with it like the first time, there are so many things to learn in this game, it's a bit complex but in my opinion is the best war sandbox you can find on steam. And the developers continue to update the game to keep it alive. If you love to create war missions and scenarios this game is a must buy."
22389,Excellent game
22390,meh
22391,"Although clunky at times, ArmA has always been an insanely good game and the devs always do the best for their community, and keep updating the game far after release, just so a bunch of likeminded individuals can pretend to be soldiers on a regular basis. This game builds camradery like no other and if you own are looking for a reason or sign to get this game, let this be it!"
22392,perfect example of how games can take you to a different world
22393,Great game to play with friends
22394,Best game i have ever played so much to do and never ending content.
22395,shoot gun gud game
22396,very goud game recommending very much my frend
22397,Just the other day I saw a CIWS anti-air gun shoot a parachuting enemy soldier. War crimes are a 10/10 from me chief.
22398,"meh, kinda like it"
22399,Action lovers must try this game
22400,.
22401,is good yes?
22402,its aight

22404,iz good
22405,fun game.

22414,"Make sure you have other people to play with.

Also mods everywhere."
22415,"g ooed r game

22416,Game is very good. Lot's of fun. I hate this game.
22417,I LOVE THIS GAME AND MY BOREDEM OF IT IS ONLY NOW JUST STARTING TO KICK IN AND I'VE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT WITH OVER 3K HOURS. SHES MY FAVOURITE GAME.
22418,I don't understand what is happening ever. I love this game.
22419,"It really ""simulates"" ""reality""! 10/10 more real than war!"
22420,One of the best games out there even though is old.
22421,"Gameplay is very nice, even though you need a good PC to run it."
22422,Since it's a shooting game it's good in my opinion xD
22423,"yeah uh this game wont start up due to it trying to do this illegal activity and I cant get around it
"
22424,"big nuts big balls
"
22425,I used Zeus too much.
22426,"Endless development leading to an endless cycle of endless bugfixes creating endless bugs which lead to endless fun, endlessly."
22427,its fun i guess
22428,good  but im too lasy to learn all the key...
22429,lol steam awards milsim good rest of the game big dumb without friends.
22430,"constantly having to spend days to find updates that if you don't do them you get kicked out of the game never being able to play , then after days of updating the games mods then  you run into an error log that is a black box in the middle of your screen that blocks everything and stays there and no way to turn it off at all or minimize it so you can play, without the intrusive error log, funny enough although it says there is a bunch of errors the game still continues to play, ACE Mods are notorious for stopping you from playing, actually kicks you out of the game when you try to get in, they need updates nearly every day and after you spend hours and days trying to sif through what exactly what mod you need trying to find updates, due to the vagueness of the title you may accidently down load the wrong mod fix, before you get kicked out of the game it tells you what mod you need but unfortunately they don't post or set you up for automatic update on the mods created . the mods that do work totally cool and makes game play awesome BUT! some mods don't jive with other mods and create a giant cluster fk so your back spending hours and days trying to figure out what is causing the problem, then that's not all you finely spend days trying to get everything to work then, battle eye wont let you play some kind of jacked up error prevents you from playing with its bullshit over watch software , I'm getting an error ,""Starting the game or battle eye has failed"" i have again been online for days trying to find the fix, no joy!! the only thing i can do now is uninstall the game , i have played only a few hours i have hunted and chased problems longer than i have played, I an a game professional in the industry so I'm pretty familiar on moding and creation of game assets, the mods have no QC Quality control , they don't delete old useless files and name them properly so you know its an update so you spend hours and days looking for the hidden updates and then when you fix one update that causes a chain reaction of updating everything else and you never get to play!. Don't get me wrong some of these mods are awesome but you get to be mod dependent do to the game itself with no mods is very shallow as far as the game as a whole very little to do without the mods , So yea I would say this is a game engine more that a game if you code and understand what and how to use a .pbo file or a .config or you can write code you will still have allot of work on your hands before you can play because there is so much sloppy crap out there were you have to go into these files and fix or re write these things so they can work, textures are tiled some almost laughable , no proper global illumination texture are flat and grainy not PBR's or even V ray style  with a good diffuse or bump maps , as a professional in the industry and an avid game player I'm very disappointed, I use to play and mod for Arma 2 but had the same issues in the past and was hoping all these things would have been addressed but just got worse, i talked to the team at siggraph and GDC in LA , i guess my complaints weren't listened to, so after all these years , I'm going back to the unreal engine for game creation. lol . i know i sound like i hate the game engine /game , i don't, i have allot of respect for the dev team this game use to be the most awesome game developed in the chech republic amazing game play without the mods so fun when it works, amazing cool shot you cant do in ANY game it has the greatest potential for some real interactivity, the moders are destroying the game play by putting out trash and screwing  the game up you need freelance moders to enhances the game and then you guys QC all the mods so they work properly then ill be happy, i cant do a thumbs up or down I'm in the middle the game can be wonderful and has so much potential  but is destroyed bye armature coders and designers no QC and and recycled models bye armatures that uses ms paint for textures,my avatar is a small sample of my work only photo real."
22431,Amazing game for it's time. Modding makes it even better. KOTH is probably one of the best things to happen to this game.
22432,"SO FUNqas ,nmfh"
22433,got to the second mission adm it crashed. couldent close it with task manager had to restard my computer. if you dont have a very nice dont get it
22434,"Time To Die On A Stationary Object Because It Felt Like It, Good Terrorism 10/10 Would Kill A Haji Again"
22435,Only good with mods.
22436,10/10 milsim there are a lot of dlcs but you still have 300+ hours of content without mods or dlcs. If you add free mods there are an infinite amount of hours in the game.
22437,"Great game, has incredible Community Backing and even if playing the vanilla its absolutely amazing, the Campaign mode is awesome, and if that is all you played? start joining some communities, either RP or Zeus Operation Units, if you haven't, you are missing out."
22438,It's alright
22439,refunded
22440,Use the Bad News
22441,"1,000+ on my other account plus 300+ on this one. I have a POS computer, and I can run it. i have a blast every time. Arma will always have my heart.. even though it has some issues that have been persistent since its launch ( certain 2 story buildings and objects getting your character stuck and other bullshit like that )"
22442,"Fun Milsim, especially when flying. There is however quite a learning curve though when you get past that you will have a great experience."
22443,"Fun and great game, unlimited things to do"
22444,With how old this games is I am thoroughly impressed with the quality experience you get even by today's standards. An excellent game indeed.
22445,Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when? Arma 4 when?
22446,Warcrimes? Yes please
22447,-
22448,kids
22449,Still the best mil-sim even in 2020.
22450,its terrible but so good
22451,"Terrible game, nothing but lag and fps problems, takes over an hour to load up, absolute waste of money even with a steam sale going on, definitely 0/10, no poor soul should ever have to play this garbage of a game"
22452,"After some hours of playing this gem I would say...it's ok ;-)
Some more hours...still ok..."
22453,"I've had a little bit of time on this game, I can safely say that it is well worth the money."
22454,STILL THE BEST MILITARY SANDBOX
22455,"Very good game with a huge modding community!
Disclaimer: you probably need friends for this to be fun"
22456,i love the dayz mod
22457,"Ive played the game for more than 1000+ hours, I just love it. At times it is slightly glitchy etc especially on modded servers, but keep in mind its a one of a kind game, that is huge. At times you kinda have a love hate relationship with the game but always at the end for me at least its worth every penny. One thing to be noted with all the features and possibilities in the game, there is also a pretty steep learning curve especially in the beginning."
22458,This game is amazing. By far one of the best games i have played. A few bugs but still those add more laughs than not
22459,Now this is pod racing
22460,so real war game
22461,it is good
22462,idk it do be kinda fun
22463,Worlds best War Crime Simulator since 2013
22464,"Even 8 years after the release (and more if you include beta), the game is still the best military sandbox game around.
This is both due to the continued support by the developer and the huge amount of community build additions."
22465,I only play roleplay but just for that it is worth the money. gripping game. it annoys me ho dlc are such a big part of the game and are so expensive tho.
22466,The best Military shooter currently availble with a lot of Mods and Free - or DLC Content
22467,walking sim
22468,"Me, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, president of the United States of America say this game is very cool and I propose to be this game played in all the States and all over Europe.


And

And why not
It's the bast game ever

Signature: J. F. Kennedy"
22469,This game has taken 1371 hours of my time! And I love it! The mechanics and realism of this game is awesome!
22470,I got this game around 2018 and i have loved playing it. but i started to get bored of the plain scenarios and official servers and wanted something new. Then i found the mods. and let me tell you the mods are soo good i mean there is just endless possibility and the fun never ends.

22494,Nice realistic FPS with huge maps and almost unlimited possibilities. Would be awesome to play tactical game with a group of friends
22495,Amazing game!
22496,I got so pissed about getting one-tapped repeatedly that I had my friend give me admin privileges so that I could teleport back into the fight and keep going. That just ended with me dying in even faster intervals. I had over 120 deaths within 2 hours. Fun stuff.
22497,very good
22498,"Good game, recommend it."
22499,best game to tryhard at
22500,"Great game,teamwork is necessary almost all the time and great with friends"
22501,NICE
22502,670 hours i'm still loving it.
22503,"Best hiking simulator, with occasional pew-pew. Would recommend."
22504,"A pretty solid 6/10 game

EDIT: Roughly a year later its still a pretty solid 6/10 games, don't play as much though"
22505,hot
22506,still fun game
22507,Still good. King of the hill is where its at.
22508,approved
22509,Great game
22510,solid game
22511,i love walking from point a to point b for 30 minutes straight just to fucking die and do it all over again.
22512,Mods are what make this game both replayable and unplayable. Expect to dedicate an ungodly amount of storage to arma 3.
22513,"Still no FOV slider.

Rip."
22514,fun times arma4 now please
22515,A great game that have a big arsenal (workshop) with alot of mods that you can use. It does have some problems with lag and bugs but it's really fun.
22516,its fun to tk tryhards
22517,"Love the game, recommend it!!"
22518,nice game
22519,It¬¥s good
22520,"This game is the G.O.A.T.
"
22521,very fun game with a group of friends
22522,I fcking love this game 1200 hours and counting :)
22523,good game muc pplay
22524,No military life is complete without playing this game.
22525,Only played a few hours but the game seems fun
22526,"If you're into slow-paced ""realistic"" military games where you don't run and gun, you only waste two to three mags per mission, you travel huge distances to complete your tasks, you fight from up a hill and enjoy getting blasted in the head by a pistol-wielding AI from over a thousand meters, than this is definitely the game for you."
22527,Great game. Will make you hate life but at the same time you will spend your life away playing this fucking game
22528,5/5
22529,It's an amazing MIL-SIM game that I recommend with all my heart!
22530,very fun
22531,Nice
22532,"the only game like it arma is the milsim you always wanted, loved, and hated. There's a lot of bugs however they're more like kinks that are a little annoying but more like a laugh than a angry salty scream, but besides that 10/10 nothing else like it!!!"
22533,very fun very well done thanks for the sim :)
22534,"I really like ARMA, despite the jank, and spent most of my time in the map editor making levels for my friends, rather than in modded servers or in the campaigns, although I enjoyed both. A demanding game to run, but it's a game that lives up to the requirements, as it delivers incredible open world spaces on a scale just not seen in other games."
22535,awesome walking simulator
22536,Altis Life is amazing
22537,Very nice game
22538,ye da
22539,Quite hard to get into at first but it ends up being pretty damn fun

22543,never played it
22544,I would not recommend this game if you are looking to play in a sever with you and your friends because it is almost impossible. Maybe with 4 hours or even more messing around with your router setting to port forward a game then you just maybe can host one. I could get a free game and host a sever and play with my friends completely free in just 30 seconds. you would think for a 30$ game it would have a option to host a game know problem like minecraft but trust me it doesn't. If they will make it were its easy and any that spent money on this game to host a server it would be better. because not very many people want to play by themselves or join a server and keep dying my teamate ex. So maybe a thought... make the game server hosting?
22545,"good game, multiplayer is easy to set up if u wanna make a server just for friends."
22546,"only for antstasi, everything else is complete poopoo fart"
22547,The N word
22548,"Good game.
Spent too much time on it tho."
22549,
22550,i like defending the homies
22551,Its Arma
22552,I've really wanted to play this game for a long time. I eventually got it and was really happy to. Don't let my 5.1 hours fool you. All of that time is me trying to find a way to host a servers and start playing with my friends. I just want to play coop missions with my bros but can get turned off really easily when you spend 4 hours watching Youtube videos on how to set up a server only for it to just not work. My love for this game outweighs the difficulty I have to go through to enjoy it. I can't recommend it now but i hope the game will change my mind as i learn more about it.
22553,:]
22554,"It's great fun. With a great and very helpful player base. The mods are fun and you can make the game look or play in almost any way you want. Also you truly feel like you're a solider on the ground. You use real military tool, weapons, cars, and planes. If you're tired of the one man army stuff of COD and battlefield then this game is for you communication with your team is almost a must to survive and it also adds to the realism and fun factor of the game.       12/10"
22555,What Now
22556,nice
22557,Best game ever!
22558,Very realistic
22559,its shit
22560,Just love it
22561,okay
22562,Goodfdgame
22563,"very fun to shooting and killing the bad guise, yes"
22564,"its good in a sense of overall operations set ups but the game got some serious AI, meaning that you'll get spotted and on the other hand your squad mates spot and engage the enemy long before anything in reality would seem real, also the vehicles rule the game and how it's going to pan out no matter how much you take to putting your guy around it never ends well."
22565,Just a great game to play with your clan..
22566,"out of 10 this game is over 9000

22575,Arma III is the best modern warfare sandbox game hands down.  It's well worth the money boiz and girlz
22576,Love it
22577,"Solid military sim with lots of gadgets and vehicles to play with. Single player seems to be a dud, but multiplayer modes are a blast. Picked this up again partially to fly choppers; definitely a fan of the flight and weapons models."

22586,fun
22587,qaerpojngn
22588,Love how you can add mods to it and it becomes Star Wars Clone Wars
22589,I like very much.
22590,It's ok I guess
22591,"Good realistic military shooter

saw my squad get killed  and got ptsd then commited suicide 

would die again 11/10"
22592,"This game... where to start? I know I don't have near the high hours that some players have, but you can still get so much experience with so ""little"" time. I've played in PvP KOTH, Invade and Annex, Altis Life, Wasteland, tried and am learning in-game photography, and many operations filled with a loving community. And you know what the funny thing is? I don't think I'm going to stop playing this game any time soon. There is so many possibilities on what you can do! Most of my now 250 hours have been in the air or on the ground with an MG. I love playing the supportive role and just making everyone in the unit, team, or four person squad feel relaxed knowing that when the firefight starts, I'll be spitting 10x the metal that the enemy is. Flying in this game is extremely rewarding. Every time I jump into an MiG-29 I know what it's capable of. I've been in that seat so many times and know the quirks of the aircraft. The best thing is is that your experience in each plane transfers to the next! As you continue with your hours, you tend to find habits, techniques, and strategies that help you. Same with helicopters! I use to rush myself in KOTH to get the players to where they needed to go and usually got myself, or the entire group killed. After a while, I started playing on this massive Invade and Annex server. I met a few pilots that told me to slowly try out the big helis before going to the lighter and faster birds. This tip alone helped me so much. Making tiny movements instead of huge over-correction led me to find the sweet spots and how the aircraft could be handled. On the ground, it's an entirely different ball game. You don't have the advantage of countermeasures and being able to see your target miles away. You have to work on such a high level of teamwork that it astonishes me how unit's can have over 100+ players for an operation. Like I said, I'm usually posted up with a PKM or an M249 with hundreds of rounds, ready to open up at a moments notice. I have played rifleman and recon (M110) and enjoyed it, but nothing beats seeing the enemy flee to cover as I rip them to shreds with my 7.62, 650 rpm. 

Yes, there are a few bugs, issues, the whole sha-bang. But you'll find thousands of tutorials to help you out. Maybe your game files are broken, or it's simply you forgot to put in a keybind. There's always someone out there to help. Even for the simple things!

This game is absolutely wonderful. From the scenarios players make, to the silly dogfights with A-10's, or the serious operations where you're actually breaking a sweat, this game has something for everyone. Bohemia, you did one hell of a job and I hope the next Arma is just as legendary as this is. Oorah!

Thank you to these units and servers that have made a mark on my playing experience and the wonderful people I've met,

Task Force Disaster, Cyclone Company, United Gaming Network, 55th Delta Squad, Code4Gaming, and special thanks to the 107th Air Wing for teaching me all that I know now. I love you guys."
22593,This game's longevity speaks for itself.  An outstanding military simulation.
22594,would shoot civilans again 10/10
22595,Only good part is scatting in Kavala
22596,Is good game but its a tad bit boring and its really good the story is great everything plus the addition of mods aswell it makes the game 10x better
22597,Haven't played enough yet but seems fun
22598,tidy son x
22599,"Arma 3 is one of those games that is so realistic that, at times, it is maddening to play. 
Some people will hate this, but many of us love that challenge. 
If you want something where a single shot kills you, where you have to consider the physics of every shot, and where ammunition and team management is almost a pain (but still fun), this is the game for you."
22600,"Arma 3, like a fine wine this military simulator has gotten finer with age. The mod community and the support that BIS continues to put into this offering make it second to none."
22601,absoloutly brilliant game if you love big gunfights or small spec ops operations a wide range of weapons troops and armour and a wide variety of mods in the steam community is just amazing. overall 10/10
22602,Just do it. you wont regret it.
22603,good game

22610,Bought this game a while back. Wasn't much into multiplayer games. Stopped playing for a while till I joined a squad and tried a MP game for the first time. Clocked almost 17 hours in 2 days. Absolutely would recommend.

22620,Its Lit!
22621,I have been playing Arma 3 for about 3 years now and i can say that in my experience it has been really fun and that only real limitations to the game is ones own imagination. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to do anything really because it has almost everything from life RP to Milsim and even zombies and everything in between.
22622,good
22623,.
22624,love it
22625,"1 reason: Zeus

"
22626,"Honestly Ive always heard of Arma being a great tactical shooter , but being a console player most of my life I never tried it, so from playing every socom, im finally here on pc, and let me tell you this game had a high learning curve ,but once you learn the principal mechanics and understand the fact that this isnt call of duty that when you take fire you will die, and need to communicate with your team ,overall its a amazing game thus far and a even better experience. Dope game"
22627,A

22646,"Love this game, easily the greatest military simulator on any platform to this day
"
22647,;p
22648,"I put 'recommend to others', but this is a different league to other FPS.  Incredibly hard, if you play PUIBG/Battlefield and take the same approach you will die in seconds.   I'm stuck on the single player campaign as just get owned all the time.....so not for me.
Non eof my real world friends play online, and limited in time due to kids, so can't really join groups to learn.  However, can see how this would be amazing as a large group.
Far too timer consuming for me to properly get into, therefore bear that in mind if thinking of trying it.   if you have a family, I would stay away!!"
22649,very fun and extremely realistic. would recommend!
22650,Very complex and hard game to learn! But if you put energy and time in it and learn how to play it is really really fun and Sandbox can make you laugh with friends many times!

Multiplayer is extremely enjoyable especially with friends. Zeus is very fun to fuck around with. Lots of potential for chaos.
The mods for this game are very numerous I recommend the ace, CUP, and RHS mods but there are many to choose from so I suggest you check out the workshop. Some AI tweaking mods are good to have because half the time the AI is horrifyingly accurate or absolutely brain-dead. 
The physics engine of this game is very fucky so don't ram vehicles into each other unless you want to see fireworks but the jank is very funny sometimes."
22668,Great played a bit made some friends
22669,love it
22670,"On first mission the game bugged, it set me in permanent scoped mode, reloading mission didnt fix it.
Joined first public game, got into heli, pressed every button on keyboard, didnt fly, so i swimmed 1.2 km to objective, clipped under rocks, died there, respawned, tried to get in more planes, couldnt, switched to pistol, pressed all buttons on keyboard couldnt switch to my machinegun, then tried to get in more planes, it worked, but i couldnt fly them, then i ran to the tank, i got in, couldnt drive it, so i swimmed another 2 km to the objective, got boored mid game, uninstalled the game and now wrting this."
22671,Arma will teach you what a real shooter game is. If you get good at arma you can succeed in any other open world shooters.
22672,"For a game being made in 2013, this game is really, and I mean /really/ addictive. Now, I wouldn't advise to immediately jump into it and play eden editor (that's what I did and it took me weeks to figure out what to do). Arma 3 is a game which takes time and patience, because in the end? it's worth it, and I mean that. There's also the modding community which does a wonderful job with most of there mods.


My ultimatum? It's worth the 30 dollars, and uhhhh, enjoy :)

22684,"good stuff
"
22685,"in the nearly 400 hours of gameplay i have done into this game, it is fair to say that its a great game, and the bugs are AMAZING, most of them atleast. being in a unit is definatly a must and the ones i served in had good and funny people. biggest example being the 1st Commando Battalion. met a lot of good people there, some of which i still game with and chat with time to time again. overall, the combat is amazing, and can be hilarious at times, sometimes you must use tactics, sometimes a good ole fashioned ORAAAA is necessary to take an objective whither it be a town, a random location in the middle of nowhere, or to retake something that belongs to you. not to mention the massive modding community involved with the game (To become a member of the 1st CB you need some star wars mods and whatever mod pack(s) they have, good people, fun people, fun operations, very big shoutout to them as they were my first experience with the game and i learned a lot from them, if any of you read this, miss y'all, should message me sometime to remanise on some old times or to maybe play a game together again) and if anyone wants to join the 1st CB message me on discord, my discord is Blue#0148 and ill get you in contact with someone who can let you into the 1st CB and get you into the wringer. only reason i stopped playing is because after awhile (in my case a very long while) it got to be to much to be a member of a unit or to simply play the game due to my job mostly. but this is a fun game and if you enjoy milsim games and whatnot, this is definatly something for you. gameplay is good, graphics are great (if your Computer can handle it atleast) and being apart of a unit increases the experience tenfold! don't believe me? message me and ill send you to the 1st CB and you can tell me after that, or play the game by yourself and experience it yourself!"
22686,Dis game so bad wot heck faq u man
22687,"I LIKE THE GAME BUT IT CRASHES CONSTANTLY BECAUSE MY PC IS CARDBOARD.

I THINK MY MONITOR WILL GET AN EXTRA HOLE IN IT IF IT CONTINUES LIKE THIS..."
22688,"Die. This game is utter garbage, I shouldn't of EVER wasted my money on this as it was a scam all along. I wasted 150 hours of my life, my money on a game that was never worth it. The DLC alone was like buying a house, and buying a mortgage was the same. I think this game's servers should be pulled and removed from this earth. The devs should focus on NOT ARMA 3 because it's garbage just like them, even though I like DayZ makes my like them no more. This game is not even worth the 5 pound it is now, even if it was free, NO ONE should play it."
22689,Played it for the first time and already have 6 hrs looks like I'm gonna be addicted and I love that.
22690,"This is one of the best Realistic military shooters on the entirety of the gaming scene. The gameplay is immersive, it's fun for those who like that downtime before ambushing a unit or if you prefer a resistance standpoint, Antistasi is there for you. The flight system is great, and everything in general is just 10/10. Thank you creators, y'all are awesome."
22691,"awhhh I love this game. I have always wanted to play this game when I didn't have a computer and now that I played this game nonstop, I started the whole campaign over because I enjoyed it soo much"
22692,"the game rocks your face when playing with friends
"
22693,its soooo broken wont even let me fucking heal im kept trying but made me keep reloading and reloading over and oever overall trash asss game fucking hate it

22695,to be to not be
22696,This is the best military sim right now!
22697,fun with friends... and meh with randos
22698,This game is the sim-est of the sims. Be prepared to learn a lot of different commands. Combat engagements are 100 yards and over. A game to run military tactics. No babies. Read manual or training. Very enjoyable if you like these things mentioned.
22699,Il primesc.

And in case somebody hasn't actually played it yet... well, technically still the same as above. The game's a blast, and so far the online communities are amazing."
22702,"This is a great game, and with the help of mods makes it better. I can recommend it to people who like military games."
22703,Game good
22704,Yes
22705,pure awesome
22706,This is an awesome game. You might need to learn all those controls a little bit when you know how to play it's awesome.
22707,not as good as runescape but a close competitor.
22708,can be good or bad. just try and find either a good server or a good game host
22709,ok ??????????????????????????????????????
22710,trash pls suck my dick
22711,excellent.
22712,"Honestly an amazing game, have been playing for the past year or two and honestly still haven't gotten bored. The eden editor has me hooked!"
22713,Good game by its self but with friends and mods it makes it ten times better.
22714,"This game is baller, find a good server with a good zeus to make missions. Make your own missions, play with your friends and a zeus, mod the game to add content and maps, realism, zombies, tanks, A-10s, what more could you want?"
22715,Legendary!

10/10 will rescue my love pillow again."
22725,so fun with mods and friends

22732,yes
22733,best choice
22734,its ok I guess
22735,"I held off on a review because Arma is one of those special games you only have good memories of, but when you really look into it you realize that the game itself is only a very small part of why you had fun. In a lot of cases you had fun *because* the game didn't work as intended. Honestly, I could write pages about what is good and wrong about the game, but I can explain everything simpler.

When Arma 3 came out, I didn't even know despite waiting for the release. At the time it looked so good it came off the screen, but nobody had a rig to play it. 7 years later, still nobody can run it, and while the game still looks good it has clearly aged in more than just the graphical aspect, but Bohemia don't seem to care about it.

Indeed, their DLCs don't exactly add too much to the game when everybody uses the workshop content to make an actually fun and playable game. They did have a few good and important updates, but it just shows what a joke it is when part of the fricking 2.0 changelog is 

""as well as a new color edition of an existing firearm, a camo variant for selected gear""

Greeeeeeeat, Arma 2.0 everyone, we have new skins... kind of sad really. So many more people could play and enjoy this game if they just focused on optimizing the game for multi-core performance and updated the shaders a bit. Yes, that is no small feat for a game this big, but if I saw that in the new changelog I would be playing Arma already.

At the end of the day, don't buy Arma 3 if you can do what you want in Arma 2. Yes, you get better graphics, but probably can't run it properly, and yes you get better physics and support, but honestly not to the extent that you want. And since you basically NEED Apex to play half the things, I would highly advise buying Arma 3, unless it's on a massive sale and you really want it. You are probably better off spending your time with other games, unless you have a big group to play with who specifically need Arma 3's uniqe capabilities and large variety of mods to play. But if you want to play alone, give up before you waste your money."
22736,the arma series of combat first or third person warfare always been a great game if you like battlefield and cod i suggest this as it has a lot more realism to it
22737,Wish I bought it a lot sooner. Very fun game almost got 50 hours. Took sometime to get use to locate enemies at a distance and shooting accurately. Online is fun if they don't kick you out of the room after join
22738,good
22739,"Pros:
-Wide array of different communities allowing you to slot into what you find enjoyable really easily.
-Huge gallery of mods and addons to optimise the game to how you like it.
-Interesting story that sets the bare basics of what the game is.
-The multiplayer is just fantastic, many different gamemodes from RP to Realistic Training to HUGE battles or even small scale team deathmatches and everything in between.
-Helpful community.
-Realistic physics and gameplay.
-A game that helps you to find your role and giving you plenty of options within those roles to experiment and master certain types of gameplay (everything from Land to Sea to Air or even the Zeus Creator mode).

Cons:
-Not incredibly optimised, graphical and framerate issues are part of the deal when getting this game unfortunately.
-Certain servers/gamemodes may deter some players because of their realism or long waiting times to get into the action.

My Opinion:
-I love this game, the previous games and cannot wait for the next. This game helped me to find a community that shared my interests and led to great friendships. Although I have ran into the Cons listed above, as you can see these are the only ones I can think of objectively, the Pros for me outweighed these Cons and are the reasons why I keep coming back to pick up the game again, hop on my favourite servers and just have a good time. Where Insurgency nails the realistic close quarters battles, SQUAD nails that teamwork and ACE Combat nails that sweet air combat, this game seems to take the best parts of all of these games and more to deliver a whole experience filled with everything military or whatever you want it to be through addons. I could easily load up my Star Wars mods and there I have an Incredibly large scale game of battlefront with realistic physics and great sound design, or maybe I feel like running around as a grunt from Halo or re-live the events of blackhawk down or maybe some tower defence, ever heard of DayZ? Maybe zombies are what I feel like that day, it doesn't matter at all because this game lets me do what I want to do and have fun with it. I hope you do too."

22741,I love having 15 fps
22742,Loads of fun
22743,"peepeepoopoo, ok give me steam points now"
22744,"its a good game to play if you have friends or a unit, though Pub can be a bit of a asstake and generally a pretty bad place for newbies"
22745, played arma 3 for over 300 hours now and still don't know how to command AI :) 10/10

22751,Its an ok game but dear god the loading time on every server takes forever and despite i have a monster pc the FPS is dying even on the lovest settings when i get near a town or a populated area.....such a same.....i was looking forward playing this but its unplayable.
22752,shit game

22754,pog
22755,"1000 hours just here.

I enjoyed the game for the most part.

Pros : It's a good game. It's fun and the pace ain't that slow.
Cons : The physics and the net code (people die a second later in mp and etc...)

It's a good game, very slowly dying imo."
22756,"game is shit with no workshop but with workshop game is very good is realistic and have good logich in editor
"
22757,Sandbox FTW
22758,What is there not to like?
22759,War Crime Simulator
22760,"Fantastic game. Even having seen really weird stuff (thanks PhysX for every my vehicle it has consumed), this still is the best military sandbox I've ever seen. The vanilla content is good and playable, but even if you get bored ‚Äî just subscribe loads of addons from workshop until your disk is full to the brim, which is exactly what I did, and which is one of the best things about this game."
22761,Definitely not a game for everyone but still an absolute masterpiece. I've had some really good memories playing this game with friends and randoms. A very welcoming and diverse community.
22762,"Plenty of community server and modded options, great to relax and play alone or with friends"
22763,good
22764,I don't know how to play this game but the editor is cool I guess.
22765,yerds
22766,"If you are looking for a COD like game this is not it. There's no hit markers, no kill markers. Most of the time when you're getting shot at you have no idea where it's coming from. This game is awesome though. Huge maps, fairly popular even for an oldish game. So if you're bored of COD and Battlefield give this go. It also has huge mod support. Some of the mods I've encountered:
Dig fox holes.
All sorts of medical supplies, morphine, bandages and a whole lot of other stuff to apply only in certain situations.
Voice communication where you can only hear people in hearing distance, then you need radio's to talk further.

There's even a Star Wars mod.

So defiantly give this a try."
22767,good sim
22768,Its alright
22769,....
22770,"Great game with open world, beautiful and magnificent gameplay. and it was fun gameplay with antistasi mod (that you can do war crimes by kill enemy soldier's and civilian's )"
22771,Haha 420 funni
22772,"Great game to play with a unit. Very dynamic, with plenty of humorous moments."
22773,"Hands down one of the most realistic military games I have ever played. It has decent graphics, enough to keep you interested. Music is somewhat average, that could've been made more interesting and intense (I am old enough to remember the music in Project IGI. If those guys could do it so well back then.. ) The music in the game menu is really good btw, but not across the entire the game. Another negative is the animations of the characters. It is pretty rudimentary.. probably impossible to be improved on the old build. Especially how characters get in and out of vehicles. But otherwise I had a blast playing the single player missions. Some of the missions I played twice they were so good."
22774,gud game

22779,"Yes this is technically a game, but there is so much more to it than what you see on the surface. From the very technical editing to the simple multiplayer server layouts, there will always be something to do in Arma 3."
22780,big gun go brrrrrr
22781,good
22782,this game you can do anything like 100 tanks vs 200 apcs the limits are you imagination

22785,Realstic milsim nice immersive game for those poeple who own there skillz  and get good at stuff
22786,"Have about 3k hours in Arma 3 (400 hours or so with scripting and maintaining servers). It's a FANTASTIC game. The game could look better, but it makes up for it in pure scale and flexibility. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a military simulation game, it's the #1 spot still. Squad is better graphically, but still can't compete with Arma 3."
22787,it's as milsim as you want it to be.
22788,swous
22789,"As you can see I have been playing this game for years. It started as Operation Flashpoint then Arma, 2,3. I have played on line with many other players over the years and have made many missions that I have recorded and published on U-Tube. This game has been what you expect from a great 1st person shooter it is not a arcade game like Battlefield. I have many MODS and enjoy trying them out to make my missions. WW2, Vietnam, and modern warfare are there for the asking. 10/10.
P.S. I am now 65 years old."

22807,"Rocks= The Number 1 killer of Arma player
**** Randomly blowing up= Number 2 killer
Team Members= Number 3

I jest, but because of its problems I have made some awesome friends and allies. I once drove 10km only to kill my whole team and me cause I hit a rock at full speed in a prowler (they all laughed and responded ""Arma strikes again""). I have almost 2k hrs in this game and I loved ever second. I play Pub Zues and when you understand that cancer comes with public servers you just embrace the suck and have a great time. 

To be fair this game isn't for everyone. If you can't handle being trolled you probably wont make it on official servers but its about the funny and friends that comes along with it. Like Zues saying ""why are you guys stopped at the gas station"" and you reply ""freaking ________ and his tiny bladder, but hey we are out of Mountain Dew so it works out"" and you can just feel Zues roll his eyes. That's the moments this game is about."
22808,Tons of fun and the mods make the game so much more creative. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good realistic shooter.
22809,"probably the best military game out there. playing the series since operation flashpoint back in the days and it's still fun.
forget the other stuff thats out there, if you wanna step up from games for 15 yrs old that hardly know anything about military from of first hand experience then get busy playing arma.

in short terms: never regret a single minute of playing this game."

22824,"MIXED REVIEW. SPECIAL NOTE: If you enjoy LARPing as a genuine special forces operator, there is a Military Simulation community here that will be right up your alley. Personally, I find it cringe as hell. 

GAME MECHANICS: This is probably the most advanced military simulation on the market. That's saying a lot since it came out in what, 2013? The graphics are nice. There are ways to bump up the realism (such as advanced ballistics, radio simulation, contemporary military armaments, etc.). 

SINGLE PLAYER MODE. I personally feel that this game runs dry on single player mode. The missions are really not my cup of tea. Server-wise, people are generally accepting if you're polite. They answer questions. 

MULTIPLAYER MODE. This is probably where the game shines the brightest. There are a lot of servers offering a lot of different experiences. Some are very serious about squad based combat operations. Others, it's just a free for all. There's even RPG servers. Those make my skin crawl but they are very populated - which shows a very high degree of enthusiasm.

There are a lot of positive aspects to this game. Overall, I think I've got my money's worth. It's not my cup of tea."

22829,"Find some good people, stick together, game together. This game really rewards that. Getting to know your equipment and your team mates goes a long way. You'll get to know the enemy soon enough, it usually goes 'pew pew' og 'ratatata' right next to your face. Letting your self get immersed in the role takes dedication and comes with it's own reward of a mission well done/failed ;-)"
22830,Warcrimes simulator
22831,"Playing this game gives me flashbacks of watching my platoon be demolished by  USMC artillery barrage. I am also pretty sure I have Ptsd now, because whenever my doorknob clicks, suddenly imagery of NATO soldiers reloading their Mp5's flood through my mind and I begin to break-down in coldsweats.

Would Recommend."
22832,This game is very old and has some bugs in it but if you're looking for a mil-sim this is one I would recommend.

Do you want to experience ptsd inducing fights in dense jungle terrain? either get the apex dlc or download the unsung Vietnam mod. Do you want to be an edgy space marine? there are a fuck ton of warhammer 40k mods. Do you literally wanna play dnd but its a realistic shooter? try out the Zeus dlc (that's also very free), this game however, isn't for everyone. Its a mostly slow paced realistic shooter that is incredibly demanding when it comes to specs and unbelievably hard. But this game has been one of the few that managed to let me play with my friends without getting bored in the first week, i can't recommend this game enough to people who want to just have a fun time playing a realistic military simulator that's still being maintained and updated by the amazing devs, and has one of the best modding communities I've ever seen."

22863,Gun
22864,I haven't played for very long but from what I have of the single player it's a really good looking fun game only issue is the performance is a bit off some times but that;s probably got more to do with my 3gbs of vram.

22894,gay
22895,"It's bad even with mods. 

Only reason I enjoy it is because I play it with some buddies, kind of the same way I enjoy D&D. Only in D&D I can build a game that works.

Here I can't.

Anyways- buggy, runs like shit, clunky (Yes I know it's meant to be realistic, but then it's also super inconsistent - for a game running on a goddamn helicopter simulation engine, this game knows absolutely fuckall about how helicopter physics or a helicopter in general works, and let's not even begin about airplanes. So why not take liberties with other things? Like how your stamina drains like a motherfucker and most of the time you'd be stopping to regenerate stamina or just be super slow and have annoying ""tired"" effects on your screen at all times. Very enjoyable 10/10). It's straight up not fun. AI is shit, no matter what the community tells you. I don't care how advanced they are *meant* to be, if they don't work then they don't fucking work. 

The maps are ""ok"" I guess, tho.

Also did I mention this game uses the most ridiculous control scheme? I played games with a shitton of controls before, but I don't remember wanting to open my skull on a wall after playing ELITE: Dangerous.

Tl;dr just don't, go buy a better game. There are tons of better multiplayer games to play with your friends, including shooters. And if you're into that whole custom missions system, just...

Eh. Maybe when it's on sale and you have a whole bunch of friends who play it. Everything is fun with friends, I just know I had more fun playing goddamn Fallout 76 with em than I had playing ArmA 3, and that game in it's entire existence almost has as many problems as.. um... any fucking living moment in ArmA3 from the very goddamn menu loading screen.

Yikes."
22896,"its okay, not much replayability tho"
22897,Best war sim
22898,The best Milsim sandbox there is
22899,so as i have the relentless creator achievement for spending over 100 hours in just the mission editor i would say i have a fair platform to say that this game is the best milsim. 10/10 would recommend cant wait for arma 4
22900,this is a samson game and i fucking hate samson games.
22901,"Amazing game, very fun with friends or even with strangers if the operation is fun. But you will need a fucking manual to understand the mechanics, the editor, how to join operations etc. Nevertheless, if you are whiling to sink hours on a game, choose Arma 3."

22919,"Whilst a bit of a learning curve for anyone coming from more mainstream fps shooters which are little more advanced than a arena run and gun, Arma 3 shines in being a platform for thousands of different experiences.
Stances, mounting weapons and the weapon handling and ballistics feel superior to anything else I have seen or played.
The huge open maps give you opportunity to free roam and discover details and approach problems however you like.
With the combination of vehicles, infantry, explosives and a lack of intelligence being readily provided to you of the enemies position unless you or friends go and do the groundwork it gives an idea of what real warfare may be like.
Death is omnipresent threat with higher consequences which makes the firefight when you are caught moving between cover all the more visceral.
It has its issues;
Physics collisions between players, vehicles, rag-doll corpses and equipment being the one which first comes to mind followed by inventory bugs in some scenarios where you are handling more items than normal.

The Scenario Editor is complex and difficult to understand with what could be imagined as simple concepts such as respawning being un-intuitive in how to set up."
22920,maybe if it ran properly
22921,rip frames
22922,very fun shoot game bang
22923,"This game is absolutely awful...
But you'll adore it!"
22924,YASSSS
22925,JUST A BADASS GAME!!!
22926,addicting
22927,Operation Flashpoint but better.
22928,"Love almost everything about this game.I saw some videos of Unsung and I was hooked instantly.  Im new to PC gaming so Im still figuign out the keyboard and mouse, the detail that went into the mods and this game are amazing. need more Vietnam!!!"
22929,mhhm very funn mhhmmm
22930,very coo[
22931,"Like the game it has lots to do and loads of mods. love flying and the power you have in the editor. but and a big BUT is the online. Trying to host a server with a friend so we can both learn is no easy task, people will say its fine and not a problem but its not user friendly a single bit. 
Overall apart from that which needs refining in my opinion, i rate the game a great experience."
22932,is fkn ally
22933,super great game if you like slower paced millitary games
22934,"Super realistic super difficult game. It has it's issues but due to the GREAT modding community basically all of those issues can be solved very easily. The game can be changed to suit your play style and with loads of servers you can get good multiplayer and single player games. Love it!

Would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a challenging FPS or even a realistic military vehicle sim."
22935,"Great game, lots of fun and challenge but the DLCs are a bit overpriced for what they are"

22941,"Very good mil sim, lots of fun and especially fun with friends 
"
22942,At first glance ... it seems alright.
22943,My close friends said they'd buy it with me and we'll host a server and play coop together. They betrayed me. Also tank always kills me.
22944,idk its fun just over took as my most played game dont look at my second most played game im ashamed of it
22945,"It is a decent vanilla game but with mods you can make it your own. Just stay away from milsim if you dont want to listen to 13 year olds wants you to call them by their ""military rank""."
22946,Love it
22947,one of the best mil sims ive played
22948,"Be me:
Starts Arma 3 server with friends.
Friends are somewhat experienced as much as me, which is none.
We learn the basics and get some basic mods.
We then download a WW2 mod.
I proceed to dominate with my IS-2 against a Panzer IV and a CV-33.
Friends get higher tier tanks from modern age.
Russian Bias Intensifies as I destroy both of them.
They ragequit.

10/10 Would dominate in an solo IS-2 again."

22956,"Come for the guns, stay for the mods. Lose your life"
22957,"I've been on board with this franchise since Bohemia put out a demo of Operation Flashpoint on a disc you got if you bought a gaming mag.  Love every thing about the way they do it... From modding, to the control of the troops,  fly anything, open world, run away scarred, and yes sometimes not moving in a bush while a T80 is tripping out 5 meters from you, for hours...  Let me know!!!  The Bomb!!!"
22958,Arma provides a real-sim sandbox and solid mission modes tobring great enjoyment. The ARMA community and their various play modes bring the experience to a level you will not find in any other shooter. a MUST BUY if you enjoy a challenge.
22959,a must play game almost %100 realistic game

22963,Arma 4? For the love of god
22964,Good
22965,this game sucks real bad
22966,"The bread and butter for any ArmA game, Is not the game itself. Its the platform the game presents to anyone who wants to learn how to mod, Knows how to mod, Or just wants to play with mods. This game is quite possibly the best ArmA game in the series, Simply because the amount of famous mods ported over from ArmA 2, My only problem with the game is the FPS on multiplayer servers. I have a pretty beefy computer, And i can still barely run public servers with more than 40 people online. But thats with more than 40, When the servers only have ~20 people, You will notice the change in FPS for the better."
22967,heckin fun

22973,it's okay.
22974,good
22975,horrible game. antistasi is ok i guess
22976,"Our small group has had a ton of fun playing together. Hundreds of hours of frustration, defeats, and the occasional victories keep us coming back again and again.

11/10 Would summersault my Slammer again"
22977,"The game shuts down my pc everytime i try to join a server, Many other players are experiencing the same problems and complaining but the devs never fix it, it has been like this for years and still the devs just act like it never happened."
22978,"Pretty fun sandbox, better with groups of people."
22979,i love this game. join a milsim is the best option. but also vanila arma 3 with a friend on warlords is so cool. recently started playing can already see ive gotten better at the game with mouse and keyboard
22980,"There is nothing I can say about Arma 3 that you aren't going to read somewhere else but I'll break down a few things for you. This gets a little rambling but bear with me.

The game was released in 2013 and is part of an ongoing series. I've been playing since Operation: Flashpoint originally came out. Even with that amount of time in various Arma games and the amount of time I've put into this one, I'm no expert. Most people joke that you're not even officially out of the tutorial until you've logged at least 700 hours.

Firstly, is it worth the money? That really depends on you and what you make of your time in the game. For most people, it's nearly an addiction. This game has so much to offer and so much that you can do but it's not really laid out for you on a silver platter. You've got to look for it and talk to veteran players. Many can point you in the right direction. It's pointless to list all of the things you can do in this game with the proper mods because for all practical purposes, there's not much of a limit.

You're going to get the most enjoyment out of this game by playing alongside other people. There are single player campaigns and missions (within the game and in the Workshop) that will help you kill some time or even learn the ropes but playing alongside other people enhances just about everything about this game. So, if you're going to play, get some friends together or make some in the community (or both). You'll be happy you did.

Are there bugs? Yes. Most definitely. If you haven't been killed by some bug or glitch in the game, you're not doing it right. But for the people that continue to play this game, those bugs don't matter. Everything else about this game makes up for it. There is going to be that occasion when you curse this game because of a bug that lays you out flat when you thought you had everything under control but when you weigh the rare bug against everything else that could possibly be going on in the game, you'll realize why some people call them features and just laugh them off.

Is it difficult? Refer to my tutorial comment above. Whenever I step away from this game for any amount of time I find that I've got to get back into the groove of playing. I'll forget some of the things that I learned to not do from previous deaths and end up making those mistakes again until my mind and body starts to remember. And it'll probably be that way with you if you stick with this game. There most definitely is a learning curve and if you don't have the patience for that, you're not going to have the patience for this game. Unlike some other games that you've probably seen mentioned multiple times in various reviews for Arma, charging a defended position is not likely to get you the win. It's just going to get you killed. This game is about patience and a healthy concern about getting shot up and bleeding out in some patch of mud on the outskirts of some town that you don't even know the name of. It's also about knowing when to quit being so patient and just charge in.

Speaking of that, the maps on this game are huge. And that still doesn't express just how big they are. The largest official map in Arma 3 is Altis. That map spans 270 km2. There's nothing I can think of to compare it to off-hand that can adequately express just how much play area is available. You won't be disappointed. Additionally, almost every structure in the game is destructible. Put enough artillery into a building and it's coming down. And there is definitely bullet penetration. Hiding out in that tin shack won't do you a bit of good if someone with a powerful rifle is seriously looking to put you down.

One of the great things about this game by far is the modding community. There is a lot of love put into this game by those modders and mods like Liberation and Antistazi have given my friends and I hours upon hours upon days of enjoyment (and possibly a few war crimes may have been committed but I wouldn't know anything about that and that's my story). Additionally, Arma 3 gives you the tools to create your own scenarios if you so choose; within the game itself via Zeus and outside of an actual session with the Editor. Mods are the way to truly optimize the level of fun you can have in this game.

If you love CoD and BF, chances are, this is not the game for you. The same tactics that make you good at those games will most likely get you killed consistently in this one. However, if you're the type of person that is adaptable and wants a serious challenge in a (and I dread calling it this) ""shooter"", then this is worth a try and worth sticking with.

I own every DLC this game put out and, for me, it was well worth it. If you think you're going to enjoy the game, wait for the sale and pick up, at the very least, the core game and the Apex DLC. That should pretty much tide you over until you can pick up the rest of the game. If you're just not sure, pick up the core game. But don't expect to be able to play for Steam's ridiculously short refundable play time and expect to get a real feel for the game. Honestly, if you limit your play time to that short of a period, chances are you're probably going to walk away from this game thinking it's not worth it and miss out on something truly great.

EDIT: One thing I forgot to note is that this game is primarily CPU intensive. I've heard that at lower settings, it shunts off more of the work to your GPU but I've not verified that myself. The best thing you can do if you get this game is, unless you own a beast of a machine, do some research and read up on settings changes you can make that will work better for your PC. Make those changes. But don't expect to ever get 120fps. For most, that will never happen. But, for those having problems with their frames, the right tweaks can make all the difference in the world."

22992,"I've owned Arma 3 for roughly 6 months now and have sunk nearly 600 hours into this game. You do the math.

Though I will preface that the majority of my time played (Likely around 400 hours) was solo play or with one other friend, it is some of the most intense and fufilling gameplay I've come across in any mil-sim. The online community is by far from dead, however there are only a handful of fullish servers that play only a handful of modes. To me, the most fun and dynamic part of the game come from hopping into a workshop created scenario with one or two friends and taking on whatever time period you see fit.

The biggest strength of Arma that shows to me is the incredible modders, map makers, and story tellers that fill the Workshop with singleplayer and multiplayer scenarios reaching across the globe all the way back to WW2 and some even farther back. You can go from playing alone with an AI squad in the lush jungles of vietnam, defending your beach landing from encroaching vietkong. To five minutes later in Pakistan with your 3 friends running Intel missions on terrorizer compounds in the middle of the night with fully M O D U L A R modern gear. To 20 minutes later in a 16 person co-op game where you are culling the chechen uprising in Chernarus.

While the game was likely once touted for it's large, robust, and inclusive online, The game has been out and in the hands of talented modders for years now. The workshop with it's scenarios, weapon and apparel mods, game modes, maps, etc is probably one of the most impressive on steam and makes it an easy buy for anyone wanting to get into some tense action where every shot counts."

The community content for this game is amazing. Actually, I'd call this more of a sandbox because in comparison to the included missions, the community content is just amazing. 

Still looks fantastic in 2020 too.

"
23019,I tried to like this game. Everything about it seemed perfect its held up for a 7 year old game. Although the DLC is just so much its overwhelming. It starts to feel like a pay to play type of game. If you want all the features of a game that might die out soon you have to pay 170 dollars for all the features of the game. If you want the important DLC its 65 dollars in all. More than a AAA game that came out yesterday. Although game developers can incorporate as much DLC as you can. It starts to overwhelm you and not many people have that much money in order to it starts to feel like a EA game. Ill admit the game is great but for me it doesn't do the trick on top of the terrible user interface in it and the 14 dlcs that priced at at at least 10 dollars. This is just my opinion.
23020,meh

SPOILER ALERT 

I have never played in such frustrating game as ARMA 3. I did not get to far but the begining of the game is just failure after failure. Even if you will complete your mission perfectly at the end everything goes to hell. Maybe it will change later but every time I tried I got tiered of this shit. 
I cannot recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy single player campaign. I can live with high difficuilty. I can live with realistic simulator aspect. I can redo the missions again and again if I will make a mistake. But I cannot live with EVERY mission ended with failure. I have real life for that:P"

23043,"The landscapes of Arma 3 are incredibly vast and rich. The game gives you command over a whole squad of troops and vehicles. All the weapon systems feel so realistic. I absolutely love flying the helicopters and using other vehicles. There are many game modes to choose from. The map editor is very fun to explore and play around with.

I do hope that a version of Arma 4 is also released on the Xbox Series X. I would love having it set up for that platform. I wouldn't have to worry about the capability of my PC and all the responsibility that seems to come with maintaining a gaming PC."

23049,"Have been a dedicated Bohemia player of the flashpoint/arma series since day one.  Prepurchased Arma 3 way back when.  The engine is drastically outdated, textures are poor, given todays tech with GPUs.  I've loved this game for a long time, but now, its time for Arma 4, or Arma X, or whatever.  Something with exponential new capabilities that can be sustained with current tech and improved on with future tech innovations.  
"
23050,this is the greatest war crimes of all time
23051,Arma 3 is a game you play if you are autistic and into military stuff or depressed.
23052,fun game after figuring out how to play.
23053,"It is very good, I am playing the ""Exile mod"" in this game and I make my Territory with materials, then buy vehicles (Armed vehicles, Transport choppers, Ammo, Repair, and Fuel Trucks and ...) and prepare to fight to enemy bases.
Also you can play in Another Mod as ""Invade & Annex"", you are prepare as a specific characters as Marksman, Crewman, AT/AA Specialist and .. to go to the missions.

This game needs more works about vehicle's physics and there are some bugs in mods, but it's so OK, 

At last, I love this game."

23097,"Love the game. there is so much to learn from the game when it comes to playing on the ground, sea, or air. Its just so fun to play with friends and even if you dont have friends to play with you the online community is amazing. so many communities that focus on multiple different aspects of the game. overall, its amazing!"
23098,great game
23099,It's a nice game
23100,Me fave....
23101,"I could not be more pleased whith any sim or game i have purchased before. I got the $20 bundle and for everything crammed in it should be at least $80. the comunity of players are amazing as well as the fact that if you can think of it, there is a MOD for it. hooked for life"
23102,ive been playing arma for years. this game can pretty much be anything kind of combat sim you want it to be.
23103,"I can still remember seeing a YT video before release of a night time battle, and I was blown away by the scale. My mind had not even conceived of a game capable of such a feat. Kept up with the community slightly through the years through media. Was gifted a capable gaming PC and this was the first download and play. I've been enjoying it immensely just on its own merits. Can't wait to get more involved with the community so I can get the full experience."
23104,"I'd very much recommend this game! If you love military, I think you will really enjoy it. To enjoy it more, just buy literally 140 dollars or so worth of dlc!! But really, getting Apex makes the game a lot better!"
23105,very fun and realistic game i recommend
23106,very realistic
23107,I bought a pc for this game. Love it!
23108,good
23109,Best mil sim out there.
23110,Fun realistic atmosphere however it can be boring if you don't have friends to play with.
23111,"So you are in Afghanistan What is that oh no some ISIS fighters have you and your squad pinned down not to worry because you have air support like an Apache, or an AC-130, or an A-10 so no more ISIS fighters will be bothering you because that Apache and its M230 Chain Gun had incendiary rounds."

23115,"Very good game. Lots of stuff to do and even more with mods. The modding community is wonderful too. If you like military simulation, tactical fps, or just fun sandboxes in general, Arma is the game for you."
23116,gg
23117,"Arma 3 is a very realistic military game. If you are looking for an arcade shooter or a game where you can just run in and be a bullet sponge Arma 3 is not that game. You take about 3 to 5 bullets to the body or one to the head and you are dead. It is a fun game however. And also, if you are wanting to be a heli pilot in this game, google how to j-hook turn because of you don't, you will get broadsided with an AT rocket."
23118,"The best game for open world tactical combat etc. I play this game since 2014 from release, i highly recomend for everybody to play it and to buy all of the DLC and to subscribe in workshop's mods,scenarios whatever you like of these......."
23119,buy game or no brain
23120,"Great game, played over 400hrs."
23121,Masterpiece.

I love it. I cannot wait for 4."
23127,Very disappointed at the state of online servers.
23128,very realistic and immersive gameplay. 10/10 would recommend
23129,"I honestly can't give much of an opinion on the base game because most of my hours in the this game have all been with mods playing with community units. Honestly I feel like that is where this game shines. I know the base game has good content, but I've had some of my best arma moments kicking doors and clearing compounds. The combined arms aspect of arma gives a plethora of ways to make things go BOOM. 

All that said, it is an incredibly glitchy game. It's easy to get caught up on a door way, or to blow up a vehicle with just a fender bender. 

All in all I love this game and the modding communities that have expanded on it to make it an incredibly diverse experience."
23130,gud
23131,"Older game the graphics and interface give it away.  Despite that alot of fun with a multitude of mods that allow for interesting missions.  You can play as peacekeeping forces, insurgents, or civilians allowing for all sorts of mission scenarios.  Great game."
23132,Pretty horrible interface. Uninstalled after about 15 minutes.
23133,ok so the learning curve is steep but once you know the basics you just get sucked in so please buy it
23134,gud game

23147,This game is really good although I really wish they would fix the bugs and glitches in the game but this is one of the best third/first person shooters I know. When I bought this game I thought it would not run because I have a low end Laptop but I was wrong it ran very well and I've had no problems running it it has not crashed on me once.
23148,This game is great I really like all the customisations in game but I‚Äôve seen to much there are things no one should see
23149,good fun game

23151,"So one thing I will definitely say about Arma 3 after the countless hours I put into it, is that the game is only as fun as you let it be. You can play it super casual, competitive, PvE, PvP, what have you. All I can say is, do what you enjoy and find some friends for the ride. A game like this is infinitely better with a squad of friends to work together. 

One final note, is that modding is ABSOLUTELY Mandatory for the maximum amount of fun. Wanna play WW2? Iron Front. Expand the modern setting? RHS and CUP. Wanna get more realistic and indepth in controls? ACE and ACE Medical. Wanna go to the battlefields of the 41st Millenium? Grimdark Armory and There is Only War.

This game's variety is practically infinite thanks to the amazing modding community, and means that Arma 3 no matter what can keep going strong and give people who love the military shooters something to do."

Like theres more to this game and it's crazy how people will just ignore that just cuz 3 guns have good gunplay, like chill out fan boy and maybe listen to teh audience instead of your 6 followers that fanboy the fuck out of the game, like everyone else agrees. Fix your fucking game, not that hard christ."
23209,great game to immerse yourself into
23210,noice
23211,"This game has realistic distances, tactical engagements, and is very realistic. This game looks very similar to games like Battlefield or Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series but instead of being arcady shooters Arma3 is more slower-paced and accurate. The game engine for this game is also used by US military to train soldiers and that military training system is called Virtual BattleSpace (VBS). You can control your AI squad which allows you to give them very detailed command like flanking or squad formations when playing single-player campaigns. The multiplayer coop mode is also great and allows for tactical realism."
23212,"This game is amazing and so addictive. The community is great and you will definitly make some friends. Also highly recommend getting some of the dlc, they are worth it."

so i hope this recommendation will help you and i realy sure you will enjoy the game 
"
23226,i like da civillian faction
23227,Probably the best milsim game out there.
23228,Very good game. Guns go Pew Pew friends go ahh and fuck you. Planes go *Insert Plane noises here* Tanks go Kaboom. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!
23229,"when I was looking for a game to play I heard about Arma 3 and Squad. I got squad first because back then, it was cheaper. I enjoyed Squad so during a sale I bought the apex pack for Arma 3( Arma is unplayable without at least the apex pack) at first I went into the game and did the tutorial. I was pleasantly surprised, Arma unlike most shooters had realistic gunplay and movement which is rare in most games these days. BUT when I went into an actual game I realized what I hate about Arma. in Arma 3 there are many different game modes BUT the only one anybody plays is Zeus, in Zeus one player controls an enemy team and the other players have to work together on one team. in the tutorial you can choose your loadout and armor its great fun, BUT in the actual game, the game master (Zeus) gets to decide your teams 3-5 loadout options. the gamemaster usually spends the whole game doing NOTHING!. even if your gamemaster is controlling his units, you have to walk for HOURS is a quite frankly bland and boring environment to fight a bunch of at best rookie-level NPCs with a loadout that makes no sense.

There is a campaign. but at best it's mediocre at best with funky directions, easy combat and when you run out of bullets you have to restart the whole campaign. You could have fun with Arma 3 but quite frankly it's more trouble than its worth.

overall Arma 3 is a steaming turd. 

If you want something that's like Arma 3 but fun I can recommend:

Squad
Battlefield 1
Battlefield 4
Battlefield 5

If you want to throw away $80 to buy the worst walking simulator ever made and a crappy campaign, be my guest but don't say I didn't warn you.
"
23230,It's ok I guess..
23231,its bloody good mate.
23232,"Definitely something to play with others. A wide variety of communities, a good amount of which are operated by veterans. It's a nice portal into a military mindset, however it's less simulator and more really well made game :) I promise :)"
23233,sick game
23234,good
23235,"They need to fix laser spotting AI. It can spawn in front of you, you are not moving, you can just aim at them and then they will turn around and kill you like it knows you're there. impossible singleplayer with games like that. thats not ""hard"" thats dumb."
23236,me lik game relly hard
23237,I only recommend this game if you know what your doing beforehand and have a large group of people to play with. I have neither but this is still a well made game.

23250,Good game
23251,"Pros: 
One of the Best MILSIM games, that has a balance of everything, 
Ton of Amazing Single player campaigns, ton of Custom created Content through Mods, ranging from more campaigns, to quality of life changes for enhanced Milsim simulation, 
good Multiplayer CO-OP and PVP, depending on player choice, lots of variety.  

Cons: 
Optimisation is so so abysmal, ARMA3 will run, but it won't run well! Don't expect smooth 60 FPS experience unless you have a newest top notch NASA gaming computer. 

I recommend. 
"
23252,amazing game if you are a military enthusiast or an avid airsofter/paintball player. Base game experience is alright but a few DLCs will increase playability. NEEDS MODS if you want the best experience.

23256,"Really enjoying this game, I am new but it's become one of my favorite games of all time.

I would advise that you buy the bundle with all the DLC I didn't and I am slowly buying DLC Apex is a must if you do single player The old man Scenario is really fun and the Apex campaign is also a must play.

if you like Tactical games and enjoy a game with a learning curve this is a 10/10"

23286,"I have tried many flight simulators and shooters, Arma 3 is my preferred and favourite of any simulation tried. I highly recommend it due to the fact it covers every aspect of what a game of this magnitude should have. If you ever wanted to know what it's like to command a squad, drive a tank, be a sharpshooter, disarm mines, be a pilot in a fixed wing, rotor wing or unmanned vehicle, (and that's to name a few tasks from a list of what is truly available!) then Arma 3 is perfect for you. With endless mods a click away, you can truly push your experience to the test. It's almost limitless to the possibilities! Take the time to learn, and then go have fun!"

23339,"Can say with confidence that Arma 3 is one of the best games in my library. Don't regret getting this as one of the first games on my steam carrier and plan to play another 1000 hours. A few things... Never play this game without mods. Your missing the point of the sandbox and the main drive behind why this game has such a loyal fan base. With that being said, I have heard that the campaign in the game is pretty good. I'm yet to play this because I forgot you can have missions in this game. In conclusion, there is a lot of content available in the game that also brought you Pubg and a little more active than Arma 2 that brought us Dayz"
23340,"i found this game to be kinda boring its lacking something just not sure what ,i bought game with expansions on sale and i still feel its overpriced"
23341,its like mil-sim gmod
23342,naic
23343,Good game to play with friends
23344,Yes
23345,"used to play it a long while ago, recently got back into it and its just as amazing as ever, its a great realistic military simulator with lots of assets and teamwork"
23346,Always Arma Fan since it was called operation flashpoint great series always improving hopefully sign of amra 4 soon
23347,"awsome
"
23348,Good
23349,best game
23350,This shit fucks hard
23351,.
23352,i like this game because i hate myself
23353,yes warcrimes yes
23354,"It's a fantastic milsim shooter, my only complaints is the AI can be a little funny to deal with but that just comes with a game as old as this one is. Very wide and healthy modding community. Multiplayer is thriving and lively if you go through reddit and find yourself a unit."
23355,poopcum
23356,there is a million things to do and even with my play time still i am yet to experience a day without unique physics
23357,ok
23358,"Good quality military simulator, full of great stuff and many hours of gameplay. But on the other side.. Most of content is only avaiable through many DLC's, and quite ugly UI. Anyways i'm enjoying every single minute of it.

Plenty of mods around, great alterantive to DayZ (Exile mod), fully customizable  :)"
23359,"It's ArmA....

Prepare for bugs and glitches and general fuckery and you should be prepared for most of it.

It's not the best military sim, but a godly sandbox with the proper mods (I have over 200GB.....help me)

10/10 would recommend if you like fucking around, proper military stuff and having a blast with other people.
But beware the learning curve!"
23360,"love
"
23361,Die befokte ervaring...
23362,GUD GAYM
23363,its awesome
23364,"One of the best military games you can play. Lots of fun and very customizable to your personal preference. I love to fly with jets and helicopters, but ground force missions are enjoyable too. I really hope there will be an Arma 4 <3"
23365,BUY IT !!
23366,its amazing!!
23367,Fucking lit game dawg
23368,"Few things about the game ARMA 3. 

Arma 3 Really not bad game,but the takes a lot the time to get the good part. - And the Vehicles cost money which is not fair. you buy the game but you not can be on the plane and there are weapons that cost money
and Maps are also not some money like a game.                                                                                                                                  

To enjoy the game you have to play teamwork. IF you play are play a plays a single game is not for U, The game needs a lot of teamwork and there are other modes like RP, Survival... The maps are Huge. You have to travel by helicopter every game to get to the point where you die.

Fun to play without friends. If already with friends are playing serious the game it's fun. If not, Go find normals group and connect with them. There is also training that helps you better understand the game. I am would not buy the game again.

Training= 7/10

multiplayer= 7/10"
23369,Its a game you cant stay away from
23370,hittin' all the frags x
23371,ggwp
23372,cant play with your friends with out doing sub level bullshit. if I knew that they didn't care for making it conveinient playing with friends I wouldint of brought this game
23373,It's glitchy as fuck. Don't play this unless you want to break your monitor or some shiz.
23374,"Bought this recently after wanting it for a while and I can say I made the correct choice. Great game that feels pretty immersive. It's fun to play both solo and with friends. I haven't tested the full extent of multiplayer yet but from what I played of the Apex Protocol CO-OP the experience seems good. Everyone that we bumped into in the lobby was friendly and taught us new things about the game (such as how to display the minimap and create groups). Overall really positive experience, would recommend highly."
23375,Let your soul feel the field
23376,LOVE IT
23377,ok
23378,the very gamer
23379,"An impressive classic in the genre of military simulators. Despite the relatively fast development of 'squad', Arma 3 is still at its level and it is worth buying on some promotion to get to know this phenomenal game. It still has problems with optimization from the beginning, but for people with a slightly better computer it is not so arduous problem, such as learning the mechanics of this difficult game"
23380,"If you ever have a craving for a fun fest in editing missions and playing scenarios on a military simulator type game then this is for you. I found myself coming back for more and more as I jumped from one mod to another with friends as I would create stories that they could play in. I joined a few regiments and found more fun as we would sing in the back of trucks on our way to overthrow the government as rebels. Here are a few more things of note:

- Be prepared to have your PC run overdrive as you go into larger missions that you or your friends make.
- Get ready to have PTSD as your regiment leader plays god and controls an enemy sniper to blow out your friend's leg or be surrounded by enemies and have no ammo or medical supplies insight.
- Playing with friends or a good group is the primary way to have fun in this game. Although there are other servers with different modes that can be fun too like King of the Hill. (I find KOTH to be quite repetitive tbh but that is just me)
- You might need a second drive to hold a large number of mods you are going to download as the developers do not add much to the game and the modding community makes everything. (I mean everything)
- Role-playing servers can be fun although getting into a good one can take a bit of time.

The game has a lot to offer and with a bit of dedication, you will find fun. You make what you want to experience so have fun and godspeed to you."
23381,Very NiCe YaaS
23382,Still good in 2020
23383,it's shit
23384,yeah it's ok.
23385,pog
23386,"I can safely say that this is the game with the worst servers ever. I could not find a SINGLE deathmatch server, the most BASIC gamemode out there. I try to hop on different servers but I get these stupid errors that look like they are in some ancient language. You would have better luck trying to find servers on Pong."
23387,Very Nice
23388,"i recommend this game as a new and to be honest pretty clueless player to the game as a new player it is really difficult to learn what all the buttons do and how you play, tactics you can pull, etc. But overall you are able to learn the essentials pretty quickly and there are some awesome guides on youtube and google to get you on your feet. in terms of gameplay you can either download scenarios from the workshop or play with your friends or on public servers. the workshop support in this game is phenomenal ranging from weapons to vehicles to gameplay mechanics that can change how you play and how the game feels. overall im going to give this game an 8.5/10 but keep in mind im only a new player"
23389,yessir
23390,"Game is impossibly hard to learn, but once you spend over $100 on it and force yourself to do it, it makes it worth it."
23391,haha a-10 go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
23392,"Amazing, Intuitive And Fun."

23420,"I died at the tutorial.

The DLC ads are annoying tho, specially in Multiplayer when the whole screen is covered by an overlay."
23421,realistic good game

23439,"I am a fan of the shooter games and this game really makes a good impression 
It is very realistic."
23440,"This game is amazing, just starting off i had so much fun and did a lot of stuff in the zeus servers. 10/10 would reccomend"
23441,"They aren't ""Unarmed civilians"" they're reactive targets.

10/10 would warcrime again"
23442,"breaking the Geneva suggestion is very welcome, 10/10 civilians shot, would recommend war crime simulator 2020 100%"
23443,Lag.exe
23444,after my previous review i had stated i had accumulated 'a few more hours'. Now I have accumulated more than double. To this point in time i still refuse to play altis life.
23445,"What can I even begin to say, or where could I even begin to start. This is in my opinion one of the very best, open-ended military simulators (mil-sim) and the previous game was a gem too, having played the original DayZ mod for Arma II. When I say open ended I mean the possibilities for this game are, yup, you guessed it.. endless...

Feel like driving a VW golf around. sure. wanna race golf karts. ok. feel like downloading any mod you could really think of and still be amazed at whats left to choose from.. even better. yup. this game pretty much has all the bases covered for a mil-sim, with all the added mods for creature comfort.

Highly recommended too, and bought by several of my friends.

also haha war crimes go brrrrr"
23447,pizdec
23448,this game has soaken up so much of my life please save me i cant believe i still play this shit there is so many cheaters :(
23449,"The game itself is amazing. 10/10 nothing could be better with the realism, graphics, and everything surrounding those elements of this game. The only problem I see is that is it very difficult to get kills or even know what your doing half the time because of the endless controls and things to learn. I'm deticated to learning many new things about this game but it's not a game for you to just give a try once and a while. for you to get good at the game and know what your doing, you must be deticated to everything about the game and stay on it to maintain your balance on what you know and don't know when playing the game."
23450,good game realistic
23451,The game is amazing. Got into the helicopter - pay for the mod or get out. Picked up a weapon - pay for the mod or throw it away. Got into the truck - pay for the mod or get out. 10 EA out of 10
23452,Still a nice game to play.. :)
23453,I just layed out like 20-30 people with a huge ass tank
23454,"Lots of mods, you can basically play any other game in ARMA (halo mods are a good example)."
23455,"excellent game, would recommend"
23456,good
23457,iujh
23458,It's alright
23459,"yes, I do!!"
23460,Love the game! I've Been playing for a little while on Altis Life and I can tell you right now that it's absolutely amazing. The graphics are extremely good for a game released in 2013 and It's multiplayer is very realistic as you have to co-operate as if you are in the actual battlefield. I would definitely recommend this game if you are into Tactical Shooter style games.
23461,Awesome game to play with friends!
23462,"good game, very enjoyable , feels like im in the warzone"
23463,This game kinda sus
23464,"ITS GOOD
"
23465,its a grate game the people who play it are pretty toxic and rude to kids who are trying to have fun
23466,no
23467,"engine of the game is from stone age.. Devs should put more effort on fix it.. planty of bugs gliches to spoil game. performaces - Arma 3 just dont use my computer.. my i9, 32 DDR4, RTX 2080 gets just 40-60 fps.. is it normal?"
23468,Its Aight
23469,haha waste ammo on civilians
23470,i really injoy the game i recommend it to play injoy milsim games
23471,yes
23472,Great game takes some time to get use to tho but its worth if
23473,WARCRIME SIMULATOR TO THE EXTREME
23474,its a good game
23475,"Simply put, best game, best developers, best community. 10/10"
23476,"12 year vet. was told to try this game. hate it. kicked from matches because of Battleye. match i did get in was just not fun at all. Game is just a damn chore to play.  and its so clunky, guys..come on. also just full of try hards, man. watched a dude, during a damn 20 min stage, get into a vehicle and they shot him cuz of it. if you want a fun shooter, look at the OG insurgency, not the new one."
23477,"This game looks great and has a very cool military style shooter. The only down side is the fps, once you reach a building the fps drops to 20 no matter your settings. I tried everything except putting the game onto my C drive (ssd). I hope they fix the fps issue but otherwise go ahead and buy this game as it has many servers and great mods. I must tough put a thumbs down for the bad fps which makes the game unplayable."
23478,THE BEST GAME EVER
23479,it good
23480,Best game ever  made !!!! Buy it play it !!!
23481,pretty fun better when playing modded rp tho
23482,COOL GAME
23483,"just do it
"
23484,"Well, after a *little* testing, i think its pretty good."
23485,"Pgood game, can kill a few hours with it."
23486,Very realistic game.
23487,It's a fantastic mil-sim game. Super fun when you find the right people.
23488,Fuck Arma. I hate that I love it... It's so shit... so buggy... yet so... classic?
23489,"In essence, while its graphics are outdated, Arma 3 is a fantastic military combat simulator, and a lot of fun. Only massive downsides I can think of are the movement bugs and how easy it is to cheat"
23490,good
23491,based
23492,warthog goes brrrrrttt
23493,no
23494,3------D
23495,YUHYUHYUHY
23496,"Pretty fun game. Hard controls but with a lil practice or switching stuff around, its fun to hop on with some pals or meet some randos and get the game going"
23497,you need a space rocket to run this game
23498,not that fun
23499,its alright i guess..
23500,"I have around 3,700 hours in arma 3...yeah...its good."
23501,One of the best games ever made if you use mods. The possibilities are endless.
23502,h
23503,I would recommend only thing is my mods keep uninstalling every day
23504,It's nice to have a platform that is maintained for several years - not just released and move on like so many other games today.
23505,1000 thousand
23506,"So before you buy, keep in mind that this is more of a modding and creating platform than your standard shooter game. The campaign is meh, the DLC campaigns are okay. There's a lot of different stuff that you can play AND create. It also has a pretty robust programming system inside that allows you to do what the developers do, sometimes even better. Playing alone is bad, terrible and very disappointing. Either find friends to play with you or go to /r/FindAUnit and well find a unit. Having a group of people to play regularly is a must. Overall game is terribly optimized and runs like shit. Mods make it even worse. 11/10, been wasting my life for years on this game."
23507,Great game!
23508,amazing
23509,"Best Army simulator, best open world mods, good community , over 10 years an i still playing their games. Hope to see soon Arma 4"
23510,great game
23511,good
23512,One of the best shooters I have ever played!
23513,play it like tabletop roleplaying games for maximum enjoyment
23514,"Very nice game, love it"
23515,"Riddled with heaps of game-breaking bugs, game feels fairly thin without the expensive Apex/Contact DLC, extremely obnoxious with watermarks when using any items from DLC you don't own (go suck a lemon Marksman DLC), has a mediocre campaign that I haven't even bother finishing due to some of the unbelievably grueling missions, commanding AI is like herding lobotomized cats, CSAT units look dumber than crap and are exceedingly frustrating to fight due to that idiotic underbarrel .50 (smooth brain firearm design on insane levels, like what the frick even is the point of that), and last and worst of all: the server system (e.g. I'm trying to host a server for a friend to join) is THE WORST THING I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN MY MISERABLE EXISTENCE. I can't even begin to describe how much of a pain in the scrotum it is to use. I still can't manage to host a server, despite watching like 15 different stupid YouTube videos.

10/10 game, worth twice the money I paid for it.

Despite the myriad of issues I listed, I love this game. I've never had more fun with friends in a game, the ""mil-sim""-ish appeal this game has scratches an itch that no other game has managed to do. The modding support is fantastic. Need earplugs so helicopters don't give you tinnitus? There's a mod for that. Want to repack your magazines? There's a mod for that. Want to customize your character face to look like an abomination of a crying-laughing emoji? There's a way to do it.

There are also plenty of public servers for game modes like Escape, Liberation, and the like. Really good multiplayer experience for PVE, though not PVP largely because I hate 3rd person for multiplayer. Again, had a lot of fun with my friends on this game, and we've all racked up tons of hours teamkilling each other at the FOB, executing prisoners, and mortaring villages. 

As a whole I'd say Arma provides a great base for talented modders to really shine and put out some really creative and interesting stuff, like Anistasi and Dynamic Recon Ops. If you have some buddies who are pestering you to pick it up, wait for a Steam sale and grab it with the Apex DLC and you'll get a few hundred hours out of it if you're into this kind of game. As long as you can handle being shot by enemies you can't see, much less even make out the direction of, as well as having your MRAP explode for running over the wrong bush, it should provide you with a fair amount of fun."
23516,fun
23517,"fun, stupid but sometimes smart tactical action"
23518,yes
23519,is gud
23520,"Like Squad but 10x bigger and less fun and older, and with more Mil RP sweats..

But still kinda fun..."
23521,Awsome!!
23522,Its pretty good
23523,"I bought this game when it was 60 bucks, I don't regret it."
23524,bababooey
23525,Many years later and it's still a janky mess that beats all the other shooters I've played hands down. Nothing quite like the Arma series.
23526,"Played it, I enjoy acting like Im having fun."
23527,"While 85% or more of my time in Arma has been spent in mission /making/ rather than playing, I can say that this a game worth buying whether you're a player or a content creator."
23528,"drop money or die- anyone you find
11/10"
23529,"yes
"
23530,"So i am not going to ditch the game and say no because i would be laying if i did that, this game is fun if you are into this type of stuff, i kinda had fun here and there but my overall time i was just bored and i only played for 3 hours but i tried mods out i tried the story out i tried multiplayer out and idk just not attention grabbing for me."
23531,"camping 
simulator"
23532,"Good with soloing and even better with friends, communities are great and if you can get a good Zeus,makes it all the money worthwhile. I would highly recommend it."
23533,"Good game, played it a little bit"
23534,all around solid game.
23535,Very realistic and a lot of fun. The community is really friendly and welcoming. Definitely worth picking up.
23536,Very fun but hard to learn
23537,"Well... there goes 20 bucks I wish I could get back, but at least I sure can recover 30GB of drive space"
23538,Its fun
23539,"My all time favourite. If you are wondering, get it. Take the base game and install 100 of GBs of mods. This is the way."
23540,"It's extremely taxing and can be very frustrating when things don't go as you expect them to, but profoundly satisfying when they do, there's a real love/hate relationship with this game."
23541,"awesome, realistic, buggy, poorly optimized, but hey still awesome
"
23542,good games
23543,"amazing 
"
23544,"People think that this game is so hard its unplayable but that is not the case at all, yes the learning curve is quite hard but the community is so welcoming and people will tell you how to play and what to do. I picked this game up like 3 days prior to my review and I love it."
23545,"This is such a fun game and recommend it to everyone i started by watching operator drewski and recently bought it while on sale i've had a blast playing with my freind and the community

23555,"love it i am going to add a f14 tomcat and and an A
10 warthog"
23556,"Great game, it's not much fun without mods. If you have the right unit it is quite addicting."
23557,Asking me for a review
23558,"The game has a few imperfections, but after a few hundred hours you won't even be able to notice them. Until ArmA 4 is announced, a must for all who want to enjoy a almost lifelike military simulation."
23559,I love this game :B
23560,its fun
23561,"Well if you want to experience a new type of game, with friends especially then please buy this. It is no doubt tricky to work out the controles but nothing can beat flying to your doom whilst you friend dosn't know ho to get out of the helicopter"
23562,"good
"
23563,"Replayable, immersive, milsim, accuracy - GOAT"

I like to make things go boom

I like large battles though my skill level means I most likely won't survive

23586,"A classic masterpiece that is still playable and popular to this present day - I cannot think of any game that would compete against this!

Pros: This is a game that offers not only warfare on the battlefield but roleplay experience as a civilian as well on the community servers. The player base are friendly and meeting new friends on Arma 3 is something that you should expect, unless if you are a people's hater. The game's graphics and textures are very pristine, giving it a very unique look. There is a whole range of mods and scenarios that can be downloaded and that are playable on the game. If you are a PvP kind of person, you are in the right place! If not, then you are also still in the right place as there are roleplay servers that other civilian jobs as well. It is quite hard to be bored of Arma 3, so I will rate it 8/10.

Cons: The game can be buggy at times and the lag from some players can be a problem if you are trying to kill them or interact with them in a vehicle; however, this still does not change the way the game is played and I still highly recommend buy this game. There are a few other downsides to the game, but the positive sides outweigh the negatives in my opinion. And for this case, I will rate all of the cons a 6/10.

This is an enjoyable game to play overall and I will give Arma 3 a rating of 8/10."
23587,True and tested.

23601,FUN but there is a learning curve
23602,"buy now
"
23603,if you dream being a military like me or you just like combat games military you call it this game is super perfect for you
23604,"Game sucks, need DLC to have fun, I want refund but I bought it too long ago."
23605,its a good game. mods are gamechangers
23606,"A fun realistic, teamwork based game! Shooty shooty bang bang make game good"
23607,"ARMA 3, in my opinion is a great game!

It holds up to a lot of standards regarding gameplay even though its getting a little old.

ARMA 3 Also runs on a very strong engine, which allows for very extensive modding.
For example: 
If you dislike the campaign or default multiplayer, you can always just download a bunch of mods, and BOOM it feels like a completely different game!

All in all I think it is a great game, and I really recommend giving it a try!"
23608,Mainly play Zeus but you'll love this game. Takes a couple hours to get used to but you'll get it done.
23609,"the game is the best i recommend this game its a mad game 
"
23610,"Fun times, play with friends or find groups to join. You'll make some fun memories."
23611,Good
23612,The game is quite realistic unlike other games. I don't see any decrease either in improvements that have been made directly by the developers or the modding community. Love this game! 10/10
23613,good
23614,Great game!
23615,"So far so good, will update when I have more playtime on the game."
23616,"Great game, but very hard."
23617,Very nice game
23618,"I rarely endorse games. This one far surpassed the realism to an agonizing degree. The long chopper rides, the faint pops of gunfire in the distance. The whirling of the blades as you gaze at the ground below you flying by. Nothingness, endless terrain ranging from forests, mountains, and valleys. While on the way to the LZ that someone marked on the map with little to no knowledge of what AA batteries are in the way you bravely forge into sprinting distance of your objective. Perhaps you get shot down, maybe you hear the blaring alert that your chopper has been locked on and your pilot bless his heart has to deal with the choice of landing, pulling off some wild moves and landing or death. Regardless, you land and nothing awaits you but the sound of gunfire and the brief flash of the enemies tracer rounds flying right by your face. You look towards your teammates but they are also just as lost as you are. You're in hostile territory but you forge on looking wildly around you while diving for what ever scant cover you can find. You spot them far enough for them to hit you a couple of times, just far enough that your best aim is jostled by the recoil while you lay prone in tall enough grass to obscure your view that you have to kneel and expose yourself to gun fire. Then you hear it, the faint motor of a tank heading towards you and just like that it takes aim and fires and no sooner than that you're dead. Only to attempt the same fate again. This is but one of the many situations you can find your self in Arma 3. Between being able to fight back using missile launchers and calling for air support you can find yourself in the midst of providing cover fire whilst your FOB is being attacked on all sides to being on the top of a hill raining down missiles on a convoy. Either way both the sheer confusion of combat coupled with the sheer variation in the ways to play there is something for everyone here."
23619,Woah.
23620,.
23621,"great game without a doubt (:

23623,Yes mate its a great game for virgins that got MAAAAD time on there hands

23636,so real!!!
23637,It's amazing. Just the performance sucks. Also the graphics are not really up to standards anymore.
23638,Runs like shit
23639,"Very great game. overall great team work. just bought the bundle expansion and thrilled to try it out. 
Learning the keys and etc is a learning curve but with a mic and some time and also the help from the community in game, it gets easier to handle. I usually only play the invade and annex time game play. but i wouldnt under mind the AI they are quit an oppenent. but overall the best military game and loads of team work and things to learn to do..  
The only down side i see about this game are that some servers allow hot mic the comms with childish actions and nothing seems to be done about that. i guess ill have to mute them players from now on. other then that i love the updates and the hard work that has went into this game. and look forwarded to working with yall on the battlefield sometime soon!"
23640,I am completely satisified with this game. Had it for a while and always going back to play it.
23641,I mean.. Its hard but fun.
23642,its only fun if you have friends very realistic game as well highly recommended
23643,"Only had fun for 2000 hours, not sure if it was worth the 20 bucks... I'm a poor russian after all"
23644,"Another piece of Bohemia Interactive trash. The developers are one of the scummiest in gaming and are not to be trusted, I wouldn't be surprised if they were paid by Soros. 

Here are some of the things these soy drinkers are known for:
. Banning people for things that happened on a different game
. Releasing shit nobody asked for like go karts in a milsim
. Overbearing Anticheat that puts the NSA to shame
. Overpriced low effort DLC
. DayZ

In terms of the playerbase it's exactly the same as GMod and VRChat but instead of left wing druggies, furries and orbiters  you'll be meeting fat military wannabes who still haven't grown out of playing pretend. In fact I'm 100% sure this game is the #1 cause of school shootings.

Avoid like the Plague, play Squad instead"

U CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME WITH THIS SYSTEM'S


VERY BEAUTYFUL AND REALISTIC GAME I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME
"
23649,"PASS ON THIS GAME AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TRUST ME

Usually people on steam reviews complain about bugs or glitches but I never see or rarely exprience what the bugs they are complaining about

Not this game, it is RIDDLED with glitches and bugs. Holy shit I dont even know where to start because every aspect and gameplay element has bugs, from rocks to bushes to vehicles to guns to doors to windows to grenades.

Not to mention the insanely clunky animations and movement system. It supposed to be 'realistic' yet with clunky movements you could zig-zag like a lighting bolt and do 180 degree turns and weave left and right like you weight like a feather and throw off the aim of even the best marksman in the game.

All of these bugs, glitches and exploits have been in the game since release and they have invested 0 amount of effort into fixing any of them.

The community knows about all of this but shrugs it off.

Save your money and effort, if you want hardcore/realistic first person shooter, go buy Squad or Insurgency, they are a thousand times more polished. If you want a 'battle' simulator with tanks, jets, helis and etc, then get Battlefield. Arma is a clunky, buggy and runs like shit even on top end PCs because you are always bottle necked by the single core performance of your CPU. 

Community is hyper-toxic and full of basement-dwellers/neckbeards like RoidRage and moderators of C4G (Not an insult, they confirmed they are overweight/anti social in several chats). Squad has the same type of people but there countless alternatives and servers to chose from till you find people that you fit in with. This is not the case with Arma 3 since C4G run the 2 most populated HC/FPV only servers.

The other half of community is mil-sim 'gamers' who spam reddit with 'screenshots' (check arma subreddit) and play 'operations' against 'AI Bots'. If you are not into that crap, you're already alienated from half of community alone.

tl;dr clunky buggy do-it-all ""game"" with a garbage community on top. Get Insurgency or Squad instead for a polished PVP experience. Gameplay wise, Arma 3 doesn't offer anything extra."
23650,Is fun
23651,"it's alright, only played a little"
23652,"Hard for new players to get into, I had returned it because I really didn't get any fun out of it. Its not for everyone."
23653,"Game's pretty barren on it's own, but a great platform for mods."
23654,"This game is really fun for anyone into milsim or are creative, the multiplayer isn't ""amazing"" but zeus and the milsim are topnotch, as for the campaign it's pretty good too and can last a while depending on how good you are at shooters"
23655,"I've downloaded more mods for this game than I any other. Arma 3 is the single biggest game on my hard drive.
Pretty much the reason I got my PC.
Play with friends, it's a blast. Zeus mode makes it a similar experience to DnD. Zeus with friends is the best way to experience this game. Would recommend. (Can be buggy)"
23656,good performance
23657,"What I Liked:
* Amazing realistic game play.
* Good collection of weapons, vehicles and other military assets.
* Great mods.
* Amazing Community.

What I Disliked:
* Performance (CPU heavy, not very optimised to use GPU)"

23666,love it BUT feels like they pushing you to buy the dlc cant get in the most tanks/choppers/cars/planes becuse i need to buy a helicopter dl.. feels like you buy 1% of the game if you buy it standalone if you want the 99% of the otherstuff u need to buy either ultimate edition or apex edition to get most of the stuff. almost forgot to mention that you can pick up some dlc weapons 5 min later watermarks take over the screen
23667,Gets boring after few minutes
23668,"I haven't played enough to write a perfect review, but I highly recommend it.

(Btw, I still don't know how to operate a tank properly.)"
23669,"You shoot stuff, and it shoots you."

23671,idk ive never played itdd

23673,Extremely bad business practice. What company thinks it ok to let you spawn in DLC vehicles and then pops up with a big menu *after* you unlock it and attempt to get in. Thats garbage. Refunded.
23674,Warcrimes
23675,fun
23676,Amazing

23678,game is big succ
23679,it is very great for teams and it feels so real and i love how open world it is
23680,"Imagine you buy this game, you wonder what it is? Is it a combined arms game, where you have air and ground military forces going in to blow up things? No. 

It's just a broken, buggy, unpolished mess of a game. If you play it, fully expect the game to not work. Constantly. Fully expect that you will sit there, for hours a day depending on how unfulfilling your depressing worthless life is, and suddenly all of your hard work and dedication just... deletes itself!

Welcome to Arma 3. This game is so broken infact, I couldn't even finish the campaign without the game literally blocking me from progressing. This game is so broken infact, the most recent official mission, Old Man, broke on me midway through causing me to lose all my progress.

This game is not hard to play. This game is really easy infact. The only reason this game is hard, is because it's so unpolished you can't even figure out what you're supposed to do half the time, assuming the game didn't just break on you."
23681,"After hundreds of hours it finally dawned on me that this game is clunky and feels like trying to control a steaming pile of shit. To add insult to injury, the developers release DLC instead of fixing the most basic of bugs."
23682,"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

It would have been fine if Steam would have let me refund it."
23683,"I have 3000 hours, trash game."
23684,"Arma 3 is a pretty damn good game for the little bit of time i have in it.  Not much of a control learning curve because the controls are mostly like Dayz. If you play Dayz a lot or have played Dayz alot then you will catch on to this game pretty quick when it comes to controls and Like any other game there are some added controls in the game. I would def scroll thru the tutorial if you havent played in a while. 

Def would recommend Arma 3 to anyone..."
23685,This game speaks for itself. A must-have!
23686,Incredible game!
23687,its and old game but i still love playing it and they even still do updates on it and add more stuff to it
23688,VERY GOOD
23689,overall improvment on Aram 2
23690,"This game tries to be a lot of things and does not do any of them very well. I find that a lot of the vanilla content is boring and to make the game somewhat interesting you need to add about 50 GB of mods. Without the mods you will have more stable gameplay but very boring gameplay. With mods its much more fun, but i don't want to have to download so much to sit around listing to people talk for 45 min and have about 20 min of combat."
23691,Yes!
23692,"This game tries to be a lot of things, but fails at all of them. If you want a game that actually succeeds in its objectives as a realistic military shooter / simulation, buy Squad.

The devs simply do not support this game enough, and need their community to do the legwork in making this a playable experience. If you're fine with downloading and managing 50gb of mod data, and asking all your friends to do the same, then you may be able to enjoy this game. (after you've fixed the incompatibility crashes)"
23693,The most advanced tactical shooter ive ever played. %100 Mil-Sim
23694,"amazing game pretty nice player base!
"
23695,Yep
23696,very nice
23697,"Even after seven years i think this is the best military sandbox/simulator game i ever played, its not the graphics that make this game great its the gameplay and the comunity. Honestly this game has a special place in my heart, cheers to bohemia and good luck whit making the new arma 4 i really hope you make another masterpiece of a game."
23698,"The best MILSIM ever, that simple."
23699,Fucking great game and hella buggy!
23700,"Great simulation, best simulation of war in the video game industry."
23701,great gane
23702,liked errything
23703,"Great Milsim, also a classic, its amazing with mods and more"
23704,"ive never in my life had a feeling that every second of life is a blessing and how you could get blown up any second

"
23705,Controls are fucking horrible so I gave up trying to play this shit.
23706,"Doesn't work well enough to be playable on my old, and very bad pc (mostly my 2006 cpu as this game is fairly demanding on the cpu) but it is a good game and the mod support is amazing.

I feel I need to mention that even though it doesn't run for me, its still a good enough game that I've tried for this long. Should hopefully be getting a new pc by the end of 2020.

Edit: Got a new pc (ryzen 5 2600, 16gb ram, gtx 1660, I do have an ssd but I'm running Arma off of my hard drive as I need the space on the ssd for other stuff), runs pretty well so far (maximum settings, 1680X1050 resolution, 3.75km render distance with 2.5 km object and 200m shadows. Could probably lower settings if I wanted more distance. About 40-70fps on average in the campaign I want to say but that's a rough guess), though it obviously isn't the most optimised game ever so it's not perfect in that regard."
23707,"Amazing game, great with friends but bit hard to master it I am still struggling with some controls. But overall love it! Addons and mods are great and it totally brings me some memories to OFPR Cold War"
23708,a-10 go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

23725,shoot good
23726,"Great fucking DLC model here. I‚Äôm playing randomly generated scenarios which spawns random items you have to use to survive and these include DLC content and there‚Äôs no way to disable that.
When you pick this shit up (if you can at all, if you can‚Äôt fuck you, you can‚Äôt use this item at all), you get an ugly screen overlay with the DLC‚Äôs logo that obstructs your view.

I‚Äôm buying the DLC‚Äôs just to be able to play the fucking game without the gaming equivalent of a watermark smeared on the screen while I‚Äôm playing.
I hope whoever designed the DLC model for this game chokes on a dick and dies and their children are forced to bury their corpse with rusty old trowels.

EDIT:
Okay, look, I was just a bit annoyed, okay?
As you might see from my played count, yes I kinda love the game but damn if it doesn't have it's flaws and if the dlc model still doesn't deserve a swift kick in the nuts.
It is one of a kind game and the AI has made me rage quit the game multiple times, but it's just a really fun game to play and blows my mind there aren't any others like it out there."
23727,"If you feel like walking for 30 minutes only to get your face ripped off by a sniper 1Km away you couldn't have possibly seen, then this is the game for you

8/10 Would buy again if my computer didn't chug when I tried to play"
23728,Make Arma 4 already
23729,GOOD

23733,"The complexity was good and made for a challenging first foray into the Arma 3 game.
Really enjoyed it."
23734,By far the best military game i have played! Yes its buggy at times but the gameplay overwhelms the bad stuff. Its a game that you will keep coming back to. I would Buy it!
23735,"Big cum

23742,Good
23743,"Great Game

23744,great game when you get used to the  game play
23745,hard to learn and nooo servers
23746,best military game out there
23747,"After 5000 hours, I can confidently say this game, and all of its DLC's, are worth every cent. Grab the game, find yourself a community, and not only will you enjoy your game, you will find a 2nd family. Community is great, game is great, price is great. 

Just please don't go expecting +100 fps ingame. The game is somewhat old, and has not aged well. Game is very heavily dependent on a CPU, specifically a single core. GPU can be a potato. Seriously, I ran this game with a GT 740 with little issues. 

TLDR
Good game. Gets better with a good CPU. Potato GPU needed"
23748,10/10 best game i have played
23749,"Great game, it feels fairly realistic, which is cool. Its also really fucking funny to play with friends.

I do have one problem, and that is the DLCs. I really do not want to pay 10 bucks for some virtual helicopters, though this can be resolved by the massive modding community.

overall, great game. Play with friends."

23766,"Arma 3's simply the top dog if you want a Mil-Sim game, due to how customizable and open it's modding tools are. Simply put it, you can pretty much Mil-Sim any scenarios you want, from Modern Shooter, Vietnam, Space, and more. 
While it's a pain in the ass to Port Forward so you can set up your own server, the variety of servers and communities are really expanded, and the game's community is really welcoming, so you won't have that big of a problem to find a good server to play on.
I really recommend this game if you want to have a good, fun and in-depth mil-sim experience."
23767,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING  
If you are into relaistic shooters and roleplay. For begginners join a clan to learn the controls i would recamend the 3rd sfg https://discord.gg/RZqqk4 they are a great group of guys and they will teach you everthing you need to know, 
"
23768,It's lit
23769,"A sound game especially for the War enthusiasts, I'm a big fan of the mods int his game. 

I wish it ended up having the same Arma 2 dayz vibes but unfortunenly never happened."
23770,"ARMA 3 is a very interesting game. Broadly, it is a very detailed simulation of war, but ARMA 3 also has the potential to be a modder's resource for so many other scenarios. I must admit that the sheer amount of keybindings for this game is quite intimidating at first, but with just a little effort, you can easily learn the necessary controls to make for an enjoyable experience. It should be stated that the target of this game is realism and sometimes realistic controls and game mechanics can be frustrating. Mechanics as small as a shaking first and third person camera while moving and changing directions or a helicopter exploding because it was landed too quickly. It is also not uncommon to have to travel a distance of 20 kilometers in online matches to reach your objective. 

All things considered, ARMA 3 is an excellent war simulation that provides all the tools you will need to create your own war and more."
23771,Get this game if you like mil sim games its worth it
23772,Great game. Highly recommended
23773,it was frree

23775,"over 1,000 hours logged 11/10"
23776,Fantastic game. Invade and Annex is so much fun to play. Had to right the review at 69 hours because of Course.
23777,"Great game, realistic, intense, multi role player... lots of fun"
23778,Best tactical shooter I've ever seen!
23779,"makes you pay extra to buy dlcs to do most of the game

(go in tanks, fly helicopters, go in go-karts, be a marksman, go in jets)"
23780,"Yeah, kinda fun. Better with mods. be prepared to run a smooth 100 frames while away from cities and play a chunky powerpoint whiles in areas with a lot of props/buildings and AI... no matter how good your PC is. Go play on a coop server, make friends and join a cool arma group. You'll make great memories soon enough."
23781,"good game lots to do, plenty of mods to install"
23782,Simulation and replabability are off the charts for this game.  I can still play many of the same campaigns and scenarios over and over in SP without getting bored.  Never does exactly the same thing twice.  Great simulation.
23783,..
23784,"Good

23785,Overall pretty good game. Very wide map so lots of things to explore and i think it was worth.

23806,Miller
23807,Good Game
23808,would recommend
23809,"Well, its a openworld map game where you can RP with other people, it is also very fun, besides needing to pay to use jets, tanks, etc. It is a very good game. You can create what you want which is also very awesome."
23810,"Enemies seem to flip from incredibly stupid to superhuman. I can walk up behind an enemy and shoot them and they will just stand there until I kill them, yet the next will see me through multiple bushes and trees from 400m away. Friendly AI will get stuck in buildings so I have to run around collecting them like some kind of carer for disabled children. Because enemies can aimbot you before they are even visible some single player missions are genuinely impossible to complete without using mods for invincibility. I wouldn't have a problem with difficulty if the reasons why it is difficult made sense but the absurd ai just take the realism out of what is supposed to be a realistic game."
23811,it is vry fun gme
23812,10/10 Would recommend.  Cant wait for ArmA4
23813,I guess it's an okay game.
23814,Very good game
23815,"very fun , but i recommend getting an AI mod , cause the vanilla ai is awful"
23816,Great Game with plenty of gamemodes created by the community to keep you coming back.
23817,Good game many nice play :)
23818,"really fun, takes some skill to master aircraft controls, and the physics are really weird, but still amazing"
23819,idk fun i guess? if you like addictions
23820,hit rock and go to space
23821,Could be better.
23822,  great game with friends
23823,"The game is good and everything but the FPS issue which I tried fixing millions of times never work, and the game is very complicated for new people as serves, dlcs and stuff."
23824,its ok
23825,"i haven't played the gameitself, only Altis Life server and I can tell you I had a lot of fun. If you have a couple of friends that you can play with, I can guarantee the game will deliver awesome content for you to enjoy."
23826,"This was one of the few games where I lost my saved games and was happy because it meant having to play it all over. The game is gorgeous, challenging, tense and even though the friendly AI is so stupid you'd want to give them a head shot yourself, its all really worth it."
23827,WAR CRIMES!
23828,"Hey you!, you want to kill friends civs and the enemy all at the same time?. You want to bomb the locals?. well its there fault for living there anyway. You want to roleplay as a crackhead on a rp server? go ahead. you want to be rambo and kill everything? the only thing thats tiying you back is your skill and the enemy arma 3 is a great game 10/10"
23829,"It do be vibin tho
"
23830,"eh, its alright
"
23831,I play usually Zombie Apocalypse maps with a friend. The more challenging the better!
23832,"i just love this game
"
23833,hell yeah fun as hell
23834,Still worth it in 2020!
23835,"It's a military FPS leaning really far into realism. It provides a great sandbox for all kinds of warfare from close quarters room clearing to coordinating tank platoons and close air support. Unfortunately plenty of it's many features were left unrefined, but not to the extent where it would make those parts of the game unplayable. One example would be driving, which I felt was the one thing that was much worse than in it's predecessor. My opinion has improved over time however partially due to getting accustomed to it and partially due to upgrading my computer. The game's biggest downfall is how demanding it is to run. Especially in big engagements which are supposed to be the main selling point."
23836,"Arma 3 has it's technical shortcomings, but otherwise it's the perfect platform to live out your tacticool urges with your friends. With the community DLCs you barely need any Mods to get a lot of hours out of this game."
23837,Great game.
23838,It's just good fun
23839,yes
23840,good game
23841,yes
23842,"I love this game, thus meaning you should to"
23843,"Its a good game, I have met a few new friends on arma, and its good to reconnect with friends. I personaly think it has the perfect balance of complexion and fun allowing almost anyone to pick up and learn"
23844,great memories F

23849,Wanna be super serious and relive your days in the army with hyper-realistic scenarios and combat? Wanna run around altis in your underwear on a life server robbing people and being cancerous in the 200m spawn radius? This game has everything you need and more
23850,Just do it.
23851,good to a point if a friend didnt get for me i wouldnt be playing it due to the ai bugs. but short from that id say it can be deasent to play but the traviling  for me isnt that fun but for realisim its cool  but to recomend on my style of play n may friends id say most wouldnt like it  besides a few.
23852,"very nice
"
23853,This game is like someone took a rock and hit me in the balls with it over and over again until I was rendered impotent. AKA its great.
23854,yes
23855,"I mean, eh"
23856,Haha this game is great but I wish my wife would stop making me hit her
23857,"everything i wanted in battlefield and cod combined

beginning the game is an absolute you feel powerless, but the community is very good, and ingame they answer ALOT of your questions.

I have already recommended this game to my friends but they dont have the PC specs. I recommend it

Hold i or scroll wheel on a scrollwheelable object to make use, you also have to play alot around with your keys and controls to get accustomed to your right fit!

ARMA wasn't learned in a day

23892,"Well after 8 years of active playing this game I must say I would really wish to recommend it to everyone who have a pc strong enough to run all these capacities that this game need's for. First of all I must say that i had 2000 beautiful and funny hours spent at this game and I absolutely love it. But there is a thing, If you really wanna buy this game consider a few things before. First is your pc strong enough to run this platform? Second thing would be that you need to be ready to close your eyes when the arma 3 physics bump something to the air (or someone, luckily). Consider that you need a loot of exploring and learning because the game itself is not everithing you need to see. Workshop awaits for you ;)"

23898,Good gaem.
23899,"so fun with friends, join a milsim group so much fun"
23900,PRETTY GOOD
23901,Played for a couple of hours. It's pretty good so far.
23902,"A surprisingly well optimised game that provides me with 40-60fps gameplay and those who have played this game before know that fps around that range is a godsend. 
I joined in on the fun too late so most of my hours was spent on King of Hill chatting with randoms while we get airdrop by a pilot with atleast 1k hours in flying. 
I also enjoyed a few of the mods. Hoping onto the already dying DayZ mod trend where I walked for 5 hours and got one shotted by a sniper :P.
I never got to experience the true military sim aspects outside of the campaign, which was extremely lack-luster (atleast walked 30km in lmao) but that drone mission...boy did I have FUN.

Overall a 4/10 campaign experience
and an easy 9/10 Multiplayer experience"
23903,Real Time Strategy at its best (highest fidelity to realism captured in a game).

23906,"The game is all around amazing, hard to get used to but it's so rewarding when you finally do get the handle of everything, definitely a 10/10"
23907,"great game, liked Arme 2 and  OA more initially because I loved the atmosphere of chernarus and also takistan , now that more content and dlc is avalible, i also love arma 3."
23908,very pog. great with friends or roleplay. 10/10 realism
23909,very gud 10/19
23910,"The game never gets old, you can install mods and play tons of different custom variants."
23911,"arma is great game, the modding though makes the experience 100x better."
23912,Great and fun Milsim to play with friends if you get enough together. The Eden editor is fun to play around with when you're bored.
23913,"A lot of things to do in this game, even without the DLC.  The DLC makes it even better. Hands down, the best life-like military game I have ever played. Bohemia Interactive hit it out of the park with this one. Worth every penny!"
23914,A game like no other. An authentic military simulator.
23915,no good for noobs
23916,"After over a 1000 Hrs on ARMA 3 I have to say you can soak a lot of time into this game. 

CAMPAIGN - I've played about 10 Hrs of the single player part of this game and I'll be honest the bit I played where very interesting and at times immersive. and i think for a game that was released in 2013 it's well up there with the games of the time. although by today's standards as I've only played it the past year it's very dated and I feel that if an ARMA 4 is ever released we'll see a better more vast campaign should they make one again.

ONLINE CO-OP / MULTIPLAYER - Now this is where this game is different with a multitude of servers game types and play opportunities this is where ill say this game shines, with assets from the workshop you can go from playing a modern day military shooter to a survival type scenario, or role playing servers to WW2 style servers. I'd day there is probably something for everyone. However this is all dependent on the server you join and the Admins / Rules to each server and I'd be lying if i said all servers are perfect as this just inst the case. but once you find i good server or one that is best suited to you, you'll be lost for hours in this game. 

OVERALL - A good game that I have and would recommend this game to friends. it can be buggy and clunky at times however this doesn't take away much from the overall experience. 

So if i was to give this game a rating I'd say 10/10 and I hope that Bohemia release a newer smoother game within the next two years. Hope this helps someone.. Jeff"
23917,"its good , but it has to much dlc to play n to much setting up to do to have fun n friends , just buy squad if you want a similar experience"
23918,Love it
23919,I've been playing Arma since it was Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis. I enjoy them all and with the many mods and user created content theres always something new to try. Awaiting the next one
23920,"THIS GAME IS SO SHIT AND AIM IS SO SHIT
"
23921,Very fun! That's all I can say.
23922,Unreal lifelike army sim
23923,Yes
23924,"The game is very realistic: the community usually simulates the incompitance of the Ukrainian army, that`s why im ready to serve in the army now!
Actually you have to buy the game if you have a ton of friends to play with"
23925,This is one of those games that you can invest thousands of hours in and always come back finding more.  With such an active community its not hard to find something for everyone's play style.
23926,"Super immersive, very satisfying shooter. Very steep learning curve - it's important to remember you will suck for a good few dozen hours, but stick with it and it will be well worth the patience."
23927,col
23928,"Boring, waste of time. I played for 79 minutes of which maybe 2 minutes was actual first person shooting. The rest of the time is spent riding in a truck, helicopter and listing to the ""commander"" talk.  Be sure to have your cell phone available to play other games while you wait for something to do, otherwise you're stuck picking your nose."
23929,"The game needs a lot of updating, Squad is currently better than Arma in a lot of ways, in my opinion it needs changing in terms of Physics (gun recoil, vehicle physics, movement and more) ,game sounds (distance sounds and gun sounds) and graphics updates the game looks way too dim it needs more colors to look more realistic other than the render issues which sometimes kills the realism, the game is slowly dying and can be revived if a major game changing kind of update comes around"

23935,"Very alive and active community in october 2020. Most mods are still getting updates regularly. The game itself is the best tactical infantry mil-sim option on the market, while offering more gamey and casual game modes as well.

I consider performance and latency issues the downfall of Arma 3. Most other issues like AI and bad command system are already fixed by modders."
23936,"Too much to do at once, only issue is multiplayer is hard to get into without joining a unit"
23937,G√ºzel
23938,this game bores me and i love it
23939,Amazing! a little old but holds up soooo well.
23940,"This game is good if you've got 16gb of ram, you can run the game with 8gb but its often choppy and laggy especially in firefights with your buddies"
23941,its good
23942,"This game has its merits for sure but as someone who picked it up in 2020 I could not seem to find many servers with active players, a good amount of bugs to deal with and in general hard for new players to get into and enjoy. 

I would not recommend this game for a casual player such as myself who wants to hop in and immediately have fun, that being said the Arma community is a dedicated one and with some effort you might find what your looking for.

Edit: Many community users and active players had been kind enough to comment on this review, I urge any new player to check it out. As I said the Arma community is a dedicated one."
23943,very goog
23944,"Do not come to this game expecting a typical first person shooter. This game can be rough when you first get into it as there are many unnecessary nuances if you don't know what to look for. That said, if you grab a group of friends and find a good game mode (King of the Hill and Wasteland are my favorites) you're gonna have a good time. It can be very atmospheric but can also be slow at times. Like I said, don't expect it to be a run and gun Call of Duty style.

Tl;dr - Buy the game on sale and blow stuff up with friends."
23945,"This game is an interesting piece. Half the time you hate it from the Navy SHARK AI sniping you from 4 kilometers with a snub nose revolver. The other half is just pure and utter chaos as you fight through any possible scenario. It runs at a buttery smooth 30 fps most of time because of its grade A optimization. The thing that makes this game worth it is the vast amounts of tax payer dollars you can waste committing atrocious war crimes. Civilians accidentally get 2,000 pound LJDAMs dropped on them frequently. War crimes are fun and so is this game"
23946,yes
23947,"Thing goes boom, and so does your PC."
23948,Its kinda fun
23949,"Amazing game even 7 years later, but hurry up and make Arma 4 please"
23950,definetly worth the money if you like rpg games or fps games
23951,yo
23952,boring!
23953,Overall a fun game a little hard to learn.
23954,Fun for military sims
23955,eh
23956,The real fun is the [strike]friends[/strike] war crimes you make on the way <3
23957,Buy it play it
23958,"Warfare, PTSD, and War Crimes . . . Oh My!"
23959,"good game
"
23960,"eh, game is good, but hosting a server goes from 60 fps to 20, lost the hype after it"
23961,p
23962,Only moved back from PC recently having been playing PS4. I grew up with Operation Flashpoint. The last PC I had was over 10 years ago. Arma3 is like that only very much improved.
23963,"So far one of the best games I have played, if you're interested in the modded side of arma, you should consider joining a MILSIM, or browse the workshop to find modded single player scenarios you can use."
23964,"Amazing game! Not for casuals tho if you want a realistic shooter this aint it, its a MIL SIM game, there IS realistic shooting but its alot of walking and running from place to place(like in real life:p) but if you like that realistic as possible gameplay give this a purchase u want sum a lil less hardcore play SQUAD"
23965,Yes
23966,"has a lot of options. great game need patience
"
23967,"best game 5-7 years ago, in 2020 not playable too low FPS even on high end systems, animations, hit reg and player models looks so outdated. vehicle physics also outdated inculding netcode. list goes on and on. the feature set is great including content and modding but still it is not playable anymore. time for ARMA 4 or a major engine update. I can not recommend the game in 2020 anymore and will stop to buy any DLCs"
23968,E
23969,"Good game

23971,"all i did was play Arma life after 6 accounts of man slaughter, 5 accounts hit and run, 1 account of armed robbery and 1 account of attempted man slaughter the police arrested me and flipped a coin, they dropped all my charges"
23972,fun
23973,i dont know
23974,"Great game to play by yourself, with friends or on a server. Would recommend to anyone!"
23975,If my graphicscard would stop burn I would love it even more but if you got anything thats newer than a gtx750ti just buy it!
23976,Very Nice
23977,fully recommend and that you cant beat it

23979,Yeah it's okay.
23980,good game
23981,This game is a waste of electricity
23982,epic
23983,"great game, crazy learning curve

23984,"Most realistic military game but the campaign lack of big scenarios like ""war welcome"" from Arma 2
Arma 3 UI look smth worst than arma 2"
23985,Tis very good.
23986,"not behdd
"
23987,gud gam
23988,"Not my type of game, buy i like it"
23989,"I honestly hate this game. I tried to like it, I tried. But it's just not the game for me. It's too difficult, the prompts are vague and confusing, the controls are all stiff, heavy, and very ridiculous. The enemies have God Tier aim, regardless of difficulty, they can somehow spot you a mile away even when ground crawling. One minute they can be idling and the next they are in automatic battle position within a split second, which mind you fucks up the argument that the game is supposed to be a simulator. Especially when their backs are turned to you. Im not talking about being 3 feet away, Im talking about being 20 clicks away and they magically sense you. Some Arguments I hear about this being a military sim is that in real life enemies won't be highlighted, well neither will your allies. It's almost like there is a double standard when it suits someone's argument, it's essentially a passive-aggressive, ""get gud"". The custom map is super anti- new player. Too complex, TEENY TINY WORDS, retarded controls, etc.

The Menu Interface is just ass. Why can't be 
Campaign ----> Add on DLC
Online ------> Modded or Vanilla
I downloaded this game just to play and fly cool planes. Why does it have to be so complicated? 

The pros? Good Ambience, Graphics are pretty cool to look at, the voice acting is alright. 

Final verdict, Idk this game is not meant for me."
23990,Fun ja?!
23991,nidf
23992,buy this game its amazing
23993,eh the movement is janky and i dont like the gun play
23994,pew
23995,meow meow meow meow meow
23996,"very tactical. Epic. A lot of keybinds, but you'll get used to em eventually. Half of them you wont use a lot but then again they could be handy at times. Just mainly get around the keybinds, and you will have an amazing experience. Almost 100 hours on this game and it is really awesome. Especially on multiplayer like playing the zeus mode is really fun. Yes, very slow, but then again if you want to have realism you gonna go slow. Anyways, 
Highly recommend. Get it."
23997,This is the closest and the most real simulation I've played

24023,"This Game is not for everybody. If you are used to FPS games like COD or Battlefield this will be a huge jump it involves a LARGE amount of walking for potentially minutes of actual combat but when the fighting kicks off it really kicks off. one minute your clearing a building with your team the next your preparing for an airstrike or a large counter attack that could last 5 minutes or 20. The map editor is one of the best i've seen and the game itself does not take a super computer to run. one aspect i feel is often overlooked is the single player the story is extremely good and i have enjoyed every second of it, i could not recommend this game more"
24024,Not Bad
24025,si
24026,"+ A lot of content (If you want to pay for all DLCs)
+ Gameplay is good

- Bugged as hell
- Looks rushed
- No polish at all
- Way too much content behind DLCs

- Servers I join with like 30-40 ping still lag a lot, and I literally can't have decent FPS.
- The roleplay servers are so stupid, and the co-op missions are REALLY goddamn long and boring.
- The map is way too big, just like DayZ. Although we get infinite vehicles in this game, I don't want to literally be driving for 20 real life minutes just to get to an objective and then die to a landmine or something.

The guns also feel very weak, and it's just really repetitive.   3/10."

24035,"Well worth it, on sale!

"
24036,BEST GAME EVER
24037,The game is really good i like so much the graphics and all
24038,"Compare Arma 3 to games like Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and you will realize how awful this game is. On top of that, someone thought it was a good idea to implement a DLC system where you get constant popups in game. These popups are so constant that you either have to buy the DLC related to those popups or the game is about as unplayable without crashing and having okay-ish FPS that it can get.
I've tried to get into this game multiple times.
The first few times were in the first few months after launch
I tried again in 2016
Again in 2018
Again in 2019 or 2020
The game is still nowhere near as fun as Arma 2 Combined Operations. I wouldn't even recommend it if it was on sale.

I also picked up all of the DLC back in 2019 to see if I was missing anything and I realized that I wasted my money. Its still feels the same."
24039,"Epic, endless military sandbox game. Decent single player campaign and scenarios, challenges, time trials and more. Good support from the devs too.

Requires more commitment to learning the game systems and more practice than most 'shooters'. This ain't really a shooter though, it's a semi-simulator - the scope of it is astonishing.

If you like playing at war stuff, and you like having the freedom to play however you want - just buy this game already."
24040,this game runs like s##T dont buy this trash
24041,"Army sandbox simulator... with amazing modding community.         Just be awere of bugfest
Now I am using CUP which got really upgraded in last 2 years and I am amazed by the content I can make."
24042," If you are searching for a realistic and hardcore FPS, this is for you. If it is too hardcore for you, you'll pretty fast ragequit, like me. Less hardcore but still realistic is Insurgency and his descendant Insurgency : Sandstorm."
24043,"The term ‚Äòco-op sandbox‚Äô gets thrown around, but the game is highly objective oriented. The main draw of ArmA 3 is that it gives players total agency in choosing their direction. 
Despite a warped outside view of ArmA 3, most of the time, it‚Äôs fast paced and action packed. The game shines most during Co-op gameplay, thus you do need a low level of patience when coordinating.

Pick the missions that sound actively fun, keep it simple and you‚Äôll have a grand time. Missions can range from 20 minute action packed or to persistent MMO-play-as-long-as-you-feel. 
"
24044,It just has very low fps. Game is very cpu thirsty. I ll only recommend if you have a good cpu or high end cpu
24045,Its soooooooooo hot makes me play nude everytime
24046,not much to say other then I love this game.
24047,"Well, played only the campaign, spent 27 hours on it and I can tell you that this game may be a modern warfare simulator, but it's very clumsy and unpolished in one way. I enjoy the realism of this game very much:
1. it really makes you think what you do and face your consequences if you do some stupid stuff, the game requires strategic thinking (unlike such arcades as cod or battlefield in singleplayer modes);
2. the enviroment is also amazing, realistic - putting you in charge of choosing what wall or tree will be your life saver;
3. overall, it look pretty good, not perfect, but enjoyable.
BUT there are flaws that just make you think that first graders produced this game:
1. the AI has the worst algorithms in this game, it's clumsy appearance balances off all the realism;
2. the AI difficulty as in all games in singleplayer mode is off, unrealistic;
3. the amount of work to be done by YOU during a mission sometimes (e.g. when you have to control  a squad, when you have to use new equipment (which makes you fail a mission 9 times before you learn how to use it and finally complete the mission)) is just way too much and the whole war feel during a mission goes down - this balances off the realism, which has been put in the enviroment so qualitatively.

So, 5/10, don't buy it unless you want to play it in multiplayer mode.
"
24048,Fun. A lot is possible with mods.
24049,A very versatile game that can be played as a shooter or as a more laid back role playing game I would recommend this for anyone that enjoys both of those types of games
24050,Good game but runs really bad. The game wont even utilize more than 30-40% of my RTX 2080 at 1440P and barely run at 60-70fps with drops below 60.
24051,amazing experience
24052,Great game!!! Lots of fun!!!
24053,love this game but hate that after the cost of DLC the game is $100
24054,Yes good game for milsim nerd and I like it
24055, I just explain that I was always gay because thats easier then explaining this game
24056,big boi game
24057,"Very fun game worth every penny.
I suggest you play king of the hill multiplayer I loved it.
Only thing that bothers me is that this game is so fun to play offline and just spawn bots and have shootouts in editor mode but the AI is just so boring, as soon as there is a gunshot all bots just lie down and dont do anything"
24058,Very horrible game I hate it please don't play this game lol
24059,gud
24060,"Great and fun game! The singleplayer is ok, I definitely recommend lowering the AI difficulty, because enemy AIs seem to have laser accuracy for some reason. The editor is fantastic, I have spent most of my time in this game making scenarios. The game gets really fun with mods too.

P.S: War crimes are badass."
24061,awesome

24067,"Its one of those things that's just short of a masterpiece. I mean who wouldn't like a military sandbox where you pretty much create your own story? Especially with the hard work of the modding community at your side, in some respects the possibilities are endless. 
I say just short because you have to be patient, sometimes its buggy, sometimes the movement of AI makes them look like puppets and sometimes its just not a polished as you would of liked but sometimes its the closest thing in gaming to war I would ever like to get."

24086,its good
24087,Good game
24088,"Its an amazing game, the only true rival could be Squads but even that lacks the beautiful balance of graphics and smoothish gameplay for all. Besides who wouldn't want to send a CAS strike package on an enemy encampment?"
24089,awesome
24090,america vs the world part like 40
24091,"To all of you who doubt getting this game even though you don't have friends to play arma with (either they're not interested, don't want to spend money, don't have friends irl, or combination of them), well luckily the game is still enjoyable in MP, especially zeus mode. Just make sure your zeus is the perfect balance of serious and casual"
24092,to be fair quite an amazing game. full of good experiences with an almost perfect mod selection and community. only thing i can't agree with is losing hours of loadout saves. it takes just about 4-5 hours to create my loadouts. the mods seem to have no config with the losing of all my saves. battle-eye seems to have a liking of uninstalling or failing to install itself leading to dozens of lag spikes or bugs throughout the game. i've lost my loadout saves just about 3-4 times now. steam is never a help and never has been. other than that fucked up fact the game seems to run okishly to complete shitish.
24093,yes
24094,gun are cool

So many possibilities for loads of fun times. Best enjoyed with friends with interest in military sim gameplay."
24101,"I've played for 96 hours and I recommend it to you. I also recommend that you do not recommend my recommendation as this was personally made for you, skank."
24102,THIS GAME IS UNBELIVEABLE! I LOVE IT
24103,"Great Game, fun
"
24104,its good my only problem is that it has way too much fuckin RP servers and zeus servers
24105,Good but runs bad and kinda complicated.
24106,it is an amazing game i played it for six hours it is a great game.
24107,"The best in it's kind, if there is any kind of game like Arma !"
24108,Realistic combat gameplay
24109,"Game is great, Had it for almost 2 years now. The only thing I find dissapointing in the game, is how things often glitch. I wish, and I mean I really wish arma would just release LOTS of performance updates instead of new things."
24110,"its a good game
"
24111,this game fucking sucks. 90% of my game time has been messing with the controls and wandering around
24112,m
24113,Best FPS out there.
24114,Very fun game indeed I quite enjoyed messing around with the eden editor and it's almost like a make your own strategy game. Though a lot of people do have problems with starting out the only really frustrating part about this game is you need a very good computer to run it and when I say good I'm talking about a PC that can run at least as powerful as a MSI computer
24115,"pretty cool. It's got some issues sometimes, but that's to be expected from a game this size. Overall nice community, avoid the Life servers."
24116,"Much fun, such realism"
24117,Arma 3 is an amazing game! (with mods) if u are looking for a realistic war game Arma should be your first choice! but just know If you want a realistic experience you HAVE to download mods from the steam workshop!!!!!!!!!!. Now if you are getting Arma for the greatness of a FPS game and not realism then Arma is also great for you without Mods it is still an amazing game. Just its not realistic because its based of the year 2035. Hope this helps
24118,no
24119,"let me shoot my friends and get PTSD 10/10 i recommend it 
Edit: I have PTSD and now im getting therapy."
24120,"yes game is intti
"
24121,it good
24122,"Did not play much single player or competitive multiplayer at all. But it's a great co-op game with friends playing against the AI. Apex Protocol campaign is co-op and there are countless user created missions that can also be played in co-op mode. Definitely recommend if you want to play a tactical, realistic military simulator game with friends."
24123,good game :)

24136,"1- You can't play without lags with 4 RAMS / Graphics 2GB / core i 5 system.

2- The only way you can have fun in this game is buying DLC which means you have to pay +$30 to get all the patches to use. Like there are jets in game but you cannot use them and you have to buy. I mean it's not cool it's like showing a pizza to a hungry man and then you keep eating yea Bohemia doing that to you  he is eating pizza in front of you and unfortunately you can never reach that piece of pizza I mean who the fuck is going to buy DLC to have fun in an expensive game."
24137,very good 11/1

24143,It is fun but it runs like garbage on any settings because of its single core dependency. If that wasn't bad enough they just released a 2.0 update that added almost nothing in the way of content.

24159,"If your looking for a war time experience, where your able to log off and sleep in your own bed every night. I suggest this game. Multiple Game Modes and DLC's. The mod community is extensive, and you can even find iconic missions, ranging from Real World Wartime Missions / Assets (Task Force Canada, which adds CDN and US forces and assets.) , Scenarios from popular movie franchises. (X-files, Starship Troopers, Aliens, Predator, Terminator, The Thing.. ECT.) Perhaps you would like to produce missions of your own, if so, the game also offers a feature for you to take command as Zeus, (GOD) Class, which allows you to create missions and add assets as you see fit, the only real limitations are time and imagination. For an in game Dev kit, it works well and is quite entertaining to use once learned.  The game features a wide range of mechanics and assets, some of which will only be usable upon purchase of the subsequent DLC.  Each DLC offers something new to the game, and although it is a bigger purchase i recommend, (if the wallet allows) purchasing the the Ultimate edition of the game. This will save you a couple of bucks in the long run. If the $100+ price point is too demanding on the pockets, Look towards the Apex Edition, as it comes with most of the DLC content.
trust me when i say this, You wont be sorry. Additionally Bohemia offers a DLC called CONTACT, where you play as a squad member in a first contact scenario. what do i mean by first contact? ""Intelligent Life, and not the kind you find every time you cross the boarder."" The DLC is interesting, and it features you guessed it, its own specific assets and missions. (CONTACT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PLAY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER AS IT IS A SINGLE PLAYER SCENARIO, HOW EVER SOME ASSETS CAN BE USED IN THE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODE.)

Further more, The player base in this franchise is TOP TIER, Players in this game actually play their roles! Team work is a must if you plan to survive the engagement with the enemy. Make use of your skills and your team mates skills to survive. Leave no man behind, as you run wounded soldiers to the nearest Medi Vac. Snipe from great distances and give our forward forces the edge of your position in over watch. Got the enemy location mark it on the map and call in an air strike. Finally got that friendly  tank to the AO? UNLEASH HELL! What ever role you play in Arma 3, I see you out there, Holding it down! and if your still reading this... THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR SOLDIER!!! WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS AT THE A.O. A.S.A.P!!!"

24189,"to good
"
24190,fun with friends i enjoy driving trucks off of cliffs
24191,"arma 3 is my favorite of all time.
Bohemia Interactive you did a good job about this game and the community workshop make the game better.
another think the story mode is sucks becuse a lot of times in the story mode is borring and you feel feeling like that the creators had nothing to add and just recorded the voice actor and did some little things and that's it!

another think's:

the graphics is not amzing, but you can install some graphic mods to the game for change the gameplay and the realistic feel.

the sounds (for me) its sound's like shit, the weapon's sound's like shit to at all, and again you can install sound's mod from the workshop. (im using escape from tarkov footsteps and wepons sounds for me its sound's really good and make the game for me realistic.

9/10
i give 9 becuse i feel Bohemia Interactive can change the story mode for good think but they not doing that and its really bad, becuse arma 3 have 2 type of players: type 1 of players can't play alone and need to join to some clan or public server for getting fun. type 2 of players can play alone in the editor mode for 5 hour's like me so i have somethink to do with this game. 

so what i think bohemia interactive need to do is this: make the story like call of duty storymode for not getting boring play must of the time good music and that's all."
24192,Great sandbox  for building games
24193,Whats to say... its Arma... Legacy game.
24194,Arma 3 continues to be one of the best military simulators on the market! also the DLCs are amazing! with really great and immersive stories and are very convincing! APEX protocol was hands down the best story ive played in a military shooter
24195,gg
24196,taught me 30fps is playable
24197,yes
24198,"Find a good Unit and you'll enjoy the game with that community. Find your balance of casual/seriousness and the correct setting/era to play in. Pubbing is kinda IMO save for King of the Hill and some RP servers, a lot of gated bubble communities exist to branch into."
24199,The game is overall great I mean starting from everysingle detail and the combination with mods ending with the most pleasurable game experience its very custom you can do basicly anything you imagine with the experience you gain. Great game to play totaly recommended.
24200,if u dont fly jets ur a shitter
24201,GAME IS AMAZING
24202,It's like 50 gigabytes but i've only ever seen 10
24203,"Wouldn't recommend if you're a casual simple fps player, way too complicated to understand for an fps shooter game, if ur in for the full roleplay experience and high details sure go ahead, but not guranteed ur gonna like it just cuz of that"

24212,"To anyone still doubting to buy ARMA, just do it. This game has been my favourite game of all time, there is endless posibilities due to its mod support. There is tons of communities running within ARMA. You feel like doing something packed with action? You can play King of the Hill... You want to play something more hardcore simulation style? Great! There is Milsim communities.

There is something here for everyone. This game will be worth every penny and more, it is coming to the point where it's starting to look a bit outdated, but you know what? It doesn't matter because the amount of content available makes the game limitless.

I hope others can expierence it and make memories in this game like I did."
24213,goood
24214,"Awesome milsim game for 7 years old, would recommend"

24218,la mitad de horas que llevo en este juego es esperando a que se unan mis amigos.
24219,Its a really great game. Are you a big fan of big maps and realistic fire fight this game is for you. But all the dlc are expensive and you basically need some dlc to play. I have 4 dlc and want more but dont want to spend more money. But its a great gam.
24220,"yes big good noob#]

24221,"dope, dude"
24222,crashes to much so i refundo
24223,"A great game should be part of everyones library a bit of sensible fun and great for learning coopreative skills. After you play for a while you will discover its one of the least toxic game communities on the net with many 
 people willing to help out newer players. For offline play its great for story and a fully fleshed out military game but if you want max draw distance be prepared to have at least a six core cpu with decent clock speeds .
Over all a must have in any sale pick up ."
24224,yes.
24225,it is very hard to understand this game after 1 hour i refunded it.

24266,"peng game n all that ye
beside the fps
damn its unoptimized"
24267,yes its yes
24268,I never bothered to get into it and i'm happy for that. The game is supposed to be realistic while it has the most unrealistic visuals and mechanics. Like you can zoom in when you aim without any optic or binoculars. Sure the gameplay is realistic but still ehh. I just feel like this game is too outdated. This definitely feels more like a sandbox game with some degree of realism to it but overall it just doesn't immerse me well.

24305,"very nice! but its unoptimized, so even with good hardware the fps is gonna be bad"
24306,"I would recommend this game mainly because it downloads & plays. But i found it just too complicated to get into. I couldn't even get past the tutorial - how was i supposed to get the scope out of the crate and attach to rifle..? it doesn't explain how.

I normally use the PC for strategy playing and leave the FPS's on the Xbox. Seems i broke my golden rule on that."
24307,"Let me be completely honest, the game is a poorly optimized, incredibly clunky and terribly balanced mess.

But the multipleyer could be called fun..."
24308,"omg no good
"
24309,"Had this game in my library for a while after picking it up on a sale. Gave it a try last week.

Downloaded the Antistasi (realtime guerilla war mod) mods. 

Profited.

Just to give an idea: my time with Antistasi; Liberation of Malden so far:

On sunday, I put on my civvy clothes to scout out the factory near my rebel HQ. Checked it out with the binoculars, counted a few soldiers. Got caught by police somehow, and shot. 

Shit was on. Immediately went back with a team of 3 guerillas. Put on my guerilla gear. Moved up on the factory from the west, where a patch of forest provides enough cover to move up close to the factory perimeter. As we get closer, the shooting starts. I keep my head down while trying to somehow position my men. Before long, they are all shot and I make a frantic run for it.

I decide to wait for night, and try again - this time with more guerillas. 8 of us get in a truck and take some backroads close to the factory. I bring a medic this time.

We move down the road with the lights out (no idea if this matters btw), and I park the truck next to the road. I organize my troop in 4 teams and order them to hold their fire until my command. 2 teams take the western approach again. My team and the remaining go around the north, where we can see up the hill to the northeast and down the hill to the southeast. All clear. The enemy is inside the factory perimeter to our south. I sneak all my men as close in as I can, the western forest and an office building across the street from the factory providing cover. With everyone in position, I order my guerillas to open fire.  It quickly becomes clear that we control this fight as enemies move toward cover and away from the fight. With them surrounded, we quickly finish them off as I order my men to advance. We have now taken the factory. I order my men to rearm with the shiny weapons of the NATO troops we just took out. I finally gain hold of a radio and use it to recruit an infantry team and an MG squad.  It turns out to be a good call, as the enemy soon starts a counterattack from the hills to the northeast, which we manage to repel. Not much later, some loud bangs rock the little island - CSAT is attacking the island. 



It's now tuesday night in game, and I have lost the factory. NATO knows the location of my HQ and is clearly stepping up it's game. I still intend to take the factory and the town and seaport surrounding it. 


This game, and especially this mod - they provide a very good all-round wargaming experience. Real time sandbox, quite atmospheric. Does a good job at immersing you in the action. Should be a blast in MP. Is challenging in SP, but provides an interesting challenge at it. Firefights are spectacular, in spite of a lack of effects to hammer home the effects of being under fire or anything fancy like that. 

Very enjoyable. I think every wargamer should pick it up. All in all, Arma 3 provides more than the sum of it parts to me. 

8/10

24310,"One of the most addicting games I've played in a while. Arma3 is a game with a huge amount of content, and I keep finding myself returning to the battlefield.
I found a group of people playing Arma3 seriously, and made friends for life. 

10/10"

24318,great fun with friends
24319,"Great game, finally runs well on midrange hardware lol."
24320,"Very realistic army gameplay, but the server menu is not that good. 
"
24321,"The best military sim out there.
For the optimal experience you need to explore the community made content.
You can play it hardcore milsim or just casual fuck around."
24322,still dont know how to turn on my lazer pointer
24323,"ENEMY RIFLEMAN, 300 METERS, FRONT"
24324,Love the mods and editor.
24325,This is a very realistic military simulator with up to date support and constant community support. Highly reccomend.
24326,Kinda like heroine but with more anxiety.
24327,Good game. Enjoyed playing.
24328,fun
24329,Join a unit and you'll have tons of fun for hours.
24330,Fantastic game for anyone who wants a completely different experience!!!  Play this game if you love RP or just different gun play in general <3
24331,RE
24332,123
24333,a lot
24334,"It really could run a lot better, but still an great title."
24335,Arma Life what can I say.
24336,Best and more Realistic Shooting Game .
24337,This game sucks cock like me.
24338,good
24339,"love this game, it takes a little practice but wow its war all the way"
24340,"crashes after i enter any game type after 45 sec of being in game

i would recommend this game if it didnt crash but until its fix i dont recommend it."
24341,vedre supa fun
24342,"absolutly brilliant the best military simulator going so much customisation and ways to play with a variety of content and player made content official servers and player made servers, senarios, campaigns, showcases ,training, vr training with headtracking and real vr in the game now too and new expansions still coming out in the future :), the  games incredible and still going new 2.0 bohemia your awesome guys <3 i highly recommend this game its on sale at the moment too with all its dlc what a better time to get into the world of Arma"
24343,No words can explain how good this game is lol
24344,"Amazing!!!!

I use the map editor."
24345,This is absolutely amazing. I love logging into my favorite arma 3 wasteland server. spawning in and immediately getting killed by 7 different apache attack helicopters. this is what real military combat is like. Have you ever expierienced being locked onto by an a-10 warthog as you ferociously rip down the side of a moutain on a quad bike? This is the ulitmate immersive military simulator. 10/10 would recommend again.
24346,Its a very good mil-sim.
24347,"Just buy it ! Every Gamer should experience Altis Life ! 




I SAID BUY IT !"
24348,Pretty cool
24349,"well it was cheap and worth it back then, i wouldn't recommened this game due to being boring, confusing and only good with about 3 and up people. This game isn't what i was expecting, glitches make this game unplayable and the game is so boring, like there's no point in buying this game when you have other military action games, this one isn't it. so not recommended. 3.5/10"
24350,I do recommend if you buy this game on sale and the dlcs to its good just get the ultimate edition as well on sale of cause.
24351,"very fun really
 good servers for rp i love it sooooooooooooooooooooooo much"
24352,Completed the Tutorial so far so good. but dont know if i will get many hours out of this.
24353,"Amazing game but personally I need a good mod.
"
24354,"Just to make it short:

You want a fun to play military simulation?
- Play Arma 3

You want to Roleplay with some friends or strangers?
- Play Arma 3

You want to experience some funny Workshop things?
- Play Arma 3

You want a game without Bugs?
- Play Ar.... wait? Then you should not play Arma 3 :D

You want to play on some modded Server?
- Play Arma 3"
24355,Completely. The most fun game I've played and never looked back
24356,gud
24357,good
24358,"good game
"
24359,"preety good
"
24360,car mechanics make the game spawn in a hundred plus cars grab some friends and let hell break lose
24361,it good
24362,"Multi fuction combat
"
24363,"clunky ass mess of a game, but thats what gives it its charm, would only recommend if you plan on/have a group of friends who also play, great fun in a regiment too."
24364,yes
24365,Late getting into this game but I absolutely enjoy it.. Must have.. All day!!
24366,i would stick my Willy in a toaster just to play this with my friends
24367,"good game
"
24368,love this game. i get lost for hours setting up missions and objectives!
24369,.
24370,"This game is awesome, when I didn't have a pc and only had a ps4 it was depressing it was awful now that I got one I can play this goat game  oierwjsoierfhnwuios"
24371,it is very good
24372,ArmA pretty much survives on mods alone. Probably wouldn't have this many hours if it was just base game so yeah
24373,amazing I would recommend this if you like realistic military games and this isn't and people don't play this game because it's easy people play this because it's really hard to learn and play I can explain the entire game but if you want the game for yourself you should get it
24374,very good game indeed
24375,ye
24376,It's a fun game
24377,It's all fun and games until you hit a fence at 220 km/h in a  high tier armored tank only to turn it into a spaceship. 9/10 buggiest/best game.
24378,"Its good
"
24379,ok
24380,"it's like...ArmA, what else could you expect?

doesn't really matter what you bought it for, you'd always come back and revisit. 2200 hours on this game is like nothing compared to more loyal fans who could potentially have 3500+ hours

it's not that hardcore military simulator you'd think it is, it's more like a family-friendly soldier wanna-be roleplay engine. and for the experience if you're a soldier wanna-be roleplayer or ex-vet looking for that extra spicy nostalgia including yelling at your fellow players for dropping security, ArmA's got it all.

this is the spicy electronic crack for you, it's not something that give you PTSDs or what not, it is literally whatever you want it to be. from thugs on a island banging cops to dropping bombs on innocent civs, it satisfy you every demand for an experience the most of us don't really get to experience - war. 

let's just face it, yall vets probably aren't looking at going back to which ever shithole you climbed out of; yall basement dwellers definitely ain't cut out for that fitness thing in the army; but from time to time in our boring little lives, we'd wish to become a spec-ops secret squirrel, we'd wish to become an african warlord kidnapping children, we'd wish to become the ones delivering death and destruction on a realistic and tactical environment. ArmA gives you exactly every bit of the aforementioned perks, and more."
24381,–î–∞.
24382,"Kinda kek
Would buy again"
24383,sick
24384,Sign up with a good unit if you want to really enjoy multiplayer.
24385,simulasi tni mantu idaman
24386,Pretty cool military sandbox game.
24387,great game
24388,"great, bit of a learning curve but amazing :) i skiped the tutorial like a nob
"
24389,It's okay!
24390,I think this is a beginning of a beautiful friendship.
24391,its extremly fun
24392,gud
24393,Fun game to play with friends
24394,so realistic
24395,My son logged on and it banned me for no reason
24396,good simulation game
24397,"Intro mission: 5 minutes actual gameplay, 30 minutes cut scenes.
2 single player missions that do not require extra dlc
very spongy feeling controls
random framerate drops from 60 to 25 within single scenes, on an up to date pc with a 7 year old game

do not recommend

refund requested

"
24398,its ok i guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
24399,"Hiking along mountains and plains only to be shot by someone I didn't see, if war is hell then I must be blind when I get there."
24400,"Almost 3000 hours in and what can I say it is one hell of a game. If you are looking to have some fun with people I recommend you try to find a unit for more specialized gameplay, however, you can still have fun by playing regular modes like King of the Hill (KOTH), Wasteland, and Arma 3 Life. The Singleplayer story is also really great, and Tanoa and Contact DLCs provide some really fun storylines and very interesting equipment to use. Overall, this is a game with a lot of possibilities and I have enjoyed every single minute of it."
24401,Why do I have so many hours in this game?
24402,walking simulator 2035 (also has some war going on but who cares)
24403,Very fun if you know what you are getting yourself into. it is more of a sandbox than anything else. and definitely use the workshop content
24404,Best Milsim game <3
24405,"I have an i7 and a 1080 and i still barely hit 60 fps in this game , there are so many mods ive lost count. I seriously dont know whats going on and im still loving it.

Dont you dare buy it for 40$, find it cheaper somewhere"
24406,"A woefully difficult to navigate game that 17 hours in I've yet to figure out at all. A bare bones single player that costs $100 of dollars to fully enjoy. I can't play in any of the servers...for some reason. Whenever I jump in a helicopter I immediately crash it. Enemies spot me from a mile away and kill me. If I select one piece of gear from a DLC an irritating water mark will wash over the screen often. But, after several mods I was able to construct a char with an outfit similar to one I have in real life with a gun similar to the one I have in real life... so, hell yeah. I'm recommending this game."
24407,"a nice realistic ham sandwich
"
24408,very noice4 game
24409,war crime simulator
24410,this game is really dated and incredibly hard to get into. If you like rp games thats where the games community has gone.
24411,"Well the game looks good , but I can't really say you should buy it. Auto kicked from most servers i try to join , the servers don't speak English. AI in the campaign is next level lethal, so if you want to practice on that get used to being killed out of nowhere by some dude in a bush with an AK like a laser beam ."
24412,"STOP PUTTING SALES ON THIS GAME, MANY SERVERS ARE UNDER ATTACK FROM HACKERS BACAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS GAME! STOP PUTTING UP SALES!!"
24413,so i bought this game back and i was actually hoping to have fun with it but some reason the game is choppy af
24414,good game. Very funny
24415,Loved this game and it's mods for years now.  Over 800hrs and still have fun.
24416,Literally the shittiest game I have EVER played before. I would also like to say the MilSIm community is terrible but at least there are private modules.
24417," If you like a FPS and military, or zombies or even a role play ""gta 5"" kind of thing Arma is the place to go. A lot of mods and options in combat  ( evasive combat or full fledge war scenarios.) From all the weapons you can think about and the utilities you can cram up the a** or all kinds of vehicles to attack with, Air or ground, or even water sometimes. Such an epic game and the closest you""ll ever get to realism and the fact that I've been playing since ""Arma 2 dayz mod"" Then ""Arma 3 came out its like FINALLY an upgraded version and better movement mechanics, never lost the love for it. Arma Period!, is only getting better slowly but surely.  (WARNING RECOMMENDED)!! Especially if your in the military."
24418,yes
24419,Awesome
24420,haha ak go brrr
24421,"pretty good, but servers kinda dead"
24422,Fun
24423,"If you choose to play this game I would recommend playing coop, by means Player vs AI(116.202.215.29
2302) that is the server I love to play on!"
24424,"The learning curve is STEEP and mods like ACE make the learning curve even steeper but I absolutely love this game!

Pros-
Military Simulation
Lots of customization
Mods make it a whole different game
Game play is pretty straightforwards once you get a handle on the controls

Cons-
It's ARMA
Physics can be wonky (You will come to love it all the same)
The base game is IMHO somewhat lacking (Mods make up for it completely though)"
24425,"fun game, unoptimised, still fun"
24426,its taken 1200 hours of my life i cant get back plz help
24427,fun ting
24428,it alright
24429,"Richtig Nices Game, besonders mit Mods wird es erst richtig cool. Ich habe sehr viel spa√ü daran."
24430,My all time favorite game. Great mods. Great additional content. I‚Äôve spent way to many hours playing it.
24431,"awesome, you can but it, ignore the bad opnions about the game, this game is awesome."
24432,"Way over-priced DLCs. Launcher needs upgrade for better and smoother launching
Once you over all those, this game is addictive as heck"
24433,Best Mil-Sim on the market now doubt
24434,Game is hella fun and addictive but it needs a massive dive into the engine to fix many of the bugs that plague performance
24435,"No women in it
(Not counting the alien dlc or war crime cleanup dlc)
10/10"
24436,Not what i expected. played it for 77 minutes got bored :I
24437,"Great game, wouldn't recommend for newcomers of PC's."
24438,An amazing MilSim fit for any prior service or current service military. It does a very good job of keeping you on your toes.
24439,help
24440,"i like, very good game. but there are still some bugs but everything other than that is great."
24441,the headshot only rule sucks but oh well
24442,good but bean battles is better
24443,lots of hackers
24444,Good shoots.
24445,the game is amazing i would really get it if you like realism games
24446,i love the game
24447,"good
"
24448,"I have a love/hate-relationship with this game, mostly it's filled with hate though.

You have to be some sort of an assburger to actually enjoy his game."
24449,This game runs so bad and has such a lack of purpose. Why are there 1000 keybinds for the most useless things I will never know.
24450,If your into military realism group this is the game for that.
24451,I want to fucking kill myself.
24452,the best war game the i ever see
24453,can be fun but sometimes you run into dick heads
24454,"Combat system is great !
Strong servers
Nice models
Great gameplay
I just play ARMA 3 for Jets"
24455,war game fun
24456,bruh
24457,"Probably the best war game out there.
10/10 easy"
24458,"Best shooter ever hands down. A LOT of people complain but Arma really is one of the best games ever made. The engine has its issues but it does far more than any other as of the end of 2020. The game is truly immense, not only with the huge maps great story but ALSO MODS this games has some of the best mods ever made and they are always making more. even after almost a decade this game still leads the industry. when this game was made is 2013 computers were not nearly as powerful as they are now so the engine only uses one core and so on. but with all that it does its truly amazing. i have played every shooter and this is #1 still above games like the BF series. COD is garbage, but to each there own. 

IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY; get all the DLCs its worth it they are like a buck most the time. Play with friends this isnt an easy game to learn and play. Its not for dumb people if you are a simple person this isnt for you. but if you want a game where somthing new always happens and the immersion is unbeatable and a bit of a challenge this is it.

IF YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS; feel free to add me and ill be happy to show you around the game."
24459,best game in war sim mode
24460,Liberal modhandling. Great game.
24461,Gun = fun
24462,its alright
24463,"Large scale.  Not your little maps.  Whole Islands.  

If you have not jumped in yet.  Why not?

Highest praise"
24464,"I love the game, don't get me wrong. The campaigns are amazing, but there are so many DLCs and there is only one campaign that you can get with the base game. It's kind of annoying considering I don't usually play multiplayer..."
24465,badman
24466,top
24467,"In a word PANTS!  Graphics are ok at first then you start to notice errors all over the place, the gameplay is soooooo boring, deleted it already."
24468,"its very good and on sale right now
"
24469,good
24470,arma three great game evere
24471,"I used to play this a lot more, but don't find myself able to do it anymore. Most of my time in this game has been spent in the editor making missions. The reason why i stopped playing is:
1 The framerate is really just terrible  
2. the AI are so god awful they cannot follow even the simplest commands without something stupid happening such as:

Getting stuck on a rock
Wasting all their ammo at an enemy who is completely in cover
Walking through doors and walls (Why couldn't they do that for the rock?)
Repeatedly shooting the edge of the bunker they are in because it is in between them and their target
Driving straight forward from point A to B on one road but somehow flipped their car/tank, got stuck on something, ran over friendlies, rammed another friendly vehicle destroying them both and killing everyone nearby, or even just deciding to drive the opposite direction you told them to, and ended up miles away from the combat area.

One more thing showing this games age is the way you would select a gun from the arsenal, i have about 50 variants of an M-4, but really most of them are the same just with different attachments, or different camos. This system is archaic and tedious at best. Now imagine this for every gun in the game. It's absolutely terrible, and one of the top things they need to fix in Arma 4.

Unfortunately i can no longer even recommend this on a technical standard either- if you want a good combat flight sim go play DCS, if you want good tank/ infantry gameplay go play squad. They offer more in terms of simulation and in terms of fun.

One thing this game does well is its amount of content- but not from the developers, i mean the steam workshop has thousands of mods, some of which completely change the game to something like star wars, fallout, starship troopers, ww1, ww2, vietnam, pirates, halo... you name it. When you get enough weapon mods it feels like the scene in the matrix when Neo says he'll need guns, and racks on racks fly past him. When you get enough maps this game has by far the most square miles of any game ever, spare NMS.

Unfortunately everything is showing its age. Even something like squad offers more immersion even in something as simple as shooting the .50 cal machine gun. The sound, the handling, the debris from the barrel, the tracers, bullet impacts... everything is so much better. (Not to mention the framerate!)

I'm gonna have to say no i don't recommend, because i never find myself playing this game anymore, mostly because of these listed reasons. Just wait for Arma 4 or pick up squad."
24472,"If you're reading reviews and wondering if Arma 3 can be fun solo, I'm here to say that yes, it definitely can be. Download some maps from the Steam Workshop, or the armaholic website. Next, download some mission generators like Dynamic Recon Ops, Dynamic Combat Ops, Dynamic Universal War System, Fight Back, Antistasi, or Ravage for said maps and you basically get infinite replayability.

If you need anymore convincing, just look at my playtime and remember that every minute of that has been exclusively single player."
24473,"hehe pp go boing
"
24474,Amazing game
24475,"Probably best game to play with your clan or group of friends (more than 4),or to find new friends through discord of arma 3"
24476,recomand cu respect si incredere baietii
24477,Been playing the game for 7 years and haven't got bored of it. Entertaining SP and MP. Great mission editor and amazing modding community.
24478,good
24479,very fun in editor mode  i can live out battles in my bedroom!
24480,why in god's name do i need a field manual in order to understand how to join a lobby with my friend? Every one we try to join gives us some sort of error message
24481,demanding but worth it
24482,I have PTSD from dealing with the AI's bullshit
24483,good
24484,Arm.
24485,so a good way to have fun in the game is too join a unit... im not in one b/c i havent found a good one.. but yeah its cool..
24486,I saw like 20 different stances and knew they weren't f-ing around with this one. 0.0
24487,5 hours in on the single player campaign and shits litty. everything i can ask for in a military shooter. realism. large map. customization. squad based objectives. vehicular combat. intuitive controls that are easy to remember but confusing enough to make you panic and forget in the heat of combat.
24488,Get it while its hella cheap. Great game with lots to offer.
24489,Lost both of my legs to a grenade thrown by a squadmate and now I'm crippled for life
24490,"CPU usage : below 20%
GPU usage : below 20%
Frame rate : below 20 FPS"
24491,arma good
24492,"FINAL EDIT: i would not recommend this game right now. it's not very well optimized, as you've probably heard before, maybe if you really know what you're doing you could fix it, but i don't. the game itself is fine, but it's also not really my thing. i had some fun with it but it's really just not the game for me. if you play games very casually like me, i would not recommend this game. but if realistic military shooters are for you, then get it. but be warned it does not run that well, and it runs even worse while playing workshop content. it's probably just my computer, but i dunno. also, time in the launcher counts as game time. that's the only reason i have this many hours, because i downloaded a ton of mods with my crappy internet."
24493,"Realism is off the charts, although the bots can sometimes be absolutely deadly with their accuracy"
24494,GREAT GAME!! challenging and rewarding
24495,The game is really fun because of the modding community you really should play it.
24496,hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or diehands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die hands up or die COMP OR BAN
24497,i like to shoot guns
24498,diggity dogshit
24499,"Great game 10/10 would buy again!!
if you love tactical shooters its a must have"
24500,This is still the most realistic mil sim around. Best shooter game thus far with many different features and the best part is that the mods are usually better than the campaigns so you shouldn't worry about getting the dlc cuz the mods are usually better and they're FREE
24501,good game
24502,Fun
24503,"*buys on sale cus it's cheap*
*spends 30 mins trying to work out how to get into an actual game*
*when finally in-game, runs at 2fps and controls are cancer*
*moves forward 0.0000001 inches and gets sniped from across the map*
fuck this game"
24504,good
24505,Terrible game can't even connect to the servers trash waste of money.
24506,"The vanilla game doesn't come with much content. This is a bug ridden mess sporting a 15 year old engine and made by some very lazy and griddy devs. 
The modding community is amazing and some of the awe inspiring content they've made might make this game a worthwile buy. It has definitely brought me hundreds of hours of enjoyment, many hundreds (if not thousands) of crashes and a handful of truly memorable experiences. 
Does that make this game worth your time and money?
It depends. But if i were to judge this game only on its or it's developer's merits the answer is absolutely no"
24507,lots of stuff to do and its fun
24508,its good.
24509,great milsim
24510,"topic and idea are 10 out of 10.  Presentation and functionality are awesome for a 2013 game.  I can't wait for  the developers to update this game with better graphics and renderings.  The best parts of the game are eden editor and steam workshop, free community mods."
24511,Is fun game
24512,"Really fucking boring tbh, takes about 10 years to set up and the game runs like liquid shit 2/10 game"
24513,Pretty solid
24514,"Awesome game, difficult but awesome"
24515,"fun game experienced a baby on it who repeatedly called an admin on me because me and two others were running him over with atvs he cried the whole time, 7/10"
24516,good
24517,i hate it and its so addicting
24518,"it is a really good war sim
"
24519,bad 1/2 birds fly into luke morre
24520,"Can't recommend it because of how the dlc system works. Either pirate it, wait for an extremely good sale or buy something else.

If they didn't handle dlc the way they did for a game like this, it would be an extremely good game"
24521,"So I have had a ton of enjoyment out of this game, however the reason I can't recommend it is the developers refuse to optimise the game. It doesn't matter if you are using a space age computer, it will not run smoothly. If they could get this game to run like 30% smoother and have 20% less bugs and glitches it would be amazing. But the desync in multiplayer servers, the lag, the pointless deaths, the buggy AI...Its just not worth buying anymore. I have a pretty crazy rig, and I get about 55FPS in King of the hill. Its just silly. The biggest pissoff is when the developers will release go kart dlc instead of just doing some optimisations."
24522,DOGSHIT VIDEO GAME!
24523,awesome game love the military realism
24524,best mil sim
24525,keep getting smoked by 1 foot tall bushes
24526,game good. Fun with friends. Only issue is even with a nasa computer you get fps locked and random frame rate issues. But very solid game tons of game modes and mods to choose from. Would recommend it.
24527,This is a great game and it is very fun to play with friends and also great to talk to each other.
24528,"Welcome to ARMA 3 

ive only had 39-40 hours playing this game but
holy shit it has taught me alot 

not only did i learn alot of proper procedures

but i also learned of modding a ultimate mistake i am to humanity now
i have committed numerous warcrimes on my Gucci Smart Toilet armed with 40mm autocannons
i also learned that a rock can send a plane flying 2 millions feet into the air
because P H Y S I C S

great simulator 100 out of Warcrime i will reccomend"
24529,"Its very fun
"
24530,"I quit my job to play arma 3 24/7.
I dropped off my kids at school and left them there and forgot about them to come home and play arma 3.
I left and divorced my wife to play arma 3.
I sold my house to buy a NASA computer to play arma 3.

I am now in mcdonalds, the internet is terrible but arma 3 is optimized just as bad as my internet. Therefore I can drive over a bush and fly 10 million feet up in the air. This is my life now. No Regrets.


P.S: Best game ever after 6000 hours tho you still don't get bored"
24531,"Played a couple of games, its alright"
24532,roleplay gay
24533,"Nice game. 
Still a good game, butt I would like some official DLC"
24534,GG
24535,i have a couple minutes in the game. it's OK.
24536,Without mods this game is nothing.
24537,Bruh stinky
24538,very good war game for making maps and units
24539,best game every if you have friends
24540,"Love the 2.0 update added a firing range and a new camo variant 
I think Bohemia mixed up Halloween for April fools"
24541,u need this game!
24542,Awesome combat simulator with realistic features.
24543,Good game if you like mil-sim.
24544,Word
24545,Great game but clearly outdated in 2020. Needs Engine refresh and revert back to Arma 2 baggage system to enhance mods.
24546,It's so fun to commit war crimes and blow up civi's with Rockets and Grenades And Also to run over friends and Kamikaze Planes into Civi Buildings
24547,"never play this game, why i can write a review anyway?"
24548,Great game but a little confusing for new players. overall worth buying if you like simulators.
24549,haha shoot bang fun
24550,yrea h bros
24551,10/10 just get it.
24552," TOO HARD
"
24553,"if you like this game you probably hate your life, dont buy it."
24554,bad
24555,best shooter out there
24556,hi thats a vary good game and can u do a idf mode for this game to people with not arma 3 apex
24557,haha minigun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
24558,"I think i am in love with this company, and i tell you why:

I started with dayz and explored a lot of unmodded and modded servers, after almost 2k hours i am a bit bored.
So i thought i go back in times and start with the root game.

Back in the days i had bad fps in Arma 3 and thats why i stopped playing it.
But hardware and the game engine improved a lot so i am back again.
Yes there are some clunky animations, but after a while you ignore it ;-)

As in dayz there are tons of modded servers and so much things to explore, it's amazing.
Keep up the good work :)

"
24559,yes
24560,"It's very good for people who like hardcore modern tactical military shooters, graphics are nice, and the community is pretty fun too."
24561,gonna have to say its a cool game. tore my friendship a new one though. I give it 5/10. 5 points off for my shattered friendship.
24562,O.G
24563,it is a great game but you gotta put time into it
24564,eq
24565,"Amazing game.
whats not amazing is the fact i bought the game ONE DAY before it went on sale."
24566,good
24567,is shit
24568,"I'd recommend it if it actually worked without crashing constantly, buggy mess. Otherwise p.fun."
24569,10/10 would commit war crimes again
24570,"buggy games, tends to crash and die, does not like you to have fun. communities and mods for it are 10/10"
24571,Pretty Good
24572,Been playing since the game came out and met alot of great people
24573,nice game
24574,F
24575,Best shooting mod game ever
24576,yayyyyyyyyyyyyyy
24577,not cool
24578,üíñ
24579,It is an excellent and unique game. Totally endorsing it!
24580,Pretty good
24581,Yes
24582,"Amazing game taken to the next level by mods. Don't expect smooth gameplay however as even the best hardware will only reach 30 fps depending on the scenario. Graphics are good for the year it released in.

Hoping Arma 4 will be a thing in the near future with smooth 120 fps and a graphic upgrade. Yet the most important thing will remain base mechanics and mod support."
24583,"it is a great milsim game
"
24584,"great game
"
24585,After 7 years still one of my favorite games of all time
24586,fun
24587,"Best FPS combat game ever. A simulator of combat ... ok, a bit rusty and old, but still playable."
24588,"ultra realistic shooter , cant go wrong"
24589,I ran over a body and flew over 100km from the map at the speed of over 1000KPH
24590,"7 years after release the game is still fun. 

Mods provide some very detailed weapons, maps, gear and damage models. Playing with a well organized group of players can provide many intense and enjoyable experiences that you simply won't find anywhere else. Even most of the vanilla multiplayer game modes and co-op missions are still good fun. The vanilla solo campaigns and some custom ones have been great and I still play them from time to time. The mechanics that work, which is 90% of them, are fantastic.

The main issue overall however is performance. The frame rate can vary from 15-200 depending on a variety of reasons caused by the mission at hand. There are almost no graphical tweaks or other improvements that will provide a better experience in most multiplayer matches.

If there's a military sim fan in you with an urge for something, Arma 3 can more than likely provide a fix for the said urge. Stealth, special ops, sniping, close quarters, vehicular combat etc.
Day and night, storms and bright skies, air and sea, low and high tech, small huts to cities, realism to zombies to Warhammer 40K. You just have to find what you're looking for."
24591,"The game is good but leaves a bit to be desired, the controls are fairly smooth but I like the feel of a controller. The game has plenty of features which makes the controller useless, however if you download another program you can edit the controls to various degrees of preference. With that out of the way.... The game itself without all the expansion dlc updates is far too BORING for the amount of hype it's had for me."
24592,"As much as I love this game, Bohemia's neglect, lack of communication for years, reselling of Arma assets again in DayZ, poor treatment of contract-modders, string of poor quality DLCs, and gaps of updates which add unnecessary sidecontent that introduces new bugs and fixing few/no old ones, brings me to this point.

Bohemia of today is vastly different from the Bohemia of 2011 when this game first entered Early Access."
24593,yes
24594,no
24595,It just works
24596,great sim gameplay
24597,"ŸÜŸÖ
"
24598,a-10 go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
24599,Very fun and addicting because of the difficulty and strategy required to play. Biggest downside is community is not very willing to help and explain with new players. other than that the combat and game play is superb.
24600,it ruined my life
24601,"Me:where is the guy that's shooting me?

24606,War crime
24607,"When I first bought this game I was incredibly intimidated by the sheer size of what this game could offer and uninstalled after two hours, now i'm starting to get addicted like holy shit this game even just playing singleplayer scenarios and campaigns is pure crack cocaine.."
24608,BEST MILITARY SANDBOX SHOOTER PC DESTROYING GAME EVER!!!!
24609,"movement is super robotic and glitchy, but i love it"
24610,I've played 1400 hrs... do I need to say more?
24611,If you have a PC you need to try ARMA 3
24612,shit game but its fun
24613,Cool game
24614,"This is the game for you if you like tactical games. It's awful a lot of fun, all I gotta say, I highly recommend you try this out. :)"
24615,good I guess
24616,is fun
24617,"Arma 3 was a nice before. Now I see only crappy expansions with crappy missions. Each campaign is buggy enough and the last I tried to play was Old Man. This bullshit stuck at the Install Virus and I ended without previous safe to restore to. The auto-save was overwritten. I have tried to reload and in the end I have lost all my progress I was playing for three days!

Thank you Bohemia for loosing my time! Next time when you release your next hoax expansion please sell it for 0.03 EUR, instead of 30 EUR, because that's the value of your work."
24618,Meh... It was ok. Could have had a few more hours of content.

I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking to play a solid war game, sure the graphics are a little out dated but the game play is fantastic!"
24649,Ive wasted 2k hours so id say the games alright i guess
24650,I played it a bit. It‚Äôs ok
24651,epic
24652,cuz is fun

24656,great game with gream simulation
24657,"Its so detalised, about everything. Weapon choose, optics, silencers, granades, explosives, vehicles, planes, boats/ships, tanks, injuries etc. So many game modes. I just love this game. Bought on sale. Best game i have ever played. In beggining, it is difficult to understand everything. Compass, map, navigation, radio comunication. Bet when you are getting used to it.. Amazing!"
24658,Good game
24659,definitely better than any cod or battlefield ;)

24663,some good shit
24664,Garry's mod - Military edition. *Shrug*
24665,waiting for Arma 4 and the new Engine
24666,good ptsd Sim
24667,"The game is excellent, you really feel the realism on this one, even though there are HUD and other things  that make the game feel less realistic. What good about this game is that they have a wonderful tutorial and campaigns and/or scenarios . The game have many other good ontent and you could install mod to improve your experience in this game. the steam workshop for this game have tons of mods, starting from guns, to vehicles, to characters, skins, scenarios, and many more. The communuty were fairly friendly and nice, most servers were full, at least on my region and sometimes there are events too.

The bad of this game are the game is a bit buggy without mods and some mods can make your pc laggy and  heat up your pc. So, you need faster pc to enhance your experience. You need to pay for almost all of the DLCsand some guns, vehicles, and scenarios are  locked by the DLC. Some server have DLCs  too so you couldnt play the server or  cant have the best experience in that server.

Thats it, overall the game was great and a recommended it to you all who admire game with realism in it. I could be wrong, and i could miss something but thats it. Thanks..."
24668,Awsome
24669,"I've played a lot of it, but the performance sucks so bad I can't recommend it. Exile is probably the most fun it has to offer... if you can find a decent server that still exists - which is a tall order. Either you'll have crap admins, crap mods, crap performance, or owners that refuse to make necessary changes. I've had the luxury of experiencing all of the above. I've never seen a game that has it's client performance so closely tied to server performance. Servers need to restart VERY often or expect everybody in the game to have 10 FPS. No, that's not a joke."
24670,"A great mil-sim type game that is fun once you get in the groove of it. The obvious problems in this game are overshadowed by how fun the gameplay is. It does have a hard learning curve though so, keep that in mind."
24671,"Great game, if you are on the edge of buying, just do yourself a favor and hit that purchase button!"
24672,go into multiplayer and then have my fps ripped to 10 fps. nice
24673,cool beans
24674,very good at 10fps
24675,played it a few hours. pretty good
24676,go ahead
24677,40 fps: the game
24678,good game fun game
24679,No nut
24680,Jesus Christ I don't even remember playing this game so much.
24681,"gud game
"
24682,Very nice.
24683,love the immersion totally digging this game even though im new and get kicked from lobbies cause of that factor but still love the game.
24684,Bah
24685,Its hard to find servers without mods and im not intelligent enough to figure out the whole create your own battle thing but i still enjoy the game in the few things i know what/how to do.
24686,God approves.
24687,"It's a great toybox for solo play, and a lifestyle for crazy people in online. You should be served well, whoever you are."

24694,yes cool
24695,i enjoy this game alot
24696,i love the realness
24697,"Great Game!
"
24698,great game even better with mods
24699,"Could be an amazing platform for a realistic warfare simulator but it's technically very unstable. Just getting it to work is a pain and considering how much time has passed since launch, the developers really should have fixed this by now. Unless you have a lot of patience and time to tinker with this, I'd say don't get it."
24700,"One of eh greatest games ever. With all the mods available and powerful mission editors, if you aren't having fun its your own fault!"
24701,good game
24702,"The Syrian people in the squares are raising banners for glory,
Cheering three words: Allah, Syria and Bashar.
(We are your men Bashar)
Church and mosque united and love, the title of religion
And millions of Syrians and they want no one but Bashar.
We are your men, Bashar.
The Syrian army standing in might, shook the universe and didn't get shaken (the army).
My lord, from you the might of the Syrian army.
We are your men, Bashar.
Syria, her men are Knights when they rally in the squares.
The leader Bashar will not be satisfied but by the liberation of Golan.
We are your men, Bashar.

And Sultan pasha in his times lit France with fire.
We are your men, Bashar.
And sheikh Saleh with his sons lead the revolution by his men.
And he kept his promise to his sons, Syria! The country of the free.
We are your men, Bashar.
We are the dawn of freedom and alphabet.
Syriac and Phoenician without Syria, we wouldn't choose.
We are your men, Bashar.
Say with a loud voice, we want to protect the message.
No precious or son of precious, with our souls we will protect you o' Bashar.
We are your men Bashar."
24703,"GREAT GAMEPLAY
GOOD GRAPHICS
COMMUNITY IS GREAT
OVERALL GREAT GAME"
24704,yes
24705,"When it works it's kinda good...

But only when it works."
24706,"Commit Warcrimes, ???, Profit then realise its your 60th hour playing after only 1 week"
24707,"I would say it's an awesome game but with its difficulties to play with. Next, I will be putting down what I like and dislike about it:
Firstly, Graphics:
The graphics need A LOT of work on. I know it's an old game, but come on guys.. gotta do better than that. Don't get me wrong, the graphic are OK, but there is staff like planes when crashing are just bouncing in place, death animations need a little work on. For someone that is looking to buy this, you could add a few 'mods' to fix that.
Next, the community:
It could get a little toxic, but in time, when you get to understand the game properly, you will not have a problem. 
There is 2 kinds of people in this game:
1.) The EXTREME strategist that bosses everyone around and if you crash your chopper/plane while getting to the mission, you get your head bitten off.
2.) The guy that only wants to enjoy this game after a hard day at school/college/work and has got to deal with 10 people yelling at him to get his ass to that position on the hill. 
SPECIAL 3rd PERSON: That kinda guy that just does not give a flying f... about anything and crashes every single time for the fun of it, if that's you, I love you man, you ARE MAKING MY DAY, keep doin whatcha doin.
Next, the complexity of this game:
It can be VERY hard to get used to the controls in this game, there are a couple of mods that will help you get more comfortable with 'em, but I would say it would be better to just learn everything through vanilla.
In this game, YOU, as an individual will have a lot to learn and to be fair, it is FUN! You have a HUGE range of vehicles and weapons you will have to make your way through, that's makes this game AMAZING. Another point that I want to make is that ARMA itself will never get boring and it will never let you down. Not mattering what you are doing, you will have fun while doing it in this game.
Next, servers:
You could play campaigns in single player or co-op, but I would prefer joining the servers themselves, getting to know the communities. There are LOTS of gamemodes you could pick from in the servers.
Long story short, every game has its downsides and its upsides. In principle, I highly recommend buying this game and if you want to experience it fully, I recommend buying APEX as well. 
"
24708,"Nothing on console can compare to this game, switching from console to pc playing this game was a bit of challenge for me since I have to learn keys instead of a controller, just off the one map and the tiny area I played I was impressed. Secondly the amount of weapons and attachment options you get can choose from are insane, vehicles, aircraft, etc... mad kudos to Bohemia and all the modders that put in work to make the game what it is."
24709,"Great Game Would Recommend Too Anyone Who Has Good Gaming Software Too Show This Isnt Fake Arma I CANT GO IN THIRD PERSON[Besides that its amazing with story depth ,and the sandbox mode creating stories and small too large scale battles]"
24710,One of the best games ive ever played. Better with friends.
24711,"terrible company and terrible game, bug out the yingyang and a severe reliance to solve any developer stupidity. very bad comp[any avoid all bohemia products. horrible evil company."
24712,Really good milsim game.
24713,"Great game, little poorly optimized, but at least you dont break your legs running up stairs like Arma 2. The real shine to this game comes from the mods in my personal opinion, although King of the Hill is a great game mode too!"
24714,e
24715,"With all the DLC it's a bit expensive, but in the end I think it's worth it. 

Servers are fun, lots of variety in what to do. Altis life is a bit trash imo, but King of the Hill, Exile, Invade & Annex, and Wasteland are fun as hell.

It's pretty CPU intensive, and frames tend to drop into the 20s/30s. Outside of towns, you'll probably get a solid framerate.

AI tends to be pretty broken on many levels. They can see you from 3km away with nothing but a rifle with ironsights, and slam a headshot. They can see through walls and bushes, so be prepared to just drop. 

PVP is where it's at though. And mods. Holy fuck the mods are insane. Want to have some Halo shit? Mods got you covered. Want some Star Wars? They got that too. Hell, want some 40k or fallout military action? They got these too, actively being worked on.

Overall fuckin' great experience, especially with friends."
24716,Learn who to stay in one spot for 40 minutes and get one hit by a AI who is using a weapon from world war 1. In this Epic game feel rage for real as you die over and over again trying to destory Russian Spies. HAHA A-10 GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.
24717,ALRIGHT GAME BUT GOT BORING FAST NOBODY PLAYS AND I WANT TO RETURN
24718,Very cool
24719, the game is great kinda a big learning curve tho
24720,Most realistic game to date
24721,"You're either going to have to join some servers to have fun if you're looking for a multiplayer experience. The campaign is ok though i wouldn't recommend it as I believe it's best used as a glorified tutorial. The reason I absolutely love this game is the creative sandbox. You can take part on a modern bullet filled excursion as leader or a follower depending on how you've set the game up to play out. You can design patrol missions to feel more like a mil-sim or even just place some vehicles just to fly around and explore the maps. 

Even if you don't want to create your own content or use the server lists you always have the option to download workshop creations. Every once in a while I'll download a mission that's been well received by the community and go crazy with it until I've finally completed it. Some are even on a never ending cycle which is pretty neat.

Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone that's more creative in nature. I don't have enough experience with the game to be able to tell you whether or not the server lists offer a bountiful selection of military fun but given the size of the fanbase, I don't think it'd be hard for you to find what you're looking for."
24722,"I love this game it is extremely fun to play and watch. It has not failed me yet it can also get really intense. It might be hard at first to understand but it was so worth it.
"
24723,yes
24724,"For the longest time I debated on getting Arma 3, I finally pulled the trigger but so far I have been disappointed.  Movement feels weird and there is so much in the game, it makes it complex to play.  This would be fine if public servers weren't dry (at least when I played).  If i could get my money back I would."
24725,It could be great game but it is rather DLC scam. In order to play properly you are obliged to buy more and more DLCs..
24726,Love the game
24727,10-10 GAMEPLAY!
24728,ye gud gaem shoot bad guys
24729,Best combat Sim out there.
24730,"The amount of content packed into this game is unreal. From the campaigns that can give you hours on end, to the DLC's adding more content than you'll ever want, to the public servers providing a multitudes of game modes. On top of that, the size of the Arma community is beyond anything anyone could've imagined after so many years since release. I had the pleasure of spending at least 900 of my hours dedicated to Military Simulations with the use of mods, providing me with life long friends and experiences I'll never forget.

TL;DR: Has a lot of content, very fun, memory maker. Just play it."
24731,"I don't know guys how you play it and where you find time to fix issues like freezing on map / briefing loading, whatever it does there. Problems even with standard mods installed by default. Right on the first campaign map freezing occured again and again. In the logs I see some shit like binocular model not found, failed take ammo into the inventory, 3 of 24 mods could not be loaded, etc. Looked promising, not a good experience for me after all. Had to restart windows 10 three times, back into the old times 20 years ago. And just for information, this was not a hardware performance issue. Well, good luck."
24732,"Honestly its a great game. Well worth the money and the more you play, the more likely you are to buy the expansions. Don't give up on it early, it'll take you some time to understand the game well enough to properly enjoy it. There is a lot there to absorb and understand. But you gotta invest in it."
24733,"fun
"
24734,ok!
24735,God Tier
24736,"I guess it's ok.

Mods do make the game though, and there is a strong mod making community still making great contributions to the game."
24737,Amazing game! Amazing in every aspect. I'm a dcs pilot and I was still impressed with many flight aspects. The graphics are beautiful and crisp. Only wish I would have found it sooner. :)
24738,GUD
24739,fun
24740,10/10 very realistic war simulator it actually gave me real ptsd and permanent 1000 yard stare from trying to get the game to run at a decent fps
24741,"Hands down the best military simulator I've ever played. Insanely detailed, not the easiest to learn the controls, but once you do it's a blast. And the community are super knowledgeable and helpful. Great game, 10/10"
24742,awesopme gasmes
24743,"tactical,fun with friends and for 7 years graphics hold up very well. but i think its time for arma 4..."
24744,FUN?#
24745,i9 10900k avg 11 fps good game
24746,"Pros:

Freaking stupid realistic
Awesome teamplay

Cons:

24754,"There is nothing else like it

HE autocannons are a meme"
24755,"better with friends

sucks playing alone"
24756,fun things can happen in this cool game
24757,"As the game's description implies, Arma 3 truly is a ""massive military sandbox"". Most of the DLCs are solid and include additional campaigns and units. In addition, there is a fairly active modding community that offers a lot of great additional content adding maps, factions, multiplayer modes, and plenty more. Would you like to recreate WWII battles? See the Cold War go hot? There are mods and DLC for that. Want to have the US Army fight Isis on the Moon? You can make that happen.

Multiplayer is what draws most people to Arma 3, but sandbox fans like me can spend hours in the included editor, dropping squads, vehicles, and emplacements in real time to set up both realistic and wildly unrealistic situations. Using Zeus you can quickly set up small squad vs squad engagements, or massive combined arms operations. Opposition proving too tough? Just spawn clouds of A-10s so thick that the sky blackens and fills your headphones with BRRRRRT, while the ground ahead (and your frame rate) are ground into dust. The only limits in this game are one's imagination and PC specs. 

For the cons, Arma 3 is not the most well optimized game and does better when run on machines with higher single core clock speeds.  However - I run the game on a Ryzen 2600/2060 RTX and 16GB of decently fast DDR4 and unless I am dealing with hundreds of units and vehicles all firing at the same time I find my FPS is in an acceptable range. Multiplayer games are a non-issue  here since almost all of the heavy lifting is done on the server. A lot of the optimization does also come down to how responsibly you choose to perform garbage collection (removing dead/unused assets from the scenario), whether it's done by hand in Zeus or via scripting. 

The AI, while fairly advanced for all that is being asked of it, can be quite dumb sometimes and for more complex maneuvers often need to be literally told  how to do certain things (see: way-points and/or scripts) - like driving in an orderly fashion to form convoys, or garrisoning inside buildings. There is also nothing major in the way of an AI ""commander"" although the great ALiVE mod and others offer that functionality and tons more if you so desire.

The cons are far, far outweighed by the positives. If realistic FPS and war simulation games appeal to you, Arma 3 should already be in your library. If you like sandboxes, base building, survival games, coop, PVP - get this game and prepare to sink many hours into it."
24758,not worth all the dlc
24759,"The top of military conflict games. I've been playing this on a non gaming PC and in ran well, haven't had any problems. Can't wait till  I upgrade my PC ! Highly recommend for sure."
24760,I love arma 3 so much because for so long ive wanted a military game that was realistic so i got arma i love it have fun with other people this is the game to get if you want a realistic shooter. :)
24761,One of the more realistic Military Sim games out there.
24762,"its nice.
"
24763,I have played way over 711 hours..The answer is totally yes.... If you like sims.
24764,is pretty okay
24765,FUT

24767,jogo muito bom e divertido
24768,Thomas Simulator
24769,awesome game.. been playing since it was released
24770,Hard to master but hella fun when you get into it. gunfights slow and tend to take thinking. really good to play if you want to have a change of pace from modern shooters.
24771,it's ok
24772,"Arma 3 in 2020 is still as enjoyable as back in it's prime. Mods are still being released, content is being developed, and players are still playing. Can easily be played in single or multiplayer. 

I last played this game in 2016, and the graphics still look great."
24773,very good game
24774,"pog game, not as good as Arma 2"
24775,"Welp, I've put over a thousand hours in Arma 3. I think I can safely say I got my money's worth in Arma 3."
24776,"E
"
24777,game good
24778,"If you are looking for a game with endless gameplay features and a great modding community this is right for you. The base game has very large maps which allow for a variety of missions that you can make using the ""Zeus"" feature which allows you to set down a variety of things from vehicles, ai, and even objects to make for a great time."
24779,"As with ALL Bohemia Interactive games, this is a buggy mess that crashes and corrupts it's own files to the point that a full uninstall/reinstall can't repair it. Unless you get this for free, and have a pc you can hard reset often, don't bother. the same goes for the equally worthless DayZ standalone."
24780,Unplayable shit. Glad that i bought it for 6 euros only. Probably going to refund this crap.
24781,k
24782,"its a great game, if you're looking for realstic game grafics, its great."
24783,Countless hours of fun especially in the Strayagaming Invade & Annex multiplayer server. Haven't been able to put this game down ever since I started and I have no plans on stopping anytime soon.
24784,ada
24785,Loads of fun. Find a good unit and it will get even better.
24786,"Best game so far, has a lot to offer and is fun to play.

Update: Still very fun and exciting."
24787,Very fun games it is hard at first but as soon as you are used to the control its very inclusive and very fun.
24788,Its Pretty ok
24789,"This games fantastic.  Great for small groups and large, great for PVE and PVP.  Good for those that love the strategy AND tactics of combat, with sniping being... well, sniping and not just CQC but 20 feet further.  Tanks, planes, combined arms, etc.  Casual or serious, this is probably the best shooter game of the decade.  Nothing comes close to the level of customization and fun."
24790,This expansion has an ok story not much combat but it will randomly delete your saves. Do not get this unless you plan to do a full play through in one sitting.
24791,idk
24792,fun gayme
24793,unfortunately this is a try to connect to a game and stay in it without battleeye crashing simulator more than it is a milsim.
24794,its ok
24795,this game is booty
24796,"its good
"
24797,Good military game
24798,a great battle simulator
24799,"So it's now an older game with its faults, but yeah. Definite recommend, just know that you'll mod it to hell and have every moment wondering why some of the mods work and others don't. But I've never spent more time in a game in multiplayer"
24800,fat ball no lie
24801,Just the best Survival game
24802,If there are many players then the FPS decrease massively from 5-20 fps on my pc in multiplayer games like Invade and annex or King of the hill plus Arma seems to have no server for south asia so I play on european or American servers with ALWAYS above 200 ping and ranging 200-400 but the game is good in other areas.

24805,"Very realistic ballistics. Excellent gameplay, decent graphics. Do some research on this one. If you like realistic, immersive, and strategic games look into this. Also, the workshop is the best for this. Tons of shit there."
24806,Need a super computer to run this and good luck trying to remember all the controls let alone it has tons of lag and bugs.
24807,this game is trash i cant even playing it without it making me put a jpeg file and i dont even know how this game is the worst please make it fucking easyer
24808,Great a10
24809,"The new king of clunky military sims that try to scale way past their budget.

Technical issues aside I do love it and recommend it despite its issues, which can be glaring."

24826,Amazing Game
24827,Shooty shoot the bad guys but also run to them a lot which take a lot of time but still fun to shooty shoot

24832,Funny A-10
24833,shit
24834,Arma 3 needs a refresh to bring it up to the latest DLC S.O.G.  besides the enhanced movements and advance mods of repelling and others need to be incorporated into the game it is still fun to get with a group of guys and figure out ways to over come the obstacle that are stopping you from taking your objectives.  Meet great people all around the world with like wise views and different views but still able to discus them not like my home country anymore.  Now other improvements that could made to make Arma 4 the realism of the weapons and the ammunition as far as effective ranges and damage ability of the ammunition. example a shot gun flechette is not going to be deadly or do much damage at 200 meters or 300 meters
24835,"Arma 3 kept crashing on me, but I was playing on my old computer. I will probably play this on my new computer that can handle the game and change out the review once I do so. So far I have played Squad. Which I heard was a standalone mod from this game, although I am not completely sure about that. But if the experience is the same as Squad, I am sure it is just as enjoyable."
24836,Its great don't play it
24837,lit
24838,"7 years from original release, I can finally recommend a playthrough of the ARMA 3 campaign. However, you need to install a lot of mods not only to try and bring the gameplay up to modern standards, but also the visuals. Framerate is still a major problem in 2020. Out of the box, this game is a no-go unless you have a supercomputer. I was able to tweak object view distance with mods to hit 50-60 fps as normal for walking around on foot. Flying, the framerate can drop to 30, and that's acceptable. Definitely a CPU bound game. I noticed an improvement in smoothness of the game when overclocking from 4.0 Ghz to 4.8 Ghz (i7-4790k). Hope this info is helpful."
24839,"buy this game it is very nice Takes some time to get used to but it is very cool.
"
24840,Top-notch.
24841,woot
24842,DECENT
24843,Made me pee my pants a little... so it's overall a good game
24844,love the game
24845,Arma 3 is an amazing game made by amazing people. The game is very fun. i recommend it for anyone who likes mil-sim games. It also has a crap ton of mods so check the mods out too.
24846,its very fun to play and playing with the editor is really fun to mess with
24847,"shit game 
"
24848,"It's a fun game to play with some mates or with people on a server, which is how you get the most out of it. Tons of mods as well so it can get tailored to be more realistic for example. Worth trying if you like a bit more hardcore and strategic than most shooters. Just aim to find a gamemode or mod/mods that you like and get some mates or find a server to play it on to get the most of it."
24849,It's a cool game
24850,fun.
24851,"This is not a game for kids... or anyone else that wants to be spoon fed to the vinish.  This game is hard, it took me a week to even begin to understand all the hot keys and control's.  as for tactics... im still learning.  You will die very fast if you run out into a field with your shot gun hoping to doom game style your way to victory.  this is a very strategic game, and if you want a combat strategic style game id recommend.  also great editor."
24852,.
24853,is good
24854,Fantastic game
24855,a 10 go brrrt
24856,its horrid
24857,Very fun if you got a group of buds to play with!
24858,"The laggiest and glitchiest piece of shit that I can never stop playing. I love ArmA 3 and all other Bohemia projects, because they are the true multiplayer FPS equivalent to a Dark Souls game."
24859,"This is one of the best military games I've played. I would strongly recommend this game if you love games that get into great detail and requires team work of all kinds. This game offers months of fun from campaigns such as capture the flag, king of the kill, escape the island, or a game mode I love called Zeus, or even warlords. This is one of the most realistic military games I've played with loads to remember and do. You gotta know all kinds of things to help communicate with your team such as compass bearings or your exact location on a map using grids, you also got to have a lot of patience cause the game can be slow at times when your walking from point A to B and there about 10 miles apart. The game is expensive with way to many DLC's but the money is worth it. The games graphics are amazing, better than gta in my opinion. The game runs very smooth if you have a good computer. But online servers tend to lag a lot more depending on where it's at. The community can be very helpful at times and usually are willing to help if your new, of course there is quite a few toxic players but if you stick with good people or friends you meet, the game is amazing and you tend to forget those players. Over all I would strongly recommend the game if you love strategy and have some patience."
24860,nice
24861,"I had been playing ARMA 2 for a long time, this was the update that I really had hoped for. Very immersive gameplay. There is a huge learning curve to the game. But it is very satisfying once you get in a groove with it."
24862,"Very good game that mimics what real military and war is like. However, to get the best experience from the game, you will more than likely want to get workshop mods (for enhancing and adding things to the game)."
24863,"Game released in 2013 and it still has just as many bugs as it ever did. The old man mission is total trash and a rip off from FarCry but in Armas buggy game engine. The voice acting is beyond terrible and the AI as retarded as ever. UI just as clunky as day 1. When i received the final achievement for completing Old Man scenario it said that only 0.1% of total players have this, goes to show you no one is finishing this buggy garbage."
24864,I have ptsd now
24865,cool kidz game
24866,"Wait, there is multiplayer in this game?"
24867,very yes
24868,only play anti-statis - arma 3 is shite
24869,Just get it.
24870,"with arma 2.0 I think you should wait for arma 4 still

24877,Okay Grish
24878,"hands down one of the best MILSIM games  created,  while i dont have the 10's of thousands of hours like many do in this game ( because i play many other games and have a life :P  ) ARMA III will always be my goto for full out MILSIM Combat"
24879,love this game
24880,ARMA 3 is my favorite for being moddable. Mods everywhere.
24881,Grab your friends and go make some tactical mistakes! I can't think of a more frustrating way to spend time with friends and have some hilarious stories to tell to people who don't play Arma.
24882,"assuming you can get past the first boss, this game is great!"
24883,"ya i like it, it has a great community too"
24884,"i once got my car thrown 30 feet in the air
10/10 physics"
24885,Amazing
24886,Its a good game
24887,yes i would recommend to others and everyone else
24888,yes
24889,"Friend accidentally handcuffs me, tries to find the button to undo it while accidentally placing a c4(or some kind of explosive) on the ground. We wonder what the beep sound was but don't pay much attention to it. Ok finally he manages to untie me. We walk about 15 meters away and suddenly hear a explosion exactly from position we were seconds ago. What the fuck?

The only thing i remember about this game when we played it like 2 years ago.
Someday i'll return to this masterpiece."
24890,its neat
24891,"I don't see why you shouldn't buy this game, it really is something. It took me about 10-15 mins to convince a friend of mine to buy it, after that we installed mods and destroyed some terrorists while flying a AH-1Z and listening to Ram Ranch.

Audio is meh, but mods make it better
A lot of different game modes and players
God the workshop is good
If you prefer an even more realistic game, you should try to get in a milsim unit

Optimization suffers. My GPU is about 30-40% in-game, and cpu sits at 50%.

A really fun game with or without friends, don't see why you shouldn't get it

Update. As you can see this game is worth every penny. 350gb of mods and I can play absolutely anything I want in it, the editor gives you insane control over your missions and so many mods you will lose yourself in them. The only negatives are the poor performance, I dont see why bohemia cant switch out the game engine (Like they did with DayZ)"
24892,PogChamp
24893,is simulator yes very real goodier physic
24894,arma 4 please
24895,Such a good game and some what realistic
24896,Soooo good. You must play.
24897,i really like new version of operation flashpoint
24898,"You like pew pew 'murica gun bois with all the memes? 
With Arma 3 realistically simulate the true military experiance with features such as -
Drunk Assholes from around the world you have to work with (experiance other cultures!)
Mind numbing boredom as you awake OPORDS (attention to detail and patience building!)
And ass-clenching action that freaks you out as you return fire to targets that you have no idea the location of"
24899,so much ability to tailor the battlefield to your own preference. Hyper realistic with excellent mod support.
24900,amazing
24901,"It's a great game, especially when the AI phase through walls"
24902,"Ill start with the negatives;
Awful performance, the average PC runs this game at 30 fps with lowest settings.

Everything costs ADDITIONAL money. Want to use that gun? $10 please. Want to sit in a tank and not even drive it? $10 please.

The graphics are awful, however thats fine because the map is huge.


Now for the few positives;

- Attention to detail 
- Fun with friends"
24903,.
24904,Its very realistic and is a very good game
24905,"an amazing game no regrets of buying it it is really worth every cent

24906,nice game about war simulator
24907,"THIS FRACKING GUY MADE ME INSTALL 200 GBS OF MODS AND WE PLAY 5 MINUTES THEN DIE AND CHANGE MISSION TO DOWNLOAD ANIME MODS, I HATE THIS GAME WITH A FIERY PASSION, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE FRIEND, I  WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN."
24908,"Friend suffered an episode of PTSD yesterday, started seeing dead people who weren't there. 10/10 would recomend"

"
24912,"You'll die if you drive down hills too fast. You'll spend hours marching too and fro, only to end up in a thirty second gun battle. 10/10 masochism simulator. If you enjoy realistic gun fighting with a lot of bugs and an insanely active modding community that makes up for any shortfalls that Bohemia has, here you go."
24913,i have not yet played it but seems very foon
24914,fgh
24915,"its fun\
"
24916,realistic
24917,"YES its EXPENSIVE but if you get the main game and the apex DLC you'll have the tanoa map and game modes with it. Give it some time to learn the key-binds and the amount of control you have over your character. After a while you will see how its much more realistic and tactical then......... other games that aim for that.
Give it a chance and you WILL be happy"
24918,Runs really bad. Have to play on low settings. Really boring and complicated.
24919,fun.
24920,great game cant wait for ARMA 4
24921,"Probably my favorite tactical shooter. There is a very large amount of depth in this game, and the experience is better with friends, probably, I don't have any.

However, I did get with a few groups, and had an absolute blast. The only issue with this is that people can want you to be a bit more dedicated to a group than you'd like to be on an army sandbox toy on your glorified calculator."
24922,"IS GOOD. YOU, PLAY NOW."
24923,Great game without mods but even better with mods
24924,it good
24925,yes
24926,The tactical realism and fish AI
24927,it is good
24928,Great game! So much to do in it that its overwhelming.
24929,Other then arma being a bit outdated and broken it‚Äôs still a fun game. Honestly I‚Äôd give it a 4/5 on functionality. But with it being fun I‚Äôd give it a 5/5 cause the bugs are funny
24930,"Recommended, but you need a good PC because these devs don't know what optimization means."
24931,p
24932,gud
24933,Unoptimized garbage
24934,really realistic
24935,Wipeout gau go brrrrrrrrr
24936,"I enjoy this game some problem i usually run into just with multiplayer is you wont usually find a good military roleplay server unless your part of a specific unit which you can find if you look also many of the official servers have dlc and this brings me to another thing i dont like all the dlc that include stuff that should be base game for $10 each too jets, helicopters, tanks, and marksman should not be a dlc but if you can find a large server or a group to play with you can easily have lots of fun with this game using no dlc and some mods."
24937,"This game is truly brilliant. The sheer variety and possibility that this game presents is just wow. The base game, no DLC, no mods kept me going for months and the Eden Editor contributed to that. If you don't know what Eden is, essentially, you create your own scenarios and ops you can play singleplayer, multiplayer or with your mates. Then you have mods, which give you literally a million times more things to play with, from WWI to zombie apocalypses to Halo mods - All it takes is clicking the download button and you have so much more to enjoy. Then you have the DLCs, my favourites being Apex and Contact which both provide a new campaign which continues on from the base game's campaign and are equally just as fun.

I cannot say how much I recommend this game."
24938,good
24939,"Amazing game, 10/10. Love it."
24940,Game good.
24941,Great!
24942,I love everything about this game. My absolute favorite PC game.
24943,"for every fan of serious and very realistic military games Amra 3 is just perfect.
If just exploiting the buggy engine or just breaking the geneva convention several times Arma 3 is just perfect for every scenario"
24944,/
24945,"Gave me PTSD, from retarded teamates who don't know how to use a fucking compass to braindead CAS fighters who don't know the definition of ""Danger close"". Or maybe the all too common megalomaniac 9.3 mm LMG user who believes the best way to approach any gunfight is to fire an entire magazine with little concern about things such as ammo or accuracy. Some people say the controls are complicated but don't worry, you will know them by heart after getting asked by new players 6 gorillion times a day ""How do I X"" and will play like a seasoned veteran in no time. And after more than 1000 hours, out of which about 80% were playing as a sniper in various missions and gamemodes, you will finally understand why most ghillie missions out there are basically 100% accurate, after all, you could be sitting in a plain open field with no cover or concealment, have an entire squad pass right in front of you, unload about 20 magazines, yet no one will spot you (that also includes MP). 10/10 would play again."
24946,"This game is fun, flying helicopters is hard and I always crash but what's even harder is the fact that I can't even see enemies when they shoot at me, be careful of that."
24947,got banned with less than 30 mins play time didn't even get to the menu part lmfao
24948,"I have never felt more like a bad ass since I've seen a tank fly by my head at mach 5 with people screaming for god inside of it while getting shot at.

Made me really feel like I was at war"
24949,inadvertently the most pro-war game i have ever played
24950,"great game always get my adrenaline rushing

24951,"It's not so fun at first, but then when you join servers that do RPG, and like movie type stuff. Game goes crazy"
24952,"HORRABLE GAME LITTERAL GARBAGE SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM MARKET AND a3 LAUNCHER SUCKS DICK

24953,"1/10, only explored 2% of the game's content, smh"
24954,"Wonderful game, most of my time went to the ""LIFE"" rpg although the other modes that are more militaristic are also quite fun. Definitely worth the purchase."
24955,"Super fun game for Milsim/Military fanatics like myself, definitly not for people who just go into FPS but I love this game Milsim units are a definite suggestion"
24956,trash
24957,"Very realistic military simulator. Great experience with friends (over 20 hours played with friends so far) and a great, vibrant modding community that really makes the game better. Multiplayer hosting (port forwarding) is easy and provides a really good experience, unlike other games."
24958,Its super fun and really tactical i also really enjoy the sandbox mode to just mess around
24959,The controls are a bit weird but overall a great game.
24960,.
24961,"When I first installed this game, it was a few weeks after it was released in 2013, and let me tell you, the game back then needed a LOT of work to live up to it's name... the game genuinely felt incomplete.
So, after a few weeks of messing around with mods from armaholic and experimenting offline, I dropped A3 and went back to ArmA 2.

Well, it's been 7 years and a lot has changed since those days, too many updates to count, steam workshop support, the eden editor, and a bunch of DLC, just to name a few.
This game as it was released wasn't worth the 60$ they were asking at the time, but today, it's not only worth the 30$ they ask now, but it's still worth that 60$ in my opinion.

Had this game been released in the state it is now, back then, I'm confident it would've competed against GTA V for the best game of 2013, and ArmA 2's servers would have dried up a lot quicker than they actually did.

However it should be noted, while they no longer have just 2-3 helicopters, no planes, and only a handful of infantry weapons, you're still probably going to need a few basic mods to enjoy the full ArmA experience. Keep in mind I have over 300 mods, but these are the most essential in my opinion;
CUP - brings back remastered versions of the ArmA 2 units and maps which is necessary because... well the vanilla ones kinda suck.
RHS - these are sort of the default ""modern military"" unit/equipment packs, if you've seen any YouTuber play this game, they were probably using content by RedHammer Studios, you'll need Armed Forces of the Russian Federation(AFRF) and US Armed Forces(USAF) for the basics, and then there's two more packs that add additional weapons and units for diversity.
FIR - has made some of the best aircraft I've seen for a game, RHS has a few and they're okay, but FIR specializes in aircraft, so his stuff is all top quality.
If you're into WW2, don't forget to check out IFA3 and Faces of War.
And zombie fans will be happy to hear DayZ's influence on this game continues to live on, as there have got to be literally thousands of custom missions for the Ravage zombie survival mod.

The only issues I have are, the game is still extremely taxing on my PC with more complex missions, and the multiplayer can be a bitch to figure out if you don't have exactly the right combination of mods and DLC to join a match.
Overall: 9/10
(My 2013 rating if you want to know probably would've been a 6/10)"

24981,"After sinking a few years of my life into this moshpit of a game i can safely say that Arma3 is one if the best multiplayer sandbox games ever made. The multiplayer aspect keeps this game alive, the single player campaigns with the dlc included ones are forgetable and at best sub-par. The modding community is strong in this game so much so thst I would dare say it gives Garry's Mod a run for its money. Ranging from weapon packs, to units, to vehicals and outfits, and even mods that add a more realistic spin onto this already semi realistic mil sim game. I can say with confidence that you can find a community with a mod list that you enjoy. Stuff ranging from WW2, Star Wars, and even Warhammer 40K, this game is in no way a dying or dead gamr. With frequent updates (all be it small ones that dont often change alot) Bohemia Interactive are invested in this game until its lifespan cones to an end. I would recommend this game and give it a 8/10."

You guys don't know that? U.S.A. is the most evil country in the world, killing people and robbing oil and money everywhere. They don't create siht but steal just like what Tomas Edison did , who steals Tesla's copyrights.

Helping the U.S.A. to jerk off and hold their dciks in ""Bohemia Interactive""'s mouth must be so great.

25025,yes
25026,"Gotta say, this game is pretty fun for being something from 2013. And honestly, I'm surprised that the devs are even still updating it. At the time of this writing, they are planning yet another community made DLC. Even without mods, there's a lot here. The Eden Editor was a little complex for me to begin with, but I'm starting to be OK with it now. When it comes to mil-sims, there isn't much better. The guns are well made and the AI system, while buggy sometimes, is decently realistic. Keep in mind, this is a little more of a hardcore game than most. There'll be some long recon sometimes or extremely well hidden enemies that you have to wait on. Overall, highly recommend. The price is a little steep, though. I would recommend to wait for a sale to pick it up with DLCs and then pick it ALL up or else you'll be missing out."

25044,arma 3 is one of my favorite sandbox games out there. if you dont like somehting find a mod (there is one for like everything).
25045,I wish I could report how good this game is on the Mac - but then that would require me being able to actually play it with the intended peripherals! I mean... if you can't use a mouse in this game then the whole damn thing is pretty useless - and I spent a lot of money to get the core game and a number of add-ons. All in all I'd have gotten more enjoyment setting light to the cash! Checking out the self-help websites to find fix has been of no help at all! Waste of time!
25046,"Wonderful Game.
With the right servers and Friends to play with, this game is limitless!
A game that births life to others!
With large scale maps, limitless mods and customisation, fun can be had for a very long time.
Highly recommend getting this game in 2020, to prepare for Arma 4!"
25047,Game is alright I guess.
25048,good game but hard to get the hang of
25049,Haha War crimes go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
25050,Lot's of replayable gameplay.
25051,The awesome community really makes this good game great...
25052,so fun realistic
25053,this is the only game where you can nuke lego men and airstrike a furry convention while the combine do the nae nae on a nato soldiers corpse
25054,I think it is a good game at the core BUT it is one of those that you really need all of the dlcs for it to be good and you need some friends who are good at it but over all it is a good game and i do suggest that you go to drewski's discord for the friend part
25055,"if you love making your own custom military battles, this is the right game for you.

25056,nice

MODS"
25061,"An incredibly fun game but to get the full experience you definitely need to join a unit,
Mods are essential too"
25062,"I've been a fan of this series of games since the Operation Flashpoint days.  So much improvement since then!  It's not a run-n-gun game but it's not so terribly hardcore MILSIM as to be unenjoyable.  While the devs have provided a good game experience, their decision to make the game so extensively moddable was brilliant.  The community breathes new life into this title even seven years after its release.  Keeps me coming back for more.."
25063,"This game can be buggy but if u find a unit with people u like and play with them, this game can bring the best moments. i highly recommend it to people looking for a more complex PvE military shooter"
25064,"I should of bought Squads instead I have this game which lacks populated servers and when there is people on them, They only want you to VC and kick you if you don't."
25065,"fun and really great with a group

25068,If your a milsim geek its the whore's tis for video games!!!!! Its to battle field as microsoft X is to ace combat!!!!!!!
25069,"I found it amazing, with a wide variety of mods to it. I like the free story, even though it could've been longer. 10/10"
25070,Nice Game
25071,"best game ever

25072,Gamer.
25073,t
25074,the most favourite games
25075,"This game is immensely popular, but you have to understand it's the community-created content that people actually enjoy.  Quite a few games create a basic framework of game mechanics and then depend on modders to fill out the rest of the content.  Arma is relatively inexpensive, so the total lack of actual content you get with the base game can be forgiven.

. . . except for the fact the framework the developers made is almost unplayable.  I am not a skilled FPS player by any means, so if I die because I made a stupid tactical decision, that's just part of the game.  If I die (over and over and over again) because the controls are physically impossible to do on a keyboard or I try to ""climb over"" a fence and instead phase into it portal-style and can't move (providing the enemy a stationary target) then that is something else entirely.  This is one of those games where 5% of your deaths will be due to enemy fire, and 95% will be due to bugs.  Not much fun.

If they update this game with actual working mechanics in the future, I may change my review.  But at the moment this is one more game where the devs receive all the money and rely on the mod community to fix the game, for free.

As a silver lining, I do like how they incorporate realistic military tactics and procedures - even pathfinding using the map is a fun puzzle in itself.  But again, if you have to avoid taking cover because you might end up super-glued to that cover and need to restart the mission. . . the path finding doesn't really matter does it?"
25076,"yes
"
25077,"If you can survive the terrible menu system, teleporting suicidal AI civillians walking into the line of fire, BAD single player campaigns, and other bugs, you will find this game great fun to play with friends online."
25078,"Great game even for solo play, great for coop playing with community. The vast amount of mods and add-ons makes it impossible for you to not find suitable way of playing. Plenty of DLC but even without them you can enjoy the game for very long hours."
25079,Everything is trying to kill you...
25080,"Very expensive, i don't think that the DLC's are worth it, but the game itself is."
25081,Quite possibly the funniest game of all time. There's something deeply comical about a middle-aged British man screaming his lungs out after I mow him down in my IRN BRU custom hatchback.
25082,Fun
25083,"nice funny game i like alhadbar part (:

25089,"Served as a infantry rifleman though only for a few months. The game feels realistic though the sight bobbling appears a bit exaggerated sometimes. The only a few number of wishes are that the objects could be more interactive. The physics seems not to work with every objects in the game. The sound loudness of the rifles and grenades are greatly under-tuned than the real life. But, this is a game and no one would want to be deaf. Otherwise, it feels very realistic. ACE mod adds more realistic feeling especially with ballistics. If you are looking for a realistic military simulation, this is the one."

Yes, just stick to modes like King of The Hill, Invade and Annex, Warlords, ETC. If you play RTS games For example Men of War, is this game for you? Yes, you'll have a lot of fun in the editor and a lot in Zeus. In reality this is a sandbox game made for everyone but some types of players outnumber the others."
25112,full of neckbeards who roleplay like furries
25113,Really challenging and A lot of Thought out Bits and Bobs. Only thing that bothers me about this game is the extreme Sway of the weapons and the constant running that takes forever because you clearly can't run that far or long but the rest of your team (AI) are well ahead leaving you out of formation and always late to a gun fight.
25114,"I've played Arma 3 for almost 800 hours and i love the game to death, recommend this game to anyone but it does have a big learning curve."
25115,still relevant in 2020

25122,With Mods and the game itself you can do whatever you want for as long as you want. I love doing my own WW2 battles on Zues editor
25123,"The amount of options, mods and game modes can leave you having fun for hours. I would highly recommend this game."
25124,"I've played this game through multiple times. I have to say that it's one of my favourites.
The single player aspect of the game is my main focus because i don't generally play online.
the expansions, downloadable maps and missions is what make this game whatever you want it to be.
Playing the original ARMA game set in the 80's within upgraded engine of ARMA 3 is especially awesome and nostalgic for those who are a fan of the series and i would highly recommend it.
There ARE a few bugs still present where a mission can get stuck and can be extremely frustrating when you can't progress to finish a mission through no fault of your own. But this is probably the only drawback that I can think of.
When the game is 7 years old (currently 2020), it still looks fantastic and does have a lot of complexity to it to keep things interesting. But you can still keep things simple if that's what you're into, until you get used to the game mechanics and can take on things in a much more controlled way at a later stage."
25125,"enjoy being shot in the head after running around for 30 minutes looking for combat

25136,good game
25137,Super fun game. if you like anything army/action this is for you
25138,Gay game
25139,things happened
25140,Rip my high school evenings/weekends playing this shit game. 10/10 Money well spent.
25141,.
25142,Very cool and realistic simulator
25143,BRILLIANT
25144,"Best played with a regular group who can design missions or play Zeus (game-master), but due to the sandbox nature and extensive modding options, the game supports a wide variety of activities. Some single-player is available, but the real core of Arma is a co-operative team (whether that's against other players or the AI).

The game is a bit long in the tooth, but despite being old it can have poor performance on even first-rate hardware, depending on the complexity of the scenario. That being said, twitch shooting is not really what the game is about, and unless things are really going sideways you'll usually have sufficient frames to have a good time.

Arma isn't really an action shooter, it's more about teamwork, coordination, and good planning. If you're after a jump-in-and-play high-speed game with excellent gunplay, try Insurgency or Battlefield instead. Arma does offer realistic ballistic simulation, but the movement and physics are still quite clunky. That's fine for what Arma is, but if you're looking for something smoother and faster, this ain't it."
25145,"Fantastic game with potentially infinite re-playability.  TONS of creative player-made content.  I would only warn people that isn't your average FPS... it requires thoughtful strategy before entering an engagement, you can't just run in guns blazing as a one man army.  The game can even be somewhat intense and almost terrifying at times with a fear of losing your squad and/or all your equipment and progress (when playing persistent games).  Absolutely love this game and its huge scale."
25146,Amazing game. If you are looking for a hyper realistic military shooter than this is the game for you. The DLC are amazing too!
25147,nice
25148,Fun
25149,"Decent mil sim.  Kind of fun, except you cant jump or climb... so that sort of sucks..."
25150,"buy it, and play roleplay server
i prefer olympus"
25151,a game where people who dont enlist can commit virtual war crimes without the risk of standing trial for actual war crimes
25152,"For convenience, I'll be splitting this review into several points: the main base game, the modding community/multiplayer, and the DLCs. I believe each of the points will make it easier to understand why I love this game so much. I don't believe this game serves any single purpose but multiple.

The main game on its own is... limited at best. You get a pretty full campaign, but it is plagued by terrible AI either quick-shooting you or mentally unable to fully utilize basic motor functions. It's frustrating, to say the least, but I like the story for what it's worth. For a military simulator, Arma 3 does not fall too short in that aspect for sure simulating explosive fragmentation and bullet ballistics. Sure the base medical system is one of its weak points, but there aren't many games that fully simulate so many aspects of combat. The true ""base"" fun I've had relies on the game's editor. Ever since the Eden update, mission making has only become stronger and easier to do. I've had more fun coming up with scenarios to play with my friends than playing the actual game. It's a military sandbox the fun comes with what you can make. However, if you are still looking for something beyond mission making or military for that matter, the multiplayer will surely supplement it.

The only other game I know which exceeds the number of communities of Arma is Gmod. You have servers for full-on milsims, RP servers, or just pure PVP KOTH. If you can't find value in the single-player, the online community is a good place to find it. Besides the community servers, the workshop is huge. It fully encapsulates the meaning of a sandbox. Whatever you want to make, there's probably a mod out there that can help. Not to mention mods like Ace which expand the game's complexity 10-fold. If you love games like Garry's Mod, Ravenfield, or anything like those. I highly recommend you try out Arma.

For the DLCs, I'll be quick on each of them as I expect to write a review for each separately later on. The amount of content for each one varies but if you're looking to pick and choose, I can group them into several groups. If you're looking for a single-player experience, the IDAP DLC, Tac-Ops DLC, Tanks DLC, and Contact DLC all expand on the single-player story in one way or another. The Apex DLC can count as well since you can play those scenarios solo. Each DLC (-Tanks DLC) explores a different way to play Arma single player. The IDAP DLC focuses on story/world-building; to me, it has the best story in Arma 3. The Tac-Ops DLC explores multi-role operations and is based on immersion. They are built to make you feel like a cog in the war machine influencing other squads in various operations. The Contact DLC brings true open-world scenarios and is akin to something like the Farcry series (but miniature in scale). The Apex DLC is a Co-Op campaign, nothing too special besides being very cinematic for a multiplayer scenario. The other DLCs not mentioned (Marksman, Jets, Helicopters, etc.) are more useful in vanilla multiplayer but I do not recommend getting them besides supporting BI. The only one I would recommend is Marksman bringing unique weapons such as High-Caliber machine guns and subsonic guns. Overall, the DLCs are not needed to fully enjoy the game. Most mods are not DLC dependent and if you plan to play on community servers, they are most likely modded.

END
IF there's anything I missed, I'll make the changes later. If you're one of my friends, I'm sorry for the review spam."
25153,"yes nibbibibib

25154,"Great game, bad optimization. Imagine if this game had battlefield 4 graphics with arma 3 capabilities.
running on a gtx 1080 with an i7700k clocked at 4.8ghz and still 40/50fps(makes me want to cry). hopefully the next arma will be run on a better engine that actually has good graphics and better optimization.

25155,Good for rp
25156,"VERY GOOD 100% recomend

25157,"Poor performance (FPS) on a high end machine. Nothing fixes the issue, Uninstalled."
25158,its aight
25159,"amazing game with mods, horrible optimization"
25160,"I am going to start off this review by clarifying something. This game is not for everyone.

I initially got this game at request of a previous gaming buddy. He had really enjoyed it after he got it. I started it, and immediately hated it. It's not what you expect at first glance. This game, in my opinion, has very long learning curve. You have to power through the initial disappointment to get enjoyment from my experience. From there, we move onto the actual Pros and Cons that may at first be viewed differently due to a potentially stressful first twenty-ish hours.

Pros: Awesome community. You can find quite literally any mod you may want. Online games can be very, very involved. Many servers and many fun gamemodes to go along right out of the gate. 

Cons: I do not know of a game that runs worse than this does. It must be designed to punish you performance wise, as it will refuse to use extra resources available when it needs them to run better. UI Can be confusing. Time requirement. Occasional cheaters ruining muliple hour, or day long games.

Overall, it's a pretty good game. I personally would not buy it full price. I got it on sale and would recommend everyone else do the same. DLC is alright, although a little pricey for what it is in my eyes. I would mainly recommend this to someone who has the time to sit down and play for a few hours straight, as some of the games can get very involved as previously stated. Don't buy it if you are used to a Call of Duty Headglitch and Jump around multiplayer experience.

"
25161,"Even though it has its bugs this game is still amazing after 7 years and still Challenges  most PC's when you have more than 50 AI down or 5 players on a server it is a great game and i would recomend for anyone who likes ""realistic"" shooters"

25181,Great game with a large mod community.

25186,Arma 3= tacticool
25187,worth as fuck
25188,One from many others close to MilSim type Game
25189,"The performances are terrible in multiplayer, making the game barely playable most of the time."
25190,"Been playing this game now for a few years now. First got it when I was in year 6 and now I'm in year 10, when it was just me and my mate Adham playing. But since then we have met some of my best friends on this game playing altis life. Still to this day we still all hop on and play arma but have moved to mil-sims. I will for ever be grateful for this game from bring me so much fun and some of my best friends."
25191,A great game for those with more than the average number of fingers.
25192,Fantastic game with many variables. There are so many scenarios supported by endless types of equipment. Play solo or with friends - the best game around
25193,"I got all DLC in the bundle sale, graphics are a tad outdated but the mods make up for everything. I love it."
25194,Pretty good.
25195,"this is a 2020 game running on 2007 systems, its is chaotic fun in very rare moments and depressingly evil most of the time. yes it is good...... no u should not get it....."
25196,
25197,If you enjoyed dayz mod for arma 2 then this game is worth the purchase. Also for military and gun nerds.
25198,The only time I ever played Arma Life was when my friend got hit by a car at full speed and it flung him across the map so he had to walk all the way back.
25199,Would be nice to see the dayz and arma series on PS5 and Xbox Series X. Had lots of fun and imagination playing Dayz on PS4 with friends. The mechanics for dayz on console would be great for a next gen console arma game
25200,Absolutely recomend best game to play when your drunk with friends
25201,The level of complexity is wonderful! As a semiprofessional pseudo-intellectual and pseudo-tactician who has never been to combat I can say that this game is the epitome of how close simulations can get to the real deal.
25202,"So I paid the money for this game, I think like $30 or whatever for how much it costs. Anyways I'm saying I'm not gonna recommend this game to people because I bought the game mainly for the multiplayer aspect which when I try to join a server then all the roles are whitelisted and no one is on them. Also, there's 1 campaign story and the rest are DLC to purchase. The story did get kind of boring and some points are confusing but it's sort of decent. I have 17 hours on this game which are all trying to connect to online servers or playing story missions. I like a lot about it but it just gets boring very easily especially when not playing with actual people. I haven't been able to play with anyone because everything is whitelisted. I'll probably edit and update this if some things change but at the moment it's a solid like 5/10. It's fun but not for long because of the uneventful story line and the poorly populated servers. I tried joining and actually got into a few but I got kicked within a minute of even being in the server. I joined one and just waited a little and was ready for the game to start then I got kicked by the host. It's a somewhat good game but really it's just not very populated and the story is boring very fast. If you ask me if you should buy the game, I'd say no. Two of my friends asked me and I told them it's really not worth the money and it's just not enjoyable like I thought it would be. Maybe if they came out with an updated version or something I might try it but at it's current state I should probably just uninstall it."
25203,"Intense and immersive battles what more do you want!

Come get some!!!"
25204,i play the exile mod its very fun
25205,"Honestly, this game is alright in my opinion, if it got a revamp and they removed the micro-transactions I would love it, however paying for a bunch of DLC and being thrown in with little to no experience is hectic. I recommend it, but it's not 100% my thing.

Personally, I believe if you're looking for something way more hands-on and tactical from Rainbow Six Siege, I would recommend something else like Insurgency: Sandstorm, but if you're looking for a crazy realistic experience, buy ARMA. It's a solid 6-7 out of a 10, and is really fun if you get the right mods. Great game, needs some work though."
25206,This game is awesome idk.
25207,yes.
25208,good game mhhhhh very much so
25209,For 11 hours in the game im now playing Anzusgaming Kings County one of the hardest mods to get into just need to know the right people and game with the Best now on RolePlay hard server GG BOYZ

25222,its ok
25223,"Worse gameplay than Operation Flashpoint. Constantly stuck in walls, sometimes bullets work at point blank to the head annnd sometimes not. Glitchy as hell. Basic ass campaign and you are stuck paying again for each crappy level. Honestly the first game is far better than this piece of garbage. Dont waste your money."
25224,it just amazing
25225,I have played since the release of Operation Flashpoint.  This is the only FPS Military Simulator anyone will ever need for hours of endless war fighting.
25226,The best military simulator.

25240,"if u like guns then get the game yes ok.
i love getting snipped from 2km away"
25241,Immensley boring for single players.
25242,this game fuxcking sucks has way to many glitches theres hackers left an right you cant even pick things up half the time like games were so much better back in the day games just look good now an thats it like i dont know what devs are doing now a days but they need to get there shit together when most the games i play dont even have simple things down that old games have already done easily like went forward in graphics but backwards in mechanics by a lot i dont think its a good trade off
25243,"This is without a doubt the best milsim game currently available. Even with all the glitches, bugs, bullshittery, the stupid fucking menu BOHEMIA PLEASE FIX, its still incredibly fun. I would only recommend the apex DLC since it adds the most for your money and the other DLC are easily replacable with the content on the workshop.
This is one of the few games I never uninstall because I know I will come back to it eventually.
I HIGHLY recommend ArmA 3 if you're interested in ""realistic"" shooters."
25244,"if you love to play like in real war soo go check this out
"
25245,uses 1 core 1 thread to run this game

25249,this is the 2nd most boring game ive ever played right behind adopt me on roblox
25250,"This, is the ultimate mlitary simulation game, you must take on the role of either: a soldier in some random army, a terrorist in a cryptic cell always associated with a kareoke-singing terrorist messiah man guy, or a civilian with a debilitating mental disorder causing you to develop a unique bone structure to commit to extraordinary feats of agility and a magical ability to attract military ordnance usually flying at fast speeds. Depending on one of these 3 paths you pick, you will recieve a uniquely different and fun experience that will never get old."
25251,Amazing!!!!
25252,"the buggiest game i've ever played, and it's almost a decade old. Unacceptable."

25262,"I love this game. In fact, this is my favorite game of all time. Its so easy to come back to, and there is pretty much infinite possibilities. weather it be making a massive invasion that gives you 4 fps or spending hours in the editor (like me) testing and building random scenarios. I would recommend this game to anyone with a decent computer and some friends who own it. Sales are relatively often as well."
25263,For some reason there isnt anime girls? wtf bohemia?

25286,Simply the best game ever. The community has helped create a game where anything you can think of is or can be done. I have never wrote any review of a game before. It is always refreshed by mods. If one gets boring. Simply find a new server with different mods.

That being said, if you're looking for a deep, challenging, and (most importantly) realistic military shooter, then this is the game for you.

25351,great mil sim game
25352,"Really no point in buying this game if you do not have friends to play with. It gets boring playing alone pretty fast, and it has a huge learning curve."
25353,"This is the only military simulation game that is good. 
If you don't own Arma yet, you've got a great game to discover"
25354,good game
25355,"CS:GO < CoD << Battlefield <<< Arma III

Best military sim out there, no comparison"
25356,Good
25357,fun game if you play it with friends
25358,"It can be overwhelming when you first start playing. But as you play and find servers that you enjoy being in in, you''l get used to them.

My personal favourites is the island assaults which sees me and others moving towards those goals. Its all made better with meeting fun people and the randomness that happens in game.
Biggest gripe about it? if you dont have EVERY DLC it'll have pop ups in the middle of your screen... and yeah its not fun when it hides the person you were aiming at..."
25359,"fun game, if you enjoy games like insurgency sandstorm, or squad you will like this. the customization is great and even in the editor i would be entertained for days. keep in mind a microphone greatly increases the multiplayer experience."
25360,No
25361,best ever
25362,"This game, is definitely versatile. There are so many possibilities and things you can do. And I've had my fair share of time put into the game. But most of the time, was spent in the EDEN editor. Personally, I'm not much for one to play online with randoms. Just isn't my thing. So I did what I could in finding missions in the workshop, and many addons to explore in the editor. Ravage is a great one for a beginner, not much scripting needed as well as some other stuff. It's all very in depth. 

So why did I not recommend this you ask? Well personally. I'm at a loss. I'm a really creative person. But I feel as though a lot of my creative ideas have become halted by the fact that so much in this editor and such require scripting. And not only that, but I think this is more of a game that thrives off its multiplayer experience. And that really is not something I'm on board with. I was excited to explore and create, learn new things. But the amount of time I feel as though I have to take to learn the editor. As well getting certain other addons, or missions to work for that matter. Is daunting. It's starting to feel like a chore. I am still going to take my hand at figuring things out, but I've become burnt out right now for trying. If I can figure more things out, and get my many, many questions answered. Then I will update my review. For now, I'm not happy with it. 

However, for those of you, who enjoy multiplayer experiences and playing with friends. Exploring the vast variety of missions and workshop items to create an even more vast experience, then by all means go for it! This game is for you! I just wanted to share my opinion on why I can't recommend this. It's for the ones like me, who enjoy their single player experiences and getting to explore and create. If you're one of those, keep in mind. You will be fairly limited on your ideas, unless you know your way around the editor and scripting. If not, be prepared to watch and read a boat load of tutorials, as well as google searching almost anything."

25373,9/10
25374,"Arma III is an old game with old mechanics. it's got good moments and can be intense but the movement, the interface, the aging graphics, the ridiculous stamina system ruin the experience. 

Every time I play it I think to myself....Hmm, Ghost Recon Wildlands is actually not that bad of a game. lol

There needs to be an Arma IV, Arma III has some incredibly awesome military simulation mechanics in it, they are just old as dirt and primitive in execution. 

People love this game so much and want it so badly to be what it isn't that they form modding groups to upgrade it, to make it better but in my opinion, it's sort of like Skyrim, there's just too many mods and those mods will never make it the game it should be.  

Only a new version can do that. 

I bought Arma when it first came out, I enjoyed it, I bought Arma 2, I loved it, played it alot even though I wasn't that good at it, still had a good time. This game I waited to buy and just picked it up recently on sale and it's better than Arma 2 but it still plays the same way.  

The Stamina and fatigue system are handicaps that mask the deficiencies of this game. I was in the Army and I can tell you a young soldier is in tip top shape and jogging 5 miles a day at sunrise before a big chow hall breakfast. that's par for the course.  AFTER PT. 

You don't get that tired that fast, you even sing  cadence while you jog through the desert, under a hot sun, in TEXAS, in the SUMMER. 

After you've been up all night drinking at the bars. 

Get it if you're curious or bored, check it out, mod it, it won't get much better. 

  Arma 3 is an old game.

I'm sorry to inform you Bohemia Interactive but you FAIL, give me 100 pushups then jog until I tell you to stop."
25375,"If u want a awesome mil sim game then this isnt for u. But if sub par is okay, then by all means buy it, just make sure its on sale, then its worth it."
25376,best game ever
25377,"There is still practically THE SAME uncomfortable command system and soldiers' intelligence in this game as in Operation Flashpoint from 2001. This is ridiculous. You cannot issue orders effectively in combat.

For example, during an ambush, I cannot easily select an unarmed truck as a target because the default order when I am aiming at it is MOUNT. Not only that, in the Army you can give orders from the map level, but even here I can't order an attack because the truck is marked as the target of the mission and the default order is GO. You can also select targets from the menu where targets are labeled with vehicle names. While under fire, how do I fucking know the name of a fucking truck? Because of this idiotism, I can't finish a simple task.


It's still the same system that was in the game from 2001. If I want to play Operation Flashpoint I will buy Operation Flashpoint not expensive Arma 3.

I will play it and maybe I will change my rating."
25378,Better than CoD
25379,i love it
25380,"The game is extremely fun, it would be much more fun if my friend Josh would actually download the mods to play in the antistasi server a lot of my discord friends are playing in, he just refuses to play. :("
25381,"Haven't gotten a chance to play Multiplayer, but I can tell its a hell of a game. Sadly I'm a casual player and do not want to join a unit because of the commitment there."
25382,I've played it a little bit. Not half bad.
25383,This game is fun. I like flying the helicopters. vroooooooooooooooooooooooooom

25393,Outdated game that needs better graphics. Too many glitches in the game itself but if you are looking for a very immersive soldier game then this is for you. Be warned that everything in the game is pay to play with it. You will be spammed with messages if you don't own the DLC for the items.

And the AI vehicles still get stuck on bridges,
AI still shoot through forest/smoke with no visibility,
AI vehicles still doesn't know 100% how to drive in convoy without getting stuck,
can still die by a one shot in the foot,
small bushes still destroy vehicles, 
still can not walk through most or Livonia's bushes (how about it work perfectly in Dayz?),
AI still walk through closed doors/walls...

But yeah, there is a ""new"" DLC coming, with most of it's vehicles already in available for free in RHS.
No, please, don't buy it.

[Update to help some]
As some said, yeah Arma is ""different"" its a big sand box not just a FPS, you can just play or you can create things or both. 
Also, as soon as you open the launcher, it count as ""Playing time"" even if you are not playing at all, mission editor count as playing too.
Yeah, smart guy(s), I've spent 70 hours on it the last 2 weeks, but mostly codding and debugging, not hiding in a bush trying to get some kill on a PVP server. 
When I bought it, the first time I put my nose in arma scripting, I've sent 200 hours strait to understand a ""broken"" dynamic mission system, after 2 weeks discovered that the problem came from a BIS broken function which make 2 groups from the same faction shooting at each other, this function is still broken, years later.
I didn't say Arma is shit, nope, its a great platform, to create and spend time when you are early retired or what ever. However for a random online FPS player, its definitely not worse the money, not too mention the quite old laggy engine.
So, you want to have some fun learning Arma scripting and create your own shit, yeah, go for it and buy Arma 3, its great, but if you want to have fun online with your buddies, go for warzone or this kind of modern optimized game."
25402,Its alright
25403,constant updates and fun shooter alternative
25404,liukssss
25405,"This is one of the best games I have played, and I don't even recommend calling it a game. It's more of a military sandbox, basically the base game has a ton of assets, and people make gamemodes, mods, and even maps using them. 

Gamemodes range from singleplayer campaigns, dynamic multiplayer campaigns like antistasi, overthrow, and apex, maybe more arcade like gamemodes like altis life, king of the hill, or my all time favorite gamemode ever, zeus. 

Zeus is one of the best gamemodes thought of, a person gets to overlook the missions, and dynamically change ANYTHING, like send a few soldiers, call artillery, respawn that idiot who went offroad straight into a tree, or create a whole mission while everyone is sitting at spawn. Every experience is different, so join in!

You're gonna have a good time with the right group, so get the game if you have some friends who play arma, it's gonna be great. Only buy the ultimate edition, or you won't have a great time. 

P.S. This game is not for the easily offended"

ONLY REASON IM NOT RECOMMENDING IS BECAUSE THE GAME RIGHT NOW IS IN A BAD STATE"
25420,I've played this game before on another profile when i was younger and coming back to it now and deep end jumping straight into a milsim community was the best this i could've done. You can most absolutely play this single player but if you never try playing with other people you have no idea what your missing out on. Great game. Obviously bugs are there but what can you do on a game so limitless.
25421,walking simulator since it came out 10

25430,"ArmA 3 is my all time favourite game, there are few games that I have racked up over 1000 hours (as of writing this I have around 1470 hours), with so many game changing mods and communities to play with its difficult to get bored! I went through my fair share of milsim groups and clans but since 2016 have been playing with 4 others doing our own mini missions. Best played with mods and friends."
25431,"Many reviews and gamers alike will have a love/hate relationship with this game, not me, I love it.  My first introduction to this genre of gaming was way back in 2001 with Operation Flashpoint, Cold War Crisis.  After playing the demo (when game companies did that sort of thing) I was hooked.  What game at the time allowed you to fight as an Infantryman, a pilot, tank commander, special ops etc.  An editor to make your own mission or mess around, a campaign using different military resources, it had it all.  Okay, there were some bugs but hey you can overlook those just for the amount you got in one package.

We move forward in time to ARMA one and two,  same deal as above, more action, better visuals and variety and yes it had the bugs.  I've played them all even the VBS series and without a doubt, nothing comes close to putting you there in the hot seat unless it's the real deal.   Now I'm showing my age by waffling on about the ""good olde days"" let's talk about ARMA 3.  I know this review is 7 years too late but remember above I'm old and can't keep up with you younger fellas. 

Now ARMA 3, what to say about it that you probably don't know already, don't worry I won't bore you.   You can skip to the credits if you so choose but for you new bloods this a great no, may I be bold and say the greatest game in its genre.  I know it's not a COD, MOH, Battlefield experience but as close as you can get to a military simulator.  Its clunky, slow, boring at times, keys that will make your eyes bleed, buggy but it's the best on offer, just ask the millions of owners.   What's on offer, well everything a military simulator can offer plus much, much, much more.  A campaign, co-op, multiplayer, sophisticated editor, mods, training, Air/sea/land environments, DLC's adding more stuff to the game.  I spent a lot of my time in the editor sampling all the toys and mechanics.  It's your choice to do what you want in the game, lots of entertainment for a small investment. At least give it a try, you've nothing to lose (play for 2-hours or under and get a refund from steam).
Anyway, I'm done, be good, have fun and stay safe out there."
25432,"really good and fun game would recommend it
"
25433,ArmA3 is great. CoD for grown ups. Exile mod is awesome.
25434,This game is a great thing between tactical shooter and military simulation. As a platform the Arma Modding Community makes this game absolutely awesome. There is almost no scenario you cannot build using teh arma  Mission editor.
25435,you can do everything
25436,yo
25437,good stuff
25438, Really good game with a good campaign and some good multiplayer. Only downfall is all the DLC

25443,"Amazing tactical gameplay!
If you're looking for something like CoD, don't look here. That said, if you're looking for somewhere to build missions and create your own campaigns to play through alone or with friends, with complex systems, supporting arms, amazing atmospherics and real tactical and punishing gameplay, look no further.

Arma 2 and 3 are in my eyes the spiritual successor to old school tactical shooters like Ghost Recon. Though the 'campaigns' are very limited and basically just teach you how to play the game, they all tie into the larger scenario. A realistically complicated relationship with host nation and NATO forces, after some sort of rebellion on a Greek based country is basically the plot, then CSAT ties in in 2035. Like I said though the campaign leaves something to be desired, but the editor is the real gem here.

The Eden editor is where you go to build you own missions and even campaigns. Learn how to use the systems and you can have near endless fun with different scenarios, and that's all before the steam workshop. Custom content creators have build hundreds of mods, ports, and reskins as well as original content for this game. You can easily find lists of the best mods on youtube or other places and be on your way to fighting in whatever area, with whatever troops and equipment you could want, from WWII to HALO and Star Wars, there's something for pretty much everyone.

Main takeaways: strong learning curve to master, limited campaign, vast amounts of custom content in the workshop including mods factions and missions, multiplayer, singleplayer, or co-op."
25444,"When it comes to popular consumer-grade ballistics simulation, this game is what Kerbal Space Program is for popular consumer-grade interplanetary flight mechanics simulation. Which makes it the best ballistics simulator I've ever encountered (not to be confused with ""Receiver"" - the best gun handling simulator I've ever encountered). This aspect alone fascinates me enough to start appreciating and even admire a mil-sim game (I am a simpleton and generally stick to fast-paced action FPSs), which offers a lot of hiking, a lot of planning, a lot of team communication for the sake of coordination, at the expense of, well, shooting. You can make your own scenarios, if you have the time for it (they probably won't resemble Quake's action, though). The best thing about Arma 3 is, in actuality, not the gameplay, but the sandbox opportunity it gives you. One could even try/test all the weapons in the ""VR"" environment (available right from the start - pretty cool).

One of the common complaints is that it takes a lot of time to start feeling comfortable in this game, because of the many things one could actually do (with, surprise, the keyboard and mouse), besides movement and aiming. It's valid and is a definite deal-breaker for less committed people.

Unfortunately, gun handling (i.e. bolt/slide management, magazine management, round in the chamber management, malfunctions management, etc.) is still extremely simplified (okay, you still need to manage the zeroing of your scope, but that's related more to the ballistics of the projectile itself; it's also pretty basic (you see the distance, and you adjust for +/-100 m difference with two buttons)) and, thus, unrealistic. If you are like me, and still want a somewhat realistic  gun handling experience, then I recommend Receiver 1/2:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/234190/Receiver/"
25445,"Game is terribly optimized and has bugs that've been around since Arma2. 
But it is a massive, customisable Sandbox that grants unprecedented freedom in a MilSim.

25446,war crime simulator
25447,Awsome army sim
25448,"This game has the worst community ever.hands down and i play LOL so i know what bad is. people are so racist. Cant be stressed enough in a crowded part of a server u hear the n word non stop. Single player=dogshit
multiplayer=some how even worse"
25449,geddit.
25450,i like how the possablitys are endless and you can create your own stuff and play with firends
25451,.
25452,"Cool
"
25453,"TL;DR: It's okay in single player, and unbelievably fun in multiplayer. Unstable at times, but surprisingly worth the money. Buy it if you want a game for a difficult singleplayer; or if you want a really good multiplayer; or if you like running missions with 30 people.

Let's start with the gameplay: the vanilla game is good, but lacking in some departments. The two maps (Altis and Stratis) are great, based off of islands near Greece. The actual gameplay is somewhat difficult, but rewarding. There are limited guns and uniforms in the vanilla game, but the DLCs fill these holes VERY well. And, you can try out DLCs without owning them! For a Zeus (will get to later), you can use DLC units and scenery in your missions.

The next two things are why I have over 1,700 hours (and counting) in the game:
Zeus: With the MCC, ACE, and Ares/Achilles mods, this is hands down the best part of the game. By yourself, you can pit two factions against each other, command their units, and even get on the ground as a unit and test out everything. Inn multiplayer, you can run entire campaigns with your friends, make small, 4-man team missions, or just mess around and have your playerbase escape ""Arma-geddon"" in go karts as you send C-130s, fighters, and the entire US miliraty after them. Oh, and you can drop nukes and cause earthquakes.

Eden Editor: The other best part of the game. It requires a small bit of research and trial-and-error to get things set up, but this is where you can set up missions, place buildings and assets, and even set up respawn areas and capture points for missions. I actually would set up missions while waiting between classes during college.

Mods: There are so many mods for this game. From missions to take out terrorist leaders, to destroying Reapers with Mass Effect: Opposition, to even fighting the CIS or Empire in a Star Wars operation, you can do so much with mods. My own recommendations for starting off are all of the CUP and RHS mods, along with SSPCM (for when you only want to have fun and not worry about ammo or dying), MCC, Ares/Achilles, Arma 3 Aegis mods, and ACE3


All in all, this is a very good game. It's a learning curve, but a fun one. If you're like me and are really bad a shooters, try your hand at Zeus-ing or map making. If you are a vet at shooters, you'll love the new challenges provided by thousands of mods (not all at once though!).

Get it. You'll love it."
25454,its good
25455,good game
25456,Honestly what the fuck do i do
25457,"yes, it is a game worth getting"

25462,Play with a dedicated group who have regular meets and expanded mods and the game is absolutely fantastic. Playing Arma 3 as a vanilla experience is terrible.
25463,ok
25464,"The game might be fun, however the controls are very hard to understand, the helper says mouse wheel for action menu but nothing works. Looking all over the controls menu for action, and no sign of it, I can't understand how to switch between scopes, the default is some weird ctrl+sec+right mouse click, that doesn't work, clicking double click on right mouse sometimes does something..."

25468,"My friends and family thought that I was getting less confident and more cocky and arrogant. 

So they reccomended I buy this game to humble me. 

I was so sure of myself, so full of enthusiasm.

Then I died in the first mission about a billion times. I had no idea where the enemy was. Because I was running in, like an idiot in power armour. 

F's for Paco. 

Next I had to embrace my true nature as a millennial, realising that I couldn't actually read a map without the help of a wiki guide. 

I managed to figure out the compass though. Although it took me a while to realise it's not a good idea to reload after one shot.

Despite my complete inability to not be a scrub. This game is hyper realistic with a steep learning curve and stands up against modern games even now.

If you're into simulation type stuff. You'll probably love this."
25469,Not perfect but there's no other game that does what Arma does.
25470,"If you like hard and realistic games this game is perfect for you. But fps is so annoying, it doesn't matter if you have a potato pc or a gaming pc you are going to see that goddamn 0 fps."
25471,"Vanilla, good. DLC, eh. Mods, yes."
25472,"Infinite fun, ~200 hours in and I haven't even scratched the surface of what the game has to offer."
25473,Im not mad just disappointed 10/10 would recommend.
25474,"its good. the thinking mans shooter.. a proper milsim with so much community and mod support it insane.

get it immediately. a real must have in your library"
25475,the best game

25497,Youll love this game
25498,"This game has SO much to do in it, it is basically Garry's Mod but a realistic military simulator. There are thousands of mods that you can download and literally a thousand pages of scenarios that you can do with friends or by yourself. I would absolutely recommend this game. I met some of my best friends while playing this game."
25499,fun to play hard to master love this game now time to find some friends and get the real fun started
25500,is gud
25501,for the age of the game it's one of the best milsim's i've played and all the mods that are available means that this game will stay alive long after Arma 4 gets announced
25502,"MILITARY BARBIE DOLL SIMULATOR 2015

Arma 3 is an overall massive improvement over Arma 2. Lots of content and lots of mods for many, many hours of playtime. One nifty feature they introduced is basically adding GUI to many of the editor functions and allowing players to actually dress up their soldiers, hence Barbie Doll Simulator."
25503,.
25504,"Love this game 

tip for new players: Do the first campaign to learn  the controls 

second: go into public Zuse

third: if you like to play with others try to find a group/Unit to play with

fourth: remember that this is a game and not real life so somethings don't make sense but still vary fun

DO NOT JUDGE ARMA on the first few hours"
25505,"Really solid game, great community."
25506,Great game.
25507,It's ok
25508,NICE GAME
25509,"hell yeah

25510,Worthy playing
25511,w
25512,i love this game it runs on my pc fine with some lag once and a while but that dose not hinder game play
25513,it good
25514,it is amazing. One of the best Mil-sim games
25515,looking forward on ArmA 4
25516,Great game. Fun even in Singler player mode only with Eden scenario editer!
25517,"After long time i re-installed Arma3 end checked out maybe they optimized they utterly crap engine, but no this is still a lagging peace of crap."
25518,"nice, just don't get too many addons because that kills performance."
25519,"The game by itself is kinda weak, a new engine should support more features for a game of this decade because performance is limited by it, no doubt, I understand how accurate this game is with the ballistics, all the elements present, but let¬¥s be real today you can find similar games which will use more than 1 core and run more fps than your current display, I got high expectatives for the next Arma yes, however if we add mods the formula...it is a gamechanger, I would like to say it is a great sand-box there¬¥s alot of room alot of potential, mods make this game what it should be, but still, Im kinda confused by how Bohemia Interactive keep doings things like this, you make a game but what ends up being the most recognized thing is made by the community. It hurts me to recommend this game, the real devs deserve more credit keep it up modders!"
25520,its all good
25521,gun
25522,Realistic game with a challenging learning curve. Would definitely recommend.
25523,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons.

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself.

25524,very good mil spec for chilling..
25525,its good.
25526,"Its the ARMA3, the game genre by itself. Run for 600 meters without nothing to happen around, just to get bullet to your head from unknown well-concealed position and drop dead. I f***ing love this game!"
25527,What can I say except its a good game.
25528,"Intense and fun
"
25529,Just don't like it
25530,I like this game
25531,"not realistic like I wanted but it's still fun 
also lots of good ass mods"
25532,nah yeah nah yeah sick game 10/10 would play til my dad comes back from getting milk been a couple years tho so yeah sick game
25533,"I will probably have hundreds of hours soon. This is exactly the kind of gmae I wanted when I was on console forever. Combat is clunky, in a good way, you could be stuck in a position for a long time if you aren't careful. It feels like death matters most of the time. I really love the mods more than anything. The sheer size of some is amazing, and playing randomized scenarios with friends is a blast. Can't wait to get in a larger operation to do some milsim stuff again!"

25561,its prety good i guess the dlc is tooooooooooo mcuhhhh
25562,"One of the greatest military simulators of all time. The base game is worth the buy regardless, but the true value of Arma 3 lies with the exceptionally talented and prolific modding community. An active multiplayer community with a diverse range of playstyles, themes, and skill levels also help to make this game, at least for me, truly timeless."

your format of MPlayer is one of a kind and 1 is to 1 in the field  real sand box

and as soon i get the speed pad mapping fix im going to ditch cod,div 2 and the rest of the shooting game"
25581,"I like it, can't wait till version 4. Buy it."
25582,pew pew
25583,amazing mods just make it even better :)
25584,"I highly recommend this game, if you want a very realistic experience. If you want a fast paced action shooter you should probably go somewhere else.
Also make sure you get mods such as ACE and CUP and become familiar with them, as they can really enhance your experience along with other mods."
25585,"Paid $30 for the game then 3 hours later it was on sale for like $7. Decided to play before I bought any DLCs. All I got to say that this game is LOADED with bugs. Sure, some servers are fun and all but this game is nothing but bugs and hackers. There's hardly ANY official servers to play on, not everyone wants to go through bootcamp and literally become active duty just to play some ops whenever they want. 90% of the singleplayer missions are absolutely horrible. The DLCs are way too expensive so I'll never get them. Uninstalled the game way before 100 hours and hopefully Arma 4 will be a complete makeover."
25586,Great game

25590,"arma is a force to be fucking reckoned with. 

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet?"
25591,"Hi Guys Arma is a disgusting game, and not worth the time if u are a filthy casual. DAGR money farm is real. Type 115 is unbalanced kills in one bullet. Clunky game 10/10"
25592,alot of fun.
25593,crazyyy
25594,Even on my dirt trash of a computer. It still runs with low settings and with a lot of mods. Best game I've ever played
25595,"Complex and Gud

How I like mah wemen"
25596,It is a REALLY fun open world game with endless ways to explore and play! Even tho it can be a little buggy some times it is still really fun and the bugs makes it the game it is today :D!
25597,haha shoot people and fly in air vehicle
25598,"Really liking it so far. The game has some bugs but they don't affect the gameplay atleast for me, AI is kinda hardcore, but it's okay. 

10/10 Tactical shooter"
25599,noice
25600,"If you like very realistic games where you need to know every button on your keyboard, then this is the game for you.  It's too complicated, the community is very unfriendly to new players who ask questions and the graphics can use an update.

Although, the map editor is really amazing, along with the AI.  You can build really unique scenarios for you and your friends.

I think the game has merit but I cannot personally recommend it to most people, it's for a very niche person that doesn't like shooting games, but really likes the idea of pretending to be in the military, because they talk like they do in the movies."
25601,Yee
25602,love the realism and simulator aspects of the game. I haven't experienced too much combat as I am still doing the training but it is amazing!!
25603,is very nice

25615,good game but very hard to learn
25616,Its amazing
25617,best game
25618,"I've played the ArmA franchise since the beginning, but I fell in love with ArmA II and the Editor feature. I think ArmA III perfected it. The gameplay is astounding, and I love the insane level of detail and limitless customization options for everything in the game. I'm a USAF and US Army veteran so realism ingame is a big deal to me. Everything from smoke to clouds, to debris, secondary explosions and ballistics, tracers and CAS is about as close to real as a PC game can get. Even the AI is reactive to incoming fire and will test your abilities in SP modes. This game truly is a masterpiece... and I've barely scratched the surface."
25619,Really good game!
25620,1000s of hours played.  Gotta be the best value ever.
25621,Best game ever. Bought a gaming computer espesially to play Arma 3.

25627,"I've always loved the Arma games, but 3 took it to a whole new level. Much more stable and many more mechanics, plus workshop integration. Love it."
25628,"I couldn't make it to one of the pickup helicopters as it was taking off but then the pilot just said in radio comms ""hold up m8 am comin for ya"" and proceeded to take a sharp turn and crashed the heli with like 8 people in it.
10/10 best military simulator would recommend"
25629,Great game with a wonderful modding community. never a dull moment in this game. i still have to try Multiplayer but this game still is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The dev community should be very proud
25630,"If you're willing to deep dive, this game is fantastic."
25631,"Do you like realistic physix and fast paced combat in a variety of cool maps?

Well get the fuck outta here dweeb, this is yomping sim 'ARID WASTELAND EDITION', where your 30 minute trek across the same faceless terrain you started in; can and will be ended by a bush wookie 600m up the valley with thermals. 
Sucks.

However once every 40 hours you will find yourself engulfed in the most dynamic, immersive and genuinely challenging military sim experience available. Combined arms options only ad to this, any mission you can imagine can be recreated in arma with the use of some easily accessed mods.

Oh yh, enjoy arma physics. Or start sacrificing virgins to stave off the desync rams and asset clipping.

25639,epic
25640,One of my favorite games. The AI can be a bit finicky in the ways it wants to work but overall has been very fun to play with. The amount of content by default is fun to play with but the mod support for this game is incredible. Overall a great game with plenty of content and ways to use it.
25641,tty
25642,"In comparison to many other battle sims, this game is garbage.  Don't waste your time on this. I bought it at full price, played 3 hours or thereabouts, realised how bad this was. Enemies know where you are even if hiding. Avoid even if in a sale. Get Squad instead."
25643,"Good game, 10/10 would die again."
25644,good fighting thing
25645,good
25646,good
25647,"realistic mil sim! great game with so many mod options, high reply singleplayer a classic and one of the best fps!"
25648,"Yeah its a'ight. but seriously, if your looking for the best open sand box experience this games where its at."
25649,It is awesome the game totally recommend!!!
25650,good
25651,i don't have a mil sim team of people to play with but damn this game is good just started in 2020 and i have to say i love the mods in the game still don't know where to find the jets or heli in the game but overall still having the time of my life
25652,Meow!
25653,"the better your hardware, the better of an experience you will have. its a fun game with the right people and the right game mode.but the age started to show 1-2 years after release.lots of ram, preferable on an ssd, high core speeds... thats about it. gpu doesnt need to be special."
25654,"Very complex military style simulation (beside the bugs), Recommend for hardcore military simulator fans."
25655,"Its really fun

Edit: I have now spent over 200 hours on this game it is very fun and addicting when you have good people and a good Zeus to play missions with.
Base game is fun but with mods there is no limit to how many different missions you can do."
25656,"My nine hours is installing mods and getting training. My friends say the game is fun, but I will tell you the mods that you need to install to actually enjoy the game take a while to download. Don't get the game if you don't have like 150 gigs to spare right away."
25657,yes
25658,Pre good aye
25659,"Sandbox game, allows for creativity and real playing!"
25660,Best military game I have played.
25661,Brilliant game to play with friends or just to play solo
25662,"Seen a couple people be slaughtered in front of me by ruthless A.I, seen myself get rag dolled off a 50 foot radio tower by an rpg, I've crashed my fair share of flying air crafts, countless vehicles exploded killing all my squad in the process due to the shit physics engine, and dear god have I seen countless war crimes after war crimes committed right before my very eyes...too many to count.pretty good game 9/10 if you remove stamina"
25663,njan
25664,This game is brilliant for Role-playing and the mechanics are spot on for a 7 year old game
25665,"I enjoy spending hours of my time walking

(still walking)"
25666,its really good theres nothing much to say
25667,this game is good
25668,yes
25669,its ok
25670,"i wasnt sure after the first 5758 hours if it was worth the 40$ I paid for it back in alpha, but that last 5759th hour made me change my mind.You should buy it tomorrow yeah"
25671,i've an issue with game suddenly went freezing and crashed
25672,"After following all the optimization advice that I possibly could online, the input lag in this game makes it basically unplayable.   I understand it is more of a simulation game, however, it inputs keystrokes in painful and unsatisfying way, that it's doesn't feel worth it.   I only have 3 hours in game, please convince or tell me how to enjoy this!   Running a 1080 TI, I thought this game would be ok, it isn't. FPS is ok but that input lag is like jumping around 5 moves behind in strokes.   I am not mashing keys, just minor movement adjustments.   I don't want to hate this game I really want to play, but I would never recommend this to anyone."
25673,Gun go Bang Bang and the enemy just flops or freaks the fuck out in wired ways
25674,yes
25675,"Great Game! The base version is fine but i'd recommend you to Join A milsim to explore the game properly. Instead of buying the base game for 2k, wait for a sale and buy the apex edition at 1k, totally worth it."
25676,Hell yeah.
25677,!!!!!!!!!!
25678,Warcrimes from the comfort of your own home!
25679,"i have 3100 hours in this game, and I think this is the most un-optimised game ever. This game runs at a solid 30 fps on a good day and im on medium graphics. and its DLC is worthless money grabbing poop.Id still buy it. the milsim community is 10/10"
25680,base game is okay. the online play is where it's at. KOTH
25681,Yes
25682,I host servers on this game!Good Fun.
25683,"Arma 3 is the most in-depth yet fun war simulation I have ever played. Watch game-play trailers and understand it is very difficult, but you'll be completely hooked. Highly recommended."
25684,Great game
25685,Great Game
25686,"Only play for the mod called ""Dynamic Recon Ops""10/10 epic"
25687,One time my friend tried to pick up a box with a helicopter and it pulled the helicopter in a tower and we all died. 10/10 felt like real life.
25688,"I liked the realism but I did not like the amount of guns, I wish there was more"
25689,"Overall best milsim style game available on the market. I would recommend the ultimate edition, which is what I have, even though its around 120$, its well worth the price, and it sometimes even drops by as much as 70%. 10/10 fully recommended."
25690,Great
25691,I've played Arma 3 for over 4 years now over multiple different accounts and have over 1.2k hours in total ranging from CQC to Roleplay and most importantly KOTH and Antistasi. I love this game and I have received so many great moments over the years. Over all I'd have to give Arma 3 a big 9/10. I believe there are some small bugs and some things could get changed but overall I believe that this game was successful and I can't wait for Arma 4 whenever that's on it's way. I wish Bohemia the best of luck with their further projects and I would like to thank them personally for providing so many people with the joy and pleasure experienced both in Arma and their other games. I wish to see the Arma series succeed and make so many peoples days better! Have a great day the people of Arma 3 Review section and Bohemia :)
25692,a
25693,"BIG PP

"
25694,"Thumbs up, because this game brings immerse regarding in military - you can fly jets, heli's and drive tanks, apc and etc. Definetly, recommend it."
25695,fun online & offline game. better than COD and no microtransactions.
25696,real fuckin hard sometimes
25697,It makes me hard
25698,"Arma 3 is the experience i was looking for, i was waiting to buy it for over a year, and when i finally got my hands on it, i just fell in love with it.I give it a geneva suggestion/10"
25699,good game with a lot of bugs
25700,Great combat simulation
25701,Best mil-sim game out there and allows your creativity to go wild in SP
25702,"i mean the game is fun and all, but i dont think i'll memorize over 90 fuckin keybinds"
25703,very 40 fps moment
25704,Super good just as Arma 2. Probably better with friends 110% but I wouldn't know! :')
25705,its fun
25706,Its really fun but DLC's recommended
25707,6
25708,Fun game
25709,insanely fun so far
25710,Best game for action and realistic
25711,very nice game
25712,Bro... it's Arma of course you should fucking buy it!!
25713,let me recommend
25714,Like!
25715,Amazing and fun!
25716,it's fun for the hole family
25717,great milsim but the bugs and ai are terrible
25718,"So much fun to play even when alone, you do need a monster computer to run this game to have graphics that dont look like pixelated vomit. Community is awesome especially on EU servers. COOP and Warlords are by far my favourite modes so far. Also mod support for this game make it endlessly fun. Just fix frame rate optimization and this game is perfect for everyone."
25719,ha ha mods go boom
25720,cool
25721,cool game
25722,.
25723,Good game to play if u like tactic games
25724,yes
25725,One of the top Military Simulation style games I've ever played. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for realism and a realistic/tactical military game.
25726,ah yes. kerbel space simulator with a dash of firearms.
25727,This game is kind of famous for its bugs but it‚Äôs still a really good game for those war vets and that are fans of the military.
25728,The game is more of a military simulation but also works in other ways depending on the mode youre playing or the mods you have. If you like guns and interested in combat and military style gameplay then you should definitely get this game
25729,It's a fun game when you can find a good server with good players willing to team up.

25737,Good Game If you LIke Millitary Games
25738,nice
25739,"very confusing  and it is hard to find full servers but it is fun, squad would be beater if you are new to these games"
25740,"then along came zeus, he hurled his thunderbolt- *multiple lightning strikes*"
25741,"This game is amazing to play with friends especially with mods, that said this game also sucks for the same reasons, besides having to download radmin to play with my friends on a private server the ffact that after 30-45 minutes my game just starts stuttering and gets literally unplayable. (that said having a 2070 mini graphics card and this only happening with arma)"
25742,"The only milsim out there encompassing all aspects of modern warfare. There are occasional glitches and bugs, but that is an acceptable price to pay for a sandbox of such magnitude.For all newcomers I would recommend playing the campaign first, which would primarily teach you infantry combat. You can always learn ground and air vehicles using the map editor and spawn an airfield full of tanks, or just play custom vehicle oriented community missions.If for the first time you choose to jump straight into multiplayer, you would most likely get overwhelmed and drop the game altogether. For instance there are 5-6 different stances as an infantryman, which is just a glimpse of the level of detail in this game."
25743,Yes
25744,fun game very real and cool :)
25745,I like idea but first gotta get used to pc gaming. lol!!
25746,Maybe later.
25747,ITS GOOD BUT TIME CONSUMING HONESTLY WORTH IT

25749,love the game
25750,Really Fun. I love this game it's really realistic
25751,"Much fun, so wow"
25752,"look at my hours, now look at your life, now download the game and sit back relax and enjoy a tasty taco"
25753,"Arma 3 literally is the most boring shooting game since Doom 3

Story: Unintresting, unrealistic, and not even worth my time

Multiplayer: You have better luck finding a game of multiplayer in Call of duty 2 than you would in this game

Gameplay: Idk game crashes every 15 minutes, Gameplay controls are shit,

Graphics: Look like a ps2 game even on ultra

Content: LOL none for my 30 dollars, they literally try charging 10 dollars for vehicles and classes that should be incuded in the base game

Side notes: Steam literally I want a refund game became near unplayble after 5 hours basically screwing me out of 30 dollars"
25754,THE OPEN WORLD AND MASSIVE WEAPON SELECTIONS
25755,pretty much the ideal milsim game (it may be old< but it requires a lot of horsepower)
25756,MINT
25757,"Highly realistic, Needs not a lot system requirements
"
25758,hands up or die!
25759,
25760,Realistic military simulation at its finest. A game so modular it still hasn't fully died out after all these years. I can only hope that bohemia continues to provide the community with the great content in future games.
25761,It's realistic with more mods added to it also if joined with a Milsim or Semi serious unit its more fun.

25780,"OMG this thing is very addicting! I mostly now play in Editor mode and I cant seem to stop playing!  Battle Ships, Little Boats, Tanks, Troops... Things can get messy pretty quick so it's a good practice to call in the Drones, Helicopter and planes to be your eyes in the skies! over 580hrs now"
25781,i cant play this because of the bad fps
25782,"Despite almost everyone telling me this game is dead, it is lively and great fun. The community consists of both serious players (for those that want to take this brilliant mill-sim seriously) and those that just play to have fun and good around"

‚òë Minor bugs (Base game has no bug that I know of but I mostly play with mods which like 90% of all players do, mods can be buggy sometimes.)
‚òê Can get annoying
‚òê ARK: Survival Evolved
‚òê The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs"

25829,"Definitely a 10/10 many countless hours played on the game and I keep finding new things to do, it is a game I recommend for everyone! Get the game while on sale you won't regret it!"
25830,just yes theres no but just yes
25831,absolutely love this game
25832,Combat
25833,value. it will take me  months just to learn the buttons on keyboard for arma 3 .  let alone all the dlc and exspansion pals. wow. awesome job Bohemia. major value like no other. way to many great things about the game to mention. would take me 20 min. truly.    I am X military. a veteran. u.s. army 1\11 A.C.R.  and im vewry impressed. played for 1 st time this week.was looking for flashpoint by codemasters and ran into this. the music in game however i would swear some of it was from flashpoint am i right? thank you all for superb job
25834,If CBT was a game.
25835,EVERYTHING

25837,"its arma, you already know whats up"
25838,Campaign is good
25839,shit game
25840,4300+ hours... eat my butt
25841,"Arma 3 is the most realistic shooter i have ever encountered. This is a game with minimal HUD and it challenges you. If you get shot once, you will be slowed for a lot of time. You have to pause to enter the map, and even when you mark locations, you need to memorize the grid and which direction it is to reach your destination. Multiplayer is also fun with friends, but thats debatable. overall, it is a great game. But sometimes it is annoying when you just want to chill, and have fun, because this game is very serious. For people looking for a 'fun' shooter, I would recommend the Black Ops series. If you are serious about this, you've come to the right place"
25842,My best game ever <3
25843,Epic milsim get it now pls im lonley
25844,bob the builder shooting game

25848,Yes
25849,Good Game!
25850,Yes
25851,cool game now only if it wasnt an unoptimized sack of shit and ran properly
25852,"This is a wonderful game, a lot of content, good graphics and a plethora of things to do. A grand military sandbox you can enjoy with your friends, or so atleast I'd hope.

Don't be fooled by the amount of hours I have played tho, since the vast majority of it has been trying to get this things multiplayer to work, which is the equivalent of pulling teeth.

I apparently have a very obscure Hauwei router that uses completely different terms & interface layout opposed to other servers, so 100% of any youtube tutorial videos on ""port forwarding"" has been beyond useless.

I have spent hours sifting through online threads & tutorials to no avail, just to play this thing with my friends. I usually can manage to figure out most technical issues like this, but I think this time I'm over my head, made even worse by most tutorial videos calling the process ""easy/simple"" I have begun feeling like somewhat of an idiot because I just can't seem to figure this thing out.

I have sunk in so many hours getting it to work, that mention of this game just brings a bitter taste to my mouth... 

I deeply regret buying this..."
25853,Very good love this game
25854,yes
25855,I joined a server with friends at 1am (Mountain time) and they just kept talking I muted them all but then i realized i cant silence (mute) the voices in my head they wont stop they keep telling me to kill abraham lincoln like BRUH he is already dead for like 300 years or something just call my mom I want to go home (I'm homeless)
25856,I have enjoyed playing this game with some friends.
25857,"Fun for those who enjoy more realistic shooters that include mapping, strategy, stealth, vehicular combat, etc. The map design is not amazing but still pretty good, there are wild animals as well to give more of an environmental feel. gunplay is great. Graphics are pretty nice for a game from 2013. Blood looks kinda weird and misty. And best of all, there is a mode to create your own scenarios, meaning you can literally have endless fun by spawning enemies all over the map and  basically create an entire war. Good for roleplaying. Voice acting is pretty damn good. 

Get it now since its on sale for $7"
25858,mmhm millitary go brrt
25859,"It's the best walking simulator on the market.

The Campaign is great, the gunfights are god tier, flying mechanics are the best in any game I've played, ground vehicles are great and each one has their perfect use as well as being universal. The level for improvement is always there but of course, you can just be stomped at any point.

A great and fantastic thing about the game that deserves its own section is the physics. The boys outdid themselves this time. I've never seen such amazing physics in a game since Space Engineers, as we know has no problems what so ever in the physics department. When you play be sure to give your friends a nice bump in a tank when they are in there vehicle or helicopter your mind will be absolutely blown by how good they did. The physics alone make the game a 10/10.

Remember everyone! There are no such things as bugs only features!
But seriously great game to play with friends, plenty of scenarios, game modes, severs to pick from. The modding community is fantastic and alive making the game a lot more playable.

10/10 overall"
25860,"Fun. I have 10hrs in rn in the first 2 days of owning this game, and who knows how much i'll have in total!"
25861,seven fitty great value
25862,Another beautiful example of a farming simulator that was done right! Good job Bohemia youve done it again!!!
25863,If you're looking for a game just turn around. This shit is a walking simulator or also known as MILSIM. If you're looking for a game where u can watch someone walk for 80% of gameplay no matter what gamemode you play this is the place for you. Actual combat in this game can be fun as long as the guys who coded whatever mod you're playing didn't fuck the AI which is shit as it is. PvP combat on the other hand is a blast.
25864,Fun milsim
25865,Sick
25866,This game is extremely realistic. (mmost of the time anyways) i love the teamwork in the game and the ability to do co op missions. Great game. I would recommend playing with friends for the best experience.
25867,"terribly optimized buggy over complicated fucking mess. ad popups telling you to buy dlc every 5 minutes. 16 fps on absolute minimum graphics settings. tutorial sucks, you require dlc to drive like half of the vehicles, and shitty base controls."
25868,yes
25869,the best of the best!

25875,Do not let your AI drive the SUV!
25876,You get to commit unspeakable crimes against fellow man.
25877,"It's great..... except, I can't play because you can't invert the y axis on any controller.  Would be great to play with the keyboard and controller together.  Not going to happen for me.  I'll keep researching and maybe find a way, but it's 2020.... how can a shooter be a shooter without the option to invert a controller axis?"
25878,just the base game is one hell of a great game to play if your in to military sim games great community who is willing to help out new players all the time
25879,gud
25880,"10/10 game with the best physics 
"
25881,"I love Games like this one its not too demanding on your pc, a plus to this game is the fact that there are plenty of mods available to download and play including scenarios and missions singleplayer/coop all in all its a great game i would recommend getting it."
25882,minnnnnttt
25883,yeee

25887,"really fun and easy to get into
"
25888,i like this game i can kill civilians
25889,"Getting used to the controls, mechanics, and game play can take way too long and it's overly complicated! Also trying to run this game is a pain in the ass the FPS is low and the devs have abandoned the game! My computer should be able to run Arma 3 yet the FPS takes a huge dive! At least this game doesn't have stupid regenerating health like Call of Duty or Battlefield just a few bullets and you're dead but you can patch yourself up and heal yourself which is more immersive. Should be more like Insurgency you can die instantly. The game is also still full of bugs and even glitches! Even trying to close the game when you're finished playing it for the time or day is a pain in the ass! Don't get this game for the single player campaign it's boring, badly structured, and glitchy as fuck! It ain't as good and fun as any Call of Duty single player campaign. This is strictly multiplayer at least that's where all the effort went into! I think what ruins this game for me and ruins the immersion and realism is the ability to switch to fuckin third person view which defeats the purpose of a fuckin Mil Sim! Go watch this video to learn more about why third person sucks in Arma. If you want to play an actual realistic mil sim FPS go play Post Scriptum and Squad both games made by the same developers! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7zoVIsIT2A&ab_channel=Dslyecxi"

25892,Very good game
25893,love this game defo recamend
25894,"Great game, just wish I wasn't charged $20 for the rest of the DLC's."
25895,"Arma 3 is a unique experience. It offers alot of great missions for singleplayer, coop and also pvp. As you play you will be able to drive cars, tanks, boats and also fly planes. It is alot of fun and offers a large variety of different mods. Its hard to give this game a proper review because its such a large game with an endless ammount of different objectives and stuff to do. 
The only negative aspect is that it demands alot from your computer, so get a good one.

10/10.
"
25896,"Nothing else like ArmA, nuff said."
25897,"It is honestly a lot to get used too, but over time i think you will find this to be an overall enjoyable experience. Extremely realistic, also kind of reminds me of PUBG. I would also recommend getting as many DLC as you can if you plan on playing in multiplayer servers as there is not many servers dedicated to non-dlc related content at this current time."

25909,This level of visual does not justify the performance. Why is the 70% of my gpu doing nothing? why is the 90% of my cpu doing nothing? Do not waste your time. and i liked it as well you know. It's heartbreaking to see a game like this going for 10$+

25914,"Horrible game that attempts to be 'realistic' by making you wait for 20 minutes to respawn.

Other problems:
‚Ä¢ you only get 5% of the content with the base game. You cannot even use vehicles or pick up guns without DLCs. You only get a simple 1x scope, all others are paid.
‚Ä¢ game advertises itself as 'realistic', but in truth is just badly made and clunky. Yeah magic syringe to instantly revive people killed with a direct rocket hit, sure. Yeah animations that are more scary than the war itself. Yeah going into space when you bump into a rock, etc.
‚Ä¢ 'tactical combat' is nowhere to be seen, it's just a deathmatch with 10 min respawn wait."

25926,good
25927,"very very very complicated and super hard learning curve and super supertime consuming, def not for people like me... no time to play this game money wasted and all the thing you need to do and learn just to able to start the game is just not worth my time, not at all"
25928,It good
25929,"Man I hate arma, but I also just fukcing love it.
I won't lie and say the game isn't buggy, or just weird at times, but that's what makes it fun.
It can be a 30 minutes walk to an objective only to get shot down by an ambush, or a silence broken by mad laughter when something dumb happens, and that's the beauty of it.
there is no other milsim like Arma, and anyone who's into milsims should get it imo.

Btw, you have to get the apex dlc(and others too), it's pretty much a must have if you want to really enjoy arma, which is why I think you should probably only buy the game when it's on sale."
25930,"Better than any girlfriend/boyfriend u will have.
!"
25931,Amazing game after a while just a pain when you get started but amazing when you get the hang of it!

if you are g–∞y,

25966,aight
25967,it's okay but how to not have 8 fps at the intro
25968,"Okay, so this is an iffy review, this review will be a pro and con list and note: i only have 5 hours in this game, but its enough to leave a review, now, lets get to the pros and cons (TL;DR AT BOTTOM)

PROS:
-This game is the most realistic military sim that you can get, the gameplay is very tactical and team based, its not like every other shooter and run and gun getting airstrikes left and right, this game requires a lot of team work, and the game is less of getting kills and more of getting an objective done.

-The Community is very kind to new players, i love the fact that no one is rude to other people, i have been on the popular servers and its non toxic, i am not saying its like that on every server, but in the majority of them, very nice community.

-The addition of mods in this game is awesome, not only is there more to do than shooting bad guys, but you can create and mod things, thats really really cool.


CONS:
-This game has terrible optimization, like the worst i have ever seen, just for reference, i have a GTX 1650 super Overclocked with a ryzen 3 3200, 2x8 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 Ram, and with low settings, i am getting 20 fps average in firefights, that is unplayable, i know i don't have 64gb of ram, and an rtx 2080ti with a 64 core processor, but i should not be getting 20 fps average on the lowest settings.

-The ads in the game is so annoying, i have the marksman DLC for the game, and every time i hop in an official server you have that stupid ""buy this DLC"" logo on your screen, and every 5 minutes, you have just a bunch appear on your screen randomly, like this blocks the screen when you're playing the game, that can hurt your game play a lot, imagine you're about to shoot a guy, and then you see a bunch of ""buy this dlc"" logo appears on your screen, and you miss your shot because of that, that is not right at all, that is just pure greed from Bohemia, they would rather have a player buy the DLC, then have someone enjoy the game.

-This one is kind of picky, but im wishing for better mic quality in the game, ik the game is 7 years old, but still.

NOTE:
And with that, I give this game a thumbs down, by no means will i stop playing a game just because i gave it a thumbs down, all i have to say is, i would not recommend getting this game if you have a bad PC, dont let the recommended and minimal system requirements fool you.

TL;DR: The game has a good community and good game play, but the game has poor optimization, and annoying ads in game

Message to Bohemia developers: I enjoy your game, and i know you guys work hard on this game, but we need better optimization, and its really annoying when i die because of the ad popping up, i just hope you guys can do better on this game, Thanks!

25979,"The Ai under command are completely and utterly useless trash, NO matter what commands you give they are either so slow youd think they need a I am special name tag or they go off doing their own thing regardless.  There have been so many times I team kill my squad for being so completely and utterly ignorant and annoying.  The command AI need some serious fixing I have had nothing but problems with them from the start.  I would rather work solo and get missions completed than have these FKN ai on my team."
25980,its ok
25981,best pc shooter and sim. AMAZING GAME
25982,best game ever.
25983,"Very bugs, you cant even have a key bind working.
Performance is a joke. For a ""simulator"" its very bad when you need 3 headshots to kill a guy at 5 meters of you...
Insurgency is much better!"

"
26005,"This shits trash, basically a running simulator. The only servers that people play are random user ran ones and the community is total aids. They will not help you whatsoever if new and expect everyone to put 500 hours into the game before even touching pvp. If youre looking for a trash ass, poorly made, buggy, running simulator with a community full of virgin lords get this game. If youre looking to actually have fun then get literally anything else. They claim this to be a hyper realistic military shooter when in reality its like BF 4 if it was made by one guy that just learned how to write script 30 minutes ago."
26006,"Good game, bit janky and has a learning curve with slower movement and gear mechanics than other games. But those are well worth overcoming to enjoy the game as a whole."
26007,i have not purchased this game.

26045,yeet
26046,.
26047,this might have been a fun game back in the 90s
26048,I recommend this game if you just want a game to chill play and have fun if your a person that loves games like cod or r6 u may not like this game so much

Good community"
26059,"It's a decent story mode for singleplayer(icluding the dlcs with stories) ,Multiplayer is good only if you fave friends."
26060,"You want to fight a 20 v 20 v 20 conquest control mission? Want to start as a small rebel force, and end up destabilising the entire USA occupation on Altis? Want to do high risk convoy runs with the lurking fear of another clan robbing you blind? All with the most realistic and wide range of car, APC's, tanks and air craft? 

Yes, Arma is the biggest pile of laggy buggy shit you'll ever play, but it's also the best mil sim out in terms of content and vehicles (and sometimes weapons) . And you never stop learning shit, and if you do, the insane amount of quality mods will keep you entertained."
26061,Its a great game! The only 2 problems are u need mostly friends or u need to play alone with that problem is u need to pay maybe 60 to 80 euros to play with them and have FUN and its a bit pricey and i think with an ok.
26062,Community is one of the best in all the games I have played
26063,yes

26074,"Having logged 8600+ hours over the years on ArmA3, may I say it's been a wild ride.
Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...
Mods are everything."
26075,"Fun, intense, realistic, and challenging, Arma 3 focuses on large scale warfare within obscure wars.  The game takes inspiration from many lesser known conflicts like Papua New  Guinea - Bougainville Island war and The second Congo War. The multiplayer is hectic, terrifying, realistic, and requires teamwork to survive any of the large scale, vehicles riddled, battles. You and your team must use everything at your disposal and having at least one person who can use helicopters and jets is almost required but with such high playercounts, there will never be a situation where you don't have a competent pilot. The singleplayer is abysmal though except when played in coop, because when you play coop it becomes excellent, issue is the only campaign that can be played coop is the apex dlc campaign but it doesn't really matter because you can just play the zeus mode which lets you play unique and diverse coop custom missions. in conclusion, buy it, get your friends to buy it, have infinite fun."

26101,good game
26102,A good game
26103,"Genuinely a fun game. Playing with a good group of friends who mix seriousness with fun, I've had some of the most amazing  moments I've had on any game. The game plays how you want it to, it's a sandbox after all. It can be slow at times, but can really get you bohemian hollering when you really get into it. Best moments include carrying a wounded teammate out of a village seconds before it's leveled by rocket artillery, landing that perfect GBU that takes out 10+ people, genuinely feeling fear when pinned down by an army of Russians who want nothing more than to sink their lead into me and many more awesome moments. Vanilla is awesome and has a great setting, but mods and custom scenarios can take the game so much farther and I would recommend playing what you want with friends as they can make the game so much more enjoyable. Zeus has probably been the most enjoyable experience for me personally, being able to create a mission on the fly that brings my friends through urban firefights, zombie apocalypses, soaring through the skies and securing objectives all at the tips of my hands is an amazing feeling. I love to give my friends a fun experience that they can take away from and make memories playing, and I can make mine watching them really get into my scenario. Such an amazing game that I'm so glad I've been able to experience by myself and alongside my friends. Not a game for everyone, specifically the impatient and immediate pleasure seeking individuals who prefer running through their objectives and expecting results, but you can find that it has something for everyone who wants to give it a try. Good luck on the battlefield!"

26106,"If you didn't buy Arma 3, you should have."
26107,"Worth a play, but the mods and custom servers are what make this game fun"
26108,Nothing like getting pelted in the face from 1.4km away
26109,Its a very complicated game but once you get the controls and stuff down its a very fun game
26110,"I have no friends the editor is my friend now, the editor has consumed my life. Also to all the negative reviews that complain about having to pay for a dlc to fly a jet or helicopter forget the dlc go to the workshop and find some mods that add so much to the game."
26111,"Can't play because of a bug that makes the game crash at launch and that has not been resolved since the game released, but it's not like this studio would care to finish a game for once"
26112,"First time played this game i didnt knew really what i was doing except torturing my pc with overheating, shooting AI with only realising they have super vision and ofcourse running for hours for 1 fight. 

Later on when i played this game it was still the same but with friends and a couple more bugs here and then and some dlc's that you can buy during the steam sales. 

Overall very fun game with much variety in missions and playstyles and ways to die nothing seems impossible except for 60+ fps and staying alive the enitre mission 

11/10 one of the best games i played"
26113,best game i have ever played
26114,The game is clous to realiti
26115,The forever game
26116,"The single-player content is good enough for a buy, though to me it was mostly for learning the unmodded game's controls and mechanics. The new-ish 'Old Man' freeroaming campaign seems fun, but I haven't yet sunk my teeth into it properly. 

The real meat is in the multiplayer, and mods that allow for far more complex interactions and, obviously, new weapons, vehicles, clothing, radios (that work with TeamSpeak, check out TFAR!), just about everything. Haven't yet seen a flyable space shuttle, but hey, if you want that, make it and mod it in!"

26123,"its ArmA 3, what can i say. its a buggy mess you sink hours in without even noticing it, messing around with friends, sniping people hundreds of meters away, or just running up and spraying guys on KOTH. its a well made game, that i have almost 1800 hours. i have had so much fun in the last few years, and have never regretted my purchase. while there are many bugs, they normally just end up in a good hearty laugh between team mates, its part of what makes the game a unique game of organized chaos."
26124,"HOW DID I DIE?

(Make sure to get mods, it makes the game WAY better)"
26125,"Terrible game. None of the controls make sense, the controls are more complicated than MSFS 2020, and gets worse FPS than MSFS 2020. You can't do anything unless you pay for $100 in DLC. My friends wouldn't teach me how to play so I spam Y key and instantly die."

26131,"PLAY MODDED.
Arma 3 is a great game framework that has endless opportunities for community content and tailored experiences, however if you are looking to play the game vanilla all i can say is don't. The vanilla gameplay is honestly kind of trash. Bots are unbalenced, there are many pay to win situations regarding the dlc, and gameplay is just not that good. There is no in depth medical system, Communications are tolerable, and there are just too many bugs. However there are many great community mods like the ACE framework and Task Force Radio that make this game soo much better than the vanilla. In the end Arma 3 is a system for making experiences, and i believe this is what it is trying to be sold as, they just aren't doing a good job of it. The editor is incredible."

I hate it being my first 1000 hour game but I dont regret it. I regret playing on life servers, wasteland is the best alongside missions with your friends. I suggest Arma for people who are willing to realize they will die for the first 100 hours. If you dont die alot, your not playing Arma right. Arma is still pain."

26154,"Keeping this one short:
If you plan to buy this, know what you‚Äôre buying it for. If your plan is to just join a random server, good luck! Zues games are ok on official servers, but the bread and butter of Arma 3 is mods, milsim, and life servers, which all require decent experience to get into.
7/10, clunky movement + repeated gameplay loops makes for a mediocre experience only saved by the huge modding community."

26174,"I've seen my closest friends blown to red paste by a T-90. I've watched as a machine gunner gunned down so many leaving them crippled and bleeding out on the floor only for me to make my way over to them to help and them bleeding out in my hands. I've seen so many nuclear explosions that I have probably developed radiation poisoning via my screen, I have seen my commanding officer shot through the chest by a .50 cal when he was giving me orders. -2/12/2021 update- After about 800 hours of Arma 3, it dawned on me that the reason I thought I would love it so much was because of the YouTubers I watched. Womble, Rubix, and so on, made it look like a fun blast. But after a while of playing, I realized that there is a reason for the edits that cut between operations. If you are joining because you watched Womble, remind your self that this game, on its bad days can be the most boring thing for someone who has no idea about the military, or a want to join an armed service. Don't get me wrong, I had plenty of fun, but just as the YouTubers cut out funny moments between a set amount of ops (which mind you unless your server does it every day, it doesn't often happen and is usually either a weekly or bi-weekly thing) don't expect to have each operation be a blast. And don't expect to get to do what you want to do."

aka the game that has the same gameplay experience no matter,
if you are rocking 20 or 200 fps. It's just overall good, from the
stunning graphics to the amount of detail in sound, debrie and
sounds of guns, vehicles and enviroment. I would recommend
this title and the previous ones if you are really into millitary
stuff and the accuracity and realism behind it."

26187,This is a really interesting game! The server may be a little dry at times but it is the best game I've played yet.

26191,"As much as i want to like this game, i just cant. Idk what to do most of the time, there arent many servers to join and i cant even play at all on some as the devs want to push their predatory dlc to me. This game wants you to buy most of their other ""optional"" dlc if you want to enjoy the game and get the most of it. I'd rather just move to another game that is not littered with such awful predatory dlc practice."
26192,"i love this game. As a kid i use to watch so many content creators play this and it was worth the wait now that i have the game I'm so so so happy to wake up in the morning to play this with my gf, And to be honest the fact that the game is loosing a lot of its players makes me sad, its such an amazing game to play with friends i just hate seeing less and less players on it hurts, but none the less i will always enjoy and remember this game as i grow older and if there's one thing i can't wait for is to show my kids one day Arma 3 and to the devs of this game i love you all for putting in all your effort in this game its the best and probably number 1 on my list of games to play.

26243,Its okay.
26244,"Arma 3 is more of a platform. You can play the bare bones single player and the multiplayer. And you also have the option to play on the servers that have mods which enhances the game play. You can subscribe to, download and, play difference scenarios in single player. Some scenarios are really fun and some are kind of dull. It's fun to play arma with mods and, to play it like a role playing game with realistic features."
26245,Classic game. An absolute must have. So many different things you can do on here. Everything from Military Sim to Role playing in a city or zombie apocalypse.
26246,'bout as good as it gets.

26259,I doubt anyone will see this review but on the off chance that you do let me tell you something. This game is amazing. I have been a part of arma culture since before Playerunknown made the battle royal mod and I have found out since that you can really do anything you want with this game. From a little CTI gameplay to full on Simulator realistic game play its incredible. I highly recommend this game and its well worth the investment.
26260,great game
26261,very nice
26262,"This is a great game because its so flexbile and you can do a lot with it. The right way to play it is with a group and do missions i didnt have freinds playing this game but i found a group, and it wasnt that hard to join one"
26263,"DO NOT RECOMMEND.
If you want to play almost any server via the ""Internet"" (not official servers) you'll get constant ""reminders"" on the side of your screen that you don't have the DLC. You'll also get faded logos across your entire screen and the occassional popup directly in the middle of your screen! Not to mention the horrible set up for aiming down sight.
Overall, within 10 minutes I was over their bullshit. And it sure as hell did not encourge me to buy ANY of their DLC.
Horrible treatment on the devs part for adding that crap into the game, ruins it entirely."
26264,very fun
26265,"Campaign firefights go like this.   The first time..., you die and have no idea what happened.  Restart.  Second time you figure out where the fire is coming from..., but you die.   Restart.   The third time, now that you know where the fire is coming from, you revise your tactics..., but you die.  Restart.  Somewhere between play 7 and ten you squeak through.  On to the next mission.   You die."
26266,"Arma 3 is an amazing multiplayer and single player game. It‚Äôs a blast to play with your friends as there‚Äôs an endless amount of possible missions with countless mods you can equip. There‚Äôs also several single player campaigns you can do to learn the game and get better at it. The only really negative thing I can say is how if you use a DLC weapon from a DLC you don‚Äôt own, it will have watermarks cover your screen for a set period of time, which makes it very hard to see anything."
26267,Good game not new player friendly in a sense of knowing where to start fairley good comunity

26278,"Arma 3 is an awesome game to play, and it gets 100x better with mods of the sort!"
26279,tis good yah
26280,Note* Not worth 30$ wait till it goes on sale which it does every few months for about 7$. The bots are annoying cause they are way to good and I even got a mod to make them worse but it didn't help to much. Fairly fun realistic military sim especially with the us army mods I have.

26283,"There is no more broken game in existence. Like Rust, you will see many positive reviews from people who basically dedicate their lives to the game, while everyone else is left wondering if it was ever good, or if unpatched glitches and hackers ruined it along the way"

26311,GOOD GAME . SHOOT FRIEND FROM BUSH - JUMP SCARE
26312,All time favorite game.....I keep coming back to it.
26313,"This game has been there through so much in my life. It has been amazing to quick set up an intense battle or scenario using the map editor. Out of the 1000+ hours I have 99% of those have been spend in the editor. However. The developers need to add more intuitive map editor tools. Easier ways to set up invasion style scenarios and way better building occupation. Mortar and artillery explosions/damage are just clumsy and over powered to the point of leaving them out. For the amount of detail they go into infantry simulation the tanks still use a health bar system. I would expect/hope that the next armour game learns from games such as war thunder with the penetration and side effects of hits. Don't get me wrong. This is a fantastic game. Just... for a game that is aiming to be at the top of the sandbox and simulation it runs the risk of falling short of other games which are starting to take over.

I write this review with the hopes the arma devs get to see this (however I doubt they will). Please. Focus on the sandbox/narrative side of arma. Please factor in the desire of your players to recreate scenes from movies, real life battle events etc. Make it better and easier to set up CQB and intense urban warfare and please please please fix artillery so it is not so OP. As a player I want to start arma and design my own battle scenario to drop into and have a half an hour to hour long battle. I know you guys can do this. Please do this. I beg you!!"
26314,"I'm playing this game just because of helicopters.

Best helicopter sim-lite game you can play today, there's really no other option today."
26315,This games is a really good time killer when you are bored or feeling tactical all in all this game is amazing.
26316,Grate game but only because of the modding community and it if you don't get apex DLC don't bother your time with game almost no content with out. by its self with Apex DLC its ok. but the engine is horrid PC runs at 50% CPU and GPU but its only capable of 60-FPS at best usually 40 to 50 without mods.
26317,Pretty chad.

26326,"Worst ""milsim"" I've played so far, no way to change sensitivity to a set value, physics are bad, you can only vault over(clip through) things instead of jumping, runs like garbage and has a linux version that's not compatible with normal servers. Did I mention you can't get into a vehicle without the DLCs and should you spawn with some DLC gear on you a watermark blocks your WHOLE screen every 2 minutes, be it only a t-shirt. Only game so far that I 100% regret buying"
26327,Great game! Highly suggest
26328,This game is really good with immersion. but to make it better the workshop offers countless amounts of mods to make the experience almost lifelike
26329,smells bad 0/10
26330,N U T   G U D
26331,Immersive military war simulator. Mods are highly recommended.
26332,Probably the most realistic weapons system of any game I have played
26333,nee niet kopen
26334,War crimes simulator is a 10/10... Get the insurgency mod if you wanna have some good ole fun
26335,not much ptsd
26336,confusing at first but after a few hours u will realise there is nothing better than zipping through a town of machine guns on a quadbike
26337,is gud game
26338,its ok. If u are into games where u pretty much do nothing than this is for u
26339,"A strong learning curve for new players who are just getting into FPS games. This game is definitely not an arcade type of game, but rather more for strategic and military simulation tactics to use and play with online and privately in a single player survival to get off of one of the islands. Personally, it has taken me over 120 hours to learn my own way to play, and adapt to new scenarios. Customization of your classes has a wide selection, however most of the different weapons such as Sniper class weapons and vehicle use are only obtainable if you purchase it. I personally believe this is slightly pay to win, especially if you are facing a team with more users that are able to use vehicles, while your team cant. There are lots of workshop content but I find that most of it is outdated and hasnt been updated for a few years at this point. If you enjoy a challenge, and have the money to put forth for the DLCs to use the vehicles, I suppose I would recommend this game - I just wish it was a little more popular. I am tired of playing only one mode instead of anything else due to no one joining those servers."
26340,awersome game i ever played on pc yet
26341,its a cool game so buy it
26342,"This game is amazing, it's just not as amazing when you spend two weeks
Just optimizing everything, and overclocking your AMD software (Which ARMA does not like)
In order to play the game without frequent FPS drops
After that, it was great
Would spend 100s of hours creating scenarios
None that I liked until I finally released one
And after that I couldn't keep up with my own criticism
The game play itself is fun
Single player champagne?
It's not terrible, and it lets you engage in the combat system
Which is tricky to use proficiently let alone master
But other than that, I'd recommend just jumping into multiplayer
Many coop servers exist, so do competitive multiplayer servers
People are generally nice, and it really helps to use a mic
And lower your aim sensitivity, it will save your life
If you are being shot at from behind, you are most likely already dead
This isn't cock of duty 2D, this is the 3D version"
26343,all of my squadmates are monkeys.
26344,very good game
26345,yes very good game!
26346,Its alright
26347,i like this game.

26363,"Total realism. You cannot come under fire and run and jump firing your GPMG at the hip and live. 

You have to go down, roll, observe and use aimed shots to kill the enemy.

Use cover.

Shape, Shine, Shadow, Silhouette, Sound and Movement.

For a Veteran, it is great fun. 

Don't worry about your AI comrades dying. Let them. All that matters is that you survive."

26372,This game is game in my mind is in the top 3 shooter games of all time
26373,"I used to have a girlfriend, used to. Thanks arma. Good game, very recommend."
26374,"its really hard to create missions in editor but other than that its a great game
"
26375,Its very fun and is great for milsims but you do need a good gpu to process the game well
26376,You should play.
26377,"This is a game that if you're not familiar with military sims will be very confusing. if you play solo you will continuously learn mechanics even after 1300+ hours. Trust me i would know. playing with friends will almost end in some form of tomfoolery. i think its a game you can enjoy if you enjoyed games that were challenging, repetitive, and rewarding. you will have moments in this game where you land a 1000 meter (1km) shot and feel like John Wayne or show off some fancy flyin like Han Solo. Other days Players and Ai will have you feeling like Piper Perri. The game is buggier than a New York alleyway with a cut in half potato on the floor but you learn that some can be used to your advantage, king of the hill, wasteland, altis life, and exile are where you will make the most memories. But start on the campaign! as shitty as it is.. it can teach you some basics for your next step to king of the hill. go there and find friends and go onward down your own path.... just please watch the bushes, they're pretty deadly."
26378,very intese
26379,Its good for a more realistic FPS
26380,"This game is a love-hate relationships,

You love to wreck people with an rpg
but hate when you fly a helicopter and it bugs out does a barrel roll and explodes leaving ""you have committed suicide"""
26381,I spent to much time in this sandbox. John Wayne signing off.
26382,"Well it only took me 47hrs to complete!!!!!!! I went for the alternate ending that I read a tiny bit about just for fun. The only level without save points and didn't manage to die in the first play through (WTF!) unlike some other levels that took 30 attempts!!!!!! For anyone who has not played this. If your thinking about just DO IT. like a good book once it started i could not stop. YES i died a whole lot Yes i swore a whole lot but its good fun really. my adrenaline raced for sure, really immersive. But its real easy to get killed most of the time by something i didn't see!!
Now wheres my in game tool box!!! plenty of dead wagons on that island need fixing!! Just glad i was fixing infantry vehicles in my service for queen and country rather than infantry if i go by the death rate in this game.  ;)
"
26383,yese
26384,"pretty fun, keybinds r complicated tho so good luck with that lol"
26385,"I gotta say..the moment this game went on sale, i NEW i couldnt miss this offer. No regrets whatsoever after i bought this. i met so many people playing this game and its amazing. You can download any mods you would like to use! You can add zombies, add star wars o it or even halo! and many more. if youre new to this game, im pretty sure you are gunna like this one. trust me."
26386,"wow mazon
"
26387,"One of the best, if not THE BEST military simulation out there. The capability of the base game with mods makes for an amazing time especially if you are playing with a group of people. The campaigns are amazing, the worlds are beautiful, and it has a great gun play."
26388,"Its good i guess.
2/10 clean.
7/10 modded."
26389,"Although game itself is pretty great I love it waaaay more with mods. Arma 2 objects/maps and new maps and procedurally generated missions mixed with those mods make me comeback to game time to time and do a few missions. Not much of a multiplayer fan of this game but it is still great if you do things like zeus with random people. Thanks to arma 3 I cant play most of the fps games as they come off pretty different. Hard recommend for anyone want to somewhat simulation but also want to have fun. Its a good mix of both.
Only downside its heavy on your pc if you want to see far.
9.5/10 For me great game."
26390,Great Game!
26391,Nice
26392,Good milsim game
26393,"You enter the game, you play after you die for the first time and you respawn, actually you can't move the character doesn't load, the map loads then it starts again, it's simply 0 optimized and it doesn't make you pleasure in playing, moreover you lose about 7-8 hours for positioning but when you get into a fight so as not to crash or else you don't have to enter as a player in figh, but only the boots, I'm not saying that if they collide 2 vehicles, they practically jump in the air"
26394,sick ass game
26395,Very good milsim
26396,"I think I have PTSD? Honestly you can do so much, The game will piss you off at times with some bugs and issues but playing with a good group of friends makes it all worth"
26397,PTSD
26398,good
26399,war
26400,play with friends.
26401,Fantastic Game!!
26402,"To keep it simple, 
It is a good game, but public servers are very noisy and can be hard to deal with at times. Most people play with communities, and with an extensive list of mods that improve gameplay and add more depth to the game. However, that is not to say that there is not fun to be had with the base game. I learned how to fly helicopters in public lobby Warlords games, and finally figured out how to best use VTOLs. 
Single player is PUNISHING. Even on lower difficulties you can get knocked down in one or two hits, which, to be fair, fits the high realism simulation that is advertised, but at the same time can be annoying running the same checkpoint five times trying to figure out how to get past an area."
26403,i have developed actual gamer-ptsd after playing this game
26404,Simply the best game ever. I hope it never dies
26405,"One of the most system taxing, clunkiest and least user friendly games you can get for $60."
26406,awesome
26407,Arma 3
26408,One of the best games to have ever been made. Hands down.
26409,Wow epic truly post
26410,If you don't want to have a life and spend thousands of hours of you life on a video game here you go.
26411,One of my favourite games of all time. have played since operation flashpoint and I look forward to the next release as well. This is a must have game in your libary with all the workshop content and modded servers aswell this welcomes players who like roleplay/survival as well as many other modded servers.
26412,"EVERY GOSH DARN TIME I TRY TO PLAY IT SAYS: You were not able to join this server due to how it was set up, try again in 200-300 seconds."
26413,Its alright.
26414,good
26415,"good
"
26416,GUN GO BANG. TANK GO BOOM. HELICOPTER GO WOOSHWOOSHWOOSHWOOSH.
26417,never ending fun and aderline pumping moments
26418,"In short i love this game. 

Pros:
The campaign is decent not anything crazy good but its there and some fun when your alone. 
The scenario editor is great and while complecated at first once you watch a few videos you can make some decent scenarios for you and your friends to play and i still now am discovering new things in teh editor that lets me make my scenarios better than before. This also allows you to make some basic sandbox testing ranges so you can just run around and blow stuff up.
The best part about this game is the modding scene. I have 56GB of mods installed not because of a lack of content in the main game but because there is so much that you can add to make this game even cooler. The RHS mod pack adds the entire vehicle and weapon lineup of countries like the USA and Russia. You can do so much with mods that can completely change your game for the better adding in new assets, scenarios, and tools.

Cons:
The game is poorly optimized so if you dont have a decent pc you may run into some major frame drops.
I kind of wish there was a bit more realism such at having to check you magazine to see how much ammo you have left among other features but that can be added in with mods very easily.
It can be hard to get into at first. Unless your already really into milsim games your going to want a friend thats already into the game to help guide you so you can get hooked quicker. If you dont have friends watching some youtube videos from people like operator drewski definitly will send you on a quest to have the most fun you can possibly have in this game.
The graphics are a bit outdated since it came out in 2013 but this doesnt take away from the actual gameplay.

Conclusion:
If you are already into milsim games get this game, plain and simple. If you want to get into milsims i would wait for a sale since they happen often and often see the game going for under $15."
26419,"Lots of content, way more fun with friends then solo but the campaign is still fun"
26420,trash
26421,Great game
26422,"super buggy, didnt run very well, even with my chunky computer"

26427,"Join a Milsim group. Modded Arma doesn't disapoint. Active community several years later!
"
26428,The game itself is kinda fun but the online KOTH is the best thing
26429,"This game is supposed to be the pinnacle of military simulation. It is very complex, but I was willing to invest the time. Unfortunately, the game's performance was crap. I bought a new gaming PC for 2000 monies and reinstalled. Still shitty performance. No, thanks."
26430,Great military simulator. give arma 4 already
26431,"Arma 3 good, very nice pew pew."
26432,So realistic
26433,"Jousted HEMMTS and one flew 10 km across the map

10/10. 

seriously though buy this damn game"
26434,"I love this game. I began on an amd 4300 a few years back and this has provided endless fun and exploring. 
Overall fun and adventurous experience, be ready to learn many key binds and enjoy hours of entertainment."
26435,"This game is only playable because for the workshop community, because they added a camo that kinda looks like beans"
26436,"After watching reading some reviews and watching some streamers gameplay on Arma 3, i never realised how much i would really enjoy this Army based Simulator. 
This realistic based Simulator meets all my expectations from single player scenarios all the way through to online co-op and PVP servers, along with the many choices of the players choice of weapon kit outs and vehicle choices. Another great addition to Arma 3 is having the choice of additional community based mods and content, which allows for variation across the board.
I have had an awesome experience with an Invade & Annex server, where i have found the players to be 
 serious, casual and everything in between, as we take on the AI trying to storm the HQ we are defending from all directions. As players start to drop you hear people calling ""MEDDDDIIIIIC"" with a fake cough and splutter over the mic as they are waiting to be resurrected, along with players praying to the in game gods to give them that slight chance of revival.
Casualties will occur as the insurgents take no hostages and will drop you like a sack of potatoes if you are not careful. This Simulator that has been finely polished to meet player expectations through updates and released DLC, which is proven due to the game being released 2013 and still having a massive player base. I would easily rate this Simulator a solid 9-9.5/10"
26437,"is the best WAR simulation game
"
26438,love creating my own scenorios but it tends to get laggy even without mods
26439,game bad
26440,"Arma has it's appeal. I dont play it often and I dont plan to any time soon. But it is a good game. If you are looking for a realistic, slow paced, tactical milsim, than Arma is your plan. Fill any sort of military role, a sniper, a rifleman, a medic, a tank driver or gunner, a helicopter pilot or gunner, a jet fighter, or even pilot remote drones. Now this is not to say this game does not have it's shortcomings. Arma is notorious for it's physics glitches, and even if you play for a short time, you will definitely encounter one or another.

Overall, a great milsim game. Would recommend for anyone who dose'nt like to have fun."
26441,yeet
26442,"I like the game, its good"
26443,Good
26444,The game is very fun if you can find the right group to play with.
26445,so real love it !
26446,eh its alright
26447,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."
26448,good

26456,it sucks ass
26457,worst optimised game ever but good
26458,"It's the best walking simulator on the market.

The Campaign is great, the gun fights are god tier, flying mechanics are the best in any game I've played, ground vehicles are great and each one has their perfect use as well as being universal. The level for improvement is always there but of course you can just be stomped at any point.

A great and fantastic thing about the game that deserves it own section is the physics. The boys really outdid themselves this time. I've never seen such amazing physics in a game since Space Engineers, as we know has no problems what so ever in the physics department. When you play be sure to give your friends a nice bump in a tank when they are in there vehicle or helicopter your mind will be absolutely blown by how good they did. The physics alone make the game an 11/10.

Remember everyone! There are no such things as bugs only features!
But seriously great game to play with friends, plenty of scenarios, game modes, severs to pick from. The modding community is fantastic and alive making the game have so much more playability.

8/10 overall"

26468,Overall a great game. Dlc's are a little pricey but the implementation of crossplay with those that do and don't have them is brill. Always a server with over 80 players on. Alive and kicking
26469,Best military simulation you can get!
26470,"I have played too many hours on Arma 3. This game owes me my life back, seriously, once you find a good server to play with good admin and mods, your life will be consumed.

The base game isn't worth playing, without the modding community, this game would be nothing and you will need to be prepared to download 80GB or more of mods on top of the base game. The game also needs good hardware, without a decent PC you'll be getting 30FPS."
26471,"cool game, do like"
26472,Made many memorable moments with this game. Community game modes and mods make this game.
26473,"great game, very immersive"
26474,The mods are great.
26475,great game
26476,"WOW so they take away TEAMSPEAK SUPPORT? What is this, me and my buddies used Teamspeak 3 ingame chat all the time, and now they just take it away and force us to subscribe to their dumb in game chat. 

also not to mention this whole alien dlc its not even fun and it reminds me of a cheap dlc EA would put out... whats next... lootboxes... these guys are greedy devs who made a barelky unrealistic game... and with the new flight simualtor i bet all the community is going to switch games...

the new fligth sim is going to bury this game in the dust."
26477,good game depending on your skill and stuff. this game is realism heavy is certain aspects (in MP the physics aren't the best). I'm not a fan of how a lot of content that should be in base game is a dlc (ie: vehicle packs) but  its not a big deal i guess. still a fun game though

26482,"es gucci game. ver gud, ver hap"
26483,yes
26484,"A hard game to master but satisfying once you know the ins and outs of it, single player campaigns are mediocre, the Old Man scenario probably the best of the lot"
26485,ciio
26486,"good game if you like the miltary
"
26487,GARBO
26488,every MOD is broke
26489,"Good game, it's worth buying and even a better deal when the game is on a sale.

It was a real mess at start but now it's really well optimize."
26490,"This game has a ton of replay value.  It isn't really optimized very well, and the engine really is dated.  There is still great fun to be had here if you like military simulators."

26492,I is fun but very hard.
26493,woooooooooooooow
26494,yes

26496,fun but very complicated and takes a hot minute to learn all the key bindings

26498,AAAh
26499,athira cops caught me slipping once ok so what
26500,"Hate this game.
The controls are not standard, the map is useless, the difficulty is absurd.
Total waste of money.
I have thousands of hours of FPS games and by far this one was the most disappointing one.
Single player campaign is hard to understand, you can't see yourself on the map... man, this is ridiculous."
26501,"I keep coming back to this game, not even to participate in combat, just to play zeus in singleplayer. It's one of the best sandbox games i've ever played."
26502,supreme
26503,yuh good gum
26504,so much to do so little time
26505,Without the extra dlc or 10 mods you can not play this game every time you try it will just kick you out. I think this is a game for players who have been playing it for years but as a new comer it is unplayable. searching for a game is a joke it just says no servers found
26506,Fun but play with a group of friends.
26507,gg
26508,walking simulator 11/10
26509,AWESOME

26512,noob game
26513,never gets old..... I've had some great memories playing this game with friends and the community is full of rad people.

26517,ok
26518,"Those who re looking real simulation of war, u should try this games. full simulation of war and hard like shit if u play solo. great experience of army and feel like in army academy"
26519,juicy game
26520,still swag
26521,I like the amount of game modes and good graphics.
26522,amazing
26523,Realism is satisfying. Eden Editor blew me away.
26524,cool guns
26525,this is possibly the least fun game ever not pog suck my nuts never got into a game (MODDED)
26526,"Arma is like an abusive relationship that you can never get out of. I think half the hours I've put into this game are just play sessions with my friends of us trying to fix the game. The other hours were mostly spent in the editor making missions. I'd recommend this game be played casually with little to no mods. Otherwise, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out."
26527,"This game is hard in all of the right ways. If you do not work as a team (AI or player), you will die. The graphics are a bit outdated in 2020, but the gameplay is solid. What really makes Arma 3 special is the overwhelming community support BI offers and the very active workshop community. If you are looking for a muli-faceted game, you have found it."
26528,fun
26529,"1000 hours of my life i will never get back, 10/10"
26530,"its an amazing game but still needs some work
"
26531,Great Game Highly recomend you check out anzus gaming
26532,"Great game, must but!"
26533,"3 of the 6 hours i've spent on this game were spent trying to figure out how to change the bindings so that i hold ADS instead of toggle.



I wish I was joking"
26534,The fact that you need to enable port forwarding or download a port forwarding app to host a simple private session is absolutely fucking insane. Whatever idiot thought that giving players the ability to play together in co-op missions without jumping through all these hoops wasn't necessary needs to be fired.
26535,not the tow missiles
26536,"If you haven't heard of ArmA III then i believe you live under a rock. 

THE best military sandbox there is or maybe even the best sandbox period. The core game already offers nearly endless opertunities for gameplay and modding brings this game to ,in my eyes, legendary status. 

A must-have."
26537,"Always a great game, and will always be positive because they support and allow modding."
26538,Its realy good game with lots of difrent mods and original stuff.
26539,Tactics
26540,this game is so much fun i cant stop playing it
26541,"Solid game, few bugs due to the engine but doesn't make the game unplayable. If you're look for better experience, I highly recommend this game with at least 2+ friends, solo only goes so far in this game."
26542,best game altis life
26543,I dont like this type of game Squad better
26544,Game is better when you have a consistent group of people to play Zeus/Custom missions
26545,its pretty good ig
26546,yes

26549,not bad

26551,"Make sure you have some people to play it with first. Once you've done that, go for it."
26552,"No
Edit - Still No 43 Hours later
Edit 2 - 400 Hours Later - Still No
Edit 3 - 502 more additional hours - Arma 3 is a horrendous disappointment of a game. The developers at Bohemia Interactive need to rethink their entire game development if this game is not to die within the next....idk ten twenty years? The game only survives based on mods, and modding support. The community is toxic, cancerous, and childish. You will not enjoy your time playing Arma 3, but you won't stop. Do not buy this game. It is horrible."
26553,amazing
26554,"No need to buy a dlc, just mods and hit :)"

26558,ok
26559,"good game. haven't even tried the mods yet
"
26560,they said ive played for 75 hours. Ive barely played it for 10. They say that to get other people to buy it. Look its a good game but that is a rotten tactic
26561,dead game in 2020 servers full with npcs
26562,It's very realistic. If anyone is really into Military games then I 100% recommend this game.
26563,Awesome. Play King of the Hill
26564,a classic
26565,10/10 Honestly.
26566,the mods

26597,10 out of 10 amazing game would suggest that you guys get this game fun everyone is nice in the servers and stuff like that they will teach you the ways of this game I just got this game yesterday and I highly enjoy this game played it for 4 hours this morning. :)
26598,Played it a bit. Its ok.

26601,Dude this sh*t needs to came with RTX 2070 Or something like that. like what the hell is that fps bro
26602,yes
26603,A amazing game
26604,"Its probably the best Mil-Sim game out there for a reasonable price, and still to this day receives constant updates from the devs."
26605,"game good, goodbye."
26606,"this game turned my gay
"
26607,the game is ok
26608,regret every minute i spent in this game
26609,"The one thing I hate is the still poor performance Hog these games are known for. But other than that they are still fun games to play in coop, if you manage to create one since creating a server sucks here."
26610,It's not bad.
26611,ye
26612,GOOD
26613,It has been a fun long ride but lately the game starts to show its age.
26614,This game has a great and very supportive community of players and content creators that really continue to bring you back for more.
26615,"Janky as hell and performs terribly on an ancient engine, but it's bearable if you have a decent single core performance. 
Should also mention that I've had no end of technical issues, tens of hours wasted trying to sort out problems that will actively evolve to avoid being fixed, and sometimes complete or partial incompatibility with some people's games and servers. 
There's also not that much to the game without mods. 

So why am I recommending this? 

If you find the right people to play with, it's a blast. Plenty of mods and replayability because of the very creative community. Plenty of war crimes and memes. Some of the moments that occur during gameplay you won't find in any other game. That includes the brokenness too :)
Would not recommend for peer to peer co-op play with friends unless you have port-forwarding or pay for a server."
26616,
26617,"Great game, best with friends who know what they're doing. Join a unit."
26618,"Amazing game
Is gud"
26619,good game love the creative mode it so fun to play this game is so gun to pays with freinds or buy your self
26620,good

26622,Never gets old!
26623,no banana
26624,Yes
26625,"It's very tactical realistic. So if you don't want a challenge do not play this game, but if you do it's one hell of an adventure"
26626,"This is probably the most coolest game I've played, would recommend."
26627,"Overall I've loved getting back into Arma 3, I've started a Zeus campaign with my friends and they are all loving the DnD style of play I'm giving."
26628,I drone striked three syrian families under order of the obama administration good game
26629,Good game
26630,I've had so much fun with this game over the years nothing to really complain about
26631,it's ok
26632,really good game only problem is lack of servers not sure if its just here in oz but its the only downside
26633,Whens Arma 4 gonna come out?
26634,I am having alot of fun playing this game on Milsim servers.
26635,its good
26636,mint game
26637,"This game series has always been the most realist in terms of mil-sim style games, the mechanics allow for a great degree of control. The detail in game is probably as close to real as it gets for a game of this scale. The open world challenges the player to complete tasks without spoon feeding you a story line. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a in depth shooter that is unparalleled compared with more ""popular"" shooters such as call of duty. There are so many options it can become a bit overwhelming though, you have to truly invest yourself to this game to play the campaigns."
26638,1
26639,Liked the free play
26640,Its overall still a fun game to play
26641,War Crime Simulator: 2013
26642,"If you enjoy tac-sims and good game-play this is a very good game. Be prepared to walk atleast 3 marathons and die on first contact, the first few times you play."
26643,"An awesome game built up by lazy devs and dedicated fans, Arma 3 after near 7 years still doesn't use more than 2 cores of my CPU not even close to 2/3 of their usage utilization, same as DayZ SA boheima stalled on this one and solely handed it to the players and sat back while enjoying user-made content keeping their games alive. note that this review is only and only because of bad optimization of this game after 7 years and continued ""support"". you have earned so much money use it on a new engine or buy one it's not acceptable to play relatively light mod like king of the hill with 30-40 fps."
26644,requires mods to be fun and is buggy as can be
26645,its arma
26646,Its the best
26647,"awesome
"
26648,Its a good mil-sim
26649,"I would highly recommend this game if you love realism, movement, strategy, modability, or sandboxes. If you find a good unit or group of friends to play with, it is an extremely fun team based game with almost infinite possibilities."
26650,good game
26651,Good
26652,"There are no female characters and it is impossible to play as a woman. 

10/10"
26653,Best game ever
26654,"Hard to get into, hard to get out"
26655,Its enjoyable
26656,one of the best games ever
26657,it's a milsim so if you want call of duty you'll hate it and if you like running or crawling through bushes for 3 hours to shoot 3 guys then you'll love it
26658,dqwDQWD
26659,Steam is making do a review. Its a good game 9/10 dentists would recomend
26660,Buy this game if you wanna play soldier if not then it isnt for you there are no i repeat NO GROUPS WHO ARE CHILL they have no people who want to relax and have fun so not a fun game exept if u want to act like a soldier
26661,"its a fun game, cool story, cool editor especially with mods"
26662,"if you aren't playing with friends, it's a bad game. its a good game with friends"
26663,this game has so much to do
26664,Very good game. you should get it.
26665,pretty cool game
26666,litty titty! :)
26667,Pretty bad ngl
26668,"Great game! Worth it if you want a realistic fps. I would argue that Arma2 has better and more realistic AI, but Arma 3 is just so much smoother, gameplay wise."
26669,great game got hooked up with task force 121 check it out everyone semi mil sim with huge groupe of guys asd awesome to play with many units to choose from and alot of fun check out task force 121 on fb
26670,ikju
26671,"It's realistic, it's deadly, it's frustrating, it's maddening, it's frantic, it's fun, it's...Arma. Call of Duty pussies, beware.

On a more serious note: I wish they would implement the user friendliness of a game like Ghost Recon in terms of controls. That would be a magic blend.

Either way, 10/10 sim/game."
26672,"pretty good
get good friends to play with and you're good to go
in case you don't have good friends, hit me up with a dm"
26673,A MUST-HAVE Game. One of the best games ever. I strongly recommend you to buy this game.
26674,Yes.

26676,If you like realistic games this is your game.
26677,Great
26678,"Arma / 10

What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is probably the jankiest piece of software I have ever touched. Through careful study and occult divinings to the machine gods I have compiled a mostly complete list of things that can break Arma in some critical way.

1) Mod interaction
2) Unsupported drivers
3) Supported drivers
4) Settings
5) Nvidia Surround Display
6) Windows updates
7) Graphics driver updates
8) New hardware
9) Old hardware
10) ACE Hardware
11) Bad internet settings
12) Missing a sacrifice to the god of ArmAScript
13) Not standing and saying the pledge of allegiance

This list is by no means complete but can be used as a general guide of 'things to be careful around for a pleasant Arma experience.' All that being said this is a great game for a 60 year old retiree. I highly recommend this game if that's you, otherwise this game is going to be a war crime on your senses."
26679,"This was one of the absolute worst games I ever played. I don't usually play multiplayer games at all, so I tried the single player mode and my god did it suck. I was expecting something along the lines of COD. I thought this would be good because unlike COD, you actually have soldiers that fight alongside you that get injured and you don't have to do all the work. However, the biggest problem are the goddamn controls damn it. I mean for god's sake the keyboard config menu doesn't even list basics like w,a,s, and d to move. The controls are just confusing af. You can't enjoy this game if you're a COD or battlefield player who isn't willing to go to the local hypnotist to have your brain reprogrammed to play a FPS without using the normal and basic controls for one. I mean in this game there isn't even a way to AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS! You would think that would just be a fucking basic for a FPS war game. If you played old PSP SOCOM you may get this but I can't even guarantee that. If you're a COD or Battlefield player who doesn't want their brain broken don't play this game, because I literally have a headache from just trying to play it."
26680,"okay so finally after 7 years ill write this review. do you smoke crack? Arma is my crack. whenever daddy needs a bit of the old ultra violence, shes there and with a modding community that is just mind blowing. also this game will eat your rig. mo no you are sittting there like but mines a blah blah blah...arma no care. deal with it. my love of programing comes frome the heady days of flashpoint resistance...they say it takes a man 10k hours to be considered a master..."
26681,"Eh, It's ok."
26682,"I Fucking Love Arma, best military sim that you can mod into basically any thing.
"
26683,"I haven't got too deep into the game yet. I do like the mechanics though, would recommend."
26684,"make sure you have good cpu
dint play zeus
find a group to play with
gucci"
26685,"I'm not sure I've put this many hours into any game before, I have atleast another 1000hrs on another account as well.   The only real con to this game is that it's framerate sucks even on a decent machine.  The game is so good however that 7 years later there are still many of servers to choose from even with limited fps for most players.  If Arma 4 is just Arma 3 optimized to run at 120+ FPS, I'd buy it.

Helicopter piloting is challenging and highly rewarding.

Best sniping of any multiplayer game.

The community is one of the best I've played with as well."
26686,awesome game with friends
26687,If you like penis you will enjoy this game since you constantly get rammed in the ass by tanks from over a 1000m
26688,good game
26689,no just no the controls gave me cancer
26690,Awesome game great community bohemia is doing something right to keep arma 3 a good game with a solid community
26691,Great game for the price and has a plenty of mod support.
26692,in this game you will spend 50% of you time running in a field and 50% of your time committing war crimes
26693,"It's a highly customizable game that is better with the DLC as you don't get the giant watermark in your face. Overall, a great sandbox in a pretty realistic style sim."
26694,"Incredibly realistic with or without mods, just can't recommend this enough, the realism hits hard besides the very few bugs lmao"
26695,"Its nice , just too many dlc's to buy"
26696,good game++++

26703,best military simulator
26704,"I have sunk about 78 hours into this game at the time of writing this. But in the grand scheme of the game, I have accomplished NOTHING. 200 hours for this game is considered nubile. I have yet to learn all the key binds, (Which will take me months of straight playing to learn.) This game is great, if you wanna make ops with friends and mess around, you can do that (albeit with a lot of googling and YouTube tutorials.) With only a couple hours in this game, i can Wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone."
26705,"HI
"
26706,"Overall one of the best Realistic shooters out there. Really recommend getting this if you like a realistic military experience. Get yourself situated in a milsim group, and before you know it you're addicted."

26708,'FUN' - J_MACK_
26709,"really enjoyable game, fun mechanics, can be infuriating sometimes but, it's props heavily outweigh the cons. multiplayer? amazing, well optimized, fun to play with friends, get yourself a crew and you could play for days, i know i have. mods galore for every possibility you could possibly want, the game really never gets old."
26710,"Get some mods, Get some Friends and you will have a great time."
26711,"is gut gem, yes"

26717,awesome community
26718,lets rock
26719,"This game is pretty bad. The campaign is alright, but you don't even get half of the missions available before having to purchase another DLC. As for multiplayer, the lobbies are some of the worst I've ever seen, reminded me a lot of Garry's Mod lobby searchers except worse because you don't know if you have the map or the file installed. Not to mention most of the servers are dead, no players in them but for some reason they are still up on the top of the list. The devs seemed to have given up long ago, it's a desert of a game. Honestly don't get Arma III, if you're looking for a combat sim you're better off with... I dunno what to even recommend, you'd probably get more realistic combat out of Battlefield V just cause you'd actually get more play time lmao.

If I could refund I would, but unfortunately I've spent so much time just trying to figure out how this dang game works that I'm no longer eligible."
26720,"BEST GAME FOR Ever i Want Arma 4 right now  !
"
26721,"Look. This game is good. Well, usually. But if you only play single player stuff, you should skip this. ARMA *has* a single-player campaign, but it's a multiplayer game at heart. And it's a multiplayer game that's based on working with your team, so you should find a unit to join."
26722,great milsim
26723,Seriously un-fun
26724,oi

26731,Amazing game if you're into tactical FPS games.  Tons of mods to play around with.

26750,hi
26751,over 2000 hours of pain and misery....... I love it!!
26752,"Yes, Fun!"
26753,"playing with friends is fun, and playing with a big group and taking the mission seriously is very intense but fun none the less.


recommend you join a milsim group to have the best experience"
26754,Its pretty fun...
26755,good game
26756,Great job.
26757,"only use cpu not gpu
"
26758,"I tried launching the game, but ever since i bought it back in like 2015, it hasnt opened / lauched once. i want my MONEY BACK!!! i dont understand this launcher, where is the game? greatest czechlovakian skammers in the world apparrentyly , faking screenshots n gameplay for a game that does not run!!!"
26759,Really fun game. I laid prone on a mountain top for like 1 hour irl too just get domed as i stood up 10/10 but actually it's a really fun game with a great community if you're thinking about buying it do it.
26760,very bad game
26761,"had anal for the first time on a3l, great time"
26762,"Great game, lots of content. Still alive after many years"
26763,you shoot people
26764,"Oldie but goodie, aged well, bit of a learning curve but worth the invested time. base game has plenty to do that will keep you busy for hours, do recommend getting all the dlc to get the best possible experience. at the very least Apex as it gives ""Old Man"" campaign which is an awesome open world set in the Arma Universe and really shows that the future of Arma is burning bright. Even once you completed all that Arma has to offer there  is a massive community support of mods and missions you can do or even create your own with the editor or Zeus. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a solid Milsim experience that things like Call of Duty cant offer."
26765,It can be a lot of fun with friends.

26768,best game ever

26776,There are so many routes you can take with this game. Have fun and explore the possibilities!
26777,No.
26778,"its a simulation its as fun as you make it. the community is pretty nice as well from having people to call in airstrikes, to decent pilots, to even the hardcore servers with rank structures. the only thing that gets me is the dlc being pretty pricy for the complete package."
26779,"I got shitty graphics/specs about 20 fps when not in a fight and bout 8 fps when shit happens
still i love this game because of the unit communication / cooperative gameplay

outside of perfomance issues i would highly consider this game as one of a kind cooperative game
and the communinity has less toxicity than a caf√© house in the 20th century most of the time

update:
i got a pc that can handle it
i just want to reinforce, ITS WORTH IT
graphics look amazing even for a game for its time it stands up for today's standard too


it worth your money if you can afford the specs"
26780,played with my dad and was always good times
26781,might have gotten me a bit hard

26786,"very good simulator and game, can be fun with friends, even alone, but it is not for everyone."
26787,"The game mechanics are excellent. Graphics and textures (if your PC can handle it) are amazing for such an old game. The community surrounding it will have the usual toxicity in any military simulation game, but has equal positive value to it from all the other players who want to enjoy the experience.

Game is a 10/10 in my book."
26788,ENDLESS FUN.. if you're new watch youtube to help the first times players.. mods make this game even better
26789,KoTH great game mode
26790,it very good gun shooter game
26791,pow pow
26792,can be good
26793,"ARMA has always been hard to handle without a good CPU. I've great times playing for so many years, still one of my favorites!"
26794,Best milsim out there at the moment in terms of mechanics and freedom. Wish the engine would be updated (like a #4?) but otherwise worth the money any day.
26795,It's pretty good
26796,um militar
26797,ITS GOOD
26798,id rather go to prison with a life sentence then be forced to play this sad excuse for a game
26799,Dude this is like the best damn game ever to play roleplay and do military operations with your friends on. I give my love to the creaters. Thank you for making this game its really fun.

26802,"The game has everything fir people who want to milsim and commit war crimes. But it's buggy as hell, and not that well optimised."
26803,Go Karts
26804,LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
26805,g
26806,awesome
26807,"It's okay, need Arma 4 though"
26808,"Is the GOAT, worth the money,most of the DLC are worth it aswell just pick and choose if you dont wanna splurge.between the workshop and countless servers with many different modes this game has nearly unlimited replayability.expect Arma to be Arma at times and you wont be disappointed"
26809,gmae gud
26810,"If you are still waiting to buy this game, don't be like me and wait. Buy it now, especially if you enjoy making your own skirmishes (in-game editor and plenty of AI). Works offline (most of my hours so far have just been making scenarios in the editor). It's definitely more fun playing with or against other players, so keep that in mind. Could use a little more optimization but runs averagely around 50 - 60 fps on my ROG, i7, gtx 1070. Mods make this game better too. Just keep in mind that you will be downloading some hefty mods like the CUP mods for more maps, characters, weapons, etc."
26811,YAY BOY
26812,:)
26813,"If I had to chose only one game to play for the rest of my life, this is the one."
26814,I only use the editor but game is still fun
26815,its good
26816,good gam
26817,no
26818,"be prepared to download 80 gigs in mods

*edit:100 gigs"
26819,BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED SO FAR
26820,"The most realistic milsim game out there. It doesn ªt get any better than arma 3. Any and every military vehicle, weapon, item, and even land terrain out there is in this game. If its on sale get it, if its not on sale still get it. This is every military gamer ªs wet dream. It ªs such a great game that i bought a computer just to play it."
26821,"I mainly play Arma online multiplayer modes and Warlords especially. It offers a fantastic free world war experience where you can collaborate with other players and command your AI squad. You can CPs to buy off-roaders, tanks helicopter, boats or fixed-wing aircraft. It's like old battlefield games but more realistic and tactical.

The relatively old age of this game shows in some graphics and physics modelling. For example you might very well be able to destroy or catapult a tank by colliding a jeep on it even if it's not much more than a scratch or fender bender. Such  instances are not particularly common because you usually wont get a chance to get close to an enemy tank or vice versa but it occasionally leads to unintended team killing. Despite a few frustrating or amusing bugs the game is pretty solid.

If you want a good war game with tanks and all this is good candidate. It also has noticeably modest system requirements so you can run on older hardware or laptops. Check the recommendations before buying it to make sure."
26822,pretty good considering age. desync is both a blessing and a curse.
26823,"I dunno, haven't played much, looks pretty cool."
26824,"I guess, its ok"
26825,Really good for hyper-realistic modern warfare
26826,"Awesome game, love the KoTh gamemodes"
26827,no
26828,fukn sucks
26829,very good
26830,"Been playing ArmA for a while.  From ArmA 2 to now, I've seen a lot of changes and some major improvements.  I wouldn't really call it a sandbox type, but you can pretty much do whatever you want in terms of misisons, addons, and other fun stuff.  I'd definitely recommend."
26831,Pretty good
26832,"Very Good game
LOTS OF FUN"
26833,yes
26834,A lot of lugs
26835,nothing like it
26836,"I have been playing this for almost 20 years (when Operation Flashpoint, OFP was released) and have enjoyed every minute.  There is not a 'game', rather more of a sim along with it, an editor that you can create about any type of mission you wish.  The missions do not even have to weapons, it could be a race as an example.  The best sim ever!  :)"
26837,good game very immersive content
26838,"Best military sandbox game ever with operation flashpoint being my first entry into the series, despite being 7 years old, unoptimized and suffering form performance issues in multiplayer to this day which is understandable since we run this game with 100 Gbs of mods made by what I consider one of the best communities ever.
I do find some of the DLCs overpriced, like APEX and Contact, and some of them should have been added as updates but we have High quality mods like RHS for free.
You can play this game however you like, super tactical with complex ops or casual with simple objectives but still complicated at first for people new to the series though so you have to get the tutorials.
The only game I don't plan to ever uninstall even with Arma 4 looming in the far far horizon."
26839,"i can commit war crimes without any consequences, whats not to love"
26840,A great game fun to play with friends Word of warning you need to be willing to get used to the weird controls of the game otherwise its a great game
26841,great mil sim game
26842,best AI I have ever seen in a video game
26843,"its fun 
"
26844,well its more of a maby because so boring sometimes with the editor and not as realistic as arma 2
26845,"man get in big gun rock and shoot at cave of enemy

enemy die by rock explosion and me win"
26846,"Great Millitary Simulator, Enjoyed it alot!"
26847,awesome game
26848,I've greatly enjoyed the Arma series even dating back to the Operation Flashpoint games. Arma 3 has so much going on to keep you entertained and plenty of great mods and communities to get involved with.
26849,Sick af
26850,not bad
26851,I enjoy the game.... warlords is fun ig.... just don't understand why the need to restrict specific vehicles and such to DLC but I still bought them.... that's about it.
26852,nice
26853,Not bad
26854,fun
26855,"Just incredible how good this game is!  

10/10 would recommend"
26856,"Good game overall, Wasteland servers my favorite game mode."
26857,fun game 10 points
26858,Very nice game. I play a lot of role play with my Discord server. Kinda boring playing alone. Best if played with friends (if you have) and some mods. 10/10 Would buy again
26859,gib arma 4 now
26860,.
26861,awesome :)
26862,"Nice game I recommend you play it,Cus its also FUn"
26863,Server crashes at least three per day sometimes after having put in lots of work into the mission and then not being able to complete the mission.  Seems to be glitchy ill be happier when they update the ARMA  engine . Also no mods seem to work especially the Enhanced Movement mod which the game really needs and i dont have these are obtained in the steam workshop but dont work the game needs better movement controls  for climbing etc inside the official game. Could be a good game but misses the mark. Bring on ARMA 4 hopefully that will be better.
26864,"Good fun, great co-op multiplayer. Servers still active. The Apex DLC contains some very good missions to play singleplayer or co-op. Definitely recommend this over Squad or any other realistic shooter. Can become tiring, sometimes a bit of a walking simulator.
Graphics: 6/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Performance: 6/10
Buy it on sale, it goes on sale fairly often. Play the tutorial before playing.

26870,The most Childish Community ever
26871,This is something I play with the husband and his mates. it's decent when compared to the previous versions. Has far more in the mechanics of it than Arma 2. Which is a -good- thing.
26872,good
26873,stupid fun
26874,"""what button is that again"" simulator"
26875,"Doesn't really need to be said but this is the best milsim experience out there. Slap a few mods and its also visually pleasing and extremely atmospheric at times. The vannila campaigns are very good and very well made, the community created stuff is just as good if not better and far more abundant. Sure the AI can be a bit fucky at times but nothing a few mods and persistence won't fix.

Really don't get if you don't know what your getting into, or it'll just be another game rotting in your library. This game is fucking hard, but really fun once you get into it."

26881,"Realistic warfare simulator with some questionable realism and a plethora of bugs. 

I spent 2 hours trying to trigger a mission during the campaign. Poor tutorial section makes me google all the stuff I need. 

During online toxic community of tacticool tryhards creates a hostile enviroment for new players.

I browsed the servers for diverse and interesting game modes but there are mostly rp a-life servers. Who even plays this crap? 

Totally unsatisfied, I would suggest you playing Escape from Tarkov instead.

26882,Best Mil Sim out on the market ...

26886,Optimize game please
26887,epic game 10/10
26888,"Arma III is a military simulator with a lot of depth. The gameplay itself can have a very long learning curve for some, as the amount of actions you will need/be able to perform are numerous. It's often mentioned that almost every key on your keyboard will be used in some way. The game also has full controller support, but you'll need to map it yourself, and your average joypad won't have enough buttons. That said, you can map button combinations, so some creative thinking can still make it work.

The most interesting part of this package, however, is the Eden Editor. You can use it to create custom scenarios. Out of the box, it has all of the game's assets to choose from to create a near endless array of missions,  and game modes. More advanced users can make use of scripting, animation, and mods to open those possibilities even further. Everything from zombies, to aliens, or one of my personal favorites, battle mechs. 

Now for the bad. Or in this case ""Inconvenient.""

The online community can vary greatly. Overall toxicity isn't very prominent, and I've never encountered any trolls, but more serious players are incredibly whiny and annoying when it comes to the roleplaying aspects. (observing military chain of command, following the geneva conventions, calling out targets, confirming kills, and following orders.) It even gets to the point where half these people are basically online Drill Instructors. For some, this is the ultimate level of immersion, but for others (like me) it can be annoying. That said, vets are willing to teach, if you're willing to learn.






"
26889,great game! lots of fun.
26890,It's probably the best mil-sim game ever created. Really nice and modular while maintaining a satisfying level of complexity.

This isn't a game, really. It's more like some sort of Garry's Mod weird shit. Seems like you gotta organize fights with the enemy to make anything happen."
26918,This game is a great addition to the arma franchise despite all of its flaws. The base game is extremely fun to play with endless possibilities. The community is very active with tons of mods and game modes. Only downside is the large amount of DLC you have to pay for.
26919,love it just like i seen it on youtube.

26968,ive played this game for about 3 months and 118 hours at the time of writing but this is amazing game but in order to have a lot of fun you need mods.but is a great game also story is great also get tac ops dlc is the best
26969,i love this game but i cant find a full sever so you need to play in a mil sim
26970,"So real it will have you sitting in a truck waiting to roll for 2 hours while you wait for people to grab the right kits. Combat patrols really brought me back in.. got a little boring on repete.. found Zeus servers. Holy shit what a mess. But sometimes just sometimes you find a good one with an awesome zeus and moderator and admin and thats 5 to 6 hours of time gone, running amazing missions and playing Gi joe. And listening to kids radio chatter. Anyways its a hard core military shooter. Don't think you're going to come from COD, battlefield to this, you're not going to have a good time. One round will kill you. Tons of trolls. Don't be a troll."
26971,awesome
26972," Unreal amount of depth and iopportunities in Arma 3. I don't want to type a review because I know I could type a lot here.
 Simply put, Arma 3 is multiple games in one. Single player, Co-Op, PvP, an Editor (that really has unlimited potential and playability), along with many other game types that have been created by the community. There is no reason not to buy this game, it offers everything a shooter and tactical game can offer.
 Even 7 years after it's release, Arma 3 competes with newer games because of the depth of the game and the quality of the community that plays it and supports it."
26973,military simulator thats all i need to say
26974,spend most of my time flying but amazing game with awesome modding options.
26975,"Mods are what make this series great. Arma Life was the shit in the day.
"
26976,"Realistic firefights (distance, fire rate, difficulty, strategy); tons of cool options like artillery support, UAV's, MLRS support, etc; fun to command a squad; funish campaign"
26977,One of the best milsim games out there
26978,Nice game. Must buy lol
26979,"Its a military simulation game at its core. There are modded games created by 3rd parties. There is an assortment of computer hackers that play this game, which sometimes become a problem. The many communities(due to the 3rd party games) are as friendly as a military simulation community can be. This is also the only game that I own that my head set, headphones, and etc. don't work properly when playing. Regardless of its technical issues, it is worth playing and most of its community are friendly, unless your playing against them. I recommend this game because it is a one of a kind game that is more realistic then other games out today. I will warn you, it is stressful and if your taking it seriously you will get called out by the other people playing."
26980,
26981,This game is  Fantastic but alot of questions about when is arma4 coming out    When we all kow you guys are still working on arma3    so answer to questions would be Greatly appreciated
26982,This game is great if you like  a tactical first person shooter. You can do somemany different things and make so many cool things.

26991,Amazing game! Slightly boring by yourself but when you have friends who also love the game then that's when it's very fun!
26992,amazing
26993,Great game
26994,"Big war feels, small war feels, autistic good fun all the same. The physics engine is broke, a word of advice, be very, very careful moving vehicles around each other or other entities."
26995,i like the how the very open maps and  the game play . the only one dislikes are mainly it sometimes it boots me from a server . saying a file is bad . but rest of the game is good .
26996,Yes.
26997,:)
26998,"Game is good, dlc is overpriced and most should have been in the game form the get go, hawkeye for them sales."
26999,I love this game its flawless Recommend!
27000,Not bad. Still fun.
27001,"Milsim, not perfect but great in its genre"
27002,Good Game
27003,"Been playin this game fo years mayn, my hours been straight buggin doe. Actually got more like 600k hours in this hoe. Man I love this joint. Keep up da beat mayn!"
27004,"This is a good game for those players looking for a difficulty story mode, cuz it only takes you 3 bullets to kill someone and to die.
It has a very good gameplay, which consists of a great variety of weapons and vehicles, from cars to planes.
Ever if it is kinda old, it has good graphics, even better than some games of 2020 in my opinion.
You can improve the experience of this game by downloading mods and joining a variety of modded servers that have great gameplay experiences, such as roleplay or deathmatch.
It only lacks a better support from the developers of this game, and also a little bit of more optimization.
I give it a  8.5/10."
27005,
27006,Great game overall
27007,great game!
27008,"me like game, is good game, can do many thing, sorry for bad english, i am speak english just stupid
"
27009,Pew Pew
27010,You ever joined the army but felt like you chose the least cool job? Play ARMA 3. It's like army but the army that you see in the cool commercials.
27011,game gud me like to shoot pew pew and make cool guys with gun that go boom. I work with my team and we get airfield and i shot a tank and died. game gud.
27012,Good game
27013,awesome gamee
27014,"Very cool, just got a bucket of sweat under my chair"
27015,"It could go either way, you'll have fun or you won't. In my case I had such a good time playing it when I wasn't getting smacked by the other team on KOTH that is because I never had the courage to go on anything other than that. I've uninstalled this game about 4 times already, I really want to love it because it's such a good game. Maybe I'm just a sore loser but hey, like any other game there's things that aren't perfect."
27016,"It's one of my favorite games ever, just wish more people played it with me :(
"
27017,It's ok
27018,God I love war crimes
27019,"Game is good if you have friends/ a dedicated milsim unit to play with. otherwise, you'll get about 10-20 hours of campaign time in, maybe an extra few in the editor but that's about it. Tons of mods to expand gameplay, lots of content to work your way through."
27020,its not bad
27021,g
27022,"Sure the game is ""Perfectly optimized and not broken at all"" but that's what makes it endearing.
The thing that really helps keep this game going is the community, the people you meet and ultimately end up drunken in a pub several months later in because you find out you live less than an hour away.
Absolutely would recommend."
27023,tree
27024,lit
27025,very nice mil sim if you got the PC to run it
27026,Very fun and immersive. Community is very welcoming and people are usually willing to talk and help
27027,one of the best military simulators defenetly recommending this game it's awesome
27028,"Although I only have about 300 hours on the game, its safe to say this is by far my favorite game. There is endless amounts of things to do will all the mods and DLC's. The multiplayer aspect of the game is really fun and you can also mess around in the offline editor. Arma is overall a great game."
27029,"Arma 3 is the best war simulator there is.
However there is something that is bothering me really,
That is the Arma 3 steam community (Anyone not involved, should not be insulted).

Majority of steam workshop uploaders are frauds, really.
Just uploading stuff that isn't their own.
Resulting in corrupted and Outdated files.

Not only that, people need to realise without propper dependencies link to the mod,
it will never work. 
for newcommers not knowing the dependencies of the mod, it will never get them to work.

PLEASE STOP UPLOADING UNLESS YOU ARE THE PUBLISHER OR DEVELOPPER.
I'm well aware to know that publishers and developpers can upload themself.
Because of third party uploaders the workshop is a complete MESS.
it should be cleaned. 

I'd honestly like to see steam put a limit to upload permissions.
depending on frequent updates, and activity's on the mods. and ofcourse being a verified mod developper or publisher.


OH yeah another thing that is just plain stupid. many campaign creator appear to forget.....
wich is forcing to use cheat just for a certain ability,
your squad is like captain america, while you are another spagheti on the battlefield.
unlimited stamina for the crew, now one of your objective is to follow your squad...
they just keep on running wherever. while your stamina runs out, leavin you as a slow poke catching breath.
OH not to mention disabling fatique doesn't work either....

forgetting that particular realism, is just dumb,"
27030,I like it becouse of the tactical stuff and the customizing. God i love the customizing. But i keep forgetting the damn controls.
27031,is good
27032,yaaaaaaa
27033,gud ;D
27034,good fun
27035,Better than real life lmao
27036,warcrimes... so many warcrimes
27037,awwwwwsome
27038,cool game.
27039,"good game, no matter how you play (recommend geting mods and playing online)"
27040,Great game - endless game play.

27046,"I mean, its ARMA, can't go wrong"
27047,dSF
27048,this game is every thing love it 100 percent recommend it
27049,"A great game if you can find the right squad. The single player can be a lot of fun, but up to the point.  There are things about the game are technically frustrating, but at the same time can be amazing. (Wind noises while driving, ambient sounds.)  Really great game to play with others."
27050,Is good... cheeky bricky
27051,has its issues but this game is very complicated and has lots of features.
27052,gud
27053,If you plan on driving jets/helicopters make sure you have a joystick and throttle. I would also highly recommend pedals to help with rotor control. Very fun and realistic game none the less.
27054,"Incredible amount of content in the form of mods, numerous game modes, pvp and pve. I highly recommend buying this game. Great solid gameplay, with players being on multiple fronts, including infantry combat, ground vehicle and air vehicle combat, and even naval combat. Any person looking for a sandbox military shooter, Arma 3 is the game to go to."
27055,"I have PTSD from this game 
8.5 out 10 
would get PTSD again."
27056,its smooth ish
27057,HodgePodge approves this game
27058,Physics realism in game can be a bit dependent on your rig. Overall a good game.
27059,its nice
27060,"Only way to play it propper is with a unit, started with 250 hours before joining TFL, and ended up playing 2.5k hoursmore within a year and a half"
27061,"Don't ask me how my 218 hours got logged, its all haze of the usual Arma bullshittery  that happens. Playing online operations with my friends. Its fun to find servers that take the milsim side of arma seriously, but for those that don't want a serious game then Arma is it. The gameplay can be hard at times, but when you join a server full of people acting out there action hero fantasies, or when you join a server full of prior service members just trying to get the feeling back they had in their heyday it really makes every minute worth it. 

Oh, and the campaign is pretty fun too!"
27062,A very flexible combat simulator
27063,One of the best realistic military shooters out there
27064,Great game
27065,"Guns go bang Im now deaf GG's

Update: the game is very good im good for sure a keeper"
27066,help
27067,This game epic.
27068,This is a very good game if you are looking for a combat realism game buy this or squad. It's just the AI in the eden editor is all over the place
27069,Awesome game when u find the right servers to play on
27070,"Arma 3 is the best, most immersive, most fun to play, worth the price military simulator that the common man can buy. You can have fun with friends, have fun with yourself and the ai, and even play a ton of different singleplayer campaigns. 

Price: The price of 30 euros/dollars is very reasonable, and logically the game would cost even more. The price is more than reasonable, and completely worth it.

Performance: The game does fairly well on modern, well-equipped PC's, but on older computers will start to lag very quickly, due to all the work that the game has to do in processing all the different characters moving around the map, as well as the graphics. It will also start to lag when more people than regular are present on the map. This is what the game is mainly lacking in.

Gameplay: Very enjoyable, and as realistic as it seems, is actually very simplified so that the normal gamer can get into it, with complete mod support making you able to get that ultra-realistic experience easily. The gunplay is pretty alright, however the sounds and physics are pretty lacking, but easily fixable with mods. A very good military game.

Story: Despite most players choosing to play multiplayer and with user-made scenario, the game's story campaigns are actually very well thought through, and hang together with each other. The game has extensive lore and background information, such as surrounding the organization of CSAT and their activities on the island of Altis. Despite the game not mainly focusing on the singleplayer campaigns, they are very good and enjoyable.

DLC: Despite the abundance of DLC, they are not required to enjoy the game, and while good if you have them, are not a necessity for a good experience. I do recommend getting a few of them though.

8/10"
27071,Its ok
27072,"This game can be really fun, the base game is pretty good but the campaign is very short.  Even the DLCs don't add much on that front.  That said the multiplayer scene is pretty big and if you find a good group to play with it can be a blast to play and enjoy.  Just be sure you ask them explicitly if they are ""milsim"" or there to just have fun or somewhere in between before you join them."
27073,"Enough content for a singular individual to play on their own, but this game really was made for gaming communities.
:NATO: :CSAT:"
27074,"I came from cod, insurgency and siege, this is by far a way more entertaining modern FPS on the market. I also play flight sims so the jets add on + HOTAS support makes this game 20/10. You should get the apex dlc as that seems to be the only dlc you need. There is the single player campaigns and they even have a open world story you can dive in. The pvp and pve servers are a blast. I just bought the game and been playing non stop. Combat patrols are fun as people with mics are always trying to help and guide new players."
27075,I guess
27076,Great fun with mods bland and boring on its own
27077,doesn't work on linux.
27078,banging skitz all the things u need for a qualla time w the bois and sum winnie blues
27079,"yeah its fun. its a very mod friendly game that allows you to customize your experience to every detail. it has a steep learning curve and the distances you are gonna be fighting enemies will leave you wondering where you got shot from,"
27080,funny stuff happens
27081,One of the most authentic Milsims out there
27082,"Need to spend about 100+ on dlc plus the 40 game charge. Stupid game devs making the game dependant on paying for dlc. No way to play single player even after buying missions for single player. Only good if you play with a community. No reason to ever buy and play by urself. Awful game, wouldn't recommend giving the devs or company any money or type of community towards this. 0/10 never will boot up again."
27083,guud game and dlc
27084,"you shoot guns, very cool"
27085,Amazing gameplay and amazing controls would prefer this game to those who are into military games and also into heavy team players  never played a great game like this before would recommend this to all gamers who love playing military games as I.
27086,very good game is old but with mods the game is still fun and sometimes you can get really good servers good job arma :)
27087,"What do you want me to say. I was a boy when I came here, now I am a man, I've seen the future. Played all the mods, learnt the game, created content and I keep coming back. There is no other platform like this and shan't be until they release a 4th iteration. Would definitely recommend, hard learning curve but very worthwhile when you find people that you meet and they respect you in ways that can't be fathomed by normies."
27088,Very immersive military campaign i have yet to get into a online server. Great game overall 10/10
27089,yes
27090,"good
"
27091,It's fun to run around and shoot folks outside of/inside of your immediate area.
27092,team building
27093,"if you don't know what this game is, its a hardcore military game. it has its bugs and issues and while its not the prettiest game, the greatness that this game is within its game play, primarily the multiplayer. countless of servers and even more mods and scenarios."
27094,its badass but needs work
27095,its ok sometimes
27096,IS GOOD
27097,v gud
27098,"awesome game
"
27099,yes
27100,Just a great game.
27101,e
27102,its bad ass
27103,rty
27104,"I only play as part of an organised server with mods and in multiplayer. So for this part, Arma3 is great!"
27105,yes
27106,"It's more like a roleplay game. Not into that kind of stuff.

"
27112,yes
27113,"[b]Arma 3[/b] was released 7 years ago on 2013 and it is still such a popular game. This title tries to be a Military Simulation game and realistic, but with many flaws.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
- Huge maps [i](Entire Islands)[/i]
- Decent campaign story with multiple endings
- Good looking graphics
- Steam workshop support
- Community servers
- Solid playerbase [i](10-20 thousand players daily)[/i]
- Lots of Weapons
- Many vehicles, tanks
- Really good soundtrack
- Scenarios
- Scenario editor [i](Custom made missions)[/i]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- [b]Awful performance[/b] even with a decent rig
- Many weapons, items, vehicles are locked behind paid DLCs
- Clunky controls
- Very dumb A.I
- Clunky interaction UI
- Weird physics
- Leading your own AI squad is very exhausting and bad
- Many missions can be bugged or just simply really bad [i](For example, Preventive Diplomacy)[/i]
- The huge maps are mostly empty
- Some parts of the game looks outdated

[b]7/10[/b] It's a pretty okay game, people love this game and I guess because of its realistic approach and co-op modes or any other community made stuff. The campaign is only decent, the community stuff is really good, but the very poor optimization can be in the way for many people, including me and I have a pretty decent rig."
27114,.
27115,yes
27116,most realistic military game
27117,good
27118,e
27119,Insane Game pretty much can do what ever u feel like in this game.
27120,Great Game with a lot of different ways to play
27121,I still can't remember what button is lay down sideways and I have 500 hours..
27122,<3
27123,How do I explain ARMA 3 intense if you enjoy a real life battle sim this is the best game around that I know of.
27124,I bought this game for myself and a friend. I love this military simulator. I have made many friends on this game. 13MEU was my first unit. I fly helicopter's.
27125,It Gud
27126,yea its good
27127,better than cod
27128,"I can't even think of a perfect way to describe the beauty that is ArmA. A realistic military simulator with an endless amount of community content and a easy and streamlined way to create your own. Combine all of this and you have probably the best military game on the face of the planet. I mean this game is used by militaries for training purposes. I mean really, the possibilities with this is endless, I even created a RTS scenario. Yea, I turned a realistic FPS game into a RTS."
27129,trash
27130,"FUN GAME

27134,Noice!
27135,very tactic so noice the tactic is so good many action also the story is hot
27136,yes
27137,"Arma is the best shooter ever.  It's realistic enough to be immersive, but not enough that you can't get into it and learn.  It has good graphics, fantastic sound, and an amazing mission editor that anyone can get in to.  Not to mention the amazing mods that take it to just about any war in the past couple hundred years.  The Vietnam and WW2 mods are particularly amazing.

It can be a bit buggy, but it's worth it."
27138,very good mil sim
27139,"Arma 3 is a really good shooter. The graphics are good and the game mechanics work perfectly, the only thing you need to do is to learn them. I think this is the best realistic shooter of all time. The singleplayer teaches you how to play and how to use items ingame. The multiplayer is decent and really enjoyable."
27140,I got to fly a jet
27141,meh
27142,"Very good game, some funny moments like when i have to FAK my friend when he is lying on the floor after being shot. Gets a bit boring after a while."
27143,Although you have to get used to the key binds and there are lots of keys you'll need to get familiarized with it's an awesome game with a lot of great people in game. Highly recommended
27144,great game!!
27145,yes
27146,"Recently got Contact for ¬£5 on G2A.COM ( Still ¬£5 2020 14/08) This game has had me hooked since arma 2 and when this released i got it asap ive watched it grow and change and although a few features never made it and some features should be added now (Please add More ships) Its still a fucking great game.
The game gives you 
Arma 3 
Campaign 
Multiplayer
Editor
With these you can have countless hours playing and palying with random stupid shit and have so much fun, Please check out some videos on this game im sure you will love it, Mods are used alot in arma 3 to make it better or in some cases add lego men but in general its amazing, I have yet todo my fly by of the new map livonia but when i do i hope its as good as i think it is"
27147,The game is ok
27148,"Man , this game is awsome z zeus games are funny and really god , everything iss good , even the funky AI  is great . i have great time playing this game and the DLC are worth it ."

27150,Pretty good. the hours speak for themself. someone please play this with me.

27152,Yes.
27153,"If you are into military games and roleplay games, this is the game for you. If you like sandbox as well as military and roleplay, once again, this is the game for you. I always play this and it is very fun."

27164,"played a bit, its okay I guess"
27165,Yes
27166,"Developed to help the US armed forces train soldiers, this game is meant to simulate real combat.  That said, its placed in the future with fake weapons and vehicles.  Candidly, without mods this game is kind of trash.  That said, WITH mods, this game is awesome!  And, boy, there are a lot of mods!  Now, it will be a little janky either way and the mods themselves take a little micromanagement but if you can work as a team and be slightly mature, this is an excellent game.  Give it a try if you don't mind learning something and having a little patience.  Its great! (with mods)."
27167,it good

ARMA is a Community Server based military strategy shooter wich has the potential for hundreds of Gameplay hours. You can pick servers from Role-Play up to War simulation wich all have their fun parts."
27172,is pretty thicccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
27173,takes forever to find a server but worth it
27174,"Still to this day one of the best go-to simulators in its class. With countless game modes, several different phenomenal showcases, campaigns, and endless; creative user-made content to enjoy, you'll always find yourself staying entertained."
27175,"By Far The Best Game On The Market You Want To Get The Feel Of All Out Realistic Warfare, You Want To Play GTA With More Features Or Even If You Want To Play HALO and Starwars This Is The Game For You !!!!!!!!"
27176,I'm really loving the eden editor by the fact that you can spawn in a variety of military personnel from rifleman to attack heli and watch them fight it out with one another or just join in with what you'd created to get a 1st hand experience.
27177,Everything is Sweet
27178,YES
27179,fire
27180,"It's aight, I'm still trying the first level."
27181,yes
27182,I would recommend this game together to play but the only thing is you would have to have a really good computer because the FPS is terrible I love playing it
27183,This game is very semi-realistic with the war aspect. So i highly recommend this to any person In the military or not. so yes
27184,Good milsim!
27185,"The greatest thing about ARMA 3 is the community. Without the community I don't think I would have ever tried this game. The community servers are great especially those related to the EXILE MOD. Varying degrees of difficulty from free money to coffee and a band-aid have created an experience like no other. Starting fresh and learning to survive is the greatest feeling I've ever received from gaming. Whether it be the screams of zombies, the sound of radio chatter, or a BEEP BEEP BEEP MISSILE INCOMING, I've learned one thing. ARMA delivers the sense of danger you've been looking for your whole life.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for exciting adventures that give you an experience. ARMA is definitely the way to go."
27186,"its like molding dry play doe, but it's not completely dried out so you can make whatever you want but no matter what it is it will end up half assed or falling apart.
"
27187,qsdasd w br as
27188,pretty fun when you commit horrific war crimes that go against every part of the geneva convention. inshallah my brothers
27189,it needs work but it is a really fun game to play
27190,Best game  (:
27191,"Great mil-sim especially if you play with friends!

The game has a bunch of different game modes and the campaign is great. This game is very difficult and almost comparable to Escape From Tarkov in its strategy and aesthetic. Tons to do and very moddable!"
27192,Attack this thing 20 miles away with no explanation of how to get there.
27193,.
27194,noice
27195,A realistic military shooter thats awesome
27196,One of the best games I ever played.
27197,good game to mess around with the editor and the workshop is extremely vast
27198,"I have always loved Military Sims, i.e., the early Ghost Recon games, Operation: Flashpoint and the Arma series.  This is the best of the best, in my opinion.  Incredible detail, a giant sandbox for campaign missions, player-made scenarios, pvp, and unlimited replayability with mods.  The mission editor is very user-friendly to place units, vehicles, or create simple combat skirmishes.  It's not uncommon for Arma 3 (and its DLC) to be on sale.  If you think this type of game might be for you, grab it!"
27199,"Yo my slime
I know you really don't know mandem like that, but I was like I was wondering if like, I could purchase something still fam. Just a bit of grub my drillar. I wanna know what your prices are saying cuz I'm tryna blem a zoot up with my boydem and gyaldem g, like you feel me? So get back to me cuz I know like you're the top dog around here. I wanna purchase the food from you bruce, nobody else. So peace out dawg, roll safe and get back to me on a quick ting brodem"
27200,Best military simulator on the market.
27201,Simply great.
27202,"very fun, however mods make it 100x better"
27203,Basically legos for adults
27204,"best war simulation game ever made, hope u will buy it"
27205,Such a fun experience with friends it's like garry's mod but tactical
27206,good
27207,Fun.
27208,good game
27209,"The actual game 100% its really fun to play, but the vault and the game getting rid of its self IS SUPER ANOYING, but its still fun and the one thing that anoys me the most is the thing were you try to get in a vehicle but you actualy go in your inventory instead of going in a vehicle. (So a 9/10)"
27210,"The physics engine is temperamental, the controls can be confusing, and what seems like basic actions can be clunky. You aren't perfect either though. When you get over its issues you will find that very few games present large scale multiplayer conflicts as well as this. The sheer number of short scenarios, campaigns, and mods available will ensure you never run out of things to do. There are mods for weapons, vehicles, maps, and increasing or decreasing the level realism to your liking. Hell, there's even a slew of mods that are geared toward the non-military aspects of the game if that's what you're into."
27211,"Very good game with a nice Community and a lot of good mods for better expierience ,but if u play online the performance can sometimes be really bad even if u have a good PC"
27212,its alright i guess.
27213,Played some.. Liked it.
27214,"There is a major barrier to cross when getting used to this game.

People say that Battlefield is more tactical than Call of Duty. But that's marginally.

This game is the most realistic shooter, bar-none. Everything is limited. Ammo, stamina, etc. You don't have a linear health bar. If you get shot, you are crippled. Even after 'healing' yourself, you will still stagger. Aerodynamics in helicopters and jets are very accurate. If you are going 200mph in a helicopter, you can't just do a 180 degree turn and fly through tunnels.

This game has gigantic maps and if you want to play the game right, you need to learn how to navigate just like in real life with a compass, and you need to cooperate with teammates to get the mission done.

The singleplayer missions are phenomenal. You will not get bored. You will be challenged and you will learn more in this simulator/game than you ever will in any other shooter."
27215,Really fun with friends
27216,ye
27217,"amazing war sim even if you dont wanna play seriously and piss about with friends, the rpg side is fun but make sure you have a mic"
27218,"Arma 3 is without a doubt, Fun.
You can easily sink hundreds if not thousands of hours into the game. However to get the optimal experience you need to get every DLC (besides that Go Kart one like what is that anyway?) the servers are mostly always populated and everyone communicates and it really feels like an actual battlefield in some occasions.
There are many problems with the Ai as they can be really really stupid and can get stuck on roads frequently.
Scenario creation is easy for the basics but adding text into the screen and the more advanced scenarios is very complicated. It will take you many hours to understand the basics and remembering the thousands of Keybindings. 

8/10
Arma 3 can be fast paced and chaotic at times, but it can also play the more slower approaches perfectly. The sound design and SFX design is often phenomenal. The workshop is frequently updated. Its easy to pick up for some but for people who are looking for COD-like game play would be disappointed. Being strategic is the main focus of this game and if you can't follow orders don't play multiplayer."
27219,is nice
27220,"fun if you hate yourself, 
playing through the campaign without turning off stamina will be hell
playing with friends is much fun"
27221,i recommend this is an awesome game
27222,fun
27223,great game loads of mods for it
27224,it has funs
27225,mmmmmm good
27226,"This is just amazing. From single player, to Multiplayer... it's the game you can play when everything else has been done to death. The mods, the campaign... it's all here to enjoy and there's so much left untapped, still in 2020"
27227,"strong learning curve. Think my specs arent the best, if you have a good computer get it"
27228,Brand new to this but like it very much
27229,1
27230,It's okay I guess
27231,Arma AI accuracy is real and it's a terrifyingly accurate
27232,"Just bought my first game worthy computer, this was the first game i bought, and its absolutely the best war-sim, shooter, or basically game period I have played. Story is good, and its only a small fraction of the possibilities you have when you buy this game. Highly Recommend buying."
27233,it is ok
27234,This game has been out for 7 years and the AI still shoots through floors and walls.
27235,"gud shooter gud rpg and gud flight sim to get ready for flight sim 2020
"
27236,Its a fun game but the thing that gets on my nerves is that the base game doesnt seem finished and that they made DLC instead of free updates
27237,"I originally purchased Arma 3 to make my own missions and play them offline. The downside of this is the AI team mates are as dumb as posts. The upside is that most of the AI don't follow what they were told to do through the various tools provided, which actually will result in random moments that are unscripted. When this happens and it works, it can be quite fun. Otherwise, if I'm expecting my team mates to do as they're told I'm usually banging my head on the desk because they seldom do as they're told. 
I found the campaign to be unmemorable and am not sure if I ever bothered completing it.
I finally figured out how to get on to a ""quick match"" in multiplayer and have been playing combat patrol missions. This has been genuinely fun as the total strangers you are randomly placed with are for the most part great to work alongside. If a person takes on the role of Team Leader seriously then good things happen. If there is good communication going on in the team, good things happen. Because you are randomly thrown together in the quick matches it's a bit of a gamble as to what you'll get to work with, but that's the nature of the beast. I'm sure those who work in squads with their friends don't have to gamble like the rest of us poor souls who haven't had the privilege.
I've been gaming since 1991 mostly through console gaming and have finally been able to play PC games. I've waited over 20 years to finally have this kind of experience in gaming."
27238,1
27239,"My vote is based on the single player campaign, which is what I have been playing.

My problem with this game is, I think what I was wanting was a military simulator, whereas Arma 3 feels more like a military simulator simulator, if you get my meaning...

First off, I guarantee that nobody in any serious military would constantly call out to their team e.g., ""MOVE 200 METERS RIGHT"", it's just not practical. Whoever might be partaking in such ""tactics"" would be dead in a real combat situation. Communicating grid coordinates? Sure. Signaling directions with your hands or moving with your squad leader? Of course. But giving these overly explicit direction + short distance commands every 10s? Come on, the game's trying too hard to be ""realistic"" that it ends up being unrealistic and robotic. It's also quite obnoxious, especially when you're ""commanding"" an AI team and it constantly has your guy yelling these commands out to them (that is, even commands you didn't issue)...

That leads me to my next problem: commanding an AI team... They're TERRIBLE at following orders! You have to wait like 5 minutes for them to move to an area that takes you only 1 minute to arrive at, even when they're not being shot at. Combine this with the campaign constantly rushing you to get things done under a time limit, and it makes you want to throw the game in the trash.

Then there's the issue of fighting AI infantry and tanks (this is probably my most hated aspect of the game by far!). I have a REALLLL problem with this in Arma 3, and no, it's not because the game's ""realistic"". It's a fact of life that, no matter how good your skill or vision or hearing, if you don't have some kind of heat signature detection or night vision going on - i.e. you're out in broad daylight in a regular combat situation - and you can't see the enemy - and he steps out from behind a wall but there's literally 100% bush/foliage covering up your line of sight to him... you can't just shoot and kill him. You HAVE to see your enemy or have some kind of reasonable way of knowing that your enemy is there (e.g. he runs out in the open then ducks behind a bush). These rules DO NOT APPLY AT ALL to the AI, and it's even worse when you're in a city surrounded by enemy patrol groups and enemy APC's, all of whom can instantly shoot you down if you dare to move at all and play peek-a-boo with them, when they can see you but you can't see them...

This really ticked me off. I'd be e.g. in a building, ready to move to the next cover, I'd just BARELY peek out the door, literally see nothing but green + walls, and immediately get shot up and killed by an enemy infantry or APC. I'd load my save, do the same thing over and over with different variances 20 times in a row, and the same thing would happen again and again. And there's NOTHING you can do about it. It's like they knew the INSTANT you stepped out the door (no actual door being opened, mind you, just a doorless opening there). I found that I would have better luck shooting all of my enemies through a window first and then going out the door once they're all dead.

That leads me to the next problem: a lot of these windows have panes or whatever blocking 80-100% of their view. Not only that, but, as you might expect, you can very easily and quickly get shot and killed through these same windows, without even having a chance to breathe or see who's shooting you first - not even if you approach it stealthily. And you can't clear these windows out! There's not even a melee option. So like, say you were walking around stealthily, and you ran up behind an enemy. You can't knife him down, you HAVE to shoot him and make a loud noise, revealing your position to everyone in the city. Knowing this game, it's probably not even possible to sneak undetected in the first place...

Then there are the campaigns. I feel like I've played enough of them to get the gist of how they work. Look, I've learned the hotkeys, I've watched the videos, etc. I've given this game a solid try, and I'm no noob to FPS games. A lot of these missions are poorly designed. For instance, you'll be assigned to take over a city and clear it out, something like that; then, all of a sudden, halfway across the map, another squad on your team will be getting shot at. What does the game then have you do? The obvious, smart play: it tells you to basically abandon your mission to clear out the city, and in the middle of your firefight, it wants you to run THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE of the UNCLEARED city, keep going, and randomly run into a forest, to ""safety"". What?! It just doesn't make any strategic sense. There's a lot of this kind of crap in the built-in campaign missions...

Also, driving vehicles is kind of obnoxious, very difficult to maintain control over them with the keyboard at reasonable speeds.

Anyways, to sum it all up: I wanted a military simulator, which could help me refine my understanding of realistic tactical warfare: how not to get shot, the best way to approach various scenarios, etc., but I continually find Arma 3's strange mechanics, unrealistic AI's, bizarre campaigns, and so on getting in the way of that. It's making me seriously consider whether I even want to continue playing, whether I'll get any enjoyment out of it or learn anything useful."
27240,One of my favorite games! Highly recommended!
27241,Very fun mods.
27242,e
27243,Lots of fun with friends and mods
27244,great
27245,I love being in the army.
27246,i  like arma 3 it's very nice good game
27247,"Magna Carta Libertatum (Medieval Latin for ""Great Charter of Freedoms""), commonly called Magna Carta (also Magna Charta; ""Great Charter""),[a] is a royal charter[4][5] of rights agreed to by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215.[b] First drafted by Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War.

After John's death, the regency government of his young son, Henry III, reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause. At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace treaty agreed at Lambeth, where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller Charter of the Forest which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, Edward I, repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's statute law. The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling Parliament of England passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance.

At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as habeas corpus. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the United States Constitution, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.[c] Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Magna Carta still forms an important symbol of liberty today, often cited by politicians and campaigners, and is held in great respect by the British and American legal communities, Lord Denning describing it as ""the greatest constitutional document of all times ‚Äì the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot"".[6] In the 21st century, four exemplifications of the original 1215 charter remain in existence, two at the British Library, one at Lincoln Castle and one at Salisbury Cathedral. There are also a handful of the subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The original charters were written on parchment sheets using quill pens, in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin, which was the convention for legal documents at that time. Each was sealed with the royal great seal (made of beeswax and resin sealing wax): very few of the seals have survived. Although scholars refer to the 63 numbered ""clauses"" of Magna Carta, this is a modern system of numbering, introduced by Sir William Blackstone in 1759; the original charter formed a single, long unbroken text. The four original 1215 charters were displayed together at the British Library for one day, 3 February 2015, to mark the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta."
27248,great game
27249,BEST MILSIM ROLEPLAY GAME EVER
27250,Great game very real good people
27251,"Game is very open and easy to understand. The initial bootcamp to learn how to play is very detailed and makes you want to delve deep into the action headfirst. The game is very realistic based on it's environment, weapons, tactics, and much more. I would recommend this game as a 10/10."
27252,"It's not a game, it's a simulator.

Watch out for bushes.
10/10"
27253,"At the time of writing this, I have over 2,000+ hours. Arma 3 is a military ""simulation"" game that allows players to play almost EVERY role on the battlefield as long as the mission allows it, want to be a special ops laser designating targets for destruction, you can do that. Want to lead a squadron of A10's into combat, raining 30mm cannon fire onto enemy troops, you can do that. Everything from a simple rifleman to the tank commander to a pilot, and from my experience is there is no other game that provides such a variety of different gameplay styles, and while the engine is now around 10+ years old which does have its limitations, frame rates on lower end PC will be fairly poor, so if your pc isnt powerful dont buy it. Another issue with the game is the amount of glitches that happen in a game, from one moment your driving a tank to the next becoming the next space shuttle going into orbit because your cannon glitched into a building. But even with all that being said, there is NO OTHER GAME that provides a similar gameplay AND workshop integration, and with the game only being 39.99 US, its still worth the price"
27254,it cool
27255,"a little buggy sometimes. Great game, Just get used to 10 fps, Trust me its playable.
"
27256,Prety good but needs some moding.
27257,Great game with its own issues but the modding and communities make it 10X better just look at my hours lol
27258,"I'm not going to ask again, where's Lega 3?"
27259,it good
27260,terrible
27261,Very realistic tactical shooter would recommend to anyone wanting realism or a pretty good representation of war.
27262,"I highley recommend this game if your looking for a realistic simulation army game, takes about an hour too get too places on boats depending on the distance the sniping is realistic as you ave bullet drop, wind and the ghillie suits you can get (not the basic standard ones) the full ghillie are amazing the blend in soo well, if your into this stuff get it 10/10"
27263,One of the best games I have and will never tire of it.
27264,This game needs some Battlefield 1 elements to make it great. It should be totally reworked to up close and personal.
27265,"I personally like this game, I know i havent played much but here is my review
GOOD:
- Graphics
- Detail
- Gun Physics
- Physics in general
- Tutorial.
BAD:
-some servers and players."

27274,"Well made series and this is no exception to that, have thousands of hours unrecorded fun.

Some of the Paid DLC however is questionable 

"
27275,"The game itself is great, but i hate the fact that you have to buy the rest 30% of the game as DLC's. If you buy a game above 30 Euros it shouldnt have another 60 DOLLARS WORTH OF DLC'S. These are horrible anti-consumer practices."
27276,"Phenomenal game. First thing i bought when i got a PC. Vanilla campaign is great, DLC content is legit endless. The devs like mods, which means they are also great; as well as the community. One of the reasons i ever even looked at getting a PC instead of sticking with console is because i saw a lot of youtube videos of these awesome operations of this game; some mods others not. But either way if you are looking for a solid shooter that will keep you wanting more this is for you."
27277,Good game
27278,4k pln√≥w za 10fps es? no es
27279,"Arma 3 is the best worst game out there if you are interested in military simulation. 

The game is a sandbox by nature, I highly recommend you skip the campaign entirely and just find a group of friends to play it with instead. Find a period in history that you are interested in, load up some mods, rent a dedicated server, and just have a ball. Arma 3 itself (when it works) can be quite entertaining, but what really sells it for me, and what really makes it worth playing, is the experiences you get to have when playing it with others. Desperately trying to save your buddy in the jungles of Vietnam is way more intense when the other person is an actual person."
27280,"I really wanted to like this game....so many people were like ""dude you gotta play Arma....its the best"". Well, after many hours of ""ARMA"", I can simply say this is a P.O.S. Your squad's A.I. is the dumbest nightmare I have seen in any game I have played that's a milsim. Adding to the fact this game's DLC cost an average of $40...what in the hell are you programmers doing? This game is crap....the A.I. is crap. Might as well play a game like C.O.D. at least then you know what you're getting."
27281,yes
27282,"good
gaem"
27283,good game
27284,"Very good game, would buy yesyes"
27285,"Hosting servers is a pain for a bunch of players, im sure there are ways to get to the point where you dont have it only temporarily work. but on a okay PC there is so much to do and can make your own."

27317,It's a must-have for real milsim enthusiasts and FPS gamers who like a challenge. The workshop is packed with QoL mods as well as tons of scenarios. Replayability is through the roof.
27318,I DONT PLAY ONLY 1 HOURS
27319,I didn't know what rage meant until I went on Wasteland...

27321,"Love it, hate it, there's nothing quite like it. Interestingly, also doubles as a surprisingly effective memory stress test when spending long hours in game."
27322,"Terrible multiplayer performance expect half fps of single player and will terminate background applications such as Corsair iCue. So if you've got hundreds of dollars of products that rely on that Corsair service then they will not work (ie: LS100 RGB light strips, RGB profiles and side mouse buttons).  This game will also lock up your system from time to time even on a clean install, who knows why so you should only buy this thing when it's on sale."
27323,"was playing this game with my friend, ended up in a warehouse with a box in the corner (we were basing there in antistasi). was climbing over the box (using enhanced movement) and messing around at 3 am (wouldnt be able to keep my eyes open if i wasnt playing the game). eventually i climbed on the box in such a way that i did not end up in the gap between the box and the wall, and did not end up going through the wall, but instead ended up INSIDE the wall. 
started sliding up and down the wall, actually crying from laughter at this point. i make it to the ground, go prone, and i get killed. 
at this point i am genuinely lightheaded and disorientated from laughing so much and i had to walk around a bit (in real life mind you) just to get my bearings.

that moment alone made it worth the 30 dollars, and i would kill to be able to experience that moment for the first time again"
27324,"The best military sim out there.
Cars, tanks, planes, helis.
Realistic ballistics.

27326,Excellent game

27330,started playing this game 3 years now of playing and still love it. i was an admin for most of my time on this game and never regret all the hours i put into this game made many friends thru the time can highly advise getting arma and explore the many different servers they offer with a wide variety of mods to boot.
27331,i got arma'd again
27332,"The most overly complicated Dad Op I've seen, expect to get endlessly harassed with floating images to buy DLC. See a vehicle? Cool, give us twenty bucks for the ability to use it. This game is like if Train Simulator only sold you a handcart and a section of track and expected you to make do with it."
27333,"It seems like its alright... but was trying to learn controls on campaign and ran out of ammo, I had no way of getting more ammo. None of the bodies had ammo so I couldn't proceed (because i kept dying). Plus there is wayy to many controls. So I'm not a huge fan of the game"
27334,oof fun

27339,This game is alright
27340,"In my close 100 hours of playtime I can say that this game is satisfying. If you looking for true sandbox and millitary simulator experience I very much recommend this masterpiece for you. 

Have a nice day!"
27341,Great brrrrrr simulator
27342,Good Game just wish you didn't have to pay for expansions

27347,gg
27348,"I loved how this game had so many uses. It can be used for messing around with friends, or hardcore roleplay. It also has (somewhat) realistic physics. Overall its just a great game."
27349,Best MILSIM sandbox game
27350,good
27351,just a lot of fun. bit of a learning curve but overall not bad
27352,"This game has aged like wine. All wine requires somebody to drink it though, and needless to say I do not enjoy its taste as much as I used to. Multiple DLC's to keep the playerbase alive, all at wide costs and some with little content to offer.
Would I recommend it? Yeah. 
You just need to seriously find people to keep it alive for you, otherwise you'll be left drinking alone. There's still boundless limits to gameplay and gametime. It's up to you to find it, not the game."
27353,arma more like where tf is my armor i get fuggin one shotted every second 3 new keyboards needed

27370,"My computer has a better time loading Boston in Fallout 4 than this busted up unoptimized garbage.  God, I installed this game today for the first time in half a year with good intentions and that was a mistake. you know your game is cucked when you can't get a steady 60fps at least with a RTX 2060 super 8gb and 32gb of ram. wish I could refeund this game but first of all, its been more than two weeks, obviously and 2nd of all, during my playthrough of this crapshow, I was stubborn and didn't wanna lose hope in this game. This game runs like a flash game."
27371,"Arma 3 by itself is an amazing game. However, when paired with some of the mods from the expansive library that the Steam Workshop contains, it adds that little mmph to make it a 10/10 game. Def would recommend."
27372,Fun sandbox\ milsim game
27373,Been waiting for command to issue a firing order this whole time. Will update this review when i finally get approval.
27374,"99.99% realism .
  0.01% Fun.
  
I think that's suitable for a review. Unless people enjoy that kind of stuff this ""game"" is just a pure nightmare to play... clunky controls, clunky aiming , clunky vehicle controls , annoying damage system , feelably cheating ai, getting stuck everywhere,  awkward feeling gunplay  and the performance and graphics are just... well... bad. 
I bought it to play with a friend... but it's so horrible that I can't even get myself to play it even if it would be with said friend... it just feels that bad to me.

Some might enjoy this...which I can't understand why ... but for me this game has absolutely no redeeming qualities or values... would have prefered to watch movies on Amazon prime or something than waste money on hot air like this ,

I can't understand why or how people enjoy this or how this got so many good reviews... but I guess everybody has his/her own tastes... For me personally it's been one of the if not the worst game experiences I've had since quite a while.

But atleast I can say that I tried ... for a friends sake... doesn't give me my money back though."
27375,yeah bro im a veteran
27376,"best tacticl shooter
"
27377,"its arma, who doesnt like arma?"
27378,|
27379,So realistic i got PTSD.
27380,"arma 3 good yes
"
27381,"Easily my favorite game on steam, hands down! I love it, and here's why:

Arma 3 is a military sandbox shooter, allowing you to interact with almost all aspects of military warfare, from ships to planes to trucks to tanks to infantry. There hasn't been a single game which has released since Arma 3 that lets you interact with all of these aspects on anywhere near as large a scale (25x25km map, 1 to 1 scale with an IRL island), if at all to begin with.

By modern standards, the gameplay is relatively clunky, the graphics are out of date, and performance is relatively poor on lower-end machines. The game is also CPU intensive, which is better or worse for some rigs. In spite of this, the game has a very healthy playerbase with thousands of concurrent players, although spread out among a wide variety of different gamemodes and units which can give the impression the game is less populated than it actually is at any given time.

Although the game has a number of DLC, what many people tend to not know is much of the DLC releases came with free patches and updates for the game which everyone can enjoy - Helicopters DLC came with a helicopter overhaul for all helicopters, not just DLC ones. Marksman DLC allowed firing from vehicles for everyone, and so on. 

The game has also gotten significant improvement in the AI department over time as well, although by modern standards the AI is still relatively lackluster. Compared to previous Arma games however, the AI in this game is actually extremely smart and complex, but also require experience with their behavior and knowledge of the honestly terrible system of actually controlling them. Still, I'd take Arma 3 AI any day over Arma 2 AI or god forbid Armed Assault AI.

The game also comes with honestly one of the best editors I have ever used in gaming, hands-down. It's essentially a built-in SDK for making missions that you can access straight from the main menu, and allows nearly anyone to sit down and make whatever the hell they want. Some of the more complicated things do require scripting (usually extremely simple scripting) but the Modules system alleviates the need for many scripts. You can spawn in and play with every single vehicle in the game, regardless if you own it or not if you can bear the annoying watermark that flashes on your screen.

One potential downside is that much of the multiplayer is PvE focused, and that's where you'll find the most amount of actually populated servers, doubly so if you get involved in the unit and modding scene behind the game. Still, you can easily find a couple hundred players playing PvP if you check during prime hours (during the day, weekends, etc.). Personally, I have spent the overwhelming majority of time playing PvE as the gamemodes and missions are significantly better balanced and fun regardless if you've spent 10 hours or 1000 hours in the game. Many PvP gamemodes like KOTH or Warlords require you to grind exp or money (or both) in order to get better gear and equipment.

All in all I would definitely recommend the game, especially during a sale where you can get the major content adding DLCs (especially Apex) for cheap and if your computer can play it. It's a unique experience you can't get anywhere else, with the ability to turn it into whatever kind of experience you want it to be."
27382,i dont know if i have the right to comment as of yet with my meager time spent but a side from pro skill needed to be effective and the long time it takes to level for higher lvl weps the games fantastic a bit more indepth than im used to (bf4 bf1 bfV) takes a bit to get used to the graphics are to be expected n im new to pc but so far handles great
27383,100% worth it right now there's humble bundle including apex dlcs and 3 others
27384,"It's janky, buggy, runs like shit, looks like shit, plays like shit, the singleplayer is shit. The only fun in this game is with friends in a sandbox scenario from the workshop, or a heavily edited multiplayer mode."
27385,amazing
27386,good
27387,After 297 hours I think I'm ready to have fun now.
27388,badA$$ game
27389,If realism is for you then this game is for you A+++
27390,fun
27391,ok!
27392,Best FPS sandbox we have right now.
27393,Good game
27394,I would like to admit that I wanted to make a review at 666 hours. Oh boy.
27395,good fun  game
27396,"this game is sick!!!!!!
"
27397,Pog
27398,good game
27399,it is a very good game if u like war games
27400,Ini Salah satu Game yang saya Suka ........top dahhh.......
27401,COOP is THE BEST MODE I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!! ARMA 3 is really FUN IN COOP
27402,"
'"
27403,Lit
27404,Yea I think the game is good
27405,"This game at first can be tedious to learn, and I am still new to it, however I can say that it is very rewarding once you figure it out. the community is mostly non toxic, and nice. Warning however that this game is very CPU heavy, and is optimized for a very specific kind of computer, because of this you might experience frame drops. excluding that, the game is very fun, and it is pretty interesting to learn about how to use each weapon. The game has a lot of key binds so I recommend looking at a guide on how to map your controls. This game has a very large amount to offer if you like militaristic simulation games."
27406,"It is such a realistic experience. The enemy doesn't just stand in one spot, the graphics are great. Very dynamic."
27407,"Like most games these days and as you get older, you'll likely not have a lot of fun unless you have a group with you. I'll say right now with a squad a friends and joining others in a Wasteland Mode, we had a blast. Just playing alone is great too if you pick the correct game mode, like domination or some other map restricted scenario. It's easy to meet people since most everyone wants to succeed via communication; in this idea listen before you speak and you'll catch on."
27408,hah.. dont buy this anymore kids..not cool
27409,I highly recommend this game if you like a realistic military simulator. In this game you work as a team to bring down AI or other players on different teams. This makes any C.O.D game look noobish and it's 10x better then war zone.
27410,y
27411,The best game I have ever owned. Cant wait for Arma 4... One Day
27412,dlc's are overprices ngl. Toxic player base and overall terrible game.
27413,so much fun
27414,"fun game been playing it since it came out, had a lot of good memories."
27415,HI
27416,"Incredibly re-playable. First game i got 1k hours on, and within 4 months. Might have several blood clots right now but its worth it."
27417,Still a great game in 2020 but its dated mechanics are becoming increasingly clear. Get it for the ArmA unit communities and mods. Desperately needs a more polished and less clunky sequel within the next few years.
27418,100/100
27419,Its pretty good I guess
27420,"After just about 2000 Hours on this game I can for sure that this game is worth the money. I have met a community that not only is consistantly active but that I have made dozens of friends in. Let me break down the good and the bad:

The Pros:
Bohemian is quite active and interacts with the community in a positive way that contributes to the game and even takes not of defects in the game and fixes them when needed. They also actively support the Mod community in arma making it quite Modder friendly with 0 shortage of things to do. This game can be played in anyway you want. Wanna play as a Halo Marine, Check, Wanna play as a Clone Trooper, Check, Wanna Play in modern Military, check. The ever expanding universe surrounding this game has lead to some amazing communities and group mods that are ever expanding, i.e TCW, OPTRE. You can do anything you want with this game and I have gotten my moneys worth out of it. 

The Bad:
The Combination of clunky UI and the term used quite a bit in the community getting ""Armaed"" to describe when the game fucks you over. Now some of the physics are not perfect, and arma has some serious querks. I believe it is still worth checking out."
27421,fun if you are cool
27422,pretty cool enjoyed it so far havent even tried modded stuff out yet!
27423,hehehehe CSAT go boom.
27424,Love the game one of my favourites. Most realistic war game ever made
27425,
27426,"This game has hosted some of my favorite memories from gaming that I have ever had. The satisfaction of an entire server working together to accomplish a mission is second to none. However, I must point out that not every game is like that. Sometimes players don't coordinate well and there are people who are just in the game to ruin it for everyone else. All in all, if you get a server with the right kind of people it's a great experience. But where this game really shines is with private units you can join. Some are meant just for fun and some are mil-sim. But both variations will give you a great experience."
27427,This game is poorly optimized even if you have a pretty good GPU and CPU considering the game came out in 2013. With my 1080 GTX this game runs like crap.
27428,Yes
27429,very nice
27430,"perfect mil-sim game. hardcore,fast paste, and the best part is the loadouts you can use its never ending. 5/5 stars"
27431,Most Epic Military Sim EVER!
27432,yo this game the cats pijamas
27433,yes
27434,Good
27435,"The Game itself is very big, has a nice and long Story, and with the DLCs, all the different gamemodes and mods you cannot have no fun somehow!"
27436,coll
27437,Played a bit. Its alright.
27438,"if you like Sandbox's or have/fined a good squad, it can be fun. (with mods... there are so many mods)"
27439,brilliant game
27440,"nice game
"
27441,"Its good but i would recomend you stay away from altis life, at least the Grand Theft Arma one. if you have any sort of disabilites you will be abused and killed in safezone and admins seem to not care when you ask for their help, instead i see them going round calling people the n word and breaking the rules, this is not the game though, the game itself is good."
27442,"I like the fact that the game is modular, and that the theme of a military simulator in a sandbox is carried out. However, I couldn't say it's perfect due to the game itself is poorly optimized."
27443,"I tried it a couple of times, only NASA can have 120FPS but nonetheless its decent priced for what it is. (Update) : It's now meh"
27444,frame rate go brrrrrrrrrt
27445,Great simulator for wannabe soldiers and real soldiers.
27446,"So i pressed yes 
only because i had some really nice time in my first 50 hour 
it isnt happening to every1 i feel like when you get this game you should be looking in reddit or ask some of your friends for kind of a clan that gives you the kind of gameplay you want 
this game isnt easy 
not talking about gameplay but im talking about finding some community to get into thats gonne help you out and that is actully active
this game could be a little bit weird sometimes but when you can get a nice gamplay with some of your freinds its the best. 
YOU MUST HAVE MODS FOR REAL!"
27447,"This game is whatever you make of it. All of my hours playing are in modded MilSim custom servers. I've enjoy 95% of my time. Glitchy and finnicky at times but that kinda grows on you after a while and it can be quite funny. I've met a majority of the people that I game with daily through Arma and its the only reason I decided to build a gaming PC. All in all I'd consider my time in Arma well spent. If you're looking for a community game that offers endless replayability I would highly, highly recommend Arma 3 to anyone interested in FPS shooters that can truly be anything you want it to be with a bit of tinkering!"
27448,"Arma 3 Base Game is good but where it truly Shines is its Steam Workshop mods, the Content created by the community is amazing and it shows how strong the community and fans of the Arma Series. You also get the Realistic Milsim Experience And also the Fun Random shit or the Arma Physics. Arma 3 is a amazing game and i would be fine with wasting over 10k Hours on Arma 3. Thank You for the Amazing Expreiences Bohemia!"

27461,Great game with some bugs but endless amount of fun with such a great mod community this game will live for a while I know the fourth one will just be great. It is fun to simulate some things but others parts you just run around shooting suicide bombers and trying not to be some ai  M1 Abrahms lunch meat.
27462,"Great game, with a bit of a learning curve but that just adds to the experience"

27491,Its fun with friends
27492,you can carry 10 rpg rounds at a time
27493,This game is a great time sink and with so many mods and a huge modding community it really stands apart.
27494,"Put a lot of hours into ARMA II and ARMA III it felt it took awhile for the community in ARMA III to take off but once it did it was worth the wait. The base game has a lot of content to go through and huge maps to explore but where the games shines is the community made content. 

There is pretty much content for most conflicts after WW1 in this game making the sandbox huge just expect to use a lot of disc space if you keep finding mods you want to try out add on the offical DLC to this game even if it's a tad pricy there is a lot of content to wrap your head around. 

Downside I guess to ARMA III is the modding community really makes it shine even more once you use some of the most popular mods for ARMA III it's hard to go back to standard vanilla ARMA and also learning controls can take a long time because nearly everything on your keyboard does something in game still defeintly worth trying out and giving a chance like I stated before there is something for everyone in this game you just hve to give it a chance."
27495,"i mean, if u really want to, u can."

27578,This game is fun. Don't let the negative reviews fool you. You just need to watch a shit ton of tutorials on all buttons. Coop multiplayer is fun when you manage to find a server you can play on consistently. Antistasi is fun when you find the right mods.

27594,"As a member of the US Army,  i look for realism in the games i play. And by far this game is the most realistic. From the interior   of the mraps, to  the actual maneuvering  of  the fire teams and squads. Right down  to  the  actual way your supposed  to react to contact on patrols. And  calling out of  targets. If you want to experience  a game that mimics realistic scenarios. This is that game 10/10"

27625,war is hell... and a little buggy. But his game is so fun when you find the right people
27626,"I love ARMA series. It was a match from heaven between me and ARMA.
This game is highly recommended for those who can benefit from the in-game ability to simply try out different weapons and come up with intense self-developed military scenarios for a breathtakingly realistic combat experience. This game is extremely versatile when it comes to activities you may enjoy the best - it might be a multiplayer experience with a pretty simple task - to dominate the whole island, long-range tank duel, paratrooper attack on a mountain base or a well known zombie survival.
It all depends on you.
It is also highly recommended to try out Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead (or solely Arma 2) to expand your milsim horizons.
Bohemia Interactive are also doing a great job by supporting the game - you can find a great addon to spend enough time on. ""Global Mobilization"" is a great one, try it out.
Definitely a must-have game that deserves time spent if you are into military action games that are realistic enough to be a wonderful challenge."

27633,"Do not buy this game if you value your free time. Despite being occasionally being glitchy and having the frame rate of a picture book at times, its addicting in both single player and multiplayer modes. Great communities, loads of resources to learn how to play, and a massive amount of mod support. So many neat weapons, transportation, situations, and maps to check out. You could play as a SAS operator with 100% correct equiptment on a serious and well planned mission, or you could be a Roblox noob skin with a tommy gun fighting terrorism. Up to you

27673,One of the best Mil-Sim video games out there. Love the modding community. Really hard to learn at first and involves lot of practice and fixing the keybindings but its worth it. Everything after setting up and learning is easy to repeat. Gun game play is amazing (have no experience with vehicles). Game is to expensive same with the DLCs (which ads pop up in game for them as watermarks). Why do we need DLC items that we cant use in a game and cant operate? Yes. Why is there a go cart DLC? Yes. Other than the pricing for the base game and other DLCs is great and amazing. I don't have that many hours but from a first impression this game is really well made. The community is also amazing. Jumped into a random multiplayer game and asked for help. Got help almost instantly. People are much less toxic in this game compared to the players in Rainbow 6 Siege but that has its reasons as to why its like that. Forgot what I paid for this but either way its worth.
27674,"Arma 3 is probably the best military sim that you can play. If you like flying, driving tanks, and realistic shooting you'll like this game."
27675,"This game is not bad, it has decent gameplay, and a good amount of content plus the mods you can get for it. However the main reason I don't recommend this game is because of its horrible player base, and now its because of the fact that the admins are now banning people from the official servers for a rule that never existed.

Back to the player base, about 60% of the people who play the game are either trolls or hackers, and yet like a said before the admins refuse to ban them instead, this makes the game almost unplayable when doing public servers, if you want to have a good decent time and still play with others... your only option is to join a unit or play only with your friends on your own server. So if you plan on buying this game get it when it goes on sale and like a friend of mine said don't even bother with the half ass DLC"
27676,Noice
27677,waste of my life
27678,"It's an older game but it checks out on the realism level. Read the reviews done by the pros in the review section. My advice, have a good server, maybe some friends"
27679,"You need a very beefy computer to play this game, and even then you will get freezes, stutters, and random bullshit."
27680,"dume game sucks cock
"
27681,"I just recently hit hour 1,000. This is the only game I've spent that much time in, except for Minecraft, and I started playing Minecraft when I was eight.

What is it about ARMA that made it fun enough to play until hour 1,000? Why do I think I'm probably going to hit hour 2,000 and keep going?

It's the modding community. The ARMA community has several amazing parts to it, but the modders make it all happen. There are mods for this game that add EVERYTHING. Want to be a US Army rifleman invading Iraq in 2003? Mod for that. Want to be a British infantryman fighting the Nazis in France? Mod for that. Want to be a Space Marine from Warhammer 40k? Mod for that. Want to be a Clone Trooper from Star Wars? Mod for that. Want to be a Mobile Infantry from Starship Troopers? Mod for that. Want to be a Roman Legionnaire? There's a mod for THAT, if you can believe it. Almost any possible conflict, from history or fiction, that involved soldiers, there's a mod for it. Sure, they're sometimes janky, and modded ARMA 3 will teach you that 30 FPS is a luxury, not slow. But the game allows you to immerse yourself in a conflict in a way no other game does, and sometimes does it far better than the source material for that universe.

There's no better example of this than Operation: TREBUCHET (OPTRE), a total conversion mod for ARMA 3 that takes you to the Halo universe. The Halo universe is one of my favorite scifi universes out there, and it has so many interesting concepts, characters, and locations to explore. The Human-Covenant War is an amazing setting - an apocalyptic battle where half of humanity loses their lives in a desperate fight against a genocidal alien menace. However, the Halo games always lacked something, and I never quite understood what they were missing until I played ARMA with OPTRE installed.

OPTRE adds a million different little things that allow you to live the Halo universe. All of the human weapons that fans are familiar with, and many more from the novels or even Halo-flavored weapons that are just from the minds of the devs, are available to you. True to the setting of the 2500s, you're given a dizzying array of technology. Jetpacks, motion trackers, thermal imaging neural implants, quick-healing biofoam, ODST pods, and body armor that makes you pretty damn durable. With this wide array equipment, you're either pitted against the Insurrectionists, a faction in a human civil war that was ongoing before contact with the Covenant, or against the Covenant themselves (even if the Covenant do lack content compared to the Insurrectionists). However, OPTRE doesn't lose that signature ARMA feel, and that's where the beauty of the mod lies. Even when you wrap yourself up in the heaviest armor a Marine or ODST could wear, a few well-placed shots can still lay you low.

That's the fundamental beauty of ARMA, its mods, and OPTRE in particular. In the mainline Halo games, you play as Master Chief, a living god who can shrug off barrages of machine gun fire and cave in the skull of his enemies with one punch. In ARMA, you play as a scared Marine who has to take cover when the guns start going off and call in air support to clear out strongpoints, instead of charging them solo.

Specifically, fighting the Covenant has an entirely changed face in ARMA compared to a Halo game. Take an Elite - Eight feet tall, energy shielded, and wielding plasma weapons firing deadly energy bolts with a high rate of fire. As Master Chief, it's a worthy adversary, but nothing more than that. As a Marine with nothing but a rifle and his wits, even a single Elite is a monster that you have to coordinate fire with your squad to take down. The existence of ARMA's extensive mission making tools means that you can play through a thousand different battlefields with the only limit being the imagination of the mission maker. I'll never forget when I lived through my first glassing as a Marine, watching a city full of civilians I was trying to save get burned to ash while I was forced to run and hide.

ARMA in general - and Opreation: TREBUCHET specifically - is the most enjoyable experience I've ever had with a video game. I've made friends that will last a long time, gone through missions that I'll never forget, and I'm still playing - and hope I can keep playing for a long time still. ARMA is glorious. Also, love you, CITF Sierra. You know who you are."

27699,"This is a must have if you love MilSim games, there's just so much potential to what you can do. It's up to your imagination to how you want to do things!"
27700,"I bought Arma3 way back during Beta/Early Access and I finally got around to playing and trying it out. I saw the DLCs it got and figured if I enjoyed my time with it, I would buy them eventually.

So here I was playing coop maps with nearly 100 players, having fun, til I picked up a DLC item. I don't mind the nagging on the side and when you go to leave the match to buy the DLC.

But then...

If you wear the item for long, the nagging becomes shop icons all over your screen and a MOTHER FUCKING BUY THIS NOW ON THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN, blocking your view from whatever it is you're doing. I would have felt way less aggravated if the game simply didn't let me wear the item at all to begin with.

Now, this kind of behavior is so infuriating that I WILL NEVER BUY A SINGLE DLC. In fact, if I could have asked for a refund I would have on spot.

Since I can't refund and try to not to endorse this kind of garbage anti-consumer behavior, I will just enjoy my time without touching any DLC item ever again and never giving money to anything touched by Bohemia ever again.

Good job.

--------------------

To the couple comments; It's not about being able to use or need the DLCs. Like I said, I would be fine with not being able to equip a DLC item at all. That I would understand. Disrupting your gameplay as an advertisement, that's unforgivable. That shows how little they care about the player and how they decide to treat their customers. This is not a free game, I bought the base game years ago and by making the mistake of wearing a DLC item once, I can see exactly what they think of me. Just a wallet to give them more money. You can argue that's what companies are after with their product, your money, sure. But you can get someone's money with respect instead of blocking the view of the game they're playing middle combat.

The shop icon on the right is fine.
The 10 second advertisement wait when you leave a server is bearable and I wouldn't mind it.
The fact you can't pilot DLC vehicles is fine.
Not being able to equip DLC items at all would have been fine.

Blocking your screen from time to time with junk and putting a banner right at your sight for a FPS game is not fine. They lost all my respect."

27722,I've played this game so long and have a blast playing it other than the lag sometimes. But I really enjoyed it I wish the DLC were a bit cheaper tho when they came out
27723,"It's mindblowingly expansive, if not a little glitchy. Id play it again"
27724,is very yes
27725,Yes
27726,Yes
27727,"please help me these people caleld JANFU have me locked in the basement making missions 24/7

EDIT: i dont even enjoy this game any more. Every friday richard aiello DM me saying not to go to casino or dennys. these are my two favorite past time. but instead we go and play another CO32 in vietnam attacking russians. i cannot take it much longer. please cut the rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
27728,"I really dont like Arma games since playing Cold War back in the either the late 90's or early 2000's.  The enemies act like bots and you cant even hide in a bush without the whole game finding you after you ran through a forest and hid somewhere that no human would be able to find you without a dog team.  Well the enemy must have stuck a GPS chip in your body, cause they find you everytime.  No matter if you hide in building or a bush, 2 minutes later you have jeeps, tanks, soliders, and LIV's on top of your location.  Like I said, it feels like I have a GPS chip in my body and the enemy is tracking my movements.  Not realistic."
27729,A-10 goes brrrrrrrr
27730,good game
27731,"Pretty Cuwl, Except for the fact that population is kinda low reciently."
27732,army game
27733,shit game
27734,"ITS VERY REALISTIC, plus theres so much you can do in the game, combat, rp, and more."
27735,awesome
27736,Nice
27737,love this game takes me back to the good ole days
27738,Great game that the developers still put time and energy into.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the genre.  Also there are a ton of mods and servers available for folks to play on.
27739,its really fun just to mess around but you need mods to get the full potential
27740,I still suck
27741,classic
27742,"Great game, and very immersive and fun with the right player."
27743,The fact that you can mod the hell out of this game always changes up what you can play and how you do it.  I could not recommend another milsim game more than this specific one.
27744,"its better than Arma 2 ngl, ofc with the graphics and all"
27745,Awesome games! Cool Mods in Workshop!
27746,its neat
27747,"ArmA is a very good game, however due to the way it handles physics in Multiplayer it can cause some...issues with vehicles. This includes being flung several kilometres at worst, especially if your connection is not good. The campaign is decent, I like the lore, and Apex Protocol is an extremely fun Co-Op campaign. I recommend this game, however you really need Apex DLC to get the full experience. I also think Helicopters and Marksman DLC are good to get."
27748,top notch mil sim
27749,So...Many...War crimes...
27750,"Diverse in demand making it comprehensive to learn, and highly enjoyable with some patience."
27751,its good
27752,10/10 would play again.
27753,Noice.
27754,"If you liked ARMA 2, you'll like ARMA 3. Not that quick and easy to learn, but it sure pays off the more time you spend with it. Partly because of a great mod community. Partly because of the game being such a great sandbox."
27755,very good game
27756,one of the best military sims i have ever seen
27757,"Buy ArmA, it is good."
27758,"Milsim of the decade. Pros outweigh the cons heavily and beats so many military simulators like War Thunder, etc. Also, the modding community is by all means, incredible."
27759,this game is really fun but it dose have it con's all the dlc are overpriced but you can still use dlc stuff but ads with cover your screen over time
27760,Blast
27761,Yeh its pretty fun to mess around with and create battle scenarios.
27762,"one: yes?
: yes."
27763,Yes gud game get gud
27764,when the
27765,Antistasi is real good especially with friends!
27766,:D SEX
27767,It's addicting and a lots of active communities.
27768,"The base game itself is a fun experience, and while there is a stiff learning curve, this game definitely has its moments. The best thing you can do when getting this game is first go through the single player for a bit and then research some units on Google. Some units can be very tough on new players, however, most of the community is fun to play with. If anything, buying this game opens players to a whole new community of people who just want to play and have fun while still maintaining a level of professionalism."
27769,I adore this game and is easy to just get lost for hours in.
27770,"what the fuck is happening


10/10"
27771,">After a lot of time, finally managed to get to the end of the mission
>When the screen was fading to black, I accidentally step on a mine and die
>Game cuts out to the next level
>Loading...
>Cutscene of the next level starts
>""You Died...""

11/10 realism"
27772,good graphics does need some work but still very very good game if you like army based stuff
27773,Lots of fun
27774,100 gecs
27775,"You won't find another War Simulator like Arma 3. However, if you wish you play online (primary reason for Arma 3) you will HAVE to keep up with purchasing the new DLC to be able to play your favorite online server. BUT, if you have the money AND you enjoy playing every day you have free time/day, I recommend it 100%. 
Best online mode is King Of The Hill. I've tried them all, KOTH is my favorite. CodeFourGaming, ArmaKOTH, or HostileTakeover servers are reliable."
27776,Very cool.
27777,"After many hours of playing multiplayer, it's clear that this game is mainly played by 16-year old military wannabes and fat, drunk 30 yr old boomers that power trip about having status over people half their age. Avoid large community servers at all costs."
27778,make my butthole whistle
27779,It's decent
27780,i love that you can parachute in this game and like it said '' arma 3 sends you to war.'' i confirm it sends you to war
27781,Even though it says 39 hours I've played for years. The game NEEDS mods and strong COMMUNITY to be fun but that isn't hard to find if you play multiplayer in and mode.
27782,fucking amazing
27783,"probably the best game on steam for role playing, highly recommend
Pros - endless fun 
Cons - none if you're trash at shooting games don't play takes all skills"
27784,Amazing game highly recommend it
27785,"preamble: while I have tried the pvp to a limited degree, I am mostly talking about the coop milsim part of this game

imho, this is a game that is only fully enjoyable if you have a good bunch of people to play with.  (a good/organised guild) There are a few places in this game where solo play is enjoyable, but to get the most out of this game - go big.

There are a few servers out there that are well organised, high sim level. If you are playing solo, I recommend these. You'll be told to join a specific squad, and from there on you just listen to and follow your squad leader. Generally the community on these servers is pretty decent and helpful. I've played this way and with a guild/outfit. Both are enjoyable."
27786,"If you are on the fence and are new to Arma (as I was) - don't be.  Even years after its' release, this game is awesome and constantly changing to provide endless hours of gameplay.  I'm 79 hours in and haven't even scratched the surface!"
27787,Good mil sim
27788,"Just a modders dream, DayZ and Wasteland are amazing"
27789,"its ok 
"
27790,very very noice
27791,Military simulator plus a modable sandbox with a variety of custom scenarios created by the comunity for the comunity.
27792,Good Game
27793,most realistic military sim I have played so far great story driven game with most amazing graphics
27794,"Best game ever, exactly the game i have been looking for. 10/10 recommend for people who love open world Military role play"
27795, game is good with mods
27796,"arma (arma)
"
27797,Very enjoable game if you're into milsim stuff
27798,"good game
"
27799,Really great!
27800,"The AI is so broken that the game is literally limited to multiplayer only.
1. AI squads get stuck between waypoints
2. AI Tanks can't get from point A to point B on any map, they are stuck on buildings or rocks
3. AI aircraft (here's the one over the limit) do not engage targets AT ALL. I think that helicopter AI is just a missing feature. Jet AI was probably written by a junior developer during lunch break.
The rest of the guys were busy thinking on how to add aliens to a war sim game :D

Seriously have you been smoking something? :D

FIX THE AI BOHEMIA! It worked very well in ALL your previous titles! How many years Arma3 is being patched? ;'D
I am a mission creator and I can't create a singleplayer mission because nothing is working ;D

Buy Arma 2 or Arma CWA instead, they are way better games :)

PS: Multiplayer is ok, when you replace AI with humans the game is OK :P"

27805,jesus has blessed us with A3
27806,"Forgot to review this, 3700 hours, enough said."
27807,If you want a MilSim experience like no other? this is the quintessential military shooter. It is a must for those of us who want dedication to immersion.
27808,is gud
27809,it alr
27810,Fairly realistic infantry combat.
27811,"Join in a server with one guy. Robbed a vehicle and run for our life in the bullet rain. Drove in a tropical forest for 20 minutes. Eventually reached a small town. Grabbed a sniper rifle from a dead NPC. My buddy went on a roof of a building and machine gunned the entire enemy squad. Then a heli arrived and we are stuck in a building surrounded by enemies. After 40 minutes we finally eliminated all of them while my buddy died several times. Then we drove to an airport. Grabbed our rpg and shoot down some tanks and choppers. Then the motor strike came in and we rushed to the nearest building and pray it didn't land on our heads. Then we grabbed rpg and made a enemy scout tower vanish. Just when we are rushing towards a heli I got gun down by a NPC from nowhere, after another rain of bullets. We made to the heli and finally escaped. Best three hours of my gaming experience."
27812,gud gaem
27813,"graet game
"
27814,Half an hour in and i was nearly kidnapped 10/10
27815,Ahh yes slamming into a group of hostiles with hostages going 50 mph without firing a single bullet
27816,great mods for a great mil/sim experience
27817,"Endless fun around every corner and every game-mode. Want to attack a heavily defended airfield and have a player control the enemy AI? you got it. Want to run a checkpoint and make sure no insurgents get through? you got it. How about rescuing a downed helicopter crew? Sure why not. You can literally make any mission you want and use endless mods to make a Vietnam mission, Role-play server, WW2 mission, etc. If you like Realistic combat games this is definitely a contender. But I know for a fact EVERYONE who has played arma knows this saying ""Oh he just got arma'd"", while Arma 3 has its enormous upsides it definitely has its minuscule downsides such as vehicles flying in the air when ramming other vehicles, weird player model bugs, etc. Overall its a great game and well worth the Base price as well as the prices for all the addons. i don't think ill ever play another game for 2,500 hours ever again. and I'm happy it was this one"
27818,KOTH is by far the most enjoying game mode. Once you get your settings down the game becomes more enjoyable. Also there is a big learning curve for learning all the controls.
27819,1
27820,fun
27821,Optimize your game ffs
27822,"very fun, realistic, but very buggy."
27823,TOXIC COMMUNITY
27824,"Great game, love mod support."
27825,GOOD GAME
27826,its fun pew pew hehe why am i here
27827,"i personally waited for years to play the Arma series and i finally got to, and ive only scratched thew surface of the multiplayer   but i know its gonna be an absolute blast"
27828,Is very good
27829,ok
27830,Loved it.
27831,9/10
27832,"fucken hard
"
27833,"Clunky, but complex and versatile. Inform yourself about the game before blindly buying it (User generated Content, popular gamemodes etc)"
27834,yes
27835,yes
27836,Best game ever made in human existence! Except for the low FPS rate. Can't wait for Arma 4
27837,"very smelly game would rather fall over in a puddle
"
27838,"This game is fun, wild, and full of limitless potential."
27839,6w4et7u5rfyghikj
27840,"Gave me some good memories over the years. The core game, missions/scenarios, aren't what people play in this game. This game is full of variety from playing life servers to escape from real life, to mil-sim type servers (not my niche but to each their own), to the more pvp focused styled servers with battlefield-esque king of the hill (about 100 players trying to capture and hold a single point in the map) to the dayz type survival servers which can range from very realistic and difficult to the easy, more sandbox type survival servers. Also decent pc is pretty needed for this game"
27841,"""Tactical quad bike drop spam yes""

Arma III is one of those games that welcomes players from all places. Are you a memelord that seeks stupid levels of dumb combat? There is definitely a mod/server that welcomes you. Are you a serious player that wishes for cooperation between teammates? There is a place for you as well. The mods are fantastic as well. I like to say that this is the GMOD of tactical shooters. If you do buy this game, make sure that you wait for a sale and have a decent PC."
27842,"cause why not
"
27843,"decent game, buy it on sale, not worth the money at 45 bucks"
27844,!
27845,"ONLY FOR TALENTED PEOPLE, LIKE MYSELF."
27846,"buy this if you have a lot, and i mean A LOT, of freetime (for serious roleplay etc.)"
27847,no
27848,fun
27849,its okay i guess
27850,"Now while it says I have over 1700 hours in this game it is likely more around 1000 due to it sitting idle so much. Despite this, Arma 3 is definitely one of the best games you could possibly purchase for replay value. The variety of missions and experiences you can have is nearly limitless. The visuals are great for the age of the game and the developers are still working on new content for players to enjoy. While this review is not very comprehensive on the details of the game I would have to say the experiences I have had within it are some of the best out there. So thank you Bohemia Interactive with this game and I plan on enjoying it for years to come."
27851,this game is so bad it should be illegal to sell
27852,pp lol
27853,This game is great. Amazing people.
27854,best game ever
27855,THIS GAME IS SO FUN WITH FRIENDS AND ITS PROB THE MOST REALISTIC GAME I HAVE PLAYED
27856,"
"
27857,Just try it if you like destroying stuff.
27858,"Played for a little, it's pretty fun"
27859,its arma3
27860,very fun milsim and also just to hoon around in wastland and such gamemodes
27861,"ARMA 3, immerse yourself realistic world ravaged by conflict, take part in solo spec ops missions or engage the enemy face to face at the front line, Air, land and sea, fully moddable! Survive a zombie apocalypse or a post-apocalyptic setting, terminators, ect. not for the faint!"
27862,aye its alright
27863,This is not your mindless run an gun. Teamwork goes a long way. 100's of different game modes thanks to the modding community. Always a blast
27864,"10/10 hides how bad I am at FPS by having the engine constantly kill everyone around me.

Best friends are made in this game though."
27865,game sucks but with mods its cool also I had to use my girlfriends tits to get some cool private gear mods.
27866,Very Unique and fun to play.
27867,Best Physics ever
27868,HEEEEELLLLL YEEEEEEEEE
27869,"yeah coming back for breaking point
"
27870,Only fun if you have friends to dick around with.
27871,its fun and a good lerning experiance
27872,kind of boring but fun i guess
27873,"This game is absolutely amazing and i highly recommend it. However, if you came to this game from Soviet Womble, Nano, or another youtube channel's highlights, that isnt what this game is."
27874,ta bueno
27875,"This is less of a ""game"" and more of a sandbox/framework for games to exist. Multiplayer is where the game shines, and the modding community keeps delivering even after near 10 years."
27876,great
27877,Its a really difficult game but it is a lot of fun when you know how to play it and when your with friends.
27878,Best Military Sim I've ever played 10/10!
27879,really fun
27880,only played a bit and its well bloody good ngl
27881,good game
27882,"Amazing game, bugs are a thing at times usually physics wise. But god this game is fun :P"
27883,A great game to play with a clan of groop of frends not good for solo
27884,Sandbox Shooting game with limitless Fun
27885,"The ultimate milsim game there is, buggy...yes, but still a good deal of fun"
27886,"literally have no idea what im doing but still had fun

just shoot everything and hope for the best idk

oh and mods

8/10 balls"
27887,"Simply one of the most realistic and enjoyable games in existence, you can do absolutely anything combat related in this game."
27888,._.
27889,"Very fun game, although it has a big learning curve. Take time to learn the game and you'll have fun."
27890,Ive only played it for a couple hours but from what I have played its the most rage inducing addiction I have ever partaken in.
27891,Needs a new ArmA 4.
27892,"Wonderful game by itself. However, if you add mods the replay value is near unlimited and with countless servers and communities to join you will never run out of things to do. Im nearly 1600 hours in and i still am discovering new things. Buy it now."
27893,good game but bad u need dlc to have fun
27894,"Its not a fast paced game like CoD or Battlefield, but if what you're looking for is realistic tactics and complete character immersion than Arma is the ONLY game you'll ever want to play. I play almost exclusively on any server with a zombie feature because I fell in love with the original mod for Arma II, DayZ. No set rules just here you stand, there's gear and weapons around....and don't die. Good Luck. The age old rule applies...Die as the hero, or live long enough to watch yourself become the bandit."
27895,I can only do sandbox on a server and I really don't like servers
27896,yes
27897,best game ever
27898,A completely balanced game with no bugs or exploits whatsoever
27899,VERY GOOD GAME VERY REALISTIC
27900,if ya get it and want to play hit me up
27901,adscS
27902,Just look at my hours... It's been my favorite game for so many years. Still going strong with the public servers and private clans. Cant wait for ArmA IV!
27903,Best game
27904,i like
27905,"THE realistic military shooter. Well, at least until Arma 4 comes out."
27906,had it once pretty shit alone
27907,The best milsim game on Earth
27908,Highly recommend this! Watch out for sales!!! Mods make this possibly the last game you need to play!
27909,gaem
27910,I love this game but it has so many issues. It's buggy and you need a really good pc to play it without lag. My 1080 gets like 30-40 fps when playing king of the hill. Theres so much to do though which makes the game worth it on sale.
27911,Its ok I guess
27912,.
27913,vuhdeqvbhijqdUIBWFAUIB game is good
27914,best military sim by far
27915,"good
"
27916,"Terrible, absolutely terrible. 

Take everything you liked from the first game, the realistic weapons and vehicles and the ability to mess around in the armory and the campaign showcase where you could just do whatever and shoot the AI? All gone. All the blood has been removed because 12 year olds, all ability to shoot NPC's even in training/armory/showcase automatically fails the mission as 'friendly fire' or 'shooting civilians' then take the fact that not a single weapon or vehicle in this game actually exists in real life when this is supposed to be a 'simulator?' I would find it laughable had I not paid real money for this utter garbage. This is like an E rated Roblox version of Arma 2, don't make the same mistake I did by buying this. You will absolutely regret it."
27917,"Awesome game, only downside id u have to own all the dlc's to really enjoy it online with others, another would be how short the story is. What is really awesome about this game is that the mods add a whole addition to the game, and are very easy to install compared to a game like dayz etc. :)"
27918,"war crime simulator 2020, 10 stars"

27921,"Honestly, it takes a bit to learn. But, with practice, time, and effort, it is a excellent milsim. Do wish though we had more naval units, or submarine breaching and clearing. Imagine, like in Modern Warfare 3."
27922,"Would not play this if King of The Hill didn't exist. Tried Breaking Point, Exile, Desolation, Wasteland, all the ARMA 3 remakes that tried to cash in on what was popular on ARMA 2 but none of them ever got close to the ARMA 2 glory days. 

King of The Hill is not only unique to ARMA 3, it also plays around the mechanics and actual art style the vanilla game has instead of trying to make it something different. It also doesn't require any Workshop mods and is officially endorsed by Bohemia.

I'm really against how they did DLC in ARMA 3 compared to 2. (In ARMA 2, DLC objects you didn't own would be very low res, but in ARMA 3 if you use a DLC item it places huge ads on the screen and can pause gameplay with yet more ads leading to possible deaths due to this).

I managed to get 90% of the DLCs extremely cheap through sales or on Humble Bundle, yet I still wouldn't advise paying full price for them ever. Overall I'd say the FPS is garbage, mods aren't that great, the 2035 art style is a bit lame, animations/movement is janky, hit reg and desync awful, but man is KOTH fun."
27923,"Yes. Recommended. If you don't already have this game, sim-shooter great campaign modders dream. That's about it in a nutshell."
27924,PTSD Simulator. 10/10 would watch some dude in a red Toyota Hilux with 50. Cal strapped to the back mow down entire friendly platoon again
27925,"If you're looking for a single player call of duty-type FPS you're likely going to be disappointed. If you've watched a few Let's Plays and streams and you know what you're getting yourself into, you might not be disappointed. If you want to play modern FPS DnD with a tight group of friends including at least one that is saavy enough to DM, you're going to be so so happy. 

Regardless, it's not super expensive so buy it anyways."
27926,fun
27927,its okay i guess
27928,"After 1300 hours on this game, I can 100% recommend this game for the full price, although I highly recommend also getting the DLC (especially Apex) as they add a good amount to the base game. 

 Arma 3 features a highly customizable, simulator-esque sandbox experience without taking the realism too far.  The community is by far one of the best on steam, and the possibilities are endless with modding. Want to play as the Clones from star wars? You can! Want to play as some Space Marines from WH:40K? You can! Want to become a ultra-high speed operator with special kit and vehicles? You can! In short, this game can be tailored to any person who desires a shooter game and can remember keybinds."
27929,Great game if played with the right mods and the right people... Very dependant on a large SSD
27930,Great!
27931,a good game get it
27932,Not worth buying since you are almost forced to buy 10 DLC's for a normal experience in game...
27933,"shoot gun, run around"
27934,GBU-12 simulator   9/11
27935,Good game!
27936,"It is an incredible experience, as you can have fun in multiple ways."
27937,"DLC milking with an already high price tag. If using weapons and driving vehicles is behind a paywall clustered by ads constraining your HUD, don't include them in promotion trailers. Companies as such must be taken to court and be persecuted for false advertising."
27938,meh
27939,"Its a niche game. If anybody is interested in mil-sim games, it is ARMA. Its not run and gun. Its ARMA."
27940,"god gam
"
27941,"Good:
-Old Man scenario is a pretty good singleplayer campaign, although it couldve been more optimised for freeroam
-The short singleplayer campaign is decent

Bad:
-Had issues with battleeye so I couldnt join the server I wanted to try
-The coop mini campaign of which I forgot the name couldve easily been made more single player friendly but isnt"
27942,"Steep learning curve, and the AI is basically Chris Kyle, but I love this game none the less. I never thought that playing a game can get my heart pounding the way this one does and can sometimes strike outright fear into you when you hear the bullets cracking by your head. I love how the game gives you basically endless options of what you want to do and how you want to do it every time you fire it up. Each time I play it I learn some new mechanic that I didn't know about before that's just how vast this game really is. The controls definitely take time to learn and get used to but I must say I have been enjoying the challenge (Its especially challenging for me since I'm pretty new to playing on PC and with mouse and keyboard since this is my first one ever)

The game looks good even though it is pretty old and it runs well on my PC I have some issues with the game freezing now and then but its not super often. If you are looking to step into a more realistic military focused shooter and are willing to take the time to learn to play this I'd definitely recommend giving this a shot!"
27943,"This has been a long time coming, bought a gaming laptop just for ARMA."
27944,One of my favorite games! hopefully Arma 4?
27945,gd
27946,The Geneva Convention doesn't have effect in this game. Buy if you are interested in war crimes. Would recommend.
27947,.
27948,emejing
27949,A beautiful nightmare
27950,like it A LOT
27951,very epic
27952,"Game is complicated and barley functional, 10/10"
27953,"Don't even think about it, JUST BUY IT!!!! STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT!!!"
27954,"*joke about killing civilians and warcrimes*

oh btw, it runs better than you'd expect. i expected 10fps @ lowest settings, but i can get stable 40fps +-10 with laptop from 2016."
27955,great game for those who like in depth shooters and if you are interested there are many quality and easy to download mods that will make the game even better so i would reccomend this. (obviously)
27956,its just great.
27957,"ARMA 3 is a good game, depending on what you are looking for. If you are after a serious community in MILSIM (Military Simulator) or just enjoy some king of the hill in a more realistic shooter, then ARMA 3 may be up your alley. It's important to note it's still very buggy and poorly optimised. It will also take some time to learn everything but to just start playing won't take long."
27958,game is somewhat ok
27959,"it's good
"
27960,"Okay I actually played this one legitimately.

It's alright."
27961,"Never, ever have I played such a terrible game that I enjoy so much.

"
27962,"Yes, it's worth it."
27963,"iT KEEPS EVOLVING

27965,milsim cuck
27966,"It's buggy as hell at times and other times it works flawlessly. The solo campaign is decent but the multiplayer experience is where it excels. I don't know that the base game is worth buying full price, but if it goes on sale and one of the DLC bundles is  like half off I'd say its definitely worth it. 
The vanilla game-play is good, but downloading mods from the workshop will make your experience so, so much better. 

One major downside-the game is massive w/ mods. I'm at like 90 gigs."
27967,runs worse than a fat kid on a hamburger treadmill
27968,Best 970 hours of my life..
27969,With many mods available for free even if you somehow cant find something to like in the vanilla game you can 100% find something you love in the workshop
27970,ALLAH HUACKBAR
27971,TWAS GOOD
27972,"Civilians go boom, me likey"
27973,realistic
27974,great game
27975,"awesome game, complicated controls but they work well when you get the hang of it, nice realism in it, lots of premium dlc only items on servers though"
27976,Awesome MilSim
27977,fun with family and friends.
27978,waste of money.
27979,amazing game
27980,one of the best game ever if u like war simulator u should buy it
27981,its an amazing game with cool featchers
27982,">the graphics are not that great. and in the prolauge i had on average 60fps. (running on rtx 2070 and I5 8400 16gb ram)
>idk if it is just me or the matchmaking is broken.(it is probably  just me but i suck at dealing with internet/router issues)
>a lot of pointless and confusing ui elements."
27983,"Arma 3 is the best military sandbox game, 3 factions with multiple units, vehicles and equipment, this is game is worth every penny, Its DLCs are also amazing, only the ones made by Bohemia though, 7 years on this game is still thriving with players, its a miracle, its communities are also amazing to hangout with, if you buy Arma 3, i would recommend getting Apex and Marksmen DLC, Apex gives you the best stealth outfits and NVGs, marksmen gives you amazing and powerful rifles, worth your money and time

27984,The best military game to play with friends hands down. A little buggy and weird but so much freedom for you to make your own fun
27985,"Very immersive game
"
27986,Good
27987,
27988,very fun game
27989,Best when Modding
27990,you can not call yourself a true gamer when you never died by walking down stairs on normal walking speed. 8/10
27991,always my go to game when i'm not playing console the immersion is amazing time just vanishes
27992,"fun, realistic, worth the money. dlc's are quite pricey though"
27993,"for a millitary sim its pretty good but there is lots of bugs and it gets very boring very fast
"
27994,"The game is pretty buggy and public Zeus can be VERY toxic but I've come to really enjoy Arma 3 because of the 3den editor, the mods you can get, and the tactical groups you can join."
27995,gun
27996,It's good.
27997,nothing beats this !
27998,11\10 Would Recommend. 3 years of my life spent great and many more to come.
27999,"Sometimes the game physics give a f*ck of you, but that's what makes ArmA 3 funny.

Good Game."
28000,its cool
28001,"I love this game, my friends and I have so much fun playing!"
28002,"Pretty extensive environment... not as smooth as say, Battlefield V - but a lot more 'real' and customizable.  Looking forward to getting more fluent and getting my head around the idiosyncracies of ARMA 3"
28003,"Arma 3 is a fantastic game and is the foundation to a Mil-Sim masterpiece. The vanilla version is a fantastic base to which the content creator community only build further upon. The Modding community have taken what the developers finished with and ran a marathon, taking the game to a completely new level. 

I would strongly suggest involving yourself with Mil-Sim groups if you have the time and energy. Before I became an adult I has plenty of time to invest into this game and joining an Australian Mil-Sim group took my Arma 3 experience further. 

The vanilla version has a limited amount of maps, weapons, vehicles and functions however, adding Mods really changes this. Some Mod packs include most weapons and vehicles ever used in modern combat. You can also download mods which make you a little developer and give you the chance to create scenarios with lots of components involved. 

I strongly suggest this game to anyone who has enjoyed games such as Battlefield & Squad."
28004,Good game
28005,"Is it good? Yes.
Should you get it? Not if your not comitted."
28006,Is ARMA is good!
28007,"Its not easy to play on your own but then that's what makes it special after all it's a war game ;) One thing I did not like was the BUY THE UPGRADE FOR THIS AN THAT as soon as I started playing AKA ""Old Man Add On"" I think it kind of spoils it when you buy a game and they ask you to pay for extras and add-on's like FACEBOOK GAMES :( ... but good game and graphics but a bit on the greedy side :/"
28008,game sucks
28009,IS GOOD
28010,Its good
28011,"tis good
"
28012,fairly good. would play again.
28013,if your a noob like me do not play this game unless you have friends to play with or dont mind playing with random people online the game is fun but frustrating to play and if you've never played a game like this before i highly recommend that you dont get this game
28014,"Personally this game offers something that a shooter game does not, you and friends will fall in love playing this. Unless your me and playing on a very bad pc lol"
28015,decent fun with mods and buddies who'll play with you
28016,its a fun game
28017,"too many games, so few time to play"
28018,Very good graphics and easy to be immersed in. My one complaint would be that it frequently crashes but that might be my PC rather than the game itself
28019,"The best online PvE or PvP Shooter ever. Realistic physics, awesome graphics, and an enormous amount of things you can do. The Eden Editor is my favorite because you can do almost anything with the maps and every aspect of the game is in your hands."
28020,"I dont regret even a second spent on it,if you find good server with good guys this game could be the best one you played"
28021,sure
28022,.
28023,"I've played this game for hours, and I can safely say that the multiplayer is fun I just strongly disagree with third person view in a Multiplayer FPS, I couldn't care less for singleplayer mode.

The ONLY thing I strongly dislike is the AI Squad Controls are a pain, I highly recommend a Voice Control Mod to assist in squad command."
28024,One of the most confusing game ever developed. But still one of the most realistic ones.
28025,"amazing game for the people who like simulations and military things 
endless hours of play time would recommend it to friends who want military sims"
28026,good game cant wait for arma 4
28027,"yep, good one"
28028,gay
28029,This is a great game o play with the boys with or with out mods arma is always the way to go
28030,hours of fun with da boys
28031,"If gun don't work. Just use more gun.

10/10 
Would use more gun again"
28032,its alright
28033,"If you are someone who like military simulations and games you can mod to make your experience even better than this is the game for you, this is not a call of duty like game this is way better, enjoy."
28034,i love this game
28035,"I first got this years ago to play with a Friend on an RP server. It was so freaking boring and lack of good RP. I had better RP on Offical GTA Online Servers. Then the normal PVP style servers are awful for the fact the game is VERY clunky along with 600 Million key binds. A large majority of the Mods are trash and not well done BUT with that being said some are actually fairly decent if not good! Some mods added guns, clothing, vehicles, and factions which I found a few of them really good. Then one mod added the ability to create you're own single player missions of sort and play through them. I spent more time doing those than anything else on this game. Overtime this game has NOT aged well at all and seems to be mostly dead  (which for good reason). Do I think this game would be worth getting now? No.. A few years ago? Maybe! I never felt that It was worth what I paid for it even more so considering you have to pay for almost all the Add on DLC... Best bet just wait for Arma 4 and hope it is a better overall game."
28036,help pls i dont now how to get air practice
28037,good
28038,"Singleplayer is alright, however the communities will give you the proper experience. This plays as a simulator and not an arcade shooter, so make sure you enjoy that sort of stuff before buying it."

28040,disghgjyrejrye8yrge
28041,demanding
28042,An amazing game
28043,"I dont think any game i've ever played quite captures that feeling of impending doom quite like arma 3. Could be just you and 1 other person on the server and you'll still be checking windows and watching the horizon. So yeah, pretty meh

7/10 Warthog go brrrr"
28044,"https://youtu.be/cpME8BD0ys4

 if you are unsure about weather or not to get this game check out this video

The community is welcoming and the game play is unreal! More videos to come so subscribe to the channel"
28045,"Make sure you have a beefy PC if you play this game, particularly, the processor and the Graphics card because This game will throttle your computer!!! But if you have that kind of PC, can get it to run smoothly on decent settings and you have friends to play with, this game can be hundreds of hours of fun! Definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes mil-sim and Armies around the world in general!"
28046,"8/10 would recommend
-1 FPS very low when playing populated online (Not much they can do just an old engine trying to calculate the gameplay)
-1 building and ground movement physics are bad. (Again. Old game)"
28047,epic video game
28048,"Not a easy and optimized game to play, but good realistic virtualization of war."

28055,"Amazing game, Highly recommended."
28056,
28057,"It's an amazing game! I do kinda wish it was easier to control AI tho. But anyways, recommend this game to those that like military games."
28058,plenty of fun and with mods you can tailor the experience to how you want to play. 10/10 would recommend and I have to multiple friends. great game to pick up endless fun.
28059,"SWEET GAME , WHY DON'T YOU OWN IT YET"
28060,yes
28061,Pretty realistic
28062,Finally Figured out the controls!
28063,"There is an endless amount of things you can do on this game, and thanks to the modding community Arma 3 has amazing servers and communities, from Life RP's to King Of The Hill you can find a pretty vast variety of things to do, new maps, weapons, vehicles, units and even new mechanics added into the game through mods. Feeling creative yourself? Well Arma 3 has a cool editor where you can set up and create scenarios/missions which you can release for everyone to enjoy. Anyway I hope this review helps anyone looking to get in on the action."
28064,yup
28065,i want it back it is a good game plese can i have it back
28066,Excellent and realistic war sim with a very active modding community makes for endless playability.
28067,lively
28068,"Very clumsy controls, lame graphics, dumb AI. Don't waste your time on this one."
28069,This game is a great game... even for how old it is.
28070,yee
28071,"its an okay game very laggy on big servers, desync is awful and to be fair the gun play is shite ahha but its a hilarious game to play with mates so get it and have fun ?

28102,Fuckin' solid
28103,Crappy cash grab. The AI are ridiculously intelligent and basically sniped me across the map even when I was just crawling on the ground slowly. Played so little of this game because it just isnt fun and every dlc is pay to win.

28108,I really enjoy the freedom of Arma 3's editor and all of the campaigns are very interesting and keep me playing wondering what will happen next.
28109,Its okay I guess. Might need a little more time to think about it tho.
28110,A fantastic milsim experience with some of the best community support around.
28111,no
28112,The detail and immersion levels are second to none
28113,"Amazing game thats all that needs to be said
"
28114,"Paid 44 dollars for this game. Let's check out how I think about it.


>A.I. is like trying to play hongkong 97 but with your dick as the main controller. (lets be real here, they aren't that bad.)
>8 year's after release, fans wanted the piece of shit performance to be updated. Maybe even run more than a single core. Still single core.
>$44.95 cents for this game. $100+ Dollars for DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT! $144 for the entire package if you want it.
>Oh, About DLC. The DLC made me think that 'Oh. Well, they're gonna force you to purchase DLC's. Or you can't drive cars, ride planes, helicopters, do sniping, and other types of stuff'. Then I saw how I could still use DLC! Just I'd get watermarks.
>>I don't mind about the watermarks. I actually found it quite cool that they allowed you to use DLC content without actually owning it.
>>>I then realize that...You are FORCED to purchase the DLC if you want to pick up a gun and use the gun! PICKING UP A FUCKING GUN REQUIRES YOU TO PURCHASE A WHOLE DLC?! What the fuck is this 'realistic military sim' turned into? What? Is this a prediction of 2035? ""EA Has taken over. Everything costs money to do now. To walk you must pay 35 dollar's. To breathe you must pay 100 dollar's. God save us all.""

>Game still runs like shit
>Developers might as well call themselves 'EA Interactive'.
>Your character loses all of it's stamina if you try to walk for 10 fucking seconds. (Jesus christ, thank god no stamina mods exist.)
>Grass can literally be turned off if you turn your foilage settings to the lowest. Making the game piss easy and at the same time saving FPS. [u] WHICH YOU WILL FUCKING NEED IN THIS SINGLE CORE FIESTA OF A MILITARY SIMULATOR [/u]

!I have a stockholm syndrome like affect with this game as I hate it so much that I like to play it.
!Sniping actually feels fun and not bullshit.
!You can break your back if you go prone and look up. Then hold down alt to look at yourself.
!The workshop is good and has many good mods.
!I can roleplay as an islamic terrorist and bomb as many buildings as I want. filling my backpack and inventory with RPG ammunition and bomb everything. Nobody can escape me as long as I have heat seeking RPG's.
!You can fly planes and suicide bomb into bases.
!Install a billion mods and finally realize that thsi game can actually go into 0 core.
!game runs like shit




TL;DR: game runs like shit"

28138,it's pretty good
28139,how the hell do people learn this game? I don't even know what a video game is after trying to understand this game.
28140,"Don't buy the DLCs at the start, you don't need them. The community has lots of mods to fix your apeptite"
28141,it is action pack.
28142,Still fun after years

28146,Arma 2 but better
28147,bit dog
28148,New engine when
28149,Game is good.
28150,"I cannot recommend this game enough. With the steep learning curve, it is clearly not for everyone--but if it sounds/looks like something you'd like, do yourself a favor and check it out.

Why?-- Well, first of all, Arma 3 is undeniably the best Mil-sim on the market.  Secondly, (as if the first thing wasn't enough) it is basically FPS Skyrim in terms of how moddable it is.  You get a GREAT game when you buy Arma 3, but you also get so much more."
28151,"*RUNNING*

28153,Its unbelievably big and varied.  I can barely get my head around it.  Thats what she said..
28154,"I've had some of the most memorable experiences in all my years of gaming, through this games sandbox platform. The endless hours of RP, building up an arms deal to dedicated customers, only to be pushed out of the market by a militant competitor, shot every time you're seen - to the bugs. The countless, game-ending bugs that can only be called ARMAisms. 

I hate this game, but it's an 11/10 from me dawg. I'll never forget these experiences."
28155,"Played it for a while, has its ups and downs really but i fully reccommend this game for anyone interested in milsim or even roleplay. The DLC's are also worth the money, at least most of them are :)"
28156,as soon as i figured out how to get a game of KOTH above 5 fps the game became similar to crack.
28157,nice
28158,"ERROR
Your review cannot be empty."
28159,"Do you like sitting in grass for 40 minutes... at 25 fps?
No?
Too bad, if you bought this game that's what you'll get up to."
28160,fun as fuck
28161,"Arma 3 is a unique game, a realistic military shooter which provides the ultimate sandbox, more than any game can ever offer. You can approach an objective any way your heart desires (stealth is not an option, because AI go full on terminator if they spot you, and their spotting mechanics are sort of unrealistic and weird). But if you want to go loud and proud, that is where the game shines. Take gunfights, or snipe them from far away, or call in mortar strike, or artillery strike or get a plane to provide close air support, come in from any direction, do it however you want and get the job done.

Multiplayer is fun as well. But you most definitely need a mic and most definitely have to communicate. Plan your attack, arrange an organised assault, take over a town, rescue hostages, kill HVTs, destroy convoys, equipment, structures, your mission can be anything, anywhere, you have to be up for the task. Co-op is where I enjoyed the game most. PvP is interesting but can be frustrating since you can get destroyed within seconds.

Arma 3 would never have survived unless it was fuelled by the dedicated and skilled modding community. There are lot of mods, which can exponentially make the game more fun. From adding guns, equipment, vehicles, maps, missions, mechanics you can get everything from playing chess to nuking a town. Total overhaul mods allows you to convert arma 3 into any game you desire, of course with arma mechanics. Want to play halo? Yes there is a mod for that. Want to play half life? Yes you can get that as well. Want to play zombies? Got that covered as well. Hell there are some mods that allow you to go dinosaur hunting. The modding community adds something priceless to the game which we are all thankful for. 

For solo players who don't want to touch MP or Co-op, of course the game is fun but you will be missing out on a lot. More the merrier.

I was skeptical about getting the game at first, now I regret not getting this sooner. 

TL;DR- 
1) Get a friend or maybe an acquaintance who will listen to your every command and is willing to lay down his life for you.
2) GET THE GAME
3) Enjoy the vanilla game 
4) Visit steam workshop
5) PROFIT"
28162,"My first Arma game of the franchise and i got to say from the salt flats of Altis to the mountain forests of Stratis this is hands down one of the funniest and pain in the neck games to play. This game can be modified to be a hyper realistic Military sim or a more complex single player military fps. Arma 3 has challenges for new players and allows players to learn the game at their own pace. However, make no mistake, multiplayer game modes such as wasteland which is a team vs team of many players of different skill levels will challenge everyone's abilities and skills. Some players are there for the up close combat. Others are there for the power of a unmanned vehicle to strike fear into enemies hearts with one missile. The Gracefulness of transport pilots or the long breaks between fast paced battles in the sky's with planes and attack helicopters. Arma 3 has a place for everyone. For the role-play community, to the fps player, to the master pilot, the skilled sniper, the powerful drone operator, to the armored vehicle operator. Arma 3 and its many game modes that range from a group effort to take over territory in Invade & Annex to the destruction and skill in Wasteland and the many other game modes. I hope like me you and your friends take the dive to learn and play this game. There is something for almost everyone."
28163,boom boom scary
28164,.... i have clue how i got 170H cuz it felt like 10
28165,Teammates are actually helpful and don't throw tantrums about campers or complain about over powered guns 10/10
28166,"*This game has not yet fallen to the Chinese Government (No offense) so do not fret!

Do you like Call of Duty?
Do you like Realism?
Do you like the idea of driving your 8 Billion dollar tank into a static light pole and blowing up?

Then this game is for you. ARMA 3 is a fever dream made by a bunch of of Czechs and their drug binge while thinking of a way to coddle Rainbow Six and Call of Duty together while making it a thousand times more realistic. Though they failed at that the result was the amazing rookie failure that is ARMA 3. This game is hard, you will go down in 1-3 shots if you are not careful. Though it may not seem like it, strategy makes up almost eighty percent of the game, not in general terms, but in quick-thinking terms. You will go from standing out in the open, getting shot and downed on the first shot; To being in cover and getting shot and downed on the first few shots. You will develop quick thinking and improvisation skills quickly and absentmindedly. 

Does the dictionaries worth of keyboard function scare you? Don't let it, cause once you get the hang of it it soon becomes second nature really quickly.

Does the vanilla sandbox feeling of the game turn you off? Does the price and warranty of the DLC make your wallet quiver at the thought? No worries, ARMA 3 modding exist, you will find amazing mods that look like they belong in part of the game, you will also find mods to completely ruin your experience so tread carefully.

This game WILL put your computer to the test, Pro-Gaming Desktops will struggle if you are not careful with your settings and mod choice list.

This game is far from perfect, there are fair shares of hackers and exploiters in the games, thankfully most servers and online facilities are run independently, so those kinds of people are a rarity. 

This game never lacks for players, you will always find full servers of warlord, KOTH, and many, many, MANY more. If you were drawn to this game from other sources such as filmmakers, streamers, or references by colleague. Don't be put off by the 'serious' appeal to the game, rest assure you will not find anything majorly hardcore unless you look for it.

This game however, is anything but perfect. Bohemian Servers are constantly having issues. The game will crash in vanilla for seeming reasons. I wasn't lying about blowing up from a light post either.

However, don't let that dissuade you, the glitches and constantly unbeknownst chaos are what gives this game the gold value many of us veteran players adore.

Play it. Struggle. Die. Give up. Return two weeks later cause there are no other games out there at the moment you'd enjoy. Get the hang of it. Enjoy it. Realize you are having fun. Keep having fun."
28167,It's pretty good if you know what to do :P
28168,The Game is very fun It takes a really long time to fully understand the game. The Modding Community is awesome although the lack of optimization with some of the mods can be very frustrating. The game is endless you can create and play whatever type of missions you would like to play at that date in time. This game by far is the most realistic ground combat you will ever get out of any game.
28169,fun
28170,"This game is actually a pretty good military simulator, and while it has many bugs (oh god its a lot of bugs) it makes for a pretty fun experience when you play with other people. It also has a lot of interesting mods to enhance your game play."
28171,shitty
28172,"Some people probably like to pretend to be a real military in this game but its more fun to just fuck around. If you hit a bush going 30mph with a quad bike it will break and probably explode as well. Its better at being a battle sim than being realistic, or at least the vanilla game is. The vehicle damage models are not very realistic especially."
28173,"No longer a Mil-Sim, now a RP-Sim"
28174,I guess its alright
28175,its amazing
28176,i enjoy realistic games also open to modding and if you also enjoy those things along with the milsim its a great game
28177,Good team play
28178,"Great game for anyone who wants an advanced military, adult sandbox :D"
28179,"Great game with a huge amount of mods available.
Pretty realistic too, except for a few weird bugs.
Only performance could be better."

28215,apparently barreling down a hill at full speed and crashing directly into a tree kills you
28216,haha arma 3 go pew pew RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
28217,Very good game!  I like the real life simulation and the attention to detail.  I really like the fact that I can play with more than four people.  I also love the fact that I can pretty much create my own game missions from scratch.
28218,"If only they would get the fps fix right, more optimized game this would be amazing! but thakfully their are a few tweaks that work. Overall good game"
28219,"controls are hard

28234,just buy it you can make your own scenarios with complex commands or download a mission or play on 1 of the many servers i recommend having a fairly powerful laptop or pc cause this game can get very laggy if you have the wrong hardware
28235,ya
28236,"definitely worth getting, and if you join a milsim community, its even better."
28237,e
28238,This game is a very good Milsim and realistic game sorta like Squad and Insurgency.
28239,soooo wen ARMA 4 ??
28240,its amazing and fun
28241,sht game waste of money
28242,"ive played this game for quite some time now, and I highly recommend it, it is a fun game to play with friends, random people online, and even alone, it is also a very realistic game, but sometimes it gets a little unrealistic, but that adds more fun
"
28243,"i dont know why i play this game, i just do"
28244,"The game is just a menu, mod mess. Needs a navigation through their menu for dummies. I am sure its a fine game once you sort through that mess but I have Squad and thats good enough for me!"
28245,realistic
28246,Good
28247,it's very fun and the community is very diverse
28248,"This fucking game, I've played it since it came out, I've been addicted to it, Don't get this game if you don't want to get addicted."

More of my life has been spent on this game..."

28251,Great Game. for multiplayer didn't mess with single player
28252,Not for the faint of heart
28253,"Played a bit, looks decent enough"
28254,"A bunch of issues have arrived recently.
A bunch of optimization and frame drops, losing connecting to the server whenever doing anything in Zues, AI arent too smart in Zues either, Plus the 20 hour download for a few guns and gear for GM.

If you got a good PC, its worth it, if not, its not worth it in 2021"
28255,"its alright hard to run tho so read guides before for performance such as the exe file which you may need to change every update and generic fps boost and launch options, cos like some, i also cba to keep installing a new exe lmao
"
28256,...
28257,if you like mil sims and massive scale fps. This is for you. Give it a try if you're not sure. You'll either hate it or change your religion to arma.
28258,Do not buy
28259,How Emersive it can take you spending 2 hours real time watching a hill only to realise its a bush rendering

28264,its litttt
28265,"It's okay.

[spoiler] Jk, it's good thanks to the great community and developer initiative in modding, though the engine limitations sometimes could disappoint, but i'd say it's a great sandbox overall 
P.S. I mostly play Roleplay modes [/spoiler]"
28266,"It's probally the most realistic game i've played in a wile i thnk u should play it.

"
28267,"gun shoot bullet, like very much"

28277,"Excelent enviroment, units and editor! Very realistic."
28278,pretty good
28279,It's alright.
28280,"Basic Observations I've Made So Far:
-Arma is the best with friends
-Bots have hax0r grade aim-bot (like seriously, tone down the wall hax pls)
-Murking civvies is pretty fun
-Awesome mods = war crims in every era imaginable (from the Star Wars Universe to WW2, this game has it all)
-Ur gonna want that full size keyboard for all ur binds
-U actually feel like Sniper Elite when landing those long range shots
-IRL there's a consistent something called ""physics"", in Arma there's a not-so-consistent ""physiks"" (slightly akin to a toned-down version of the Diesel Engine used in PD2)
-FRIENDS AND GOOD COMMS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENJOYING THIS GAME

(update for badge)"
28281,"I really want to play multiplayer but I don't want to pay for all the DLC. I also really want to play the campaign but the AI is fucking disabled, making it impossible to progress at some points. IDK what to do with this war simulator."
28282,i have a small cock
28283,most replayable game i have ever invested in
28284,awesome
28285,Great FPS MILSIM

28291,make sure you'v got friends to play with for the ultimate arma experience
28292,"The first thing I did when i got arma 3 was to uninstall arma 3.

Arma 3 = shit game and a waste of time.

I hope everyone who reads this listens to me and do what I did, uninstalling the game."
28293,basically it can be fun but there are retareds in the game and thae game takes me 2 hours to load in then the Ui disguting and i sepnt to much moeny ont this game also only 20fps

28296,Good game passed many hours playing LOL
28297,Great graphics and a decent gameplay
28298,best military game ever
28299,afd
28300,"Very good game - war conflict simulator, has a lot of commands, options, weapons, etc.
And the downside is that you need a really strong processor to make the game work smoothly and not chop, my processor is AMD FX 8320 and when I play on a multiplayer server when there are over 30 players on the server the game starts to chop and is not fluid so yes my recommendation is to ifrate this game with newer AMD Ryzen processors like Ryzen 5 1600, 2600, 3600 etc."
28301,"yea

28322,"Great game. I like flying the hummingbird on KOTH Code4Gaming, it's all I do and it's more enjoyable when you got the VR and Joystick in hand. Transporting troops to the AO from base is so fuuuuuuuun!"
28323,wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
28324,Military sandbox with as much/little structure as you want. One of the best mod communities in all of PC gaming give you limitless game play possibilities. I have played for 50+ hours and have yet to even touch the main campaign.
28325,great game. has its downside but however it keeps you locked in
28326,very good
28327,Idk I suppose its a pretty good game but I haven't put enough time into it to tell for sure.

28332,It'a an awesome game to play!
28333,"Yes. They are Acceptable Casualties. No. It isn't a War Crime.

In all seriousness, it's fun. Heck, after you're done with the vanilla version of Arma 3, The Arma 3 modding community has so much more to explore.

DLCs just add the fun to Arma 3 and actually feel like its additional content. Some of it. At least.

All in all, Game iz good for Lone Wolves like me and even greater with friends.

500 hours in, and there's still things I need to learn how to do."
28334,"nice game

28345,This game is amazing so many different mods and so many different things to do just get some friends hop on and you'll have a blast
28346,"Too buggy, could hardly play it, framerate is shit. Might refund idk not very fun"
28347,"I liked this game in the start was super fun i got bored at about 150 hours and started playing again then i met some cool dudes and after that i really got into the game again (Im bored again lmao)
Its a good multiplayer game and not all about PvP but more about teamwork and planning"
28348,"Arma 3 is a ever growing Military Simulator Sandbox with endless possibilities. Featuring a good Single Player mode, but the star here is the community and the multiplayer aspects both cooperative and competitive.

This is a sandbox game! Do not enter with a group of friends, a buddy, yourself, or even on a huge server expecting a very straightforward experience right off the bat. You create and experience your own memorable moments.

It is incredible how this game keeps pulling me in. The community keeps sculpting and shaping the game in the greatest ways including but not limited to ACE3, ACRE, RHS Sound, etc... Arma serves as one of the best war story generations and simulators even after soon to be a decade later from release.

New PC gamers will struggle to find footing in this game but for those who are willing to learn. It's the biggest and most sophisticated military sandbox on the market.

As quoted from another steam user by the name of [TFH] Webster as of this post. He said on June 23rd. ""A lot of people in the Arma community don't play this because it's easy - they do it because it's hard. But when you're through the first frustrating weeks, you will learn to love it. And you might have some of the most fascinating moments in your gaming career...""

With that, it's no wonder why I keep coming back to this game. The community, friends, and endless content.

[b] Graphics: 4/5 [/b]

[b] Gameplay: 5/5 [/b]

[b] Music: 4/5 [/b]

[b] Replayability & Longevity: 5/5 [/b]

[b] Quality & Experience: 5/5 [/b]

Quick note on the flaws. The clumsiness of bugs in the engine and sometimes admittedly the sophistication of it. The poor AI coding and lack of stability as a platform for certain mods can really get in the way to the experience. My personal counter argument to this is the game is reaching it's age. It still stands as one of the best military simulation sandbox games."
28349,A fantastic way to experience a taste of modern warfare in gaming format.
28350,Great Sandbox Milsim . Highly recommended
28351,nice
28352,"great game, lots of DLC and Mods to keep it fun and interesting!  enjoyable in whatever form you want to play"
28353,fps = 0
28354,Hehe war crimes.
28355,"good to play when bored 

p.s cost alot tho"
28356,"I like this game it's realistic, smooth and f**king cool."
28357,"Large learning curve and lots of keybinds to remember, but it's worth it!  Single player, multiplayer, map building, etc... it is about as realistic as it gets, and with mods, it gets even more realistic. 
I would suggest anyone who is into realism, RPG, or military sims get this game."
28358,Everyone is cool tbh
28359,Great Game!
28360,it gud scub
28361,"(this review includes mods)

28372,good game
28373,It's aight
28374,Its an extremely accurate Military Sim. Its replayable for many many hours.
28375,"It's a nice military sandbox, but you can use it for things other then military! like, zombies!"
28376,"pretty good game, play by yourself or with a few friends or game is trash, i promise"
28377,"Great game!  Still killing it in 2020!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpG7KyAGDEY"
28378,additional content costs a lot of money if you buy the original game your not getting much the creators were lazy and doing the mods is confusing. seems like original game should be free. NOT WORTH MONEY!
28379,Yes
28380,"its arma need i say more 

love it better than cod thats for sure
"
28381,the game in my opion is fun and a very acurate portrayll of real warfare

28390,it is really fun
28391,◊©
28392,"This game is fun, if you have friends and about 20 hours to learn every keybind and various ways of doing things. The game itself is hyper complex, but with mods it can be turned into rocket surgery.

These devs care about their game, totally would reccommend 10/10"
28393,its pretty shit but i like it
28394,Janky as hell and tons of fun in spite of it.
28395,"This Game is For Simulation Lover...Love it...Couldnt Stop Playing for now
"
28396,it pretty good
28397,noice
28398, if you plan on buying this in 2020+ then the graphics may feel dated but its a great game
28399,"This game gives you the freedom to create conflicts, scenarios, complete freedom to do anything, make anything. If you love current events, history, you can make your own! Shape your own reality!"
28400,"This is an amazing game for playing with friends and playing with large cooperative groups.

Unfortunately, I lack friends and any sense of working with other people.

10/10 would play again."
28401,"With the right players, this game is a really good mil sim"
28402,"this is the closest thing your going to find to a military simulator, that's still fun."
28403,"In all of my 142 hours i have enjoyed most of it. Personally I loved Modded version than the vanilla version.

What to expect :
Military Simulator, Can play Mil-Sim operations with your friends, can literally recreate Anything from Black Hawk down to the Assassination of Bin-Laden. If you're into Military simulation or are a huge geek for a certain country's Military and want to feel like a part of them, this game is for you. 

And yes this game is still fabulous even for 2020 , great time killer for me in quarantine xD. 

Where to Start :
I'd say get familiar with the controls, get the tutorial done and if you are confident enough start with the infantry Showcase. 
If you want to get into serious Mil-Sim look for a unit. Best place to look for is the Arma official discord, you'll find thousands of units and will defo find the perfect one for you. Joining a Mil-Sim unit will also help you out with the basics of ArmA and it's mods as most of the guys are more than happy in acting like a real Drill Sergeant xD.

PS : You might see the requirements but there's one Recommended requirement Bohemia forgot to mention.............. A pal to help you out for the beginning. HMU if you need help :)   
 


"
28404,"Oh boy... what's there to say about ArmA III?

It's vast, has a buggy physics engine and unlimited potential for gameplay. Is it for everyone? No. It has enough keybinds to cover two keyboards, so much so that there are times where I forget what binds I need to be using even though I set them and have played with them for 2000+ hours.

This is the first game (aside from Minecraft) in which I have invested significant hours. And I in no way regret it. You can do whatever the hell you like - shoot people, drive cars, gun tanks, fly helicopters, strafe with a jet plane, play as a civilian on a roleplay server.

Literally the most price-effective game I have ever purchased."
28405,"great 
"
28406,"Fun game, reccomend the rp communities to expeirenced rpers. However, some of the base servers are decent, and the atlis life in my opinion is boring.Very buggy game, more than dayz standalone and arma 2 dayz lmao. 8/10 overall."
28407,lit
28408,Be prepared to buy some DLC if you want any of the cool stuff. Otherwise its pretty darn fun by itself with so much to do.
28409,Its great i recomend antistasi
28410,its ok.
28411,mom
28412,Come play
28413,This is the most realistic army game i have ever come across its a must have really been with ARMA for the start and man i tell you this puts you right in the battlefield.
28414,gud
28415,"If you like: guns, tanks, shooting guns, shooting tanks, commanding a squad of soldiers, piloting a multitude of aircraft, shooting aircraft, shooting from aircraft, shooting others, and/or a game with an extremely extensive editor, look no further."
28416,yes
28417,dope
28418,"Its an OK game, what makes it fun is the group you play with. Find a good group, and enjoy your self."
28419,"just a overal nice game
"
28420,It's aight

28423,It‚Äôs one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played and the mods give you almost unlimited stuff to do!
28424,fun yes fun
28425,"Despite the fact this is probably one of the best games ever made, official servers are plagued by hackers. If you can't find community servers for a specific game mode, that gamemode is basically nonexistant. I got banned from community hub for 3 days for mentioning hackers. This game has shit moderation."
28426,Best milsim ever
28427,nize zimulator vattle kill
28428,"it's alright, i guess..."
28429,"It's a good game but wee need arma 4
"
28430,its ok.
28431,a
28432,"Bohemia knocked it out the park with this game, loved every 700+ hours i've invested into it, be it through campaign, antistasi, PVP servers, or through the A3Launcher. Would recommend this game to anyone interested in a great milsim with a variety of mods available for it too. My only negative would be the price of SOME of the DLC addons, but with that being said, i've absolutely invested enough time into the game to justify the cost. Sometimes struggle to think that this game came out in 2013 and looks and functions brilliantly."
28433,"Great fun with friends. There is single player content as well, however its one of those games where friends really enhance the experience. Strongly recommended with Steam Workshop content for the hardcore military shooter experience."
28434,"just a good game to chill with m8s and family gg for makeing this game sick
"
28435,tons of things to do unlimited amounts of missions events and scenarios hard to put down even when you claim your finished

28442,Big boy epic gamer gamer lots of epic mods if u want a epic tacticool experience this is the epic game for you bit clunky but thats what makes it epic.
28443,I don't know what I'm doing half of the time but other than that I think it's great.

28452,this game is kinda chunky untill you add sum diet mods then it gets guud also the campain has that one mission
28453,pretty solid if you like realistic shooters
28454,"game is rad, so many ways to play. get ready to get shot.....a lot"
28455,An excellent dad sim. Love a good and intense firefight where half the time you're shooting at shrubbery making snapping sounds? Enjoy looking over maps pretending you understand topography? Find loading a transport truck with supplies exhilarating? Then this game is for you.
28456,One of the best games i have ever played
28457,iuytgr
28458,Best military sim
28459,"It has its buggy moments, but no other game can deliver like ARMA"

28468,I Love Arma 3
28469,Best Realistic Military Game
28470,It's Arma what can really be said? Buy it!
28471,the game is huge most of the comunity is helpfull there is something for everyone best i can say to new players dont give up its a big learning curve
28472,"Soldier, 100 meters front!
MRAP, 500 meters left!
Rifleman, 300 meters right!"
28473,no ninjago mods
28474,This game as much as it seems to be clunky or queer. The posibilites of the number gameplay options are endless. With the right will and knowledge you can do anything with this game.
28475,very cool gun go pew pew

28482,where is arma 4 ? i need it
28483,meow
28484,"A little dated now but with all the MODS, hands down the best game every made. It is a sandbox that can be what ever game you want it to be. Pubg, Dayz, Deadside, Dead matter, etc. All based off Arma, That sums it up."
28485,A great military sandbox and editor. 5 stars
28486,good
28487,Still holds up. :)
28488,Good game lots of mods
28489,general belgrano
28490,"it ia good gME
"
28491,This game advertized very nice action good graphics and a good story. hard to see graphics story is if you buy at full price  but did not say you have to buy the game piece by peices steam offered the game at a fair price but only gave a skeleton of the game so bad quality low graphics and you are left with a skeleton you dont want to invest in....sit in the library
28492,"I purchased this game a while ago, and have only really played the single player scenarios made in the workshop by some amazing people.
Recently, I have talked my friends into playing this with me, so after figuring out how to host my own server, we go on these scenarios together. 
It often ends with us dying before reaching a mission objective, but we have a good laugh shooting blue on blue.
I would 8/10 recommend this for people looking to play alone.
10/10 for people that are looking for a mil sim game that they can play as a squad with their friends."
28493,Old but Gold.
28494,Yeah
28495,"Best military sandbox and RPG game, period."
28496,good
28497,base game is rather good. modded content makes it even better. my suggestion is watch a few tutorials on how to use zues along with get achillies. once you have done this the game becomes a full proper sandbox where you can spawn and fight what youd like. (for maps to have zues it must be added through the eden editor)
28498,"Idk how anyone plays this game seriously in a pvp setting. Wayyy too buggy, but if you got the right modset and right set of guys.. the Chris Kyle/Terminator hybrid AI is a great time to fight against.  Just remember, sometimes your the one who gets arma'd and laughed at. other times your doing the laughing."
28499,"Arma 3 is a good game. The mechanics are solid for singleplayer and for playing with friends and modding allows you to play almost any setting or scenario you could imagine. Well worth picking up, so long as you have an atleast half decent pc. Before I got myself a copy on my own steam account, I've played most of the main campaign and a few missions from each dlc and I can only point at a few times I thought the game was flawed, even then mods exist to fix those issues I had, and I can safely say that Arma3 and it's dlcs are entirely worth paying for on a sale or if you just happen to have a lot of money to spend on the full price for a game that goes for real cheap on sale."
28500,69 ooooooooooooo
28501,good game just don't play output gaming really bad server.
28502,"For a Game Made back in 2013, The Graphics, Gameplay, and Performance are top notch. I personally enjoy the Zeus DLC, due to the fact that the gameplay is made by a game master. I wish i had the other DLCs aswell, as they seem top notch as the game itself"
28503,Great game especially with mods!
28504,Been out for seven year nearly and i still play this at least once a week. I think that says enough but what has really been keeping this game going is the workshop community with the amazing free mods for this games that never disappoint.
28505,gay
28506,"good game

28511,"This is Iron-Actual, come in Battle-Mage, over."
28512,amazing game 10/10
28513,"Even in the current day this game is wonderful. The community can be highly toxic at times but that's not the dev's fault. It isn't as demanding as people would say because I run 16gb of ram and it doesn't come close to maxing, same with cpu/gpu. Highly recommended for everyone who lives military style rp/experience."
28514,its white
28515,It's ok.
28516,Yes
28517,"Prepare to make lots of mistakes, feel confused, and die often. Fortunately I like games that I fail repeatedly in so this game was for me. If you ever find me in game please allow me to fly you somewhere in the helicopter, you can trust me, I am an excellent pilot."
28518,good game
28519,super fun even funner with modded servers
28520,Good game! Just needs to be updated with modern graphics and tweak it to be more stable.
28521,wow
28522,Great Mil-sim
28523,The game is good if you are someone with a lot of time on your hands and are willing to put in the work to figure it all out but for the casual gamer just looking for mindless fun or just blowing a hour before doing something else this game is not worth it I completely understand why people like it but it‚Äôs just not for me or someone just blowing a little time.
28524,banging those 1500m sprint snipes
28525,"Realistic and ghetto ass military simulator, everyone is super serious, which is strange because every event is a comedic disaster waiting to happen. Play with friends or don't play at all."
28526,Great mil sim.
28527,"if u want very realistic shooters id suggest this game to download some mods such as suppress, immerse, achilles, and ace"
28528,"Good game, good community, and realism. Love this game, would recommend"
28529,Wipeout go BRRRRR
28530,"Extremely detailed. Really simulates the experience of being a regular soldier. For instance, you will die without having any idea how or why, for a dubious cause that is potentially making people's lives worse. Play single player unmodded and live the true to life soldier experience of; Schlepping shit from point A to point B. Carrying too much gear. Untrustworthy, unprepared, uncaring leadership, and goofy as fuck squad mates who couldn't possibly have passed the fourth grade.

Or play modded and multiplayer and experience ""war crime simulator 3000"""
28531,"if you like mil sim even a little bit......you will love this game. the content is through the roof, and the mod community is second to none. want to storm the lines as an imperial gaurdsman? you can do it. how about being the hoss boss himself, MASTERCHIEF!!!! you can do it. want to lead a squad of colonial marines? drop them in with a cheyanne dropship? complete with apc? YES. want a tactical your way dayz? tons!!! it is cheap, get it!!!"
28532,"god i wish i couldve refunded this when i had the chance. some people will like the million keybinds you need to know, but i sure as hell don't."

28562,"This is a very good, in-depth game. Perfectly fine on its own with the content it has.
But BOI when you add some of the sh*t from the workshop it only gets better."

"
28564,Good game!
28565,"YUH
"
28566,Incredibly realistic. Challenging. Plenty of customization. Amazing game.
28567,"This game is literally amazing, change my mind..."
28568,"This is a milestone in computer gaming and something that should not be missing in any game library. I am a supporter and player or ARMA games since their first game, Operation Flashpoint in 2001 and since then Bohemia Interactive have constantly raised the level of detail and realism on a simulated modern battlefield. You not only fight on foot, but on water, land and in the air. You have multiple roles as a foot soldier, have various aircraft, ground vehicles and boats.

This game is a must for anyone who likes a realistically simulated battlefield. If you don't have it, buy it!"
28569,"This game is very realistic and it may have a bad engine but that doesn't mean that you still cant have fun, There is many mods in the steam workshop you can work with and make the realism become more fun. You can do any war you want or even make your own wars. Iraq war. Vietnam, ww2 or ww1 and more. theirs maps you can install so the battle field is changing every time and the field is a canvice waiting to be painted to your next fight so have as much fun as possible."
28570,"One of the best milsims out there with a mix of sandbox. Really good combat simulation and realism. It is really enjoyable with friends.

10/10"
28571,Arma 3 is game like no other. You can have realism to it finest but yet also do some pretty stupid stuff. It's a blast to play with pals. I would recommend.
28572,this game is basically whatever you want it to be. It's like a large scale garrys mod
28573,I bought Apex edition and didnt get apex. wtf is this bullshit.
28574,"10/10

This game has a huge following. Many mods and a unique world to give you a unique feel that differs from other players. You can fight other players or NPC's that will give you a decent fight also. The map is enormous and you will truly feel the depth of it when traversing from city to city. The guns and vehicles handle realistic and can really feel like a true war sim. The dedication the devs put into this game really shows and continually gets support and new mods from the community."
28575,"The optimisation is not very good and it can  lag when there's lots of players near you, but overall its very interesting and fun to play."

28590,every epic
28591,"Game Gud 
"
28592,"This game is pretty much the industry standard for Milsim games, and has been since the days of Operation: Flashpoint.  The mission editor is incredibly powerful, community addons exist for almost every historical period (and even...40,000... years into the future), and there are player-driven units that specialize in almost every mode of play you'd want to play."
28593,gets boring after abit tho xx
28594,fortnite
28595,"this game provides experiences that can't be replicated in other games

at the consistent sacrifice of your time, patience, & brain cells."
28596,"Awesome game! Super fun, for anyone who wanted this game or wants it, it's worth the buy!"
28597,"ArmA 3, from an Aussie's perspective:

1. Walked for an hour with squadmates as incompetent as I was.
2. Get ambushed by enemy factions as both myself and my teammates are slowly killed one by one.
3. We repeat Step 1 and Step 2 until the enemies eventually die from bullets that we spray upon them all. 
4. After this, village sized genocide on the map's inhabitants. 

Great job Bohemia, I now have acute PTSD and refuse to walk for more than an hour with anyone of my friends again.

9/10, would recommend."
28598,The worst optimized and worst programmed game ever. 40fps on the most high-end PC with fastest CPU/GPU/RAM.
28599,its laggy at times. very derp. much fun 7.2 bananas out of 10
28600,Best game for PVE when it comes to doing FPS with mates and you want to make something on the fly with Zeus or edit something with the in game editor.

28608,"I've played ArmA 3 since it's inception. Others have reviewed the game, I shall review the online community, 

These are solid people. They are good and honest folk, and the community alone is worth the price, I play Kind Of The Hill games, and absolutely everybody has been kind and helpful. I trust you know what you are getting into an aysemmetrical milsim shoooter. Knowing this you know what to expect, but the community makes it worth it.

28619,Good stuff
28620,"Definitely a solid game, with a ton of ways to play. My personal favorite is the MilSim way. I highly recommend finding a group of regularly active players and running missions and campaigns together. Mods can absolutely improve the experience, but the people you play with make the experience.

28633,I LOVE IT ITS REALLY FUN AND EVERYTHING HAHAHAHA YES
28634,amazing with friends
28635,"How to describe ARMA in a little rectangle...? Well, it definitely covers all basis of a good open world tactical shooter for one but the real gem of ARMA is in it's continued development both by Bohemia Interactive and the ever active ARMA community at large. Third party content allows the player to do just about anything, from plug and play fast pace online gaming to an immersive experience of you'r choosing and to your own degree. 

Straight shooting.

To run this game with all manner of colourful MODs you will need loads of free SSD space.

Being and intensive combat immersion there are loads of controls that overlap with various engagement/ transport styles. Getting to know the game will take some getting use. 

Expect bugs. ARMA has had bugs since day one. In comparison to the days of playing ARMA 2 and navigating the endlessly clashing clusters of mods and addons, I must say that BI have certainly made the best of this epic project over the years. 

Enjoy"
28636,very good!
28637,"I am so into Realistic Military Shooters and arma 3 is just my jam I don't have enough word to say how much I love the arma, It is an amazing game."
28638,nice
28639,Arma 3 has evrything a real war needs and you can experience a real war
28640,"very good game
never gets repetitive"
28641,What isn't to like about this game! The community help to make it the best game available
28642,"Way too many damn micro-transactions, what kinda game states full war type experience then expects you to pay for jets, heli's, boats, and other vehicles. Weapons and Maps I can fully understand. those are expansion they physically dont let you play unless you have the certain dlc. but with vehicles it should be full access to everyone. JUST A WARNING!*!*!*!
"
28643,"This game is so good, i enjoy this so much. The only downfall is the amount of DLC's, i cannot afford these, but its still a great game i recommend it a lot."
28644,gud game
28645,best Game
28646,"big shoot, big thinker, big fun"

28649,"All 2,000 hours of it."
28650,"One of the best combat simulators out there, you want action? you got it, graphics? amazing, mods? take your pick. Overall is a fantastic game, a must have game in your library."
28651,Really good game. Just a bit hard for the average COD player.
28652,REAL
28653,Arma 3 has a very detailed and creative presentation. i'd recommend anyone who likes realism in war games to atleast give a go and take on the really immersive experience:]
28654,Yes I like
28655,is aight
28656,Do you like walking through the forest for 3 hours and dying to a sniper that you couldn't see? Then this is a perfect game for you
28657,I only have a couple of hours on the game but it's pretty good I guess.
28658,baller.
28659,AWdf Af
28660,Best. Especially for RP lol
28661,i just love it
28662,the best way to waste your life
28663,"The opening doesn't teach you how to play the game at all. It's like showing a person to walk then asking them to fly a helicopter while shooting a rifle one handed and only making head shots right away. I have only played for 3 hours and I already want my money back. No way to pick load out, no way to mod load out before mission. I just found out that my toon was carrying a Grenade and I have no idea how to use it. Seriously this game expects you to know things already before playing! If you have no Military experience at all or scouts or something similar your better off saving you money. I had high expectations and was fully let down on all of them. I even found a way to load my favorite gun into the game but there is still no way to even touch it. I'm not sure I even want to try the multiplayer mode but it's the last part I am willing to try. If that should fall the same way then this game is done and I haven't even got my moneys worth out of it. They need a level of disappointment meter on this."
28664,"Dont know what the fuck is going on.

Good game tho."
28665,played the absolute hell out of this love it
28666,"Cool and ultra-realistic but pretty harsh to beginners, ESPECIALLY if you don't have a mic. I own one but just didn't have it turned on for the multiplayer and found myself going all the way across the map in an atv (a 40 min ride) just for some bum on voice chat who i couldn't communicate with. Still awesome game tho."
28667,"its aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"
28668,"realistic gameplay and just all around fun games
"
28669,"Was it worth picking up then? Is it still worth picking up now? 

Well, even just simply looking at numbers, I'd say so! I've spent about twice the amount of money on a game that I've only played for maybe 100 hours, tops. With Arma, I've squeezed a good 3.2k hours out of it and counting! The game was fun enough alone or with just a couple buds for about a thousand hours, and joining a unit full of genuinely AWESOME people  reinvented the game for me. After so long, I can't even confidently say I've seen all there is to see because the community as a whole constantly adds to the game and mission devs out there seem to have endless creativity. 

As far as the game itself goes, it's just simply amazing. I saw the cool near-future style with really advanced gear and the emphasis/focus BI put on the infantry combat this time around, and I was drawn in immediately. The campaign alone wasn't a masterpiece, but it definitely had its moments. The map design of Altis felt warm with the sun beating down on everything from dawn til dusk. Being so immersed, I immediately felt the urge to find some sort of shade, even! The addition of diving and seeing everything in the ocean made their frogman showcase feel almost like a vacation. Ambient sounds in the quiet moments and sweet cacophonies of gunshots and explosions that erupt make this game an absolute FEAST for the ears. The rain and thunder will pick up, which will nearly blind and deafen you, and it'll remind you constantly that you're on a big, tropical island. Being on foot isn't so bad in A3 when compared to A2.
The vehicles are still fun in their own way. I never really had an interest in them personally, but the way BI handled them this time around makes them powerful, but not overpowered. It's always going to be scary seeing that APC or tank rolling down the road at you, but with the different factions playing in entirely different ways, it's not always so obvious on how you should handle them as a threat. That goes for both Co-op and PvP modes.
Playing as a crew in a vehicle, however? That's a blast. They've all got their functions, and no vehicle is the same as the other. You'll learn what a particular vehicle is capable of, and you do have to use your head to get the most out of a particular tank or APC. The Tanks DLC added a few interesting alternatives to the regular tanks, like tankettes, or MGS tank destroyers. 

Now, I'm not saying it's a perfect game by any means. Sometimes it's the odd bug here or there, or sometimes it's the game being characteristically janky, but at some point or another, this game will begin to hurt you. After so long, you'll learn to like it, though. Once you get over that hump, it's smooth-ish sailing! The AI can be a little hard to deal with, but feeling overwhelmed at the start is definitely appropriate. There's a lot to learn before you stop surviving and start thriving.

The public online stuff is often a memefest or sometimes you'll get griefed by someone way too bored. Sometimes it's the opposite, with people getting genuinely immersed and running the missions tightly and actually working as a team. It's finding that perfect unit that fits your attitude and your playstyle that'll really bring out the best this game has to offer.

TLDR Still worth by a long shot! Anyone just picking the game up now wouldn't be missing the boat by any means."

Before a few days ago I had owned Arma 3 for about 4 years and never actually played very much of it to an enjoyable extent. That changed recently when I got my new PC though, and holy hell, I'm in love all over again.

This game is so great. Get it. Now."

its one of the more interesting games and after lots of hours i can still find something new in it."
28689,very good indeed
28690,Good game been playing since alpha
28691,"I do recommend this....... 

But there is times when i think standing on lego is more enjoyable.

About time Arma 4 came out to aye..."
28692,gg (gun game)
28693,"it offers 2 main types of game play. Fun and Mil-sim. Fun is you messing around being chill and joking. Mil-sim is more focused, strategic, and follows a chain of command. both are fun and i really do suggest buying this game and all the DLC's except the WW2 one."
28694,k
28695,"Your gonna be crawling away from this game.

Literally both your legs are gonna fucking break.



Still headglitching you ;)"
28696,the editor is fun
28697,i like the realistic simulations i'm put into through out the games missions and more.
28698,Because the game is amazing hahahaha realistic
28699,"great game that costs 9 dollars to get in, and 60 dollars to enjoy (prices of when its on sale)"
28700,very fun
28701,"It's the best tactical shooter and still stands up in 2020 as the fucking best game

28702,War crimes are fun
28703,Yes

28711,Cool game. One of those where you come for the stories you make in game.
28712,literally the most fucking boring shit i've ever played
28713,yes very swag
28714,yeah its ok
28715,It is far too clunky!
28716,its alright init
28717,I like the constant game devolopment. New weapons feature. The new nods. And the unlimited workshop. The graphics are amazing the game works nearly 100 % of the time. Never have issues. I also like Bohemium as a company becuse they take a lot of input from the players.
28718,good purchase i must say
28719,gud
28720,I loved the tactical realism of this game and love how people aren't just running into places destroying people
28721,Best Low FPS simulator of all time!
28722,"Be warned: while flight (and looks aweseome) is excellent in helicopters in this game, Arma 3 does not have good gameplay like Comanche does for the Comanche like helicopter Arma 3 calls another name (forget what now). The fighting with your helicopter could use some work on Arma 3's part. The armor seems a bit too weak on their version of the Comanche helicopter, but mostly it's the weapons.. or at least the main gun/cannon, that are way too underpowered compared to any 'Comanche' PC game. Even the new one, which I recently bought. Arma 3 does have a ton of FPS and what not stuff in it however.. almost 2 much, LOL. So many moves your character can do. Also, be warned: you have to use a regular scroll wheel mouse with this game! If you don't, in the maps that you spawn in mid-air, you won't be able to choose the option to deploy your parachute! Not as bloody as Doom Eternal, but still scary realistic graphics at times. Both a con and a pro. Overall, this is a good game even with it's shortcomings with bad helicopter combat abilities. 7 out of 10"
28723,An awesome game
28724,"good game
"
28725,The base game itself is alright. However mods and great workshop support literally give this game endless potential.
28726,very funny and good game
28727,"If your a big military nerd like me then buy it!
Even if you aren't its still well worth it especially with 
the community and the hours of fun to be had playing the game!!"

28729,its good you can make battes
28730,Pretty forking good
28731,"Hey, i would like to warn everyone who's new to this game, let the game run for 5h and set your profile as public if you want to play on all servers, i usually don't like RP, my friends are playing it very much and i like playing with my friends, so i was like ""maybe i can try at least this one ? and if still don't like some there's so much to do that i can find something else on the game"" then i bought it, downloaded it and got banned instantly for 15 minutes. ""Why ?"" you would say, because of the lack of the 5h, my profile is already in public now i need to wait 5h for a game that i wanted to give a chance and that is pissing on me, i'm not complaining, i just want to warn the more poeple i can so it doesn't makes someone else angry c:
I'm still sure that the game has much things to offer, so i'll wait, Have fun poeple :)"
28732,Not a bad game large community
28733,Love the realism to combat and how everything can go in one direction or another.
28734,Brilliant if you can get some mates on and do a server. I also recommend getting some mods to enhance the game.
28735,"the game is pretty much a buy to win because if you don't have the DLC Global Mobilization you can't fly the helicopter,fight jets and some other's.plus if you don't also have the DLC Arm 3 tank's you can't use the tanks 
the only time you can use the vehicle's is if you friend has the DLC or if you buy them the's is pretty much a buy to win game for me but I have mixed filling I would say yes and no but I can't set it that way so beside's being a buy to win game I like it."
28736,geat game i think its amazing i hope u guys enjoy it to
28737,"YOU CANT FUCKING ZOOM ON ONE KEY YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO DOUBLE CLICK EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO AIM DOWN SIGHTS... HUH?????????

I have never seen this absolutely profound stupidity in any other game before. Wow. Do they hate money? No you can't change it.

Irritating and stupid devs. I lost the steam sale to buy this dumbass game without a freaking single button zoom and you're too dumb as the player to be trusted to change it I guess, even though you paid for the game. No there's no option anywhere to zoom and aim down sights at the same time. You can either BINOCULAR ZOOM WITH YOUR SUPERVISION MAGIC, or aim down sights by double clicking. Not both. That's fucking dumb. What were they thinking after spending millions to make this fucking game... to not include a god damn zoom. .... the fuck is that..?

Incomprehensible. I guess they hate money? This is annoying and unchangeable without 3rd party plugins. I don't want to download that.

Requesting refund. I got all hyped for something ruined so damn stupidly.. Fire the guy who programmed that, seriously."
28738,campaign is fun
28739,"Pretty good game, I feel like most people look at it and think it wouldn‚Äôt be something they are interested in as at face value it‚Äôs just some ‚Äúmission shooter‚Äù but in my experience it‚Äôs much more than that. From zombies to life mods it‚Äôs been a blast. The game has a great modding community that will draw you in for over one thousand hours like it‚Äôs done to me. All I can say is don‚Äôt judge a book by it‚Äôs cover."
28740,"Great game,  you walk, you die, you walk again, you drive, you swim, you fly, you die and repeat !!!"
28741,LOVE IT
28742,i cannot wait until arma 4 come out this game is awesome
28743,"This game is awesome.
Helicopters are perfect.
Infantry movement could use some improvement like stance adjusting while moving and the glitch that traps your character into the last movement direction, only ever happens when you input too many things at once, best example is sprinting and raising your weapon while toggling combat stance into a walking speed then attempting to adjust stance left/right, its probable this is a result of having to be stationary to adjust stance.
My next gripe is the lack of customization (vanilla wise) in regards to optic reticles... differing shapes, colours and shades of brightness would be deeply appreciated B.I. <3

Anyway you should buy this game and try out the awesome variety of vanilla game-modes and customized workshop content...

Hopefully the step in quality from A2 > A3 will be reflected if not expanded with A3 > A4

If ARMA 4 is REAL!!?.....? >:')"

28750,There are lots of mods to change up playstyles and explore different worlds. GO try them out!
28751,"I personally wouldn't say this game is too fun without the DLCs and mods...however, I admire the in-game map editor, and the community, therefore it gets a thumbs up from me."
28752,Good FPS sim of army and stuff.

28770,"The game is absolutely astounding, top notch graphics (If you have a good PC) and the combination of massive team operations and the ability to have players on land, sea, and air all coordinating as one is the best a game can get. But my only issue is that my game started lagging bad, I only got 1 FPS but no matter hat I did I could not fix it so I reinstalled the game now half my keys don't work and I cant look up or down. No matter how many times I reinstall the game or tweak with settings I can't seem to fix it. I paid full price and my game is F*****.

But all matters aside I am still looking into the matter, if anyone knows a fix or has this same issue please feel free to drop a comment.

Edit: No worries, talked to a few friends, was just a mod pack I had that makes some keys glitch. My game now works perfect again. Be aware, some mods on the ""Workshop"" page can cause some controls to not work (ACE Compatibility for example)"

28772,"I've only got 6 hours of gameplay, so of  course i like it.
Give it time, i'll learn to hate it."
28773,good game
28774,A-10 go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
28775,great game a little confusing at first but if i got the hang of it you can to
28776,runs like shit
28777,its an amazing game but too much glitches
28778,good game only problem is optimization is the problem
28779,"TL;DR:
Definitely recommend this game but I'll suggest waiting for sale to buy the DLC's.
Most of the time you'll need Apex for servers.
You'll need a mid/high-end machine to run this game smoothly (very detailed models and enviroments).
Controls are quite weird.
Steam workshop is full of great stuff.
Overall it's the best of it's genre.
"
28780,its a fun sim for anyone that likes the military
28781,Its ok i guess.
28782,"good game had it for 2 days
"
28783,cant play the game on some servers since you have to buy dlcs to use either the map or alot of the clothing items. however apart from that the game seemed fine if you would have the dlcs along side it.
28784,"Between the handicapped players of public zeus, to the handicapped players everywhere else, arma 3 provides an expierence similar to gmod rp. there will always be those that take the game too serious, and there will always be those that place mine dispensers and murder everyone in cold blood. 

a good example of this kind of behavior is in how we name our squads. most of the time we say genevan't or something to that effect. if you dont love war crimes and mass genocide, dont buy this. however, if your morality is perverted to such an extreme as mine, you will enjoy unloading cluster bombs on civvies, slaughtering non-combatants, and pretending to sneeze as you detonate explosives across altis.

10/10, would get court marshaled again."
28785,"Pros:
Don't need a great computer,
Tons of content,
Modding Support,

Cons:
Graphics,
Price (maybe),
Learning curve."
28786,"Its pretty good game, with tons of different ways to play and with many game modes. Personally, I can tell their is a difference from playing on an Intel rig vs an Amd rig. Better optimized for Intel but still not greatly optimized on either. Past optimization it's a very fun game and its even better with a good group to play with."
28787,"I fully recommend this game if you have an experienced friend who already plays it, but if you are looking for a multiplayer shooter to play alone in servers or with other new friends I do not recommend this game at all. The official servers are empty and in the active servers you won't have a clue what is going on."
28788,Ravenfield is to Battlefield what this game is to Squads.
28789,YES
28790,its cool
28791,great game to play
28792,"most glitchy and buggy ass game I have personally ever played, but I love it still with the modding and workshop and features that no other game has"
28793,"Great Game !
"
28794,"This game is by far the best shooter game, heck best game i have played. Since buying a PC nearly a year ago, this is one of the main games i have played. I have met new people whilst playing Arma. Personally, if you don't play with mods or are not in a MilSim unit you will overtime dislike the game as it is becoming old which generates less players each month. With a unit you can play whenever you want, learn new skills and meet new people. If you play PC games then definitely get this. Its worth the money, worth the hours and worth the space on your hard drive.
If you are interested in joining a Milsim then join the one i am in:

28798,good game
28799,its pretty fun i guess
28800,Good
28801,"Honestly, Im not a huge millatary roleplay guy, but this game did scratch my itch for setting up huge battles and watching them playout and with workshop support it gives infinite possibiltys to what you can do, hell if you want 1940's America fight the UNSC from Halo you can! it is hard to find certain mods though, but other than that i highly recomend it!"
28802,Great military shooter.

28815,you can do anything and everything. great game.
28816,"A great game, wish I could buy it twice"
28817,"Bit pricy dlc, but thats why steam summer sale is here"
28818,"Difficult to the point of being unfun. Graphics are crap and controls are wack. I see the effort that they tried to put in, and maybe I'm just not the intended audience, but I'm not sure who would enjoy this."
28819,"[h1]Wait for a sale to purchase this one[/h1]
The base game itself without dlc is rather expensive and extremely bare bones. You literally get popup ads when using DLC weapons, just wait for sale and get apex pack edition, it gives you almost everything you would want if you're interested in mil sims. 
Other then the pretty expensive pay wall, its a pretty solid game, The 'arcade' like game servers are brilliant fun with friends or solo."
28820,crap
28821,haha airstrike isis for comedy
28822,"amazing with friends, ive never played something with mods this creative other than minecraft, and this gives me that minecraft creativity feeling"

28860,"Fun Military Game, I've not played much of it though"
28861,"I started playing OFP Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis way back, and have been a fan ever since. This game is by far the best so far, especially the scenario editor and the DLCs. I look forward to hopefully more units, more locations, and more stories."
28862,waste of time
28863,"Serious or rpg, it's awesome."
28864,It's really fun
28865,its good game
28866,i think this game is verry good but if your new to PC try ravenfield before you try this game becouse it might be  hard to play and you might want to learn about modern millatary before you play this game.this game is awsome.
28867,I think this game is good but its not for me
28868,Pretty cool military simulator.
28869,"Great fun for anyone. Get some mods, mess around in the editor, play online or find a unit. Its a military simulator which you can use however you want."
28870,yes
28871,"Just buy it and play, u'll know"
28872,"Fun Milsim, though they need more servers that are more team based"
28873,too many buttons
28874,Pretty fun
28875,Good game. Very diverse. Great modding community. Hope they make an arma 4 and repeat their success here.
28876,7 out of 10
28877,"The game be like bruh moment. It all do be sounding fun but you will never reach the fun part of the game. Bridge you shall never be apart of the mil sim. Just like my mother said on her death bed. ""you can act all you want but you are a pu55y"" I took that like a man and not like a pp, after that a swore to never play this game again. If you like your pc and dont want it to explode in a fire do not play this game. This game is cringe and the people who play this is cringe and disqustang.

10/10 solid game would play again"
28878,"This game is very complicated, and you you will feel like an idiot trying to dod simple things and asking how you do it. But its an amazing game and you will eventually enjoy it and get better over time!"
28879,"Bugs, bugs, and poor design. This is the most clunky, bugged, and cumbersome game I have ever played. It's like I'm playing military QWOP. Even after 36 hours in, I feel like I can't properly control my movement, or see, or shoot, or command, or manage my inventory. I've watched some great Arma 3 multiplayer videos online, but my experience has been very different. My computer meets the recommend system requirements, yet the game barely runs, even on the lowest settings. And I think this might be my main issue. For instance, the aliasing on my cross-hairs, rendered at a low resolution, makes them barely visible. On a very high-end system, with a large screen, and a high-speed internet connection, the multiplayer could be enjoyable, overall. But I have been playing the single player campaign, and it has not been enjoyable. Again, that list of bugs is endless. At times, the enemies seem unaffected by my bullets, even at close range shooting and square on. The enemies, however, can be uncanny at spotting at killing me instantly. The movement mechanics are frustrating. The inventory system, especially kitting up, is terribly cumbersome. Squad commands are impossibly slow. The squad AI is as dumb as any AI gets. I can't get any better at the game because it's not my skill holding me back; it's the clunky-built engine filled with bugs, barely running on my mid/low-level PC."
28880,"Arma is one of those games every gamer should try at least once in their life, just be prepared to put some time into understanding the mechanics of the game. There are so many different things you game do with this game from Swat hostage rescues, massive scaled military battles to Dayz style game modes. There is a little bit for everyone's taste."

28891,Excellent Milsim game. Find a unit to play with or join a co op server. Great fun! Highly recommend.
28892,"Too many hours on this game, hope your pc can take it"
28893,"This game just makes sense. 
Realistic immersive realistic action shooter even though looks shiny and great, the back bone that drives the game further, is the sense of community you are able to take part in. With a great group of people, the experience of joy within the game is limitless. Realistic scenarios, Role playing, Team vs Team Milsim events.
- Love this game, 9/10"

in forest i get 100fps when in Building get 50 fps idk why but it still play is ok.

28901,"awesome, but runs like poop"
28902,This is good
28903,"this game has always come back to me to spend 200 hours until i play another new game. Love the mods! cant wait til they put out arma 4!
"
28904,MUY BUENO
28905,!Good
28906,"y e s
"
28907,"This game is one of the best games I know, I love games that are realistic and this is one that shines in that category. There are ballistics which mean no bullets are hit scan (instant hit) and also drop because of gravity pulling it down, so you either have to adjust your aim or use something called ""zeroing"" where someone adjusts the sights of the gun to where it shoots higher than where it is actually aiming to compensate for the bullet drop to make it easier for someone to aim. Your character has stamina which affects how much scope sway you have and how long you can sprint for, weight also affects your max stamina. if you sprint a lot and have no stamina your aim will be all over the place. If you don't sprint and run that much and have full stamina, you will have little scope sway and you can also hold shift to steady your breathing for even better aim.

Different stances also affect your scope sway, standing has the most, crouching has medium amounts and lying on the ground or prone has the least since your guy rests his weapon on the ground to help him aim and you can press C to lock your weapon on the ground for the best amount of aim and if you have a bipod on your weapon it increases the accuracy even more. There are many stances to do in all different positions. When you are standing you can lean left or right by pressing and holding q and e as well as holding left Ctrl and then pressing ""w"" ""a"" ""s"" or ""d"" which are default controls to step left, step right, look higher and get a bit lower. While crouching you can also step left or right, and get lower and higher. When you are prone things are a bit different, instead of stepping left or right you lie on your sides and leaning turns into rolling instead. going lower makes you lie on your side but facing forwards and going up make you do a sitting position.

Different calibers do different damage and bullet trajectory differs. Shooting different limbs cause related effects, being injured in the arm increases your scope sway, being injured in the legs makes it so you can only walk, I do not know what torso shots cause though. There is an armor system where depending on where you are hit deals different amounts of damage depending on where the armor is as well.

I love vehicles and especially combined arms in games and in Arma I like flying jets and being CAS for my team."
28908,bruh moment
28909,would not let me join my friendsat all
28910,"Most realistic military game i have ever seen in my life , i would recommend this game to everybody"
28911,The clone wars have lasted a long time but that's perfectly fine. more clankas ta scrap. remember.....WATCH THOSE WRIST ROCKETS
28912,"good game it is
"
28913,It's just a great game overall. Even though I'd much rather and recommend have a modded version than the vanilla.
28914,"Great military simulator. Walk for half an hour, look at rocks, maybe a tree or two if you feel frisky. Walk a bit longer. Now that you've walked, you have contact! Or you did because the AI snapped to you at mach 10 and now you're back to walking. 

So, you try multiplayer, have a good and goofy time with the other new players. Then, Zeus dumps three tanks against your squad.

Maybe RP is the choice? Oh, how fun! Until you get enough money to buy a truck, only to be killed for no reason or arrested for no reason. 

In the end, good game. Really brings the term; ""Welcome to the suck"". Yet, I love it."
28915,great game but wont let me play it for some strange reason
28916,"As someone who has put over 5k hours into this game. I would recommend it, there's ALOT of content here. From the singleplayer campaigns, scenarios, Trails and challenges. To the online multiplayer modes such as King of the hill, Exile, Role play modes and many many more. Additionally there's a mission editor which will allow you to make your own scenarios for yourself or for a group. The modding community is just as huge as the ones for Bethesda titles, such as Fallout and Skyrim. These mods will add even more content for you to dig into.

However the clumsiness of the engine and the poor AI code will make you want to pull your hair out. As someone who has created a lot of missions for the game for many different groups, the games poor optimisation and derpy AI has pushed me to uninstall this game many times in frustration. The game runs best when you play with, or against other players. 

If you are new to PC gaming, you're going to have a tough time with this game at first. The learning curve for the controls alone is really steep, if you have the patience's of stone, then you shouldn't have a problem."
28917,"ARMA 3 is the most robust milsim game I've played so far. The mods available make customization a never ending process. I find myself in VR Trainer trying out new loadouts for hours trying to get something that feels just right. The community has been great (so far) and finding people willing to teach the game was easy...or maybe I was lucky. Overall, this is my new favorite game."
28918,"pretty fun game with a (somewhat) realistic format that is best enjoyed with mods, and honestly one of the worst parts of the game is that the AI can sometimes be really stupid or at times seem like they have aimbot, overall cool game 

7/10"
28919,Totally acurate Driving physics!!!!!!
28920,If you want to LARP some military stuff then this is the game for you. Bonus points if you join a MILSIM clan. Overall a fun game with a good community and decent updates.
28921,This is a good game especially after all the development of it. Its not a perfect milsim game but its pretty close and it has so many mods available that it can really change how you play it.
28922,"If I had to choose only one game to own it would be ARMA 3 
endless amounts of fun and replayability

I had a life once upon a time, a job, family, friends, clothes even a dog and possibly a cat of some sort once but now it's just me and A3, no regrets ...."
28923,"It's so broken, but in a good way. This game is hilarious if your a fan of Corpse Launches, vehicles flying across the sky, and some dumb physics."
28924,"This game is not for the faint of heart.  There will be downs and lows.  But if you are into Milsim, somewhat tech savvy, and can find a group of people to play with.  This is the ultimate Milsim Sandbox.  I'm a big introvert and most of my almost 1000hrs is probably singleplayer.  I like building arsenal kits, bases, and stuff.  Whats cool is that I can actually PLAY with it afterwards too.

You can also find a unit to play with and the fun multiplies tenfold.  Still good to play in 2020
"
28925,"I'd like to be able to tell you I'm a military expert. I'd like to be able to tell you I'm a competitive online gamer. In reality I'm a 32 year old child who has spent over 340 hours playing in the ultimate virtual soldier toy box. 

I spend 95% of my time in the Editor setting up different armies with different troops and vehicles and watching who comes out on top. Yes it's the best mil sim out there, but it's also the ultimate game of animated toy soldiers, and if that makes me a weener, then guess I'm a BLOODY WEENER OK?"
28926,"This is THE definitive military sandbox experience, and having the largest mod community of any other game of it's class, this game never really gets old. With simple, intuitive controls and Editor options, you can re-create any realistic military scenario you'd like."
28927,"very gud, still gud

28928,played in a random server left 5 hours later deaf but happy 10/10 would go deaf again.

28932,"Warning: This game is hugely complex, and incredibly unfriendly to new players. 

That being said, it's the Dark Souls of shooters. Tough to learn, even tougher to master. You want to look at your map, and it's night time? You better have a torch, or stand underneath a streetlamp. You want to find your way to a checkpoint? I hope you like orientating yourself via a real-life static map - as in, piece of paper. 

Once you get past that and accept those quirks - and many more - though, it's strangely addictive.

Pros
-Once you get the hang of it, it becomes rewarding and deep.
- Graphics are really pretty
- Tons of content

Cons
- There are inbuilt buttons to speed up the game, for when you're walking miles in realtime... let that sink in
- Hotkeys for [b] everything [/b] - players on smaller keyboards might have massive rebinding to do
- If you want to get good you're going to have to sink in some serious time, but that could be a pro if you're into that. 

Worth it?
Yeah! I'd get it on sale with some DLC. Apparently the Apex pack is the one to get."

28973,"I do recommend Arma. 

Arma really did something quite rare. The Mod support, Mod Creators, & Devs did a fantastic job at giving this game longevity. This game is still hugely popular, and really that's because there is nothing Newer, that is quite like it. Arma offers customization as well. Which is something Developers really seem to undervalue now days. 

Take Squad for example; There is absolutely Zero customization in Squad, and that is Imo- The main thing keeping Squad from blowing up like Arma did. Which is unfortunate, because we are terribly due for a new Large-scale tactical game, with  updated graphics, updated performance, that also offers customization. 

No-Customization, is a bit of a deal breaker.

Developers need to Wake up, and realize, that in 2020- you have to offer customization.

Insurgency Sandstorm for example, or Ground Branch have great customization. Ground Branch specifically has phenomenal customization. You can even customize how many pockets and ammo mags and grenades slots on your vests & gear you have, as well as customizing even where specifically you put mods on guns on the actual gun rails. Incredibly in depth. Its just still in very early Alpha, and they're not really Large-Scale games.

Squad, totally dropped the ball in this regard. And no one can say, that ""Customization ruins Immersion"", because in Insurgency and Ground Branch Both; The Immersion is even better because of these things.

So, Developers, please realize this. Arma is so long standing because of this. There are many options, and There are many mods. The leaning system in Arma is even still; the Most in-depth leaning system in any game, to-date. And thats pretty remarkable. Arma has like a 10 point leaning system. More games need to offer this as well.

All in all, I give Arma an 8-10. Deducted 2 points. One for a bit outdated Graphics, & One for performance; Because as we all know; the performance in Arma, even on very high-end systems is shoddy, and this is just due to the Engine/Coding.

Everything else is superb.

Hopefully, in the very near-future, we get a New Large-Scale Tactical game, thats Updated, offers loads of Customization, Mod support, lots of Vehicle Options, lots of PvP Scenarios, Updated Performance, and Updated Graphics.

Whoever offers this^ will have one hell of a money train on their hands.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy Arma.

At least until we have something better."

28979,Got yelled at by a 13 year old squad leader because i did a front flip with a tank. No regrets.
28980,The most fun I have ever had while playing at 12 FPS!
28981,very fun and exciting game if you have friends and the player base is nice
28982,best military tactic game
28983,5.56 sucks among us
28984,best if youre looking to play mods on it.
28985,true
28986,"played a little bit, not bad"
28987,"Once you get into into you cant really go back. Just hearing the monotonous sound of walking, the radio chatter and HQ pinging you. Listening for sound barrier cracks to locate an enemy sniper that's pinning your entire squad down. The slow, methodical kind of game but one that's very tense and exciting with the right group."
28988,"Fun.  Controls are a little difficult to remember with so many options, but that is also the strength of the game too. Wish a few more items were more interactive."
28989,"Pretty fun game. Despite being a fair bit buggy and not having the best optimization, its still pretty fun, and you're able to get decent frames now with modern hardware."
28990,"its a good game but its even better if you have mods hah 69 hours btw
"
28991,OOGA BOOGA  good game
28992,"As a United States Marine (Thank me for my service) I can say that this game is a accurate betrayal of military combat, as when we were in Iraq we used to d-sync ram everyone as we were unstoppable"
28993,Arma-ed
28994,Dank game just needs to be optimised lmao
28995,"This game is unlike any First Person Shooter you've ever played. Sporting multiple features spanning from next-to-real ballistics, ranging, traversal, and vehicle operation models. Everything has it's purpose in the game, nothing is the same in terms of applications.

Infantry ranges through all types of preset classes, from Ammunition Bearer to Sniper. These presets provide the best possible equipment to aid you in whatever operation you're going into. Of course, with the help from the Virtual Arsenal, you can mix and match your kit to be your own customized badass.

Vehicles in this game bring a more sense of heaviness and control, it just feels right driving around in an HEMTT and get that real sense that it actually is a heavy transport vehicle. The Tanks have a sense of overwhelming power, the helicopters and jets feel right to use for their intended purpose - especially with a flight stick, and nothing is bulletproof. You can damage any vehicle with small arms fire and the hit boxes are true to the vehicles.

LMG's, Assault Rifles, Snipers, Submachine Guns, and Pistols aren't OP. You can't run around with a single buffed rifle and dominate like you can in Call of Duty or Battlefield. Every weapon is balanced, the heavier punch it packs comes with drawbacks to stamina and backpack space so nothing is unbalanced when it comes to on the ground infantry tactics.

There are a multitude of things you can do in the vanilla game of ArmA 3, but I found that the best experiences come from the mods and ability to seek community Units and participate in custom Zeus Operations with them. The ArmA 3 community is so extensive there's endless possibilities for what you can do with mods, anywhere from World War 2 to Warhammer 40,000. The player lead units bring a sense of Comraderie and structure to operations created by skilled Zeus players.

TL:DR - If you're looking for a tried and true Military Sandbox, this is the game for you, plus the DLC goes on sale pretty often so it wouldn't be bad to think about picking them up and expanding your arsenal."
28996,Super hardcore shooter. Make sure you bring some friends.
28997,very good would play again
28998,"Fantastic game, had so much fun, its hard to get into but once you get to do what you want to do you can do anything, if thats understandable"
28999,very fun
29000,"VERY GOOD BUT BAD OPTIMIZATION
"
29001,sure
29002,ZAIAH
29003,yesssssssssssss
29004,It's ok
29005,its really good
29006,Its allright i guess
29007,good game
29008,"This game is very realistic. It represents how war would be like on a smaller scale of not actually joining. The only issue I have is I replay the same missions when i quit and get on the next day, but other than than it is an amazing FPS and would recommend anyone who likes realistic shooters."
29009,show arma community power! give some points
29010,124
29011,Price is too high. Waste of time. A parody of realism.
29012,"In so many ways this game is a vast improvement over ARMA II but and this is a big but, the friendly AI IS COMPLELETLY USELESS. Target that MRAP - fire at 100m - miss.
UTTERLY STUPID.
Waste of my money."
29013,"ArmA III is hands-down the greatest title I have ever invested time into. If you launch the game and play 10, 100, or even 1000 hours, you will not understand the full grasp of what this hobby has to offer. 

-This game is your playground. With the modding community, you can create any scenario you want. From a camping trip with your friends, to being invaded by giant rubber duckies, even to portraying historical battles such as the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, YOUR IMAGINATION is the limit.

-You can find anything you want here. Casual, realism, hardcore, survival, etc. This platform allows me to run a realism/milsim unit where I can create entire story-based campaigns that are more in-depth than AAA titled games like Call of Duty - AS SOMEONE WITHOUT A DEGREE IN GAME DESIGN. You do not need a degree to make a good game or story. ArmA III allows you to do both, this is a 3D canvas. Where you can create a mission or scenario in any clime, era, universe, or place. Don't like a map's layout? Use the ""Hide"" tool and delete what you want; then make it however you want it to be. ArmA III is the best Halo, Warhammer 40k, WWIII, WWII, WWI, Vietnam War, Korean War, etc game I have ever played. This will capture an immersive feel you have never felt elsewhere, and give you so much freedom that so many titles refuse.

-This game has been out for 8 years and has more functionality with infantry movement than every other game you can think of combined. And that's the basics, not even going to scrape what else it has to offer. 

LASTLY, do not blame your bad experiences with groups, mods, your personal missions, etc on the game. I have spent the last year as a mission maker/unit leader designing gameplay for people to enjoy, so I have credibility when it comes to this. Like I said before, your imagination is the limit. My group, Task Force Trauma, is where I commit every second to attain the highest level of detail, optimization, compatibility, and immersion to achieve unforgettable ArmA (and gaming) experiences; most groups do not take it this far. We are special, and ArmA allows people like me to be. This is something I have always wanted to do in a video-game environment, and ArmA provides it. 11/10, this is the last shooter I will ever need until ArmA 4 releases."
29014,"Nice
"
29015,the mods
29016,Had fun for a bit. Might play some more
29017,I have 679 hours on this game and i can honesty say its a good war game where you can join rp server and join actual war servers fighting over key points such as important city's and airports.
29018,Your experience with this game depends on what server you play on.
29019,"Played it a bit, it kinda good
"
29020,good
29021,Arma will 100% be one of my favorite games for a long time all because of the user created mods and maps 10/10 would car bomb again
29022,Buy game for modding community :)
29023,"I will say with confidence that this is the best war simulator that has ever been, as well as a platform for mods. But stabilization with some mods is lame, and so the game is cool."
29024,I am now army man
29025,"pretty good military simulator
"
29026,"RUNS GREAT ON MY 350 DOLLAR LAPTOP
"
29027,"I would recommend that you should join a Milsim group or any ARMA 3 group because it'll be more fun.
Sure you can play without joining any Milsim group no problem!
Overall enjoyable
8/10"
29028,I love this game like anything I use too.
29029,"very nice
"
29030,It's ARMA... It has a steep learning curve... I still don't know how to play...
29031,I'll start off by saying... If your like me and you watched You Tube videos and fell in love with this game thinking you were gonna come and fly off aircraft carriers and do all this other wicked cool spec OPS stuff your wrong... The campaigns are BLAHHHH to say the least and joining a server or getting started on one is just a headache in its own..... The game doesn't even download mods for you or anything you need to match them all up and join from other launchers and all kinds of stupid BS..... It's very very miss leading... !!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! Stayyy AWAY far AWAYY
29032,great game but it doesn't run too well on conventional hardware

29057,iss gud
29058,Love gaming with the boys
29059,People need to get better
29060,So many different mods to enhance your game play. The online mmo side of this game really makes it a must for getting together with friends and playing together.
29061,good
29062,"One of my favorite games!!I loved Arma 2, same goes for Arma 3.Great mod community, got a lot of potentials, despise sometimes some stupid bugs,buts thats ARMA :).Recomend for everybody just to try it at least once"
29063,good mil sim
29064,"Nothing else quite like it, great way to pretend soldier."
29065,Absolute Cancer.
29066,I love this game.
29067,best game ever!

29069,its aight
29070,"playing the game without every DLC is like watching porn on a sketchy site, pop-up ads and watermarks right across the screen constantly reminding you: give me money, so you can play a game you already paid for..."
29071,"""Nooooo you cant just whipe out my intire squad without even standing on the ground D:<.""
 
"" haha 30-milimeter go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr."""
29072,This provides a unique experience not found in any other fps game in my knowledge
29073,Good game it will take some time to learn
29074,"Luv Desync
Luv Physics 
Hate BLUFOR
Simple as"
29075,"Alright. I gave the game a whirl. Bought it when it was on sale, since I am not paying that amount of money for an old game one could just as simply pirate. Now, regarding the campaign, all three minutes of it were amazing. Found some scenarios in workshop to try negate the thought that all I paid for were those three minutes of fun. It was cool, however when I unlocked the armory, I could get all weapons, but only a few of those weapons were not so called premium content. If I buy a game, I expect to utilize all assets of the game, since I payed for it. But this is not the case with arma3. It is a great game, but ruined by constant buy this buy that. I kinda regret having bought arma3 now, since I am not sure what in fact I really gained with my purchase, because I cannot drive all the vehicles, nor can I use all the guns and gear. It's money wasted. If you have no problem with purchasing dlcs for each aspect of the game that should be free, then go ahead. If you are more rational and have some actual expectations and respect for money, I would advise you to not purchase this product."
29076,It's alright I guess
29077,trash
29078,"A milsim in the vein of Operation Flashpoint, a great game to play with friends or by yourself as there are many missions to keep you entertained. Plenty of  mods as well to add to the playability factor if you get bored with either the missions or scenarios. The only drawback is that you require DLC for some of the missions which then means you have to spend more. Apart from that a very good game in which I will recomend to anyone."
29079,"the game is very fun with friends, especially if you join a dedicated server/discord with loads of people"
29080,"I played a little bit and it was fun.

üëçüëçüëç"
29081,Great game. One of the best military simulation games out there.
29082,One of the most realistic and challenging games I've ever played.
29083,Its a fun enough game but if you want to play stoned get ready to get yelled at a ton by a bunch of 12 year old with military boners
29084,after 57 hours of game play...... still dunno how game works.
29085,Great Mil-Sim game!!
29086,The Dark Souls of Milsims
29087,It's alright I guess...
29088,good
29089,"Arma 3 is one of, if not my favorite game of all time. For some reason i always find myself going back to Arma 3, i stopped playing all my other games entirely because i just love Arma 3 so much. The game is like a bf/gf, It can get very, VERY annoying at times but goddamn do i love it. i don't think i'll ever stop playing Arma. When i say the possibilities are ENDLESS they truly are. With the modding community you can fight in any war from World War One to World War 3... if your imagination is big enough. Enough is said, Buy the game, worth every penny. DLC's too."
29090,"Confusing mechanics and controls, boring gameplay, can't get the point of the game, get squad rather than getting this"
29091,unless you have a godlike computer prepare for a microsoft slideshow
29092,Epic
29093,runs nawt gewd onj thy toaster
29094,best milsim handsdown could sit here for hours creating my own missions in eden editor
29095,all my time on this game is singleplayer
29096,yes
29097,very fun cyka
29098,"As good as you can get right now in regards to a realistic shooter or what ever mischievous actions you want to experiment with! 

A vast expanse of DLC and Mod support that covers everything from world war era maps, weapons and vehicles to advanced flight models. 

I mainly play King of the Hill where 3 teams (blufor, opfor and independent) fight for control over a rotating selection of towns earning xp and money for kills and control over the zone, levelling up and unlocking new weapons and vehicles to play with whilst emphasising the critical team play aspect where players will dedicate themselves to specific skills sets such as transport pilots (RESPECT!). 

But you must also take a look at mods such as; exile (for the survival/base building/looting aspect), ""altis"" life (and other various """" life servers for the role play and depth of content) and finally the old classic wasteland which along with the original dayz mod were the main components that distracted me from my college assignments all them years ago.

10/10 - Control bindings may be difficult to understand to start with but persistence will build muscle memory and before you know it you'll be there."
29099,wad
29100,VARY FUN LOTS OF NICE PLAYER
29101,hahaha military base go boom and we all die in 6 seconds
29102,Awesome
29103,yes
29104,a bit hard to pick up but the best military simulator out there
29105,Of Course
29106,Love everything about it.
29107,Just AWESOME!
29108,"Mil Sim, Zombie Sim, paintball arcade game. ARMA3 is pretty close to a lot of things to a lot of people, it's versatile enough as a game that I'd recommend getting it and it's DLC in sales as a certainty."
29109,this is amazing game. this was my first pc game ever <3
29110,"Admittedly, I only play Arma 3 for the mods, but if you can deal with the setup of those mods, there really isn't a better tactical FPS game out there."
29111,Tree=fly to outer space
29112,gun go pow pow
29113,Game is extremely buggy. Wouldn't even let me open up the menu or select a weapon.
29114,ye

29121,"Runs really good, fun to play with friends, even better modded, just a good game."
29122,"Very Unique Game, However you might want a decent few programmable buttons on your mouse, Think of mice like the G502, Would recommend 8/8 would master my bait."
29123,This game is great. Very realistic military simulation with a great community and many different game modes.
29124,If u like arma 3 u should buy it with all the dlcs its worth it i think !!!!
29125,"A bit hard to learn, realy hard to stop playing"
29126,"Its honestly a really great game and simulates war in the best way possible, yes you can fight other players and yes you can work together with others to complete objectives, this is what makes this game great, also trolling others is fun too"
29127,"very fun solo and with a group, would recommend to all!"
29128,Spaud≈æiu patiktukƒÖ
29129,Haha tank go brrrrr
29130,not bad
29131,"One of the worst games I ever played,
Why should I pay to use weapons? ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off. I am not going to pay more money for this, It already costs 35‚Ç¨. Missions are very bad, lots of bugs and the physics are so bad that I want to end myself. Get shot by teammates, listen to teammates screaming for medics. And watch how you die because you step on a bag. The game is also not optimized I only have 50 fps on average.

The fun gaming aspect of this game is almost zero. Didn't even complete the single player campaign, after 10 times trying to shoot a truck on a road and getting killed instantly on the easiest setting, I was kinda fedup with it, the aiming and controls simply suck. The AI is even more stupid, you teammates are simply too dumb to stay alive, most of the times you are bound to do everything yourself, which is almost impossible

At times it can be buggy but [i] it can be quite amusing.[/i] Truth be told, There isn't a lot of content in the game but the saving grace is the [b]Extensive[/b] modding community from which you can do damn near anything you want to with the game.

29147,GOOD GAME
29148,This is a fun and quit real shooter. It takes a lot of time to know what u have to do and u need to play with mods to have a lot fun. And playing with your friends is the best idea. Other then that it is a good game. 8/10
29149,have u always like to be a pilot ? or a soldier when nows ur time this game is the best.
29150,Hitman 1-1 to Hitman 1-2 you did what with a bluebarry?...over.
29151,"Its a thought out game
"
29152,"Great game, zeus is the best game mode, and the glitches are hilarious"
29153,IT IS PERFECT
29154,"If you've heard of it from a friend, like military shooters, armored combat and squad tactics then why haven't you bought this yet?"
29155,The editor is really fun you can create a mission for your squad!
29156,"Honestly this game is kinda trash. Only have fun with the editor, which tbf is enjoyable, only repitative. save your money"
29157,"This game is the definition of military *sandbox*. You'll see everything from Star Wars mods to survival gamemodes to ex-U.S. Marines roleplaying.

Amazing experience."
29158,"First off would like to start with the main game campaign

Although it can get quite boring the mission system is actually quite good, Especially once you get used to the games physics.

Once you have gotten the hang of the overall story line, challenges and the scenarios you can move on into the editor which is where most of my time has been spent. What makes it better is the community content which is updated daily!
You can lose countless of hours in the Editor role... But it is a lot of fun again once you get used to the commands and the tools in which are at your disposal!

I can't say much about the multiplayer other than its huge and can be very confusing! Especially if you are planning on playing with friends on your own server! port-forwarding and all that jazz...

100% would recommend this game even with the confusing server hosts it is worth it!"
29159,amazing game. wish there was more team play without joining regiments but overall super fun if you can get into it.
29160,Very fun yet also challenging

29163,"Fantastic game and the modding is AWESOME, And yes you can play modded online"
29164,"It was the best or may still be the best in a game that focuses on military simulation. Although, time has definitely taken a toll on Arma 3. Don't get me wrong, I will forever love the Arma series and has actually made an impact of the genre of games that I play today.  In terms of immersion, new military simulation games like SQUAD and POST SCRIPTUM are reigning over.  If only Arma 3 could have focused more on visual effects and sound immersion, I might still be playing it today. 

Note: Even older games like Red Orchestra 2 focused on immersion which is almost non existent on Arma. When bullets start flying and bombs start dropping, games that focus on suppression and immersion just gives you the best battlefield experience. 

I may re-install Arma 3 one day, but I'm definitely looking forward for an Arma 4 (if they ever produce it)

I hope to see you again on the battlefield gentlemen. It was a pleasure.

Sgt.Ketchup, signing off."
29165,Extremely detailed but the mods can cause issues so don't load everyone you see just because.
29166,if you wanted to sit in the same spot hiding from your brother with over 1000 hours for over an hour this games for you
29167,"LOVE killin kazis
"
29168,"i love this game, it was easy for me to learn controls through multiplayer because of very nice community teaching me stuff. If your new i suggest also checking out the field guide for help"
29169,HOAHHHHHH
29170,i havent even been able to play the game yet ive seen yt videos on it. the game looks fun but ive tried for hours to find a fix for a missing dll file
29171,"its really fun
"
29172,"I love this game. I myself don't really play the Campaign's, but i hear they're really good. I played A LOT of Multiplayer, and A LOT before i got my own PC, and i have to say this is so much fun when you can get even ONE friend to play with you. It has so much depth and detail, and the challenge is hard enough to make you keep playing but not so hard as to utterly piss you off. Do yourself a favor and get this!"
29173,"I've had so much fun playing this game. Arma 2, Arma 3 and DayZ are by far my most played games. For people that like huge maps and freedom to do basically anything, Arma 3 is wonderful."
29174,dont even bother buying anything less then all the DLC or you wont even be able to join any server. this is a waste of money. not spending 50$ on a game thats this old. sry no go!
29175,its ight
29176,Epic
29177, Good.
29178,You will either love this game or hate it.
29179,Yes much
29180,This game is amazing for military lovers
29181,"Great community

Realism to it's highest

Also good for flight simmers."
29182,good game
29183,"its alright, a bit short."
29184,this is a very good simulator
29185,BEST GAME EUW
29186,"Great game tons of interesting mods, and a lot of groups who do dedicated Arma games, there are a lot of people who are full of themselves, and many who aren't but what game isn't like that.... it can be very enjoyable, well hell if you do snag this game on a sale or something and want to get into it hit me up always lookin for more people to play with. 

JUST A HEADS UP I RECOMMEND GRABBING APEX, MARKSMEN, TANKS, AND THE HELICOPTERS DLC THEY ARE FREQUENTLY USED IN LITERALLY EVERY FORM OF THIS GAME."
29187,yes
29188,wankers
29189,"Tactical combat where you build your own experience. Hundreds of servers and game modes to choose from. Including Milsims, King of the Hill,  and even Zombie survival modes if you install mods."
29190,issa good game
29191,Altis Life was fun.
29192,i dk
29193,"Great Game, If your not sure. DO IT! Make sure you have people to play with though, Playing alone sucks"
29194,tactical and good to play
29195,Its pretty good.
29196,good
29197,great to play with friends
29198,yOU HAVE TO JUMP THRU FUCKING HOOPS TO TRY AND PLAY A GAME
29199,GREAT GAME
29200,It's okay
29201,it's ok.
29202,"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/107410/Arma_3/][b]Arma 3[/b][/url]

Is not fps game like battlefield and Cod. Arma 3 is a military sim with endless possibilities, with a community that adds so much content. 
Maybe there wasn't as much content as arma 2, but if you take your time to go online and look at the mod community you will be amazed. To get the maximum experience out of the game, you will need find a group with skill. Because Arma is a game that needs to be played with more people, not a game were you're a lone wolf.

Personal rate: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
29203,Amazing fucking game
29204,jbvyuilb
29205,C'mon. Do it. Get it. It isn't dead.
29206,You should know
29207,If you ever wanted to be a helicopter
29208,"If you love War games, this is the most realistic of all time, imo."
29209,"Poorly optimized, not enough teaching, and only available game modes are the large scale games where you have to drive for 30 minutes from spawn to get to the action."
29210,"One of my favorite games, ever."
29211,"It's fun, worth full price if this is what you're into"
29212,yes
29213,love ittttt
29214,"It's far too realistic for your own good, no matter what you do, the game will bring your frames to 30 FPS. The controls are actually the worst controls I have ever experienced and I would hope that nobody buys this game full price. The game doesn't tell you how to do half the things that are necessary to your survival so when you enter the game blind, expect to die.....a lot."
29215,"The most un-user friendly game I have played. Good idea, played out poorly. Ridden with toxic tryhards, and terrible servers. It dosent help that actually learning the controls is impossible as well. Some may say this game is fun once you learn it, but nothing about this game makes me think it deserves a second more of my time."
29216,"The game seems like it could be really fun and entertaining, however it lacks user friendliness and any dedicated rp servers for new players. Also a lot of the player base has been playing since it came out and aren't too friendly to new players. My friends and I joined many servers to be kicked after 5 minutes because we weren't being too try hard. In short... if you aren't willing to put time into the game or are looking for casual play this isn't the game for you lol."
29217,aWFUL sHIT
29218,i love this game very adictive and great vonderful graphic
29219,only download if u like military sim games and long hard battles
29220,By far the best military shooter I have ever played.
29221,its endless fun and so much to do
29222,yes
29223,"This game is amazing for those who want to be in the shoes of an operator during all sorts of things, and the mods make it even better!"
29224,"It's alright, spent a bit of time in it."
29225,kinda toxic but whatever fun game xxx
29226,"This is subjective to me, but I personally find many of the controls and objectives confusing but that's just me.

Edit: Recently, I reinstalled the game again to play on wasteland servers. I've been enjoying it and having a good time. If you take a bit of time to learn the basics of the game, you can have a good experience. It may seem confusing at first, but if you do the tutorials and watch some videos you can get a better understanding of the game."
29227,Never really understood the terror of being shot at and not knowing where the shot came from till I played this. 10/10 would play more
29228,"most fun game ive ever played 10/10
"
29229,good
29230,good game to hack on
29231,hardest game i ever played.

29235,Good game with good mods
29236,It's ok
29237,Wow!
29238,its k
29239,"Great game, would highly recommend to anyone who ever enjoyed playing with toy soldiers as a kid, I've got 70+ mods now and I enjoy it more and more every time I play it. :D"
29240,"LOTS OF FUN
"
29241,I recommend
29242,"Good game that is very fun with friends, only downside is they may or may not want to kill you"
29243,great game loads of different things to do
29244,"runs like garbage

just buy garrys mod you would honestly have more fun with a similar experience"
29245,"My boyfriend gifted this to me. Tbh he only did this so he would be able to guilt trip me into playing it since he is crazy about this game (around 2.500 hours ingame time) and spent 60 bucks on the copy for me.
It's really not my cup of tea. There are way too many buttons to remember just to grap something out of your inventory AND THEN THERE ISN'T EVEN A KEY FOR JUMPING like wtf. What are these soldiers, LEGO figures? At least the visuals kinda indicate this. 

Anyways, through the workshop this is highly customizable, thus I was able to play some shitty pseudo-Mario Kart with it which is actually kinda nice. The bunnies are cute and it has butterflies.

3/10 if you're looiking for a good time, 10/10 if you're into military simulations."
29246,"Smile!
Sweet!
Sister!
Sadistic!
Surprise!
Service!
SUPPRESSING FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!"
29247,much fun game especially when its fun
29248,"How the hell do you get this game to load. I have had this over 2 weeks and I still have not played it and am so frustrated. 
I thought it would be just a click and play. I tried looking on line but that was useless.
So frustrating"
29249,One of my favourite pc game. if you like sandboxs you will love this
29250,its good
29251,very good game and realistic too
29252,"297 hours into it while writing this review. 

Me and infantry company are finally geared up and ready.
Aviation company is all loaded and ready as well.
Armor company is ready and ready to go. 
Zeus has his battle scenario ready.

I edit my review and let you guys know once i experienced playing the game!"
29253,"At first Arma is a bit overwhelming, a bit like being actually dropped into a battle. Both the content and the gameplay leaves you confused and ducking for cover. You may decide to not play it, I did. 

Eventually I came back to it after randomly seeing a cool mod on Youtube and decided to really make an effort and it was worth it. The initial content is a bit meh but once you've got into the habit of getting what you want out of the workshop there's just about every time of shooter fun you'd want. I'm currently addicted to single player battle royale. More fun than playing again Chinese cheaters in PUBG."
29254,from the top best games on 2013
29255,"Great game! Love the weapon selection, vehicles and mod community."
29256,"got RDM'd in kav, :(

29257,Da Fucking Best!
29258,its a cool military sim
29259,ye
29260,Brilliant genre - easy to spend hours in it.
29261,"Good sandbox military shooter due to the abundance of modification and regular dev support in the form of updates and dlcs.
Cons : Bugs (too many to list) and bad ai (enemy and ally alike)"
29262,arma 4 when
29263,"Pretty fun,but hard"
29264,"What a fucking ride arma 3 is, Get it, get it now and you won't ever regret another purchase."
29265,ARMA 3 is a must have addition to every Steam library! It is frequently on sale and will be the best $13 AUD you will ever spend!
29266,real gamer game
29267,ye
29268,"Single player and Co-op is very fun. PVP multiplayer is hard, and I haven't tried it much."
29269,You need to have friends to play this.
29270,Really detailed game filled with a great and broad community. Lots of stuff to learn and lots of people to meet. Good fun and good time spent
29271,Try the bumper cars!
29272,walking simulator
29273,"The game is good in your own way, the control system is pretty fricked up and the movement is wooden af, but the missions are fine, the mission creator is good and there are a lot of mods that can improve your gameplay, of course  its a simulator thats why all of this things that i've listed are bad, not because the creators did something wrong, like i said its a simulator... wait what? In this game its not very hard to see flying cars all over the map and the helicopters just crushing into place that you were hiding, you can go 10mph and when you hit the tree with car there is no animation or whatever you just get a little bit of red color on your screen and you health is just lower. In many aspects Arma 3 is bad but the game is just fun to play with friends. Also playing solo is very boring."

29280,game doesnt want to download
29281,"The only thing I don't like is when my mates or enemies come out of the bushes or trees, gives me flashbacks from Vietnam god damnit.... Other than that this game is great, needs a fix here and there but it's part of developing, every game has them! GG, see you in our next deployment."
29282,AMAZING GAMEPLAY
29283,good game

Great for those strategist store of play."

29293,good game
29294,STILL LOVE IT
29295,"its amazing, definitely worth the purchase, along with the dlc's"
29296,ye
29297,It's pretty realistic
29298,"I like the game, the workshop allows for near unlimited gameplay possibilities."
29299,too much dlc big scam
29300,"Imagine Squad as a sandbox game, 10x scale and content (not including mods), and about 5x jankiness and you get Arma.

This game sets the bar for milsim and semi-realistic games for me. Squad, Insurgency, Rising Storm, etc. are all great games but none of them compare to Arma's scale, possibilities, attention to random details, and jank. 

At 7 years old, it still looks good for what it is. CPU is most important with this game.

Client-side FPS is dependent on server-side FPS, so some servers you just won't get the framerate you want (and you shouldn't play on those servers anyways [spoiler]Arma Life[/spoiler] [spoiler]Wasteland[/spoiler]

Look for servers like OFPS Warfare that have epic game modes, custom content (which is nicely handled by Arma's mod launcher), and attention to optimization/server framerate. 

Some servers really don't care and throw as many scripts as they can together, giving everyone 30fps."
29301,"10/10 would get blown up by some guy in a tank from 2000 meters away without knowing he was there because my load distance was set to 1500 meters.

But for real, this game is great. Most of my 112 hours has been just in single player mode, and I just recently started playing DUWS with a buddy and I always have a great time."
29302,"YEAHHHH, If you enjoy roleplay servers or want to get into a milsim. Get this game. Otherwise, ehhh uh eah uhhh yaaaaa knowwwww. ITs uh there, kinda toxic. Fun though

29315,good game
29316,Good game even without DLC's
29317,Not Fun At All If You Don't Have Any Of The DLC Good Luck Trying To Find A Sever And If You Do Find A Sever You Are Insanely Kicked From That Sever
29318,bad game
29319,"First of all this is one of my favorite MilSim games. However it is not without its problems low fps not the best graphics  do keep in mind that this game was released in Sep 12, 2013 and it is now June 29, 2020. I will say that if you want to have a advanced MilSim game this game is great. Mods  are a wonderful addition to the game with mods such as ACE and other mods. I would say this game is a 9 out of 10 

"
29320,"Great game, made a lot of friends on this, only issue with this game is you need to have a supercomputer if you want to have this, mods, and other games."
29321,"Nice game, im having fun. Only for people who are willing to spend time to learn controls and tactics."
29322,Best military simulation games
29323,pretty good if you want to sit in a field and be denied for air support then get railed by ai.
29324,"warcrimes, a lot of warcrimes"

29333,Ok
29334,"My girlfriend gifted me Arma 3 in 2015. Although my computer at the time had issues handling it, and I was forced to take a break from PC gaming for a couple years in college, it has proven to be the single greatest gift I have ever received.

The sheer customization, replay value, mod support, and multiplayer functionality of Arma 3 will forever cement it in my mind as the single most valuable game for fans of the genre. Want to keep is small? You can do that. Want to go crazy with tanks, jets, helis, and 10 infantry units? Go for it. The only limits are what your computer can handle, which leads me to my only real criticism of the title:

Bohemia, please prioritize optimization in the future (whether that be for Arma 4 or continued support for Arma 3). My new computer handles Arma 3 okay, but I know so many others who cannot run it well enough to get the most from the game. In some ways, Arma 3 feels like a benchmark test for military themed renders."
29335,If you want to play this game and shoot a LMG get some earplugs in real-life in advance. Thank me later.
29336,"this game is not noob friendly

BUT IT GOOD"

29343,Good Game
29344,"While Arma 3 may be a broken, buggy, unoptimized piece of shit. It is also a fantastic game with a lovely community of roleplayers, modders, etc. It may not be the most realistic sandbox out there, but it does do a good job at being a highly fun and replayable one"
29345,Great Game
29346,"great MilSim experience with mods like ace3, ACRE, RHS, etc.."
29347,"It has A LOT of content. It also serves many different kinds of players. For those who like realistic fpses, theres the campaign and challenges. For those who like to play god like me, theres the zeus DLC (Which is free!). Would recommend this for all players for sure."
29348,"I went to the military and killed innocent villagers and this game reminds me of it

29352,good game
29353,"I have a massive amount of hours on this game because I like it. It‚Äôs a much older game now, so I can‚Äôt promise you‚Äôll have as much enjoyment as I have had with it, but I can say it is fun for those who like realism. Whether that realism be with game modes like King of the Hill or Roleplay, or if you‚Äôre playing for Milsim. If you like realism you will enjoy this game."
29354,I have 1 hour of playtime so far and zero seconds of actual gameplay time.
29355,"good
"
29356,"4600 hrs in and I love the game and all its mods. Could do with some small fixes, like the physics needs a proper overhaul, but other than that the mods make this game amazing."
29357,fun
29358,"Honestly a really fun mil-sim with lots of versatility. Very CPU intensive, especially when overhaul mods are applied, but is a great game to play with friends in either co-op or even testing each other's combat and tactical skills by battling each other.

So many mods can be used to enhance the game and is a great way to get involved in communities by joining Units."
29359,its ok
29360,"Very good military simulation game. For some reason it's letting me right a review?? Either way it looks fantastic and i've seen my friends play it, so i'm buying it"
29361,Super Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!

29366,Immediately addicted to it
29367,"It's pretty good I guess, whatever."
29368,This game can jump from hyper realistic ptsd simulator to nonsense meme fest. 10/10. Looking forward to my next 2500 hrs.

here is a list of + and - of it
- I don't like shooter games 
- graphics were a bit outdated 
- you can buy special cars and can't use them
- there is no matchmaking system, so it maybe hard to find match sometimes.
(+-)there is a lot of tryhards  out there
+ game mechanism were quite realistic
+ Map is big and if you like military simulator or shooter games I totally recommend it.
"
29378,Great sandbox for military simulation and chill modes.
29379,"get it.. just get it then join ahoy or jsoc on multiplayer...

see you on the battlefield"

29382,Love it.
29383,e
29384,Pew pew !
29385,"This is NOT a casual game like COD or BF. It's not a Fortnite-like experience. This is a REALISTIC combat simulator with complicated controls and long hours required to play. This is for DEDICATED gamers only that are up for a challenge.

I will not outline all the endless features and abilities you as a player will have in this game. It's just going to take forever. Plus, all of it has been said by multiple game reviewers on YouTube, Reddit, etc, so I reccomend to do research yourself and decide whether this game is for you or not.

One video I can recommend is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SRcHAvHw8I

You should watch his channel for more useful content on ARMA 3.

Best of luck!"
29386,"Pros
-Fun with friends
-Realistic especially with realism mods
-Decent Graphics

Cons
-Can be unoptimized and laggy at times

Overall It's an amazing game"
29387,Very nice game
29388,Looks better than ARMA 2 but plays worse. A great platform for modders to make better.
29389,As clunky as it can be at times Arma 3 is great because of simply what you can do with it.
29390,good
29391,boring
29392,"Very nice game, too bad it is hard to find good servers. Still very good tho."
29393,ok
29394,10/10 would flip my Tank again
29395,poorly optimized but thumbs up cus of all the fun mods
29396,"Well what can I say, after more than 1k hours playtime, its one of a kind!"
29397,"It doesn't matter what new shooter game comes out, I always find myself going back to Arma 3. In fact, I normally upgrade my PC with playing Arma in mind. Arma has some of the best game play and mod support, so you can play the game how you want to. I don't get hyped for new releases anymore, but I will blow my load when they announce Arma 4."

29413,"Absolutely amazing war-sim game with often stunning visuals and details put into certain areas such as vehicle interiors and weapon details. Certainly did enjoy every single second I've invested into playing this game, and the majority of it was spent on vanilla servers. I did role-playing, semi-fast paced action, walking simulators, and DayZ like surviving on mods. There's tons of fun to be had (There's tons of other things to try of course but that's just my personal experience listed.) but it's a game for mostly patient people as you can't necessarily expect fast-paced action to be a key entertainer here. There is of course King of the hill servers but c'mon, that's only a minor fraction of what the game truly has to offer and who plays arma to run and gun all the time :)  

People mainly praise Arma for it's endless amount of mods that can be tried out in order to spice up the gameplay and all, but the only mods i ever played on were Epoch and Exile so I can't speak too much about that. 

Also, the game will probably run like hell (20-40 fps) on highly populated servers, although i do have an average mid-priced pc. Despite the low frames however, it's still a lot of fun and the amount of things which you can do is basically endless. Would and still do certainly recommend for anyone wondering if it's a game worth buying and investing time into. 

For new players who may not have anyone to play with, I'd highly recommend visiting the 'Invade and Annex' servers. There usually always full of cool people to play with and they're quite welcoming to new players as well. Will teach you how to play as well as give you a fair experience on what the game's about and what to kinda expect in a way. At least that's where i ended up when i bought Arma 3 for the first time.

9/10 awesome memories and might come back someday for more :)"
29414,"First time playing, and i love it. will put a few hundred of hours on it for sure. so many possibilities."
29415,it alr
29416,"Good Game, many lovely bugs tho"
29417,"Damn what do I say about this...? I have been playing for 1000 hours when I writing this. This game has a LOT of glitches, all of them being somewhat funny in some kind of way. Rubber banding in a convoy mission because of lag and sending the vehicle behind you flying to the moon, hitting a tank with a quad bike flipping the tank and sending you across the map, trying to flip your tank back over with your APC and having your APC do a barrel roll onto it's back, losing both your tank and APC because of it. Having the AI walk through walls just to hunt you down, and the fact that the AI sees you through grass and hedges is also a problem, but the laughs make up for it. Now I haven't gotten to the mods yet! The mods make the game 10 times better, although you need a group to enjoy it in it's full form (TSB, TCS, and TMTM are only some of the groups that do modded missions that aren't fully sci-fi (The 501st is a star wars group that is VERY organized and do very laggy missions, yet they are also satisfying.)) You can enjoy this game in single player, but the multiplayer is were it shines (although being laggy). There are many game modes from your standard KOTH (King Of The Hill) to your escape from altis. The community also has made other game modes like Altis life. ArmA 3 also has this game mode that I believe is only in ArmA, ""Zeus"". Basicly a multiplayer sandbox where the ""Zeus"" (the mission maker) makes anything he wants to with the resources he has. ArmA 3 also has Eden Editor which is a mission maker that you can test things in, and make your own missions from scratch. I have spent a lot of time just testing things and playing around in my own missions (that likely will never get to the public). I believe that ArmA 3 is great and I have had lots of laughs with this game. I hope this helps with your choice in buying this game. Have a good day!"
29418,"%100 great, great fun, quality game, would get again"
29419,"You have to experience this game for yourself honestly. It is better if you have your own group of friends to play with given that most of the servers are gonna be populated by little kids and team killers, but it is when you start playing with friends that it really starts to become fun and don't worry if you don't have any friends that own this game because there are ton of groups that have been created that you can join and play with and each one has there own way of doing things so be careful who you join.
"
29420,Arma 3 has a realistic game-play.
29421,"Received this from a friend of mine
Hands down one of the most diverse  games that I have ever played. Mind that this not your average fast paced shooter where you can run and gun. More tactical play, wide choice of loadouts, mods. Do this with some fellow friends  of yours and you'll have the idea you just entered the army and you really do have to communicate and scope out targets. Physics and gunplay resemble more realistic situations and feel more genuine than most shooters that I have played.

There are a few small things that are a bit glitchy like vaulting over in window frames. Nonetheless not affecting gameplay. The maps are huge and must say that even with lower frames per second (as the game is quite heavy on cpu) it is very playable and not even a game breaker.

played 5 hours straight for the first time yesterday and had a blast, probably  a lot more hours to follow :)"
29422,"I received this game as a gift. This is a game I play after I get off of Rainbow Six Siege or Rocket League, because its fun to get some realistic game play. This game is very realistic if you are into Militaristic role play and King of the Hill [b](KOTH)[/b] games. I would recommend getting this game. Its is really fun. (4 of 5 Stars!)"
29423,one of the best mil - sim games out ther.Play this franchays from Operatin Flash point back in 2001 and hook me up thil this days.LOve it or hate it its up on you but i suget to give it a tray.
29424,"This game is hella fun. I recommend this game to people who love the Military or just in general love this types of games.

For me I enjoyed how realistic this game can be. Like you can make it very tactical and makes you feel like your in the military in way. And the way I played is that  I go on King of the hill to play with a bunch of random players or I get a group of friends and host a session for a mission and my favorite is Liberation mode."
29425,good game yes
29426,duh
29427,can't even play the game due to mods updating but good game
29428,"I Only Come For The Editor Mode, Very Epic

29429,good mods even after 5+ years game is good.
29430,neat
29431,7/10

29433,gg
29434,VERY confusing mechanics and controls
29435,Yay
29436,love it
29437,cool i think thier should be more games like this
29438,Found the gameplay pretty slow and boring.... unless you like running around and waiting more than you like action.
29439,"Frustrating if you're on your own. AI is a little wonky. 

But as other reviewers say, Arma truly shines when you're part of a community. Most of my hours were wracked up in goofy LIFE servers, and PvP KoTH. It's when you play with friends that this game truly shines and allows for endless replayability."
29440,"3500 hours to date and no signs of stopping. 
Excellent game overall with plenty of game modes for any player. 
The mods available to this games sometimes outclass the base game and you can find yourself playing something completely different with just a few extra mods."
29441,"PEW PEW, solid game tons of fun with mods and different game modes."
29442,extremely tactical and probably not what you would expect. It's a nice change from cs and cod
29443,all of it
29444,i miss my family
29445,makes you feel kinda pepega and has many monkaS moments but fun if you know what the fuck to do.
29446,"Yup, it's a good military sim. Only thing that sucks is that just like real life, you can get killed before you even knew there was a baddie near by. Super fun game with fantastic campaigns and great multiplayer."
29447,o
29448,great game all around
29449,Immersive
29450,"its the  best
"
29451,super fun game to play. always have a great time with friends either playing the objective or doing our own thing. Never really dealt with toxic players on this game either. overall a 10/10 experience.
29452,From someone who was in the marines i love games like this! Can never go wrong with sandbox shooters either!
29453,velly gud
29454,makes smol pp do the big pp
29455,good game
29456,ii like becausee fun
29457,"Amazing,Join a reg and big amazing,Love the 102nd great people
"
29458,pretty fun especially with the SOG vietnam DLC
29459,"Saw a guys foot sticking out of a wall. Shot the foot, killed him. Turned around just in time for an abandoned helicopter to land directly on my head. My teammate in voice chat starts laughing, runs over to heal me. During the healing process, he gets run over by an armored truck, which shoots into the air as if it drove onto a cartoon-style spring trap. 

Next game, nailed a 1800M moving sniper shot thanks to teamwork and a spotter w/ a laser designator. 

10/10; would embrace the jank (and awesomeness) again."
29460,nice
29461,"After spending nearly 1500 hours on this game, I can tell you that the it is worth it's replay value. The game has it all, from a variant of guns, missions, vehicles, and tactics to be used on the battlefield. The one problem where it falls short is the A.i. Unfortunately, Bohemia has never had smart NPCs- as they all stagger haphazardly throughout the land getting stuck on buildings, crashing into walls with vehicles, and somehow seemingly head shotting you from 1,000 meters out without even blinking. As said above, even though the a.i's intelligence is stupid to say the least, this does not make them pushovers. If you do not take proper cover you will be in immediate danger so learn to use the environment to your advantage, alongside the positioning of your character to give you the greatest advantage. Another great reason this game is still playable to this day are the plethora of mods, ranging from dayz survival esque, to king of the hill, and battle royale. This game has it all for pretty much any game type. My only advice to newcomers is that this is a first and foremost a military simulator. Play smart, be a team player, and communicate. Call or duty fan boys beware. You Rambo, most likely you will be the first to die amongst your unit. Then it becomes a marathon simulation for 20 minutes unless you are fortunate enough to have a pilot to ferry you from one destination to the other, and in most cases this is not going to happen. For this reason alone it is frustrating, but also gives a sense of realism and forces you to play cautiously. Ultimately, if you enjoy shooting guns, realistic simulation of the military forces, and don't mind modding every once in awhile this game is for you."
29462,"[h1]The go-to milsim sandbox.[/h1]

There is so much fun that can be had with Arma 3. The controls are a learning curve on their own, and can be very clunky at times. If you can get the basics down, totally play this with friends and go on a public or private server to roleplay some missions.

[h1]Best Features[/h1]
‚Ä¢ Modding opens the floodgates for missions and mechanics.
‚Ä¢ Customizing your character with clothes and weapons is always fun.
‚Ä¢ Campaigns are a good challenge solo OR with friends.

[h1]Things to Note[/h1]
‚Ä¢ This game is [b]very[/b] CPU intensive. High-end PCs can dip below 60 FPS during firefights in dense locations, especially with lots of mods. Make sure you can run this game!
‚Ä¢ The controls are a steep learning curve. There are a lot of controls in this game, some include a context menu.
‚Ä¢ Movement can be clunky at times. It is a simulation after all..."
29463,"The game play is alright. Controls are very complex, but you can get over it. What is extremely annoying is that if you equip content that is not explicitly noted as something you have to pay for beforehand, you begin to get in game adds that block your entire screen. This makes me think the developers are a bunch of assholes. I bought the game, so leave me alone already. If this didn't happen, I would have posted a good review. These developers hate America."
29464,Creative and fun :)
29465,geneva conventions breaking simulator 2013
29466,"it is such a great game when it comes to using your brain connecting and communicating With your team to advance in the battlefield,Hope to see new members Joining soon and join the discord for ear to ear Missions,Have fun stay awsome,And be Arma"

29480,"
And so, after all the time spent, it is safe to say that I finally figured out how to walk in this game, but I have concerns that in order to learn how to shoot you need as much time"

29492,"This game is the beast!
if you dont buy any dlc you can play as the other players got dlc..but if there are 4 tanks you cant use 2 of best tanks... or jets or some other things..

if you want my recommendation Apex dlc is enough for whatever you want to do in this game....
specially ""Blackfish"" is the deadliest thing in this game

names are not real.. you can see a gun like ak47 but its called m7
or something else."

29513,Feature-packed tactical fiesta.

29515,Game Good
29516,"Love the concept and also all of the possible mods for this.

Don't love the fact that the enemy AI can clip through walls and shoot you from inside a building, and you can't shoot them back without collateral damage (such as bringing down the building)."

29523,"Pretty awesome :)
"
29524,Good game. Mods make it better
29525,One of my favorite games.
29526,"Arma will be Arma. There are buggs that never got patched and probably will never get patched. There are Probably 2 kinds of people, those who love it for what it is and those who can't play it for understandible reasons. I love it for what it is and will always laugh if a Tank goes yeeting in to the sky because it feels like it."
29527,Yes verry good
29528,If you want a good criminal type Roleplaying platform get this game. Also good if you want to role play as a cop on the internet servers
29529,"The sheer customization Arma3 has is insurmountable. This makes it the most versatile game of it's genre, hands down."
29530,Good Game 10/10 would play again.
29531,multiplayer is the most confusing thing i ever played
29532,Good game. PITA to set up multiplayer..
29533,24 hours into the game.   After dealing with tech issues and getting back into quick play cause the internet servers are useless to try and play due to only 1-3 players or many players you just get kicked out of most servers.   I got into quick play and have read the instructions (confusing and in game play is very confusing what is going on)   you ask players the ones that have i guess 3000 hrs in understand it but as a new player your completely lost on what and why your even there so other players just kick you out.   I guess this is why the servers are very low in occupancy.    The Map and repeated instructions by AI completely make no sense to you.  You get into the game and most players are just standing there and asking questions trying to be polite about not understanding what or how to play the game ......where to go ????    what to do after transport ??????    getting vechiles and using them is during game completely useless to understand why your even trying to use them and where to use them.   enemy seems to be out in the game someplace but the repeated niose instruction between players and AI is nothing but again confusing.    Ive bought the game but wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you want to spend days trying to just get the basics down.   Map is completely impossible to understand what and how the battle is progressing .....you read the briefing but when you go into into the game it seems none of your teammates if you can understand whos in your squad or team is at that location or is even puching the position?????????     At times i found myself almost understanding but I had to stand next to someone close and just follow them and dub what they where doing which got boring or lead to areas that I ended up lost again about what was taking place in the game.   I only have 25 hrs in the game 4 days off and on trying to figure it out ................So at this time I still find the game not a game i would recommend .
29534,"Don't let anyone tell you that this game is broken in anyway, it's completely flawless."
29535,Great game!
29536,From everything to the firefights and the bullets cracking as they pass you to the room clearing. Its just awesome imo
29537,"I love playing this game, its alright alone. However with the modding community it makes it an all-time great for me."
29538,"YEP

29539,"Great game, recommend."
29540,eh i guess its ok
29541,"I got so hard scammed for this thing...First of all nothing looks like in any picture or video. I am getting 50 fps with a GTX 1660 Super with all low graphics and the game at those graphics looks horrible. Second thing, you have no tutorial that helps you. I was pressing C on my keyboard so much to crouch, until I realised that GOD KNOWS WHO THOUGHT TO BE A GOOD IDEEA TO BIND X TO CROUCH. Everything is awfull. You have no idea what to do and how to do anything. Third of all, the game is a giant paywall. You can't join most servers cause you need to pay some dlc's. I was a newcomer to multiplayer, got kicked by asking what to do or what this game is about...  A lot of cutscenes on the prologue missions that make absolutely no sense. I tried to have fun but I got mindblown of what a hard scam this thing is...For guys who want to buy this thing, rethink about it and choose anything else, because nothing looks like in the screenshots. I still can't believe I spent 2 hours to understand literally nothing."

29543,ArmA 3

29547,"Arma is unlike any other game you have played so far. The level of detail and granular features are really what make this game stand out. While it does have some bugs the entertainment value really does shine through, and you will find yourself loading the game up again and again. Once you really jump into things there are thousands of hours of content for you to choose. This game also has one of the most unique, and possibly best, developed sniping."
29548,gives me the big iron

29551,The game is fun and has an active community.
29552,it's ok i guess

29556,"ArmA III is a military-simulation video game developed and published by Bohemia Interactive Studio (BIS) exclusively for the PC. It is the third installment of the ArmA series, officially announced on May 19, 2011, and is built around the new Real Virtuality 4 engine owned by BIS. The playable alpha version of the game was made purchasable on the Steam store and BIS' page on March 5, 2013. The beta was released on June 25, and the full release was on September 13, 2013. New weapons and vehicles are added with each new part of the free-to-download campaign, split up into multiple chapters.

The storyline is set in 2035, when NATO influence is on the decline, while a new Eastern military alliance led by China and Iran called the Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty (CSAT) is on the rise. The setting are two islands located in the Aegean Sea, the 270km¬≤ Altis (based upon the 477km¬≤ Greek island, Lemnos) and the 20km¬≤ Stratis (based on the 43km¬≤ island of Agios Efstratios). The Republic of Altis and Stratis is in a state of civil strife following a military coup by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF), where a loyalist insurgency group known as the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA) wages a guerrilla war against the AAF. Following the signature of a ceasefire between the AAF and the FIA, the US Armed Forces is involved as NATO peacekeepers to oversee the ceasefire. However, the ceasefire breaks down, and the AAF allies with CSAT to suppress the FIA by full force, while restricting NATO to Stratis. Things go from bad to worse when the AAF declares war on NATO due to a muddied firing incident on Stratis, triggering an all-out war. The main protagonist of the campaign is Corporal Ben Kerry, an American NATO soldier stationed on Stratis, who needs to work with the enigmatic Captain Scott Miller and the FIA remnants to survive and turn the tide of the war.

The MX family of rifles is the standard-issue weapon for NATO forces. The MX series, designed by real-life CMMG, Inc., has design elements borrowed from the Remington ACR and Robinson Armament XCR. It fires caseless 6.5x39mm ammunition, though it is implied that it could could fire traditional cased ammunition due to the presence of an ejection port on the right-hand side of the weapon.

The MX comes in five variants:

The standard MX rifle, equipped with a Magpul UBR stock.
The MXC carbine with a shortened barrel and handguard, equipped with a Magpul CTR stock. Both the MX and the MXC are also equipped with the Magpul AFG2 Angled Foregrip with a flat ""A1-style"" surface.
The MX 3GL grenadier variant with an underbarrel Metal Storm 3GL instead of a foregrip.
The MX SW squad support weapon with extended lower handguard and barrel, Z-M LR 300 stock, vertical foregrip, an integrated bipod, and using thicker 100-round magazines.
The MXM marksman rifle with the Magpul PRS stock, extended barrel, and vertical foregrip. Both the MX SW and MXM also feature simplified Picatinny rails on their handguards.

In 2001, the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC - Crane Division) initiated Block II of the SOPMOD program, which called for both new accessories (optics, flashlights, etc.), as well as a new M4/M4A1 Rail Interface System (RIS) to replace the Knight's Armament Company (KAC) forearm from Block I. Among others, SOPMOD Block II introduced accessories such as:

Elcan SpecterDR 1-4x Scope (designated SU-230/PVS)
EOTech 553 HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight (designated SU-231/PVS)
Insight Technology M3X Tactical Illuminator (designated SU-233/PVS)
Advanced Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Light (ATPIAL) (designated AN/PEQ-15)
During the rail selection phase, NSWC-Crane surprised most observers when they chose a new lightweight free-floating rail forearm manufactured by a then-unknown vendor, Daniel Defense, based in Black Creek, Georgia, over competing rail designs from KAC and ARMS. In contrast to the earlier KAC rails, Daniel Defense's design, designated RIS II, extended nearly the full length of an M4's barrel, past the gas block, thereby increasing M1913 Picatinny rail space relative to the KAC rail. The RIS II was also free-floating (it had no contact with either the barrel or front sight post), and was capable of mounting the M203 grenade launcher without a barrel attachment. Two versions of the RIS II exist: A version which contains a slot to fit over an M4's A-frame front sight post (known as the ""RIS II FSP""), and a continuous version (simply ""RIS II"") which contains no FSP slot and therefore must be used with a low-profile gas block. The RIS II was first adopted by SOCOM in 2006. However, in contrast to most of the other SOPMOD Block II accessories, which began reaching operators in the field in 2007, SOCOM did not complete testing on the RIS II and issue its first major procurement contract until 2009, and Daniel Defense's own production lines initially strained to meet delivery orders on their SOCOM contract (which also limited the RIS II's availability on the commercial market). Consequently, the RIS II did not enter usage with SOCOM component personnel until after 2010, and it did not fully replace the KAC rail in SOCOM until 2016, by which point newer, modular rails had begun to usurp Picatinny quad rails on the commercial AR-15 market. Despite being a dated design relative to current AR-15 rails (e.g. those using Keymod and M-LOK attachment systems), the RIS II is currently the standard-issue M4A1 carbine rail for U.S. SOCOM."
29557,dogshit
29558,"Great game, BUT WHERE DID I GET SHOT FROM?!"
29559,It can be hard at times but with enough practice you will have fun.
29560,Very buggy an unoptimised game but that why it's fun...
29561,"Great for milsims or just casual fun. There are plenty multiplayer servers up, and the community is pretty fun and chill. The singleplayer mode offers a good enough campaing and an endless editor mode, where you can play around with everything the game offers in a sandbox. Recommended buy."
29562,very nais
29563,Very nice game i kill yes
29564,"Good military sim, lots of variation and scenarios to play with other or alone. Best mileage will be will a committed group willing to play regularly."
29565,"As somebody who has a whopping 2hrs of game time (guys im pretty sure i have the most hours here) safe to say im pretty much an expert. the game is very good, many fun's, the DLC practises however arnt, but it has amazing mod support to make up for it. well worth a buy when its on sale (which is pretty much every second day)"
29566,The amount of time you can spend in this game is seemingly endless and at the same time endless amounts of fun.
29567,This is a fun one.
29568,best tactical shooter ive played in a long time but you need a good pc to run it
29569,what
29570,"Pretty mahfuckin good
"
29571,Not your typical run-and-gun shooter games. Recommended for those who like realism.
29572,"Overall when it comes to the bare bones content and Singleplayer aspects of the base game there's a decent amount of polish and content to keep you involved for a handful of hours if needed, that being said though i personally felt the campaign for the base game to be a bit of a slow burn when on Altis. In regards to the DLC campaign (Scenarios) i personally haven't tried them yet but have heard decent/good reviews from friends.

Though i believe where ArmA 3 itself truly shines is the multiplayer and further super in depth Modding Support and capabilities that provides content creators and the countess communities, if you are looking for a military sandbox game Arma 3 is THE king of military sandbox shooters at least at the time of this review. The scope at which the modding community has stretched can provide you with any experience, You want a WW2 mission? There's a mod for that, Wanna fight the Empire from Star Wars? There's a mod for that as well. The sheer size of the modding community is easily the number one reason this game hasn't faded from memory.

PROS:
- Thousands of Mods.
- Outstanding Communities (There are ArmA Units for Every Niche)
- Deep arsenal for the base game. (All DLC's Taken into Consideration)
- Anything is truly possible with ArmA so long as you can code etc.
- Hundreds of Youtube Tutorials (Wealth of Information at your Fingertips)

CONS:
- Sound design for the game is a bit hit/miss.
- The game is CPU intensive and therefore can seriously dampen the experience for lower end rigs.
- Graphics are feeling more outdated as this is by default a fairly old game. (7 Years)
- Engine itself feels clunky at times and some seriously game breaking bugs occur (Tank ramming a bush can go Space Shuttle status.)
- A rough learning curve for beginners. (Dozens of controls/keybinds and not easy to get the hang of if on and off play.)

I bought ArmA 3 roughly when it was initially released for Steam and haven't regretted the buy one bit, if Military Sandbox games are something that tickles your fancy than by all means pick it up and check it out!"
29573,"fun with friends, lots of great mods on the workshop, 100% worth it"
29574,"Imagine, cock and ball torture but... It's an FPS game."
29575,"One of the best military simulation. The only problem is why a soldier can't use hand to hand combat, or a knife. Imagine people just staring at each other when there are no bullets left in their gun."
29576,Great game. I love you
29577,"fun
"
29578,"Arma as a series is a very ""deliberate"" game. What I mean by this is you must be interested in a more simulator aspect as opposed to game aspect. It is not as smooth as a game like counter strike or call of duty because your character has weight to it almost as if it is a vehicle as opposed to a floating camera with a gun attached."
29579,GET IT RIGHT NOW.
29580,"game
"
29581,its a gaming
29582,"Bought Arma 3 vanilla. Every three seconds I am given an ad for DLC that does not matter. It ads nothing to the game, it is either cosmetic or should have been in the game originally. Money grab!"
29583,yeah
29584,i bought it 1 day before it went on sale for 9 dollars. I paid 30 dollars for it when i could have waited 1 day and got it for 9 dollars. And yes i tired to get a refund but it said i couldn't. I hate this game and i want my money back!
29585,"For sandbox fun, this game is hard to beat.  If you like GTAV and want a more military centered game, this is for you.  If you want to play in a MILSIM unit and LARP as an operator, this game is for you.  If you want to play janky but fun survival/PvP looter mods, this game is for you.  I've had countless hours of fun playing Arma 3 and if the engine is upgraded well enough that multicore support is a real thing, I'll have plenty of fun in Arma 4 too."
29586,"Realism. Tactics, strategies, stealth. Open World. DLCs galore. A workshop STUFFED with content.
A very satisfying simulation. Supports TrackIR which adds to the immersion, gets your head on a swivel.
Worth it even if you only play the single player campaigns."
29587,"Great game, community is nice and helpful most of the time."
29588,Outstanding game. Can literally mod to be whatever you want.
29589,Been playing games since Attarri came out so for me 1986. This is the first game in all that time i cant get a game to play. I don't have a clue how to get this thing started when ever i think i do it freezes or it's the longest load times ever. Needless to say i lost a fair bit of money on a game that's harder to play than a 1988 dos with floppy disks.
29590,i was an old Operations Flashpoint player... and jumping right into this.... is just bring back memories... i love it!
29591,best war game ever
29592,What kind of control scheme is this? Realism isn't fun.
29593,yes
29594,Shit Game Dont buy

29597,nice
29598,very nice
29599,"After a little bit of time playing this game. I think it's pretty good. I recommend you get all the DLC, especially the kart DLC. Because there's nothing like running over Civilians as Kerry in a go-kart."
29600,did not like game
29601,It's fun.  Best played with Poles.
29602,"Best and fun game I have found and good mods too.
"
29603,Everything is awesome until a kid starts shouting when you steal his car in Altis Life
29604,The best shit game that I have ever played.
29605,"Single-player campaign user. Great amount of tactical options and room for creative play (assault/defense), weapons, open format semi-sandbox with some amount of story and non-constraining directionality. My favorite all-time games are Battlefield 1942, Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6 Raven Shield and Operation Flashpoint: for me this game is reminiscent of all three, for different reasons. BF1942 in large map, open-style play, Raven Shield in the sharp tactical play which keeps you on your toes, and Flashpoint in the larger story/movement across open spaces toward a goal. 

Works much better than expected on my low-spec laptop with toward medium-low. If you're seeking a detailed, tactical military fps and have a limited budget or older computer I highly recommend Arma 3. I imagine it also would be great on modern devices with settings at maximum. Though I haven't played online, I've heard great things about the community and the innumerable mods available. Good luck."
29606,"Could not learn the game fast and dropped it, but I give it positive for realism, that is what this game is all about."
29607,very bueno
29608,10/10 great game has lots of fun and the mods on the steam workshop are amazing.
29609,yeag

29631,The simulation is very complete and attractive and gives you the feeling of being military. But playing without DLCs doesn't hurt at all.
29632,Still the best milsim

29634,"High-quality game with realistic physics, the first time there were difficulties with management, over time you will get used to it, this game is worth your attention."
29635,"I definitely recommend ARMA 3 to people who love more realistic military games. Not only is this game realistic but it's also a great sandbox. It has it's bugs and FPS drops but overal, ARMA lets you have a great military-like experience! 
Children play COD, teenagers play Battlefield, but adults play ARMA. ;)"

29650,"Geneva Convention, more like the Geneva Suggestion"
29651,"When a game developer gets arrested for spying on a foreign countries army to make a video game you know its going to be good. Arma III is one of those games that you dont have to be good to have fun. Im sure I didnt get more than 20 kills(one of them being my friend on accident) during my time playing it. It seemed like every time me and my friends booted up this game we would be in some crazy adventure running for our lives away from the enemy. I never figured out all the controls and how to fly a helicopter but it never mattered. I was still having fun.
If youre looking for a realistic military shooter. Then this is it. I recommend buying the dlc because if you dont and mistakenly use a dlc gun or clothing item you will be spammed with checkerboard style logos across your whole screen while you try to play."
29652,ITS ENJOYABLE
29653,"To give a short review, Arma 3 is about the best military simulator you can find on the market. To large scale realistic warfare to quick small arms close quarter combat, this game delivers it all with some of the best mechanics i've seen in a game of its genre. I highly recommend Arma 3 to anyone who wants a realistic, immersive, and enjoyable military sim with an active community of interesting players."
29654,It's ok. Only played it a little bit.
29655,E
29656,"Refreshing change of pace from the COD/Battlefield world. First real military sim I've played, I like! Only doing single player campaign at the moment, I bet the real fun will start when I get into the multiplayer stuff."
29657,best battle game
29658,fun to play with others
29659,"The good: The graphics are better than Arma 2, the maps are larger and the editor is more powerful.
The bad: Instead of fixing bugs that are years old, you get updates of content that have no value, are ridiculous and everyone thinks ""why?..."" 
Without the addons made by others, this is basically a sci fi shooter with fantasy weapons and vehicles.
BUT with free addons made by the community found in the Steam Workshop (don't bother with the DLC, that is mainly useless and expensive crap and most certainly do not pay for the mods hijacked by Bohemia so they could charge you money for it), the game becomes a simulator where you can fly, drive, walk, sail and  murder just like in real life. 
DO NOT WASTE extra money on silly dlc(except Apex maybe for the Tanoa island but only when on sale) that you absolutely do not need and want. 
"
29660,Game that i will never regret getting. Lots of different things to do. great game
29661,great game bud
29662,"Always been a fan of the game from youtube, finally got the set up to run it (even if settings are low). Found a semi serious milsim unit on discord and have felt very welcomed there and I have learnt a lot from the game as well as having a lot of fun. I have only got just over 100 hours in game but I play majority of the week and am always learning, that is what is most enjoyable."
29663,Great game and great communities. definetly needs mods to be good but otherwise its great
29664,its ok

29669,"First of all, It can be really buggy and performance on certain maps is garbage. BUT if you can get past that, It's a lot of fun. The SP is pretty good, the multiplayer can go from a shooter to straight up D&D, and there is an ENDLESS amount of content through the workshop. Can't find a scenario you like? Use the editor to make your own. Don't like how someone is running a mission? Play as Zeus and run it yourself."
29670,It's fun.

29691,"A really fun game with a steep learning curve, with having to learn semi-actual military protocols and procedures. Singleplayer campaigns are fun, though the NPC characterization could use some work. Multiplayer is where this game shines. Plenty of ""units"" of excellent people that provide unforgettable Zeus campaigns, and even then, public multiplayer matches, Co-op or competitive, are also fun with that steep learning curve. Public Zeus, however, will make you question your hope for humanity. No game is without some degree of bugs, and Arma just so happens to get the short end of the stick, when it comes to them.

Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10"

Steep learning curve but worth it. If new to the series Don't skip the tutorial scenarios.

29710,"Though it can be played in SP, Arma 3 is definitely NOT a SP game. It's hard to learn and even harder to survive. With almost a hundred keybinds und dozens of features to provide a realistic combat enviroment, it will take some time to get a good routine. That's why Arma unfolds its full quality by joining a community or at least playing on dedicated MILSIM-Servers (not the official ones). It's meant to be played as a military simulation, and if you don't like that, you'll probalby won't like this game neither. MILSIM-Communities can train you how to play Arma in a team, cause it's a team game. Communities can give you technical support, cause there are always a lot of technical issues to solve. And finally, you need someone to guide you through the almost unlimited forrest of community-based modifications, and a lot of this stuff is just AWESOME! It's the biggest and most sophisticated military sandbox on the market.   
A lot of people in the Arma-community don't play this because it's easy - the do it because it's hard. But when you're through the first frustrating weeks, you will learn to love it. And you might have some of the most fascinating moments in your gaming career..."

29737,"Background: i'm a flight sim guy. I got arma because i love CAP and it seemed like recreating COD coop, in a sim with friends would be fun (it is). So that's what this is more a review for.

Pro's: Great mod support. any military plane you might want to fly is most likely on steam and if not its on armaholic.

Simple but not dumb radar and targeting pod GP. 

Great pylon loadout menu


Cons: Small maps. radar would be cool if bvr existed in arma, but instead everything is within 10 miles so creating fun AA and AAA engagments is hard since the ai will lock instantly and dump all its rockets.

Poor multiplayer support. this is by far the most frustrating game to play with friends because it takes half an hour to get in a lobby that works and god forbid you want to try P2P or LAN. You are stuck with the zues official servers and hope you get in first or the GM lets you play with your toys.

Overall: IF you like Milsim stuff and don't have this yet, pick the full bundle up on a sale. You will get plenty of enjoyment, and the mission editor gives you endless stuff to try out

29757,"Arma 3 never ceases to amaze, it looks great, has compelling gameplay and suprises you with it's customization. But after playing nearly two months in the game, I can tell you that it no longer holds up to modern standards. 
Whether it's the piss-poor performance, incredibly dated controls, and the lack luster ""V2.0"" release that came out recently it is clear that this game has  aged very poorly. With games like squad getting constant content releases and support from the devs it goes to show that Arma 3 is on it's last legs. At it's core it is a functioning game but after 7 years of postponed development its obvious that there is no hope for Arma 4. I would recommend that you look elsewhere for a military shooter."
29758,"Outstanding game, with seemingly endless mods. Worth every penny."
29759,"This is a game that can unite casual gamers and hardcore milsim fans. The game takes some getting used to; to learn the factions, the vehicles and the weapons but gives you limitless possibilities therein.

Perhaps the best part of this game is the Zeus addon. No two games on Zeus are the same, unlike repetitive normal server games can be. So long as permitted by the Zeus, you have the opportunity to use whatever customised loadout you want.

The game's biggest downfall in my opinion is the vehicle physics. One vehicle touching another on a server can turn a vehicle convoy into either an explosion caused crater or a NASA mission to the ISS. 

Overall this is an incredible game giving the chance to go on fast paced missions or those of a more strategic theme, or even if you wish to create missions of your own."
29760,I sold my wife so I could offord this game.
29761,Good Succ
29762,great for meme content
29763,So damn fun
29764,Fun
29765,it is good game yes
29766,I dont think the people who play this dont know that they are not in the army.
29767,"Great game for those who like realistic games, very GPU dependant though and would only recommend getting the DLC's if you actually use those items otherwise its worthless and overpriced."
29768,"I played for a while, its fun"
29769,"Good game (not that it doesn't have its flaws), community with both horrible and great sections, bad company. So bad, in fact, that I recommend not buying this game in order to not give this company money.

One day, I logged off of Warlords, gave my CP to a teammate, and there was no problem.

Then, about 2 weeks later, I decide to try to join and find that I've been banned from all Warlords servers by some admin I wasn't told even existed. I was under the impression that players moderated these servers through the power of votekick.
Voted admins, to my knowledge, don't have this power, and so I am led to believe that this admin belongs to Bohemia Interactive.

A complete breach of my trust to give me a random, unwarranted, unjustified spit in the face of a ban just after I'd bought some DLC and given Bohemia Interactive money. I have been backstabbed and betrayed and will give no more money to this horrible company.

Update: Admin Abuse Interactive strikes again! Despite not even having played since this incident (incident meaning blatant admin abuse), I somehow got banned on official servers for other modes as well!

Seriously, don't give them your money.

Update: I rate Bohemia Interactive ""worse than Daybreak"", and that says a lot."
29770,greatest game i have ever owned and it is updated frequently enough so that it isnt out of date with content
29771,^_^
29772,great game when you have no DAD
29773,"The game is good to mess around in, quite realistic too"
29774,"I highly recommend finding a Milsim unit to play with, it makes the game a lot more fun"
29775,*click* Nice
29776,I play King of the Hill and love the game. This is no run and gun shooter. You need to work as a team and play tactically. There are several different online games you can play and single player missions. There's even a battle royale.
29777,"One of my all time favorite games. Its the roblox of Fps's. You can do whatever you want from a milsim, to Gta, to Dayz, to Call of Duty, to Roleplays. The possiblities are endless. It has a good singleplayer and great multiplayer communities."
29778,Heavy on the Simulation side lots of mods to keep you entertained
29779,"ArmA 3, a great source of controversy, and game from over half a decade ago. To list ArmA's all shortcomings would require an essay. So why do we all play it? It's because we all love it. ArmA, while a buggy mess at times is a wonderful host. And ArmA's replayability has kept us around for all these years. 

Comparing ArmA 3 to other military games is honestly like comparing an apple to an applepie. For example Squad and ArmA 3. Squad has undoubtedly better graphics, and smoother gameplay, but that's it. In Squad, the playerbase is limited to a singular gamemode. In ArmA, the game has numerous gamemodes in vanilla in-and-of-itself. And what makes ArmA ArmA is the ability for the regular user to make their own world. Want a guerilla based gamemode, if you can make it, you can play it. In Escape From Tarkov, the players are limited to whatever the devs create. ArmA has no such issues, as the players are free to create pretty much whatever.

Keep in mind that I'm not trying to say 'ArmA is perfect no matter what', that's not what I'm saying. I am aware of ArmA's shortcomings as much as the next mate, but beggars can't be choosers. ArmA has proven to be a generous host, and since there are no alternatives to it, us the playerbase pays no mind to the issues Arma has. 

ArmA 3. It may be expensive, run poorly, and have graphics dating back half a decade but there's nothing like it. Until ArmA 4 whenever Bohemia get's their stuff together, we are here to stay.

- Lion"

29783,"Awesome game, loads of fun."
29784,Good Game. Yes.
29785,"It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.

Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.

Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.

While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.

The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the ""follower"" category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.

It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.

While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to ""find cover"" (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.

Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.

Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.

Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on ""Patrol"" and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.

After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.

Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.
