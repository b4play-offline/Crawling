0,Good game. Easy to learn and well explained. Especially like the fact it is free and you don't have to spend $ if you don't want to. Looking forward to playing with friends.
1,Close to realistic WW2 ships!! Leveling can be a bit long winded though
2,/ewuygtfhcuydhxfhncrufhycjnd x great game
3,"Love this game, great for a quick time killer just hop in and have a bit of fun. Works pretty well on Steam Deck,

Wish they had cross platform, so the stand alone client can link with steam client."
4,"gaet game  sorry for my selling
"
5,Free to play but not pay to win.
6,"It's a lot of fun getting to control beautiful rendered ships of history. With iconic ships prominent in the battle, it's like taking part in a museum battle with every deployment."
7,Awesome
8,Great game enjoying it a lot. :) Check it out. I'll meet you on the highseas!
9,"great game, epic battles"
10,"pretty noice, although it uses health bars, still noice
"
11,Good game
12,boat
13,Great graphics and game play.
14,Great fun and might even teach you some history.
15,"i find it very fun, the only downside is that it can be hard to get different ships i only wish that researching ships was easy."
16,Rubbish game
17,🚢
18,Sell me Yamato.
19,Excellent game!
20,"a fun naval game, easy to learn & play especially with a friend or two. There is AI opponents or PvP, missions and challenges, different tech trees for different nations ships. easy to get lost for hours playing so beware!"
21,loved the combat experience. this is a great game and the attention to detail is awesome.
22,"alot of people tend to shy away from games like this (world of tanks, warthunder, etc.) because it always becomes a pain to grind once you reach midtier without paying but this one does a pretty good job of throwing different ways to get xp, boosts, and money even at higher tiers."
23,yeet
24,I love this game so much! I love how all the ships are so realistic and I love ww2 ships!
25,iz gud
26,good
27,amazing game play not the best graphics but its really fun to play
28,Games pretty cool i guess
29,Best game ever and if it sounds stupid its not
30,Indeed
31,lame
32,pretty fun - lots of strategy and heaps of ships to play
33,Broken matchmaker with passive players camping edge of maps. Battleships are target practice for all other ships and and do the worst dpm while beeing unable to hit the side of a mountain from 10km unless you are lucky. It's a bad joke at this point.
34,Decent
35,love these games
36,"this is good game,you can chill
"
37,big gun battery energy
38,This game is Awesome!!!...
39,great immersion into a world of realistic warships..
40,It is a great game for a 20 minute casual playing session. Most players behave well.
41,"Historical accurate warship model with nice environment set up. Love the Navy legends channel as well. If you enjoy planning strategy  more than dealing damage, this game is probably for you."
42,its woerth the try no matter experience
43,fuck you kongo but its a gud game
44,"This game is insanely detailed in graphics, its easy to learn and ITS FREE!!!"
45,awesome
46,no enjoy
47,"A very satisfying game.
I will elaborate the reasons:
- Free to play;
- Options to spend (if you can and fancy the idea);
- Different modes for all tastes (randoms, co-op, ranked, brawls, clan battles, etc.);
- A game that you can log for a few to kill time or longer if you love to dedicate more in it;
- Constantly updated, with new goodies, fixes and more.

If you are someone who can't understand the difference between a video game and real life, or someone lacking common sense, most likely, you won't have a good experience in here.

Sometimes you will win, sometimes you will lose, and sometimes you will play great within a mediocre team and lose, but it is OK. It's a video game. If you are mature enough - of any age group - to understand that in games sometimes things happen (a bad decision, a bad team, a glitch, etc.) and focus to have a good time (for any amount of time you want to dedicate) this game will offer a lot of fun moments."
48,gREAT GAME
49,"Super fun to play
"
50,"Nice doo doo fard game.
My PC goes into cardiac arrest when I play this tho..."
51,thhhhhhhhhhhhhh
52,Fascinating and engaging game. Excellent graphics and sound effects. Developers eye to details in rendering vaious scenes is note worthy.
53,Great game
54,very fun
55,"big gun go critadel
"
56,Fun and realistic naval warfare.
57,"Big ships, shooting big guns, at other big ships until one gets wet. What's not to like?"
58,"Addictive and fun. the Grind isnt too bad and there is alot of tactics involved. There is pay to win, but if you dont know what you are doing, then honestly it doesnt matter as you will be slapped hard."
59,"It was a great game until out of nowhere, they decided not to support and drop all mac users."
60,very very fun!!!
61,"Fun well balanced game, good comunity regular updates. I really enjoy it."

64,"A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
And he said to the man runnin' the stand
""Hey! [(bam bam bam)] Got any grapes?""
The man said: ""No, we just sell lemonade
But it's cold, and it's fresh, and it's all home-made!
Can I get you a glass?""
The duck said, ""I'll pass.""

And he said to the man runnin' the stand
Hey! (bam bam bam), got any grapes?
The man said: ""No, like I said yesterday
We just sell lemonade, okey?
Why not give it a try?""
The duck said. Good bye

And the man just stopped
The he started to smile
He started to laugh
He laughed for a while.
He said: ""Come on, duck
Let's walk to the store
I'll buy you some grapes
So you don't have to ask anymore
So they walked to the store
And the man bought some grapes
He gave one to the duck
And the duck said: ""Hmm, no thanks
But you know what sounds good?
It would make my day
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Do you think this store
Has any lemonade?""

73,"DO NOT play this game! If you value your time, mental health and your funds.....just skip."
74,REALLY GOOD
75,GOOD GAME
76,i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. its boring af any super infuriating.
77,gud.
78,"I've got very limited time with it, and it can be frustrating for new players.  Stick with the lower levels until you can buff a 2nd and 3rd level ship.  Note that whatever level you take the game will bump up the competition 1 level potentially.  So going in with an L2 ship, you could be facing L3s.  Go in with an an L3 and expect L4s.  Note each of those ships could be highly modified so you are at a disadvantage unless you do the same.  Graphics are good and audio is ok.  Can't beat the price. ;)"
79,I love wins no matter what it takes.
80,"It's okay I guess, didn't really enjoy the experience after few hours of playing."
81,awesome game
82,better than shit thunder

90,"Pros: great graphics, can be fun to play with freinds
Cons: Some toxic users, Ships you cannot get or can only get by spending a ton of money"
91,Fun game
92,"An all round good game. Yes progress get slower unless you play but I still find it a fun game to destress to. 

The graphics are really good for the type of game, I use a GTX1660 Super and have no problem with the game play."
93,"Subs ruined the whole thing, nothing less enjoyable than that"
94,"""World of warships""
more like ""World of torpedoships"" 
"
95,Game is great fun for anyone who enjoys naval history and military history in general. The only complaint I've had is the same with any MMO games. All the immaturity from people who think they are professional players giving new players grief in the chat. It's not bad enough to make me quit but it could definitely make the game less enjoyable for some.
96,laid back naval death
97,its free and has great graphics
98,oh yeah. I love this game. Good for youtube. SPent a lotta time on this is just a couple days lol(i really shouldnt be on that long this is a cry dfor help no really PLEASE HELP THIS IS A CRY FOR HELP)
99,nice game
100,I like the Big Gun Battery's :3
101,Good tactical fun using a large variety of ships and weapons
102,great Game..
103,"Good game still...Of couse, WoWS & affiliates charge the hell out of you for everything but...if you know how to play each class of ship you can do really well playing with what you earn. It's a very fun game. For free. I mean you cant really go wrong and if its not for you...uninstall it! Def worth a try if you like historically accurate, graphically well done PVP & Co-Op based missions."
104,Its one of the greatest adventures ever!  Very realistic feeling!  I'm hooked.
105,"lets you play historic ships in battle in a ""realistic"" format against other players"
106,"great game 10 out of 10
"
107,"matchmaking system and p2w ships are serious problem, thumbs down"
108,haha boat go boom
109,this game is veary fun
110,паиапаи
111,"is fun
"
112,"realistic warfare of ww2 naval combat dispite people saying aircraft carriers and subs shouldnt be in the game. they should, its realistic. although some things could change to make aircraft carriers and subs more realistic and fair"
113,good game
114,"I've played World of Warships for 6 years now on PC plus what I've played on PS 4. They have always striven to keep the game interesting, fun and challenging. though it has been a great challenge for their team to do so. I still think the tier 8 through 10 ships are still about 10% to high, they have kept others within reasonable reach. all in all, i would recommend"
115,STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!
116,fun to play
117,"Fun game.

Has a lot of tactical play and a lot of straight fighting as well."
118,it good
119,"Good game, very grindy"
120,"This is an arcade game not a historic navel simulator, ships are placed in tiers and their damage and resistance are based on that, ship classes/types are balanced and do not reflect IRL characteristics of the ships which would be unbalanced to say the least. however game models depict ships accurately and graphics are very good. would like to see a simulation mode added to the game that went off the actual specs of the ships, it would give more gameplay life to older low tier ships in the roster."
121,"very fun, technical game"
122,Can't run on potato pc
123,IT VERY GOOD
124,The grind is already awfull but after you finaly stop grinding you see that the grind was the best thing ever cause at least in the grind you were doing something but after? The people get angry at the other players and that makes me want to uninstall the game even if it was one of my favorite games
125,"Warships cool, the rest is uncool"
126,"Many updates, more of the same."
127,ONE TORPEDO DEALS 10K DAMAGE ARE YOU INSANE WHAT IS THIS SHIT GAME
128,I's fine.
129,"There is a lot to like about World of Warships (detail in the ships, gameplay, etc).  For a newbie to WoWs, not everything is intuitive.  A tutorial would be nice.  I see a practice server is ""available"", but I haven't figured out how to use it.  Information please.  Submarines are not easy to figure out.  YouTube videos help some, but there is no way to learn some things submarine other than trial and error, but if you waste time trying to figure out submarines during a match, you may be penalized for non-participation (lose, lose).  The game is over 17 years old and there is no place to practice but in live PvP?  Overall, it is a good game.  I find it a bit theraputical similar to playing solitare.  That is, the co-op battles have a certain degree of routine to them.  I can engage in that type of team play having an expectation of what the map may be like and what expected (kill off all the enemy or capture the designated areas).  Overall, I can recomend this game (though there is room for some improvement to help people understand things better when they are new to the game)."
130,":) its a good ship game very realistic , good grapihics and physics and i would recomend
"
131,its free and there is a bit of a grind to it. Then tier V is a whole different experience. Good and Bad depends on the person
132,"I have found this quite addictive even thought its a very basic game. Building up credits and research XP etc is designed to be slow obviously trying to encourage players to spend money. THis game can be played for free but it would be an incredibly long process to get up the tech tree. Premium ships though you really need to do your research, plenty of duds in that lot but there are some good ones. I enjoy the scenarios and co op. Random Battles I cant understand its like everyone's ships are on steroids. I dont understand how battleships can seem to have an endless supply of missiles coming at you yet the couple of battle ships I have , I am making a cup of coffee between reloads. Overall the game is addictive, not sure how much time I will put in this once I rejoin Iracing when the black Friday deals come. Appreciate from the developers that this can be played for free but I have spent some money on a few premium ships."
133,big ship go fight big ship it's fun
134,pay to win clearly... u need at least premium account...
135,sick
136,Fun Game
137,"Fairly fun free game, of course your limited to how many boats you can hold at one time as it is free to play, play to win to a point but still and overall fun challenging game with great effects and game play."
138,This game is called Boat. Boat is fun.
139,"The Best Epic machine Vs machine (No blood or gore graphics) battle on the market. Played on a more relax style tempo.

First shooter type game are for nerdy young folks...THIS game is perfect for older folks who crave the history of Naval Sea Warfare.

Bravo to inventer of WoWS.....;-)    esher457"
140,P2W garbage
141,Good
142,love the grind and options
143,This game is very fun. I like how they make everything look realistic. To the details of the boat to the ocean water that moves. Awesome game!
144,⚓️
145,it is amazing the graphics are amzing and it has realy realistic ships
146,"""Dear Dasha, my love.

Our ship caught fire, and the blue colored smoke is filling our cabins, trying to suffocate us. My comrades in arms fights hell, but I could see the demons knocking on the steel door with their burning fists and bright yellow claws clenching into it.

My crew mates bravely investing time in their battle, their sweat and their tears. With their sacrifices, I could relate their stories to entire generations to come and this were the words I carefully told them, with my utmost sincere feelings:
I am so so glad that when I had to choose to invest time in this game or not years ago, I decided not to.
Thanking my guts for saving me hours from this game and sinking it into the depths of the bottomless sea called ignorance.

And this is how, I closed a chapter in my life about believing in people who turn their back on their own. And nothing will change that whatsoever.

With France From Love.""

147,gg
148,big boat
149,"I've been playing the free version of World of Warships and I've got to say that the game is very addictive primarily because the ships and the battle scenes against live enemies feels so real, firing the gun batteries, getting hit, escaping and attacking is immersive, I love the close up view of detailed battle scenes where you can even see the bolts on the other ships as you pass each other in battle, water splashes guns blaze when in close combat, it's awesome! I recommend this game. I've played it for the first time today and it's already been four well spent hours; it's an awesome experience!"
150,i love the plane caeere cant spell but it  fun an to get better ships
151,I command battleship.
152,"I'm actually a tank fan, so I was first introduced to this franchise with their game World of Tanks, and this game caught me by surprise. I find myself playing this game more than World of Tanks, and I love the attention to detail the developers made with the in-game graphics, very nice indeed! I was specifically impressed with how they made the water look and move."
153,great game
154,"It's a very fun F2P navel battle game. Yes, there are numerous microtransactions but they are NOT required to play. Yes, having a premium account will help with the grind but again NOT needed to play. There are a lot of RNG elements that people will complain about, and I do admit it can get frustrating. However, that is what RNG is all about. As much as I got frustrated I also got excited about amazing citadel hits or sniped a DD with torps."
155,"It is a nice game overall. It is a quite hard game, normal if luck is on your side almost everytime."
156,its alright
157,.
158,"This is my first review from over 4500 hrs playtimes.
I just got banned from ""Shipposting Contest"" by WoWarships Admiral user accout, Reason : using automation.
And I was reported by these people. : Conzo_ | Werwolf_P | Starseer
I can tell that this is real Human Error, Users and who is moderator in Steam platform. Then i explained to them with solid evidence that I can prove that I didn't use automation, but still haven't received any reply or apologies.

Over 4500 hrs of my total playing time, I would like to warn the rest of you to avoid this game, It's not worth your time.
After the Puerto Rico dockyard event is over, I think it's the right time for me to get away from malicious person, and this game forever.

Good Luck and Fair Seas"
159,Great game to play with friends.
160,!
161,"hey devs this is a great game and happy 7th annaversary
"
162,fun
163,can't play since the latest update. the game keeps crashing mid-battle and i get penalized for leaving early.
164,"Played for five hours with no problem. After logging on the next day every solid surface had black, flickering splotches all over them. the game has no way to share an in game bug report. The five hours the game did work were decent enough with needing to lead your targets for shots. Very detailed game but no way to report issues. I even deleted and re downloaded it (at 46+gb) and it still didn't fix the issue."
165,fun times. the only downside is most ppl don't play the objective and are more focused on stealing ppls kills than the taking the actual objectives. which will often leave you screwed over.
166,"The game often encounters silly server, connection or login errors"
167,devs completely ruined the balance
168,good ships that u blow up is fun and Xtreme
169,"Apart from Carriers, this game is the tits."
170,"The video quality is very good however the ship speed over the water for destroyers seems to be out of sink. The ships seem to move faster than a motor boat in perspective to real life.
"
171,Nice game! Short battles with pretty much emotion!
172,"The game is a bit heavy on the currencies, promoting extra monetary investment. Aside from that, I think that the game looks beautiful. Immersion has been my favorite aspect so far. Don't expect to survive to the end of a match often, especially once you hit T5's and abouve for randoms. Losing is how you learn tactics! Enjoy the torpedos lads :)"
173,"Just like any PvP game, this one CAN be toxic.  For the most part though, this game is worth the time it takes to grind and get xp points for newer ships.  If you do not come into it expecting to win every match (you wont) it can be quite enjoyable.  Worst case scenerio, you jump into a coop lobby and play against bots if you keep you getting crap lobby after crap lobby."
174,"Games fun, been playing on and off for years, nothing hardcore but noticed the original ships are best and buying ships is a waste, word to the wise don't play after 11 pm euro cause people get very hardcore and all upset for a game, guess they crying cause over tired but if you don't want to deal with the immaturity dont play after that time."
175,"great, fast paced game. Best to play with friends but you can solo que and play with random other players whenever you want."
176,It's so good
177,"Make your game more enjoyable again rather than super grindy, also please don't place Tier 8s with Tier 6s, its massively unfair especially when its an aircraft carrier who's extremely experienced vs midgame / new midgame players like myself who are just trying to learn...

Edit:
I was booted from the game via a wifi issue and was penalised for that? Care to explain why an UNINTENTIONAL afk would have to be punished. I am not a Wifi God.."
178,"good
"
179,Cracking game to play with friends or join a Clan and raise some HELL!!!!
180,absolutely love the game play plus also have this on my ps4
181,Big ship go boom
182,fun and interesting
183,great game
184,"Gameplay is good, the UI is bad and sluggish, the updates are outright ridiculous"
185,its a great game which rewards team play and getting better can be frustrating but thats also what makes it rewarding
186,"The trailer isn't exactly truthful.
Like other ""World of"" games, early on is fun and quick to unlock new stuff, but eventually you will need to spend money, or be stuck on an endless grind."
187,i an a double amputea upper arm and it it is eazy for me to play
188,i use to cut up retired naval ships in philadelphia naval yard always wish to ride an hear hoow the sound in person
189,43647
190,"Battleships: SLOWAF, shoots far and pain, reloads slow, you're a tank.
Crusiers: Medium speed, shoots medium range, has lots of turrets, reload fast, has torpedos (some fo them).
Destroyer: Fast speed, shoots short ranged, has 2-3 turrets, has alot of torpedos, very little hp
Aircraft-Carrier: You're SLOWAF, but you're gonna play with your plane most of the time. Yes you can control the plane in a battle of ships.
Submarine: Does it even exist?

Overall good game. Btw you get to leave the game early and STILL RECEIVE YOUR EXP. But you just can't play with the ship that you sent to battle previously until the games over."
191,good game all i can say
192,"Cool Game and Amazing In Game Interfaces 
Also the sounds in the game are amazing."
193,"If you've ever wanted to shout at your computer screaming ""YOU SANK MY BATTLE SHIP!"" this game is for you."

199,boats and explosions
200,funm
201,fgfg
202,Its fun. They did an amazing job on the effects and the detail on the Warships
203,fun can be pay to win in mid to late game
204,I would say it is a decent game.
205,Such amazing graphics and detail.
206,"no balancing at all, developer not interested in a good game, just the maximum of money"
207,"I really like this game, very accurate ships!!"
208,Bad developer
209,amazing game looks amazing.
210,"i love this game. its so satifying when you land a hit on a ship or sink one and the battles are both high intensity and a relaxing way to remove stress by blowing up a few boats. i highly reccomend this game.

my only issue with it is the futile amount of xp you gain from each battle. if i battle for 10 mins and am saving up for a 6000 xp ship i expect more than 9xp
maybe im just bad lol"
211,I like this game
212,Too slow paced for me
213,"I used to really enjoy this game; the core loop of Destroyers, Cruisers and Battleships was very fun, and each ship type had an important role to play. Unfortunately, the game developers have repeatedly chosen to maximize short term profits over the health of the game. This game is very much pay to win nowadays, with all the best ships in their tier being the most expensive, sometimes to an absurd degree. Worse, when they made the changes to aircraft carriers and submarines, they made some poor design choices that make the classes not very fun to play. Instead, they are made to be as easy and low risk as possible. I think this makes it so not many people want to play those classes, but this looks pretty bad for the developers given the resources they put into developing those classes, so to make those classes more ""fun"" they have significantly turned up the impact of those classes, to the point that they seriously overturn the balance of the game. 

Where the base game revolved around information and risk/reward, the other classes, especially aircraft carriers completely break that dynamic. They carry essentially zero risk, while completely ignoring the concept of positioning in the game. I think matches without carriers can still be pretty fun, but when carriers are involved it incentivizes a style of play that is extremely boring for pretty much everyone involved. 

I could see myself coming back to the game if they significantly reworked the carrier class in a way that didn't upset the game loop between the original classes, and brough higher risk higher reward gameplay to the class, but as it stands, this game is boring and pay to win."
214,"not a bad game, the update is pretty good"
215,pain
216,"pretty alright
"
217,Awesome relaxing battle game. Definitely a great way to just enjoy some gaming
218,good game some bug's but this happen's with all games would recommend
219,float
220,"ths is a great game and i highly reccomend it to everyone 
"
221,it do be fire
222,"its awesome when you get the torpedo boats in action
 love it!"
223,addictive game
224,cool
225,Russian ownership and then they tried to sell out their own people to make profit once their country invaded Ukraine! Worst yet the game had been known to be Russian Bias and its also a paid for easy win PvP. STAY AWAY!
226,"Worth the grind, although can be repetitive. There are no competition naval warfare games currently, so Developers will always be tempted to get greedy with P2W stuff. The Armory & Premium shop is extremely lazy and craply built - compare to the tons of cash these guys raking in, one would think they re-invest it in a better software team.."
227,Uh idk fun game
228,Casual fun or hardcore grinding
229,fun and challenging
230,"most games are fun, id say 65%+ are, theres about 2% of games where you carry and have a great game, those are some of the most satisfying games ive ever played in any video game. 5-6 kill games in your secondary german bb is basically p0rn"
231,"Love the game. Wargaming asked me to comment on what I remember most about WoW. My old Wargaming Account. That's what I remember and miss most. But since now I play on Steam with friends new to the game, I can't use it anymore. Once there were ways around it where you could use an old Wargaming account and still play with your Steam friends but it seems to me that has been patched out."
232,I don't know just how many hours I've put into this game across both console and PC but it still has to be one of my most favorite multiplayer games to date
233,very good game j
234,.
235,VERY NICE GAMEPLAY
236,20 hours in and ive already bought 3 premiums this game will ruin my life
237,Enjoyable!!!
238,"This game is incredible, I recommend it for everyone who likes warships games. Quality and details you can see makes the game better, but also I recommend to install it with space in disc or it can go slow or inclusively crash. Beware that is a very good game, I rated 5 of 5 its interesting and very exciting. And you don't have to think about hating it because its very awesome, so what are you waiting for? Download it now!"
239,"Awesome game...Used to play a long ago when it first came out. I've played all of the ""World Of"" war games. All are a blast to play. Iv'e settled on Warships as my favorite. Graphics are so much better now. Greatly Appreciated. Really adds to game play. I'm a big fan of the subs being in the game. Much more realistic game play, historically. The subs add a whole new element of skill development. Would recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in naval warfare gaming......James"

241,"world of warship is alot fun i love the combat in it!
"
242,IT's a truly fun game
243,Great game! If you take the time and learn how to fight each ship it is very rewarding.
244,its a good combat game with planes cool maps boats and torpedoes but I cant figure out how to get the submarines
245,Entertaining for sure.
246,"I changed my mind with this most recent patch on 9/7/22  they made this game so much fun at least for what I like to do with the change of Operations.   The new rework made this game fun a lot of fun but  still be wary of ships on sale for cash some are good and others are bad,  really bad."
247,"After they balanced it, the game is much more fun and has more objectives, it's something you can return to over and over."
248,"Fun game, free to play but unless you throw some money at it, you will need to grind to get better ships and upgrades."
249,Fast paced fun for me and my young son!
250,Addictive!! Love working my way through the ships.
251,Need to balance broken subs and the economic rework was not in the interest of the players. I would give it a 7/10 the game used to be much better
252,Match making takes too long. Same grind map after map.
253,Sweet game!
254,it good
255,This game has seen me through some of my darkest days. Frustrating at times but that's what makes it a great game.
256,Maybe a good game.
257,easy to play. one will need to have a very long patience as acquiring new ships takes time.
258,"A wonderful game, but concealment of Destroyer and Submarine is an unpleasant experience for a Battleship player."
259,great game
260,"THIS GAME IS A GREAT GAME - THE BATTLES - THE SHIPS - WORKING AND PLAYING WITH FRIENDS - ITS A REALLY NICE GAME TO PLAY. THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY I DISAGREE ABOUT IS THE TERMS IN WHICH IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE IN BUYING IN GAME PRODUCT, THE RETURN POLICY REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND SHOULD BE RE-LOOKED.

IF YOU BUY A SHIP ON ACCIDENT OR THAT WASN'T REALLY WHAT YOU WAS GOING FOR AND REQUEST A REFUND. YOU MUST HAVE NOT PLAYED WITH THE SHIP AT ALL, NOT EVEN ONE GAME. I THINK FAIRLY YOU SHOULD AT LEASE BE GIVEN 24HOUR-48HOURS FOR A REFUND ON A PURCHASE OR UNDER 2HOUR WORTH OF GAME PLAY ON PURCHASE FOR SHIPS.  

THAT'S ALL 
THANK YOU"
261,very nice game
262,"My friend had to talk me into playing this game at first, and I am thankful that he did lol it has been very fun, I have really enjoyed everything about it, especially the strategic aspect of the gameplay along with having friends that I can team up with. It is a great time single player, but really shines when you are with your buddies."
263,"WOWS is a fun game the matches are short which makes it nice when you have to leave to do life.  What I don't like about it is its the constant change... just when you get good at building and playing a particular way, they change things and you have to totally start a new.   I guess this is fine with the people who spend hours a day playing, but for us once in a while players it makes it tough.
"
264,great game for some naval pvp action
265,fun
266,"Easy to get into, takes a long time to advance without premium though. For a free to play game that seems fine."
267,Fun game but there is a learning curve but most players are helpful if you ask. Beware there are some very toxic and abusive players in the game but thankfully very few as the community does a good job of policing the worst offenders. Plus the devs have installed some tools to report abusive or unsportsmanlike conduct. Give it a try if you want to try a pvp focused game that is a very non-traditional FPS.
268,"love this game, been playing for around 3 years on different platforms. the best warship ""battle"" simulator."
269,"Rated 7/10.
it's a nice game, free, not very Pay to Win.
 but when it comes too in-game reward's, they aren't set right for you re ship's tier. 
You can unlock and use a tier 6 ship but still only make the same mission Payout as a tier 3 ship.
On the bright side this game is free, large scaled maps, Highly detailed graphic's (even on low setting's),  Easy Matchmaking, Great Ship Mechanic's, No Hacker's, No Glitches i believe.
"
270,game is good
271,ok
272,"I love this game. I play it almost everyday, and its always so fun to play these ships that (some of them) you can't even visit in real life unless you want to scuba dive. However, One main thing that really bothered me is the Submarines. I was playing a game as the Shimakaze, and a sub surfaced right in front of me. I was laughing and taunting him that he was about to eat abunch of depth charges... until I ate like 5 torps. really?? they can do that?? Maybe like have them warm the torpedos before they get launched or a delay. Sub feel out of place in the game, they need a rework for more fun for both sides."
273,really fun game but takes time to master
274,Great game
275,Decent game
276,BOAT
277,BIg BOat
278,"Ballance is non existant.
Agressive monetisation = create problem sell solution
Did some research on game devs and they seems to have hoofs instead hands woth spagetti coding.
For such big company i wonder where the money going to from players as sure shit not into a game developement"
279,really good game :) i got tier V because i started last month and other players should play because really good good grapicks
280,"Love this game. I got into it because I was looking for an aircraft carrier game. This is much more. I'm a CV main but I love playing all other types of ships, too. CV's are beginning to get ridiculous, though. From what I've heard, they are about to get automated Anti-submarine warfare (ASW). I for one thought subs were subs were supposed to counter CVs, and yeah it is frustrating when a sub gets through your entire team undetected to get to you but at least us CV mains actually could be countered. To conclude It's an awesome game with awesome CV gameplay. If you start playing to play a CV expect to get hated on you deserve it, really. This ASW thing will only make it even more viable to hate on CVs. Like I said I main CVs I love their gameplay but it really is getting ridiculous how they are trying to make our carriers almost impervious to get more people to play them. Have fun and Stay safe. - (GUSTO) CaptainJonSnow."
281,"war game has war
5/5"
282,great game
283,"I still love playing WoWs. However you asked what I dislike about this game. I dislike what was done to the carriers. it use to take good skill and map control to use carriers effectively. now anyone can use them and Wargaming weakened the AA on all the ships so the carriers can be effective. Y'all should take the carriers back to the way they were. I miss the RTS control, multiple squads and the ability to cross drop bombs and torps."
284,"its a great game but needs a button to turn off the chat window. 
The folks who play a free, multi player game then spend the game complaining and insulting others who dont do as they say is a lesson in stupidity."
285,Good!
286,"Good fun, clear  progression through ships , though after lvl 5 ships match making can be a cruel mistress."
287,sweet game
288,i like the game because of the history of the ships and where they are built.  i have been reading about the diff ships as  i play missions with them.
289,"I'll admit I have a bias. I love battleships so it makes sense I like this game. Its a bit faster pace than actual naval strategy but who cares. Explosions and cannons.. that's all that matters. 

Ok Ok, so serious side of the review. It has great graphics, the objects (ships) have good detail. If you have a good enough graphics card and monitor, it makes for a very aesthetically pleasing game. 

The controls are simple and very easy to learn, allowing you to quickly form strategies depending on ship type. The tech-tree/levelling up has many options. It does take a fair amount of time if you don't buy anything, but why would you do that? If you like a game support the Devs and Engineers. Even if its £2 ($3) every other month or only when you use it. 

There are enough maps to make it fun, but I have to admit I'd like to see more mission types. At least two new Co-op mission types and Head to Head fleet types. Maybe have a mission where you must protect a flag ship. 

This game is great fun, it can get repetitive. But that's fine for some and not for others. I don't mind it; some nights I can play it for 2-3 hours. Other times 20 - 30 mins. In any case if you like naval ships and just want to blow stuff up, this is your game. 
 

"
290,"It is strictly a grind. But if you wish to learn your Naval education, this is a game properly introduced. Detailed, authentic and realistic nautical travel, I thoroughly enjoy this naval warfare."
291,"Don't buy crates or Cammo .
Buy premium only if you play a lot and don't play tier 9 except for the almighty grind to tier 10.
The new economy in the game is busted IMO.
The fun zone for me is T5 to T8, you can have a poor game and not lose any in game coin.

It is a great sounding and looking game, the ships are beautiful."
292,"game play brilliant endless time of fun would be awsome if map can be made bit bigger so battle not so finished over quikly
"
293,great game
294,Great game for chilling out on the High Seas
295,Fully immersive game play can keep you engaged throughout the Battles
296,fun game
297,Great game!
298,"I have played this game now just long enough to see that its weaknesses is about making $$$, ship balance, and ship selection.

When it comes to $$$ even small details like having a premium account to gain the most xp per battle, available port slots for new ships, moving a commander from one ship to another, converting ship xp to free xp for use in lower tier ships, all cost doubloons which of course cost real cash. Everywhere you click, something costs doubloons, if you want to play at your best you must buy the best ship upgrades, or to gain quality advancement in tiers of a warship. It was free to play in the beginning but its very evident now that its not free at all. I would rather have payed $75 dollars for the game and had all this available, it would have been much more fun.

Ship balance is out of whack too, too frequently a ship will deal massive damage with every volley due to tight artillery shell dispersion while the same class of ship played by new players, with all the commander skills to improve dispersion, will miss widely. On their forums they call it prediction, skill, etc., its none of those because shell dispersion depends on neither prediction or skill.

Carrier and Submarine commanders frequently get reported by players for not being helpful or contributing and this removes any xp accrued for that match. The seasoned players despise these two warships and often report them just to cause trouble. The game maker added carriers and subs for the whole immersion factor but they should just take them out and call it World of Battleships because they have too much hatred for other ship types. Their reporting system should be nixed entirely as it gives too much leverage by a team of players to vent their contempt on ship types instead of the actual players contribution."
299,great!
