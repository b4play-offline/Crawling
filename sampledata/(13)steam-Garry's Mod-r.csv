Here's the best brownie recipe I've ever tried

Ingredients:

3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) melted butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 large eggs
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup Hershey's cocoa
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Line an 8-inch square metal pan with foil and grease only the bottom of the foil.
In a large mixing bowl combine melted butter, sugar and vanilla with a wooden spoon until well blended.
Add eggs and beat well with spoon until creamy.
In a small bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder and salt.
Gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, beating gently until well mixed.
Spread batter evenly into prepared pan.
Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until brownies appear set and begin to pull away from the sides of the pan.
Remove from the oven and cool the brownies completely in pan on wire rack.
Cut brownies into desired size and shape.

Bon Apetit"

61,///////////////
62,"2014 Gmod was something else, Deathrun taught me god hops, intro to speed and speedrunning later. The game was much more active and spontaneous. Servers full of squeakers, teen bullies and YA usually in the military. Chaos and funniness included. Most gamemodes feel dead now, or are just too srs plyers and trolls lmao. For now I play the Mirror's Edge version of Half Life 2 where I can dropkick combine into space and shoot them with satisfying guns. Oh and the workshop is flooded with nextbots but still has impressive, overlooked ports/addons. To each it's own."

160,"Garry's mod is an iconic PC game with tons of different game mods and servers. Anything from prop hunt, TTT, murder mystery (aka OG Among Us) And Even Dark RP (aka OG Five M). The game is old school and probably has some outdated graphics and features but it cant be replaced!"
161,Banger alert
162,It's Fun
163,IT really helps with backgrounds
164,Garry's mod is very unique game because of the ability it gives you to create your own world however you want it. I think for me Garry's mod has helped me think more out side of the box which was a breath of fresh air. It has some much to do. In my experience it is very fun and worth the money. If you have the time try it out you might have a blast!

BTW: Most servers will show ERROR messages if you do not download CS: Source, you can get it for free on gmodcontent.com or you can buy it for $10.00 on Steam. Also recommend downloading TF2 content as it is used often."

There is a vast modding community, many fun servers and a host of friendly people to play with (about 25k) With all the mods there is, this game has nearly endless possibilties. Make Gordon race Barney on the moon, create a sword battle between Kliener and Breen, or even make your own mods."

288,Very good sandbox game
289,"Perfect game.

The base game of Garry's Mod isn't too bad or good, it has what you need to make anything you want, but.

The mod's in this game is GIANT! You can find almost everything in this game on the addon's or workshop page, want a dildo? Go to workshop or addon, want a fucking rocket? Go to workshop or addon? Hell, want a damn sex doll? GO TO WORKSHOP OR ADDON PAGE! This game is perfect."
290,In my opinion Garry's Mod has to be one of the most important videos games of our generation.  So many people have grown up watching people play it as well as experiencing it for the first time on their own.  It true is a magical game that is great to play with friends no matter what you do.

567,Garry's Mod on its own allows you to take the items of Half Life 2 and mess with all of those items. The game on its own can get boring but the player created mods on the Steam workshop allow for literally unlimited situations to be made! Little things like making better versions of existing items or maybe downloading World War 2 NPCs and downloading a map to have trench warfare can be done in this game. This game is about 10 dollars for what should be worth thousands. Not even 1 penny must be paid for workshop content so getting items on the workshop isn't like a DLC but more like having some sort of optional update to download. Each individual mod is all by fans and some things on Garry's Mod should be up for real money. The fact some people have made amazing items that they should be getting money for just astounds me. If you want a War of the Worlds experience we have some mods for you. If you want the experience of a shootout then you wont even need a mod! Remember though that some items require games like Counter Strike: Source to run. If required games are not installed it will cause the items to not work so make sure to read the description of an item for other required mods and also required games.
568,This suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch a good game and some pepole probley think that too. i recamed cheking out garys mod those who are half-life fans like me should check this game out if you havent it has a lot of elameants that the game has. What i am trying to say is that garys mod is a good game.

702,"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

Pushed as far as I can go

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this

707,Good game to pass the time. So many different servers and so much fun!
708,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

831,"Garry's Mod is an outdated, laggy, and overall inconsistent game.

This game is still running on the outdated source engine, which arises a lot of problems when source engine still runs on DirectX 9. Which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the addons in this game.

You cannot say that this game can run good on your computer, unless you spawn 60 yacht vehicles, implode 60 nukes, and have the game still responding. All the addons will have one or two fatal flaws, unless it's a NPC. The most these mods try to be is graphically demanding, because I can't use a weapon without the stupid ahh COD weapons UI and the textures ruining the way you control.

And in the end, all these mods overlap with each other. Which shows, when the game has a problems menu that shows addons overlapping, or spamming the same file a thousand times just for it to be an PNG. I swear these mods get corrupted no matter what you do.

So, don't buy this game, or you'll get sucked into it like purgatory.

I have so many great memories with this game. Logging over 1000 hours now, I've played this game since the very first days. I never got into the online multiplayer aspect, but my little brother and I would have awesome adventures just using our imagination. All thanks to Garry's Mod. Best part is: all of those maps are still around."

1113,"Picture this; Two old men T-posing in a shed sh*t talking a gut with a sub-machine gun while he attempts to find them, expecting said old men to be an object or piece of furniture within the map. As the clock slowly dwindles down and the hunter loses patience the old men reveal their location by singing ""All Star"" by Smash Mouth putting heavy emphasis on the line ""I ain't the sharpest tool in the SHED"" 

When that somehow doesn't click, one of the old men just tells the hunter exactly where to go, so with the sweat beads rushing down his forehead the hunter runs to the shed and opens the door revealing the two T-posing old men standing one behind the other. In an act of desperation he launches a grenade from his gun, only to die leaving the two old men alive, and victorious. 

Our hunter hero was vanquished by the forces of evil old dementia ridden men in a shed, as the poor man behind the computer screen wails in agony and anger, cursing out his friends and how horrible of people they are as they just laugh and laugh....

TL;DR
Fun game, play with friends."

1194,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

1305,10/10 definetly up top on epic meter
1306,"thank you dev, thank you community"
1307,"I strongly recommend this game over its simplicity, its funnyness and it makes you addicted.
I got addicted since 2014 - 2015 around that time. I have played it for a total of almost 1100 hours.
I stopped being addicted to the game ever since addons started slowing down and it started being less fun.
I've gotten in to the game. andIi expect another 1000 hours put in to this game once more. Garry's mod will be and always be my favorite game to play. I played it in bad times. good times, and most importantly I played it with friends. if you own Garrys mod. and you have a couple of friends that have it, invite your friends to a game and have some fun! play around with sandbox. run from obunga and nextbots.
maybe make some youtube videos, gain some views become a full blown garrys mod youtuber.
get hella popular. or you can just chill with your friends! Once again I strongly recommend this game to those
that like simplicity, sandbox, and fun. It's a wonderful game to play if your bored. If your bored right now and
dont own the game, if you can afford it. I strongly strongly recommend it, Garry's mod is my favorite game.
Thank you, Garry's Mod. for teaching me the importance of how important games are. Games will always stay in my heart, and I hope that they do that for you too."

1331,"There are so many things to do in this game, from recreating world war II to settling on a nice beach on a hot summer day, while a nuke is falling from space, You can be chased by flat PNG images, have red texts saying ""ERROR"" when something goes wrong loading something, or have purple and black squares for textures if you do not own other source games, You can also commit mass murder, run people over with cars, spawn in and create a turf war with different NPCs, you can build anything and do anything that comes to mind. In other words: this game's possibilities are endless."

Story: The night after a high-profile party, the four main charactersrapper Sam B., hotel desk clerk Xian Mei, former football star Logan, and bodyguard Purnaare awakened by a voice over the emergency intercom system directing them to evacuate the hotel. They discover that much of the population of the island have been taken by a contagious infection that has turned them into zombie-like creatures. Briefly overcome by the infected, they are rescued by lifeguard John Sinamoi, who believes them to be immune to the infection. After aiding Sinamoi and several other guests he rescued to reach a secure lifeguard station and call for help, Sinamoi requests they travel to the nearby city of Moresby to obtain food and supplies while they await rescue. The four travel to a nearby auto garage where they meet Earl, the owner, who has recently been bitten by the infected. He maintains his humanity long enough to create an armored vehicle that will allow them to safely reach the city, and requests that they take his adopted daughter, Jin, along to prevent him from attacking her once he turns.

A promotional still featuring Xian Mei, one of the four playable characters, about to attack oncoming zombies. The still shows this in third person, while the game uses a first-person perspective. Upon arriving in Moresby, they discover a horde of infected attempting to break into a barricaded church where another group of survivors is hiding. After the four kill the infected, the church survivors inform them that while much of the city has been overrun, a violent street gang has secured the police headquarters. The church group's leader, Sister Helen, requests that the four help restore the church's water supply by entering the sewers and reactivating the neighborhood's pump system. After doing so, the group travels through the sewer tunnels to reach city hall, where several of the island's top politicians have holed up, but they refuse to assist the other survivors in any way. The main characters attempt to regroup to decide their next plan, and when they return to city hall, they find it has been overrun with infected, which were able to enter the building through the tunnels after the four drained the reservoir by activating the church's water pump. They return to the church and learn that Jin attempted to help the gang at the police station but was kidnapped, and they are focused to mount her rescue.

After acquiring supplies, the main characters return to the hotel, where the voice contacts them again. The voice identifies himself as Colonel Ryder White, a Banoi Island Defense Force (BIDF) commander, currently trapped in a prison located on Banoi, accessible only through the jungle. He states that due to the characters' immunity, he may be able to obtain an anti-virus to cure his wife of the infection. The group assists a small survivor encampment in the jungle and meet Mowen. Mowen does not know how to get to the prison, but instead takes the players to the location of a secure bio-research facility on the island; the researchers there have been examining a native cannibalistic tribe where they believe the infection may have started from. They affirm that the characters' blood type helps to make them immune to the infection, but at the same time, realize that an anti-virus cannot be created. Under direction by the scientists, the group rescues a native woman, Yerema, who was about to be sacrificed by the tribe. She willingly returns with the group to the laboratory to allow herself to be examined.

After completing tasks for Mowen and returning Jin to her home to put down her infected father, the characters return to the laboratory and find that the infected test subjects had been accidentally released and the scientists wiped out. They rescue Yerema and recover the sample of vaccine that had been created. With Yerema's help, the group, Mowen, and Jin travel to the prison to meet with White. They find that a number of prisoners have survived the infection, and are given their aid in arming themselves to get to White. When they reach an elevator to travel to White, the elevator is suddenly filled with knockout gas. The characters are awoken by Kevin, a technology-savvy prisoner, who reveals that White has stolen the vaccine and is attempting to flee, while readying to detonate an nuclear explosive to wipe out the island. The group race to the roof and confront White, who refuses to hand over the vaccine. Jin releases White's wife from a restraining harness, forcing White to defend himself. His wife bites him, infecting him, and he shoots both her and Jin before taking the vaccine. However, the vaccine's formula is flawed, and White becomes an inhuman monster, and the group is forced to kill him. The group escapes Banoi in White's helicopter along with Yerema and Kevin, and as they return to the mainland, ponder the fate of the world.

Gameplay: How do I get my husband to stop going ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô during sex?

TLDR; My husband says ‚ÄòGoblin Mode activated‚Äô when we start to have sex, growls and acts like a caveman, and then says ‚ÄòGoblin Mode off‚Äô when we stop, and then pretends not to remember afterward.

I really love my husband and he‚Äôs always been great in bed. But recently he‚Äôs been acting really weird. So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through our house and said he was in ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô. We didn‚Äôt really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a special needs school. My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He‚Äôs an incredibly tough man, but this was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he‚Äôs been a little emotionally unwell. I‚Äôve heard him muttering, ‚ÄòGoblin‚Äô repeatedly when he didn‚Äôt notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that this was for the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to have sex to relieve our stress. However, my husband said ‚ÄòGoblin Mode activated‚Äô, starting growling, and went wild having sex with me. Admittedly, it was some of the best and most experimental sex I‚Äôve ever had, but I‚Äôm worried that something might be going on with my husband. Any advice?

Edit: The problem isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄòGoblin Mode‚Äô, it‚Äôs that he could be ill

Story:

15 elite high school students are trapped in school and forced to participate in a sadistic killing game - Either remain in confinement forever or murder someone without being detected in order to escape, but risk death if they are caught.

Setting:

Fallout 4 takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after the Great War, a war between the United States and China over natural resources that ended in a nuclear holocaust in 2077. The setting is a post-apocalyptic retro-future, covering a region that includes Boston and other parts of New England known as ""The Commonwealth"". Unlike the previous titles, Fallout 4's story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077.

The game takes place in an alternate version of history that contains 1940s and 1950s aesthetics such as diners and a drive-in theater and design and technology advance in the directions imagined at that time. The resulting universe is thus a retro-futuristic one, where the technology has evolved enough to produce laser weapons, manipulate genes and create nearly-autonomous artificial intelligence, but all within the confines of 1950s' technology such as the widespread use of atomic power and vacuum tubes, as well as having the integrated circuitry of the digital age. The architecture, advertisements and general living styles are also depicted to be largely unchanged since the 1950s, while including contemporary products, such as a robotic rocking horse for children in one advertisement, or posters for the underground Vaults that play a central role in the storyline of the game.[citation needed]

There are four main factions that the player can choose to support throughout the story; the Brotherhood of Steel, an anti-synth faction hoping to preserve technology in the Commonwealth; the Institute, a secretive organization that specializes in the creation of synths; the Minutemen, a faction that aims to drive out raiders and other threats out of the Commonwealth; and the Railroad, a secretive organization dedicated to rescuing synths from the Institute.

Game-play:

The referee decides who starts and spins the wheel. The wheel has different segments split into body parts and also split into different colors.

Players must follow the instruction of the spinner in order to progress. Do this by placing the required body part onto the nearest available circle of the correct color.

If there are no open spaces then spin the spinner again. If your hand or foot is already on the required circle you must move it to a different spot.

Players cannot move their hand or feet that are not chosen by the spinner if they already occupy a circle on the game mat.
If at any point a player‚Äôs arm or knee touches the mat or if a player falls over than eliminate them from the game.

Players can remove an arm or knee if it‚Äôs necessary for moving a body part to another position on the mat.

Players must replace their hand or foot before completing their turn.

The last person standing wins the round.

6.32/8.43

2081,"This game is literally; a jack of all trades. 

Chapter 1: Community.
The community is one of the greatest but most controversial communities in all of gaming history. It is almost always known for it's modding, servers, and guides. Don't forget youtubers. This game is good for nearly all ages, solo, and it's very fun with friends. Any server you go in will always usually have nice people or will me fun.
Chapter 2: Modding
As stated before, the community is known for modding. The idea of a physics sandbox where you can be anything or shoot anything or make anything is amazing. It is easy to mod and I have created mods before. The servers do require some mods. 
Chapter 3: Physics
The physics in the game are outstanding, almost realistic. There's even a thing going around that garry's mod is good for physics in class. I agree.
This concludes my review.
The nextbots are funni.

2229,"Garry's mod is a sandbox with the only limitations being source engine map sizes and your imagination.
it can be anything you want it to be, a sandbox, a social hub or even other games from Call of Duty to Alien: Isolation. the places your able to explore with your seemingly endless amount of things to mess about with as well as a physics engine that still holds up relatively well to this day (just don't over-weld things otherwise your creation may begin flipping and attempting to eat you.). Garry's mod is made for everyone so load a map and get to doing anything (For better or for worse.)"

2322,yes
2323,"Garry's Mod is a weird game to review because it isn't a game in the traditional sense. It's more of a sandbox where you can create whatever random thing comes to mind. Much like how an artist's work can be interpreted in a number of ways so can Garry's Mod. To some it's a game about playing fun game modes like Prop Hunt or Trouble in Terrorist Town with friends, to others it's nothing more than spawning endless NPCs and killing them in more and more elaborate contraptions. Maybe you want to use Garry's Mod to create wacky machinimas with Walter White and Sponge Bob, ultimately this game is whatever you want it to be and there is no right answer to what Garry's Mod even is. So play it or rather experience it because it's truely unique and can be a massive amount of fun."

This game is old, but the graphics are still gold. The amount of in-game modeling, proping, and photography I've done too is just fun. This will always be in my top 10.

Lord Gaben, bless you for this game. I am but a insignificant man walking among the old gods of the PCMR."

Have a look around.
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found.
We've got mountains of content.
Some better, some worse.
If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first.

Welcome to Garrys Mod.
Come and take a seat.
Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?
There's no need to panic.
This isn't a test, haha.
Just nod or shake your head and we'll do the rest.

Welcome to Garrys Mod.
What would you prefer?
Would you like to fight for civil rights or tweet a racial slur?
Be happy
Be horny
Be bursting with rage
We got a million different ways to engage.

Welcome to Garrys Mod.
Put your cares aside
Here's a tip for straining pasta
Here's a nine-year-old who died
We got movies, and doctors, and fantasy sports
And a bunch of colored pencil drawings
Of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other.

Welcome to Garrys Mod.
Hold on to your socks
'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you a model of his cock
It is metallic and off-putting
He just sent you more
Don't act surprised, you know you like it, you whore

See a man beheaded
Get offended, see a shrink
Show us pictures of your children
Tell us every thought you think
Start a rumor, buy a broom
Or send a death threat to a boomer
Or DM a girl and groom her
Do a Zoom or find a tumor in your
Here's a healthy breakfast option
You should kill your mom
Here's why women never fuck you
Here's how you can build a bomb

Which Power Ranger are you?
Take this quirky quiz
Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids
Could I interest you in everything?
All of the time?
A little bit of everything
All of the time
Apathy's a tragedy
And boredom is a crime
Anything and everything
All of the time
Could I interest you in everything?
All of the time?
A little bit of everything

Apathy's a tragedy
And boredom is a crime
Anything and everything

2779,"Garry's mod is hard to ruin, YOU tailor the game to what YOU want it to be, it can be a puzzle game, it can be a shooter, it can just be hanging out with friends, I would recommend this game to anyone.

Gameplay: 10/10

Replayability: 10/10

Graphics: 7/10 (It is an old game, pretty dated graphics, you can get mods for that though)

Grind: 4/10 (The game does require you to take a lot of time to install addons)

Fun: 10/10

(I was gifted this game from someone I know, i didn't recieve it from the developers for free)"

2805,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

3100,"Garry's Mod is the result of a young Garry Newman, bored from his day job and curious about the new Source Engine's functionality in the early 2000s. Newman would develop little toys and tools inside the engine as a mod before spending more time working on the features. New versions were released, there was a whole weird situation where another similar mod competed with GMod before GMod blew it out of the water, everybody loved it and Valve suggested Newman put the mod up as a priced product. It's from there that Garry Newman would build the company known as Facepunch, birth a whole community around it, hire people to work there and start developing other games.
If you were born quite recently you've probably heard of their later work Rust, but anybody born about twenty years ago would learn of his existence through Garry's Mod. It's not hyperbole to say Garry's Mod has become a cultural phenomenon not just within the Steam community but also gaming in general.

Nothing has gotten close to what Garry's Mod has achieved mechanically and entertainment wise. Garry's Mod inspired literal generations of creators and united them in building strange contraptions, equally strange storytelling and gamemodes where you attempt to convince everyone else to kill each other and come out on top.
An endless sea of addons created for and by other players for either pure entertainment value, realism, roleplay or cinematic production, Garry's Mod is - currently - a ¬£7 sandbox with some slight hidden fees by way of two of the most critical resource pools Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life 2 being sold separately.
But if you can buy into Garry's Mod, if it appeals to you thanks to videos and you bother to spend some time rubbing your face against the workshop and playing with what comes with it, you'll get sucked in and you'll spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours messing around.

Garry's Mod isn't just a mod to Steam, it isn't just a game; it's a way of life. It's a form of expression. It's a giant canvas that spawned some of the greatest videos and memes from the early 2000s. It's an art form. Words alone do not do Garry's Mod justice. Let it take you out to dinner, take you to a hotel room, take each other's clothes off, and mess around. It'll treat you well and you'll wish you had done it sooner."
3101,"This sandbox is amazing. there is literally so much you can do in this game, from building insane vehicles to horror maps and then the mods. many mods."

3118,"This game is really fun on single player, I remember spending hours and hours just fucking around with millions of mods in singleplayer, but the multiplayer is a whole other type of fun (sometimes it is boring though), I have come across allot of fun and engaging servers, though the servers that seem to be the most fun and annoying are the RP servers, people seem to really just go on these RP servers to take out their anger on people because they are losers irl, but there are allot of times that RP (especially with friends) can be really fun... both in a serious way and a silly way.

This game does have allot of flaws which I cannot be bothered to name but because of that I give it a 7/10.

pretty good game."

3174,BEST GAME FOREVER
3175,"Good game... suggesting don't download TOO MANY mods when you or your friend is a low spec user if you happen to play with him, which happens most of the time so atleast there is a disable button in the ""Addons"" section when you hover on either of your mods.

Some roleplay servers in the multiplayer section can be.. questionable at times but some gamemodes are very good, and designed perfectly most of the times I play Garry's Mod. There are a lot of mods with no regret too, recommend playing it if you are willing to buy."

The game alone without any mods is good, this is one of the most revolutionary games it's you might say the best game ever, no matter if you get bored of it you will come back to it, the replay ability is always there, and you should try it out."

3186,It's amazing with mods.I recommend it to everyone who loves half life's mechanics but is bored of half life
3187,"Its a fun sandbox game, sort of similar to Minecraft. It has ALOT of props and NPCs. The game also has some half life things too. Its moddable, its community is nice and makes good mods. Play it, if ya want!"

I have around 157 hours, and from that experience I could say its very funny, entertaining and sometimes even horrific, some of the maps have an ambiance I cannot describe. I did also, make a lot of videos on this game. Me and a friend even re-created breaking bad, well.. Sort of. Its called Breaking Rat but still, its very funny.

3365,"Something about this funny little game tickled my brain the right way, and I ended up spending a little too much time on it. I've been playing Gmod since i was a kid, and even now it is my go-to game. Some of my favorite modes on this are Zombie Survival, Prop Hunt, and Players vs Boss Extreme. Through various servers, ive met some really good friends and had a lot of good times. In a world where game developers are charging 60 to 100 dollars for triple A games with little to no content, this stands out to me as the exact opposite. Theres no DLC crap, just 10 dollars for an amazing, timeless game with almost infinite possibilities. The best part? Its all moddable. If you dont like a certain sound effect or weapon model, you can get some really cool mods to replace those. This is absolutely one of my favorite games ever, and I urge you to give it a try.

3699,"Absolutely the best and also most frustrating experiences of my life lol (Both in a good way).  After playing this for 6 years and having over 2844 hours as of today, I have never been more drawn to a game. The possibilities are endless and the experience you can have is infinitely different with each game mode. The idea of not only being able to have a completely rich experience alone in single player creating artworks, or spending time online trying out different modes is incredible. Half life being a childhood memory closest to me, I can have all the enjoyment I want while also being nostalgic. This game is wonderful! If you have the opportunity to play it, please do so :)"

3717,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 18 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

I recommend TTT 2.0 Base, and then slowly add more and more add-ons to spice up each session.
Afterwards mix it up with a some prop hunt and guess who.
The most important bit is having a GM that can take care of all the add on errors, and setting up for a weekly session"

3910,"Standing here, I realize you were
Just like me trying to make history.
But who's to judge the right from wrong.
When our guard is down I think we'll both agree.
That violence breeds violence.
But in the end it has to be this way.
I've curved my own path, you've followed your wrath;
But maybe we're both the same.
The world has turned, and so many have burned.
But nobody is to blame.
It's tearing across this barren wasted land.
I feel new life could be born beneath
The blood stained sand."

4259,"Garry's Mod is a 2006 sandbox game developed by Facepunch Studios and published by Valve. The base game mode of Garry's Mod has no set objectives and provides the player with a world in which to freely manipulate objects. Other game modes, notably Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunt, are created by other developers as mods and are installed separately, by means such as the Steam Workshop. Garry's Mod was created by Garry Newman as a mod for Valve's Source game engine and released in December 2004, before being expanded into a standalone release that was published by Valve in November 2006. Ports of the original Windows version for Mac OS X and Linux followed in September 2010 and June 2013, respectively. As of September 2021, Garry's Mod has sold more than 20 million copies."

4328,"i did not like this game because it became to mainstream, you can see people do everything that you could ever even think about doing in this game in your entire lifetime. the game became boring before i could even play it, and that is just talking about the singleplayer. the multiplayer is so bad its toxic. no matter what server you join in nothing is taken seriously, and even if you do play along with the ""joke"" it's still a terrible game. in the average multiplayer server's nothing is fun because you have to abide to hundreds of useless rules for a stupid game. i could go on and on about why garry's mod is bad, but i wont because i don't have the time. then again i see people with thousands of hours on this game and it is mind blowing how brain rotted they are. i dislike gmod and the fan base. do not PAY for this game"

4411,"My father smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your children graduate, you have to stop immediately."". Tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your father put us through."". I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway."

4492,This game is pretty entertaining and fun to play with friends. Over the past few years we've had a good time exploring the maps and messing around with each other. Keep up with the good updates! Can't wait to see how it continues to progress.
4493,"a great old classic. nothing can get better than doing whatever you want! ok now get the game and leave this review.


















































































































































what did i just say











































































































why





















































































































































there are so many better things to do with your life than this.







































































im telling you right now. just go. nothing at the bottom of this.






































































































































im not even joking, there is, quite literally, nothing at the bottom.



































































































































































maybe.. go outside? read a book? watch tv? do literally anything other than scroll down?








































































































































YOU FOOL! YOU'VE UNLEASHED THE FORCE OF YGGDREELINA! STOP RIGHT NOW AND WE MIGHT LIVE!




































































































































not a roleplayer, i take it?


























































































































































...

























































































































[Congratulations! you have reached the bottom! redeem the code: CCDD-33YD-869S-QPRS for a free hat in tf2!]








































































































































































































*sigh* you wont quit, will you? even after my 11 children need you to go away so they can eat for the week...












































































































































































































welp. manipulation wont work, i guess. uhm, did you know that if you go to spotify and play the cantina song the volume slider will be replaced with a lightsaber? you cant have any other tabs open, though.


























































































































































ok fine, how about you go to the bottom? ill gladly let you do it. dont close it, your too far in now.





















































































































































































wasnt reverse psychology supposed to work?



































































































































































final warning: there is nothing at the bottom. i repeat, nothing. you will have wasted your time.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































nothing."

Imagine you get Garry's Mod, right? You thought it'd be a nice little sandbox game you have. Then you see how limited it is, right? So you uninstall the game and refund it. But that was before you figured out you could get quite literally almost ANYTHING from the workshop. In fact, you didn't even know the workshop EXISTED until this game.

Gmod hasn't failed to disappoint me yet. From making scenarios in my mind, to creating posed ragdolls and sharing them, to having some good ole' PvP or PvE with your friends. The stuff. Just. Continues. Almost everything you want in the game, is on the workshop. You can just keep getting more and more addons until you're content. Or, until your PC or Laptop can't handle it anymore.

The only downside on Garry's Mod is that some addons require certain games mounted to have them work. Like some require you to have Half-Life 2, and the episodes or Counter-Strike: Source or Half-Life: Source. (Which sucks by the way, the only reason you'd want to get it is to mount it to the game for the maps.)

If you're still on the edge about buying this game, YOU CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING. (emphasis on the almost) This is one of my most played games on Steam because of the variety you can get from it. And it's only $10.

Okay, if you're STILL not convinced to get the game, or you're not just that kind of sandbox kind of guy, and yeah, sandbox can get boring sometimes but there isn't just a sandbox game-mode. There's Murder Mystery, Prop Hunt, The Floor Is Lava, Guess Who, etc. 

Easily one of my favorite games to play. 9/10"

4837,"Doom 64 is a first-person shooter game by Midway Games. It was first released for the Nintendo 64 in 1997, as the second spin-off game in the Doom series after Final Doom (1996), and the fourth game in the series overall. A remastered port was developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks for Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2020, and for Stadia in May 2020.

Doom 64 was developed from 1994 by Midway Studios San Diego under supervision of id Software, the main developer of the Doom franchise, and was tentatively titled Doom: The Absolution. It has a customized version of the Doom engine, enabling new kinds of level geometry, and dynamic colored lighting. It has new sprite graphics for weapons and monsters.

It received positive reviews from critics, praising its graphics, level design, soundtrack, and general atmosphere, with some criticizing the lack of new gameplay elements compared to the previous games of the series. It gained a cult following, with several fan-made PC source ports and mods."

For centuries Garry sat in his labyrinth waiting for his chance to mod the world into a chaos of Lamp Shades and TF2 ragdolls. 10/10 Recommend."

4990,"We may not have anything like the ""Oasis"" from ""Ready Player One"" yet, but imo, this is the next best thing. This game will someday be placed amongst the stars next to the likes of Pong, Super Mario Brothers, Super Smash Brothers:Melee, Halo 3, and Team Fortress 2 as one of the greatest video games of all time. Even if you've never played it yourself, you know what this damn game is, and you know why it has such a high mass appeal.

Why such high praise? You can do almost anything you want, and you are only limited by your hard-drive capabilities, what's available on the workshop through Steam, and your imagination. What more do I need to say to?"

5226,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

5289,Garry mod is one of the best game you g√∫y should try it out
5290,"Garry's Mod is an open-world sandbox game, where you choose how you want to play. Unlike other games, there are no preset goals or story mode for you to follow, but it plays like a first-person shooter. You can generate hundreds of thousands of objects, such as non-playable characters, props, or ragdolls and have them interact with each other in all sorts of silly ways. The availability of the Steam Workshop allows for extra replayability and gives players room to expand and create beyond their wildest imaginations."

5661,"It was Oct. 18, 1851, when Herman Melville‚Äôs Moby-Dick; or, The Whale was first published. Though it was not an immediate hit, and Melville didn‚Äôt live to see the fame his book would achieve, it would eventually become one of American literature‚Äôs most famous and beloved works of genius. The critic Lewis Mumford would call it ‚Äúone of the supreme poetic monuments of the English language,‚Äù and it would inspire adaptations from cinema to emoji literature. Today, because the work is in the public domain, it is easier to read the original than ever before; it can be found online in countless places. Here, get started with the first chapter.‚ÄîTIME Staff-ME"

5929," That's how I know that I'm in the studio with the Doggy
In Californ-E, 'cuz my homie from Long Beach
Always got that bomb weed, that's why I feel a calm breeze
Every time I palm trees (get it) just like that blonde bleach
I went platinum, then so did my albums, Calvin's turning me into a zombie
Cuz these buds are like The Hulk, they're twice the size that his arm be (his zombie)
And that is some strong green
Got a contact, my contact lenses are foggy, I might end up in Walgreen's
Pharmacy with my arm asleep gone off lean mixed with Dramamine
I will treat Paula Dean like a fuckin' human pinball machine
Bouncin' balls off her tonsils, if ya'll are seekin' the smoke I got all the weed
I am a walking motherfuckin' Marijuana leaf
And I'm here to stay
My reign's so definite (deaf in it) my longevity needs a hearing aid, still wearing Hanes
T-shirts I done bodied some features with legendary names
Was there when Dre turned the Chronic to monetary gain
'Cause dope is addictive just like they call it marijuana, cause like marriage, you wanna, marry Jane
It's like you and Spiderman feel the very same
My adversaries came
But these little degenerates are my lineage, when it comes to pockets weren't many if, any as skinny as mine bitch, I was penniless
Now I'm plenty rich, and the shit don't make any sense (cents) I was in a motherfucking pinch like a titty twist
Now I'm sitting as pretty as each penny is, while I'm penning this in the lab on you guinea pigs
I'm finna' fool, I'm in effect, gimmie the semi and when I pull the big guns out
That trigger pull it until the motherfuckin' shit runs out of bullets
Somebody better call an ambulance
You live, it will be miraculous, I got more hits than a contract killer
Like caterpillars that don't got antennas, other words I don't got no god damn fillers (feelers)
Mt. Westmore, you did not plan for this- from Detroit all the way to Los Angeles
[Chorus: Eminem]
Put your doobies high, if you reside in 213
Let's see them blunts raised
Whether you Eastside or Westside of the 313
Let's see them guns blaze

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Make money moves like the matrix
Make more mount motivation
Roll up, more meditation
I'm watching the moves that you make might wanna stick to the basics
Military mindset, locked in, cocked in, making sure the mission is profitable
Ain't no mission impossib-ble
One phone call and my monsters will go
Dump phones, hop in a Mazda and go
Fuck that, y'all stay
Ni  ga I'm finna go
Think you slick, boy this Crip
You ain't ready to take it where I'm finna go
Mafia rules
You making a mockery, me a monopoly
Speak on my flow, my ni  ga I'm mopping 'em
Slept on my flo' now ni  gas is copying
Ni  gas be opping through all this opulence
Give me a task, I conquer it
This ain't the time for pondering
You ni  gas is slandering this real shit ni  gas be honoring
On god
You looking for followers and not watching my ni  gas that's following
Ni  ga fuck them likes
I'm like like what, like my ni  ga young Problem
East side, East up
My ni  ga Eminem woke the beast up
Let ya'll ride now a ni  ga want it back like the lease up
Think it's a game you gone see sum
Ain't no peace, you'll be missing a piece of ya
Ni  gas popped off, now sheets on 'em
Mama all mad, kids all sad, damn my bad
Send a few coins to the coroner
Please make a sweet for 'em
Ni  ga I don't hop on tracks I leap on 'em
In the fields with the cleats on 'em
Steve Job of the cannabis mob
In due time, ni  ga knew it be mine
Suge knew I'd go platinum the minute I signed
If you're looking for the facts, I'm the ni  ga to find
Young ni  ga sold crack in the middle of pine
To being the face of this cripping
Long Beach, these seas is different
4 man with the put on
Still getting bread with the ni  gas I put on
Yea, yea
I Put my hood on
Shit got cold I put my hood on
Yea, yea
Marshall and Calvin, both from the gutter like public housing
Now we both performing for 100's of thousands
Wearing no makeup, but we still be clowning muthafuckas!
[Chorus: Eminem]
Put your doobies high, if you reside in 213
Let's see them blunts raised
Whether you Eastside or Westside of the 313
Let's see them guns blaze

5973,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

6410,"The review i made before was bad because i only focused on the stuff you could do with nextbots. You can do a LOT more.
Do you wanna kill people? You can do that. Do you wanna build something? You can do that.
You can do absolutely EVERYTHING. No limits on what you can do. (unless you're in a darkrp server, which if you are, may god have mercy on your soul.) I absolutely do not regret buying this for my birthday and you should buy it too."

6433,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

As I was building something, I started noticing several people dying at once on the kill indicator. What the hell could do that? Well, i'm here to tell you.

This man had made a giant penis out of plywood, and through his engineering genius, used wiremod to make it to where not only would this penis rapidly approach other players, but it would kill people. the creator was dubbed ""Dicklord"" and ended up fleeing somewhere.

The mods weren't on, so Dicklord's creation was on a rampage, cockslapping people to death.

People managed to lure it into that big white room, and seal it off. We could hear it. It was angry.


Never before have I heard grown men scream like women and fly away at the prospect of a hostile penis. Nobody knows whatever happened to Dicklord though. Some say he decided to write a steam review.

‚ÄúIt brings back the silly glee of unbridled experimentation, intuitive learning and playful social interactions that most of us haven't experienced since childhood. For that, it's essential.‚Äù

ABOUT THIS GAME
Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.

You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day.

If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.
Beyond the Sandbox
The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide & Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties.

We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: it‚Äôs all free.

Please note: Some multiplayer servers and game-modes might require you to own other games - such as Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2.

6683,"man i love this game, it was really worth the 10 bucks lol."
6684,"you can do evreything
"
6685,
6686,I stopped playing for a year and half of the mods I used either got deleted from the workshop or banned due to modders injecting malware into their mods.
6687,"Love this game so much, if you want a real life experience i recommend you play dark rp on here. The little kids robbing you and if you give them the money they still kill you, this is a nice touch to bump up the realism; 10/10 would recommend to my dead gold fish."
6688,"This game is about as fun as letting a group of alligators tear your limbs off one by one, and probably a better social experience compared to it's spastic community of Dorrito-munching pedophiles."
6689,"A great game that can drag on for 2 or even 3 hours. A lot of creative people who create wonderful modifications and infrequent, but pleasant updates make the game better and better."
6690,its really really fun and it specially when making yt rps and all ya have to do to get mods is click on workshop and then just find a mod that u like but its better to just watch a yt vid of ppl show casing mods so like then ur able to see if u like the mod and its also easier anyways thats all ive got to say
6691,its great if you get a bunch of your friends together to play
6692,perfect game
6693,Who the fuck is Garry? Why doesn't he share his mod? i NEED to know.
6694,Best game 10/10

6741,WHO IS GARRY
6742,"Like fps? There are mods for it.
Like tardisses and other random stuff? There are mods for it.
Wanna play the floor is lava with your friend, you have 10 bucks and a computer and your friend does too and has steam, and your mom doesnt like the idea of playing the floor is lava in the house? Use those garry's mod gamemodes. If you like like any game ever and have a spare computer you have some games on with steam and have 10 dollars, BUY GARRYS MOD its neat. Why shouldnt you like it? Its an AEINCHENT game but the modding scene for garrys mod, the main focus, is still going on, churning content like a gift that keeps on giving. Please do not get this game just for Gmod's vrmod, TRUST ME there are way better things to want garrys mod for"

6907,"'Garry's mod' is one of the most fun games on steam if not the best. The source engine it runs on still holds up to this day, and the 2 maps the game comes with are perfect for this game. the Toolgun, Physgun and Camera are still solid inclusions for this amazing title.

even without the source engine and compatibility with other source games, Garry's mad (also known as 'Gmod') has a 'steam workshop' page to download user created addons to make a cool sandbox game into a delightful combination of icons across the internet. its not just raggdolls or props you can add, you can download textures, more tools for you tool gun, entities, weapons, npcs, maps and much, much more!

but if you look in the other direction completely ignore the workshop the content in Gmod is very detailed, as you can pose a ragdoll's face and hand with some tools from the toolgun and pose there whole body with the iconic pysgun. The camera allows for detailed screenshots and the compatibility of other source games lets you pose iconic characters in there respective locations or even not so familiar places, all the tools are at your disposal.

In conclusion, Garrys mod is one of the best games on steam, if not the best. The combination of built in tools with the other game and workshop assets create a colourful, unique and memorable experience. 7/10 to much water

6929,"WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning! Once there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More- government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up a special room to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died. Now every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death. Now send this to ten other profiles on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best of your life

6932,played for a couple hours good game
6933,"Fun, you can do anything you want"
6934,"By itself, the game is pretty bland. Just a sandbox game with a few maps and a few weapons and a few NPCs. Nothing really that big. What makes GMod GMod, though, is its incredibly extensive addon community. There's an addon for pretty much anything. Want to turn NPCs into jelly? You can do that. Want to fight off hordes of zombies using Modern Warfare weapons? You can do that. Want to parkour around huge maps without a care in the world? You can do that. Want to animate skits with memorable characters? You can do that. The sky's quite literally the limit with GMod. You can do pretty much anything you want, pretty much however you want, and that's what makes it so great. This is probably the game I've sunk the most amount of time into, and you'll see why if you give it a try. (Although they still haven't made an MX ragdoll/playermodel. C'mon guys, I need MX.)"

Being able to customize a game to the point where it isn't even the same as the base game is astonishing, and being able to do this with up to 16-32 people private and public servers is just as great. Highly recommend to those who are looking for a sandbox game."

7147,"One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

7313,"Chair

A chair is a type of seat, typically designed for one person and consisting of one or more legs, a flat seat and a back-rest. They may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics.

Chairs vary in design. An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and features a mechanism that lowers the chair's back and raises into place a footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.

Etymology
Chair comes from the early 13th-century English word chaere, from Old French chaiere (""chair, seat, throne""), from Latin cathedra (""seat"").

History

The chair has been used since antiquity, although for many centuries it was a symbolic article of state and dignity rather than an article for ordinary use. ""The chair"" is still used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom[6] and Canada,[7] and in many other settings. In keeping with this historical connotation of the ""chair"" as the symbol of authority, committees, boards of directors, and academic departments all have a 'chairman' or 'chair'.[8] Endowed professorships are referred to as chairs.[9] It was not until the 16th century that chairs became common.[10] Until then, people sat on chests, benches, and stools, which were the ordinary seats of everyday life. The number of chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most examples are of ecclesiastical, seigneurial or feudal origin.[citation needed]

Chairs were in existence since at least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt (c. 3100 BC). They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today's chairs ‚Äì chair seats were sometimes only 10 inches (25 cm) high.[11] In ancient Egypt, chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions, the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it.[11]

The average Egyptian family seldom had chairs, and if they did, it was usually only the master of the household who sat on a chair. Among the better off, the chairs might be painted to look like the ornate inlaid and carved chairs of the rich, but the craftsmanship was usually poor.[11]

The earliest images of chairs in China are from 6th-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs at that time was rare. It was not until the 12th century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Christian missionaries in the 7th century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is no longer common to sit at floor level.[12]

In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a privilege of state and became a standard item of furniture for anyone who could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. Almost at once the chair began to change every few years to reflect the fashions of the day.[13]

Thomas Edward Bowdich visited the main Palace of the Ashanti Empire in 1819, and observed chairs engrossed with gold in the empire.[14] In the 1880s, chairs became more common in American households and usually there was a chair provided for every family member to sit down to dinner. By the 1830s, factory-manufactured ‚Äúfancy chairs‚Äù like those by Sears, Roebuck, and Co. allowed families to purchase machined sets. With the Industrial Revolution, chairs became much more available.[15]

The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair,[citation needed] moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs.[16] The recliner became a popular form, at least in part due to radio and television. In the 1930's, stair lifts were commercially available to help people suffering from Polio and other diseases to navigate stairs.[17]

The modern movement of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair (originally called the Hardoy chair), bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair that turns. It also introduced the first mass-produced plastic chairs such as the Bofinger chair in 1966.[18] Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated into the chair enabled adjustable chairs, especially for office use. Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.[19]

Materials

Chairs can be made from wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, multiple materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally contain a headrest. Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe.[20]

In rare cases, chairs are made out of unusual materials, especially as a form of art or experimentation. Raimonds Cirulis, a Latvian interior designer, created a volcanic hanging chair that is handmade out of volcanic rock.[21][22] Peter Brenner, a Dutch-born German designer, has created a chair made from lollipop sugar ‚Äì 60 pounds (27 kg) of confectioners' sugar.[23]

Design and ergonomics
Chair design considers intended usage, ergonomics (how comfortable it is for the occupant),[24] as well as non-ergonomic functional requirements such as size, stacking ability, folding ability, weight, durability, stain resistance, and artistic design.

Seat height

Ergonomic design distributes the weight of the occupant to various parts of the body. This is done by having an easily adjustable seat height.[25] A seat that is higher results in dangling feet and increased pressure on the underside of the knees (""popliteal fold""). It may also result in no weight on the feet which means more weight elsewhere. A lower seat may shift too much weight to the ""seat bones"" (""ischial tuberosities""). Gas springs are attached to the body of the chair in order to give height adjustment and more comfort to the user.

Some chairs have foot rests. Around 15% of women and 2% of men need foot rests, even at the 16-inch (41 cm) chair height.[26] A stool or other simple chair may have a simple straight or curved bar near the bottom for the sitter to place their feet on.

Actual chair dimensions are determined by measurements of the human body or anthropometric measurements. The two most relevant anthropometric measurement for chair design is the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length.

For someone seated, the popliteal height is the distance from the underside of the foot to the underside of the thigh at the knees. It is sometimes called the ""stool height"". The term ""sitting height"" is reserved for the height to the top of the head when seated."

7557,"This is the first game you should get ever if you are new to steam... or even old to steam; whatever, the point is that this is a timeless classic. if you enjoy building stuff, destroying creatures, or even destroy your own buildings you have created (if you are into that sort of thing I guess). This is one of those rare cases that this is truly a game with no limits thanks to its modding team. The only people I don't think this game can please are people that want an objective in the games they play, if they want that they will have to stick with the multiplayer section of the game such as prop hunt, murder, and death run to name some of the mainstream multiplayer games.

this is the best game on steam hands down, you cant go wrong with this one."

7572,"It starts with One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

That kind of replay value makes for some amazing content, like animations, maps, addons that literally add a sentient, moving gravity gun that constantly tells you to pick it up in Alyx's voice, etc.

Current topside temperature is 93 degrees, with an estimated high of one hundred and five. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times. This train is inbound from Level 3 Dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Sector C, you will need to return to the Central Transit Hub in Area 9 and board a high security train.

7706,"it starts with one. One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

7728,best sandbox game ever created
7729,"The if not most entertaining game i have played on Steam. Running on a highly-modifiable source engine, you can't run out of ideas. It's almost scary how you can play an almost completely different game out of ad-dons straight from the workshop. The only complaints are missing textures, and some don't come included in most ad-dons. This game is 5 stars to me. Playing it with friends is no boredom with custom game-modes for community servers, especially when you can make your own ad-dons. The best of it all is the Sandbox mode. The biggest crossover you can do awaits here. Hope the review was enough. This game is worth every penny."

7864,"Como uma pessoa que faz muito sexo o tempo todo, posso dizer que esse jogo √© 100% parecido com fazer sexo com uma mulher, como sempre fa√ßo. Obviamente, este jogo n√£o me excitou. N√£o sou gay, fa√ßo sexo demais com mulheres de verdade para ficar mais de 15 minutos nesse jogo. Por outro lado, gostaria de recomendar este jogo para pessoas que n√£o fazem sexo (n√£o como eu porque fa√ßo muito sexo com mulheres, muito) como se houvesse uma mulher nua l√° e ela est√° nua. Ela tamb√©m se parece com uma das minhas v√°rias namoradas com quem fiz muito sexo. J√° fiz muito sexo. Eu tamb√©m sou muito bonito e as mulheres SEMPRE querem fazer sexo comigo porque eu sou muito musculoso e bonito e muito bom em videogames. Todas as minhas amigas dizem que sou muito bom em sexo, em jogar videogame e em ser bonito. Uma das minhas amigas me pediu para fazer sexo com ela, mas eu disse que ela estava jogando um jogo sexual e ela come√ßou a chorar e se tornou l√©sbica e se matou porque eu n√£o fiz sexo com ela. Fa√ßo sexo com mulheres, n√£o com homens, n√£o sou gay. Eu sou muito legal e bonito, ent√£o as meninas sempre querem fazer sexo comigo porque eu sou muito legal e sexy. Meu p√™nis √© muito grande. Todas as minhas amigas gostam do meu p√™nis porque ele √© muito grande e eu sou muito bom no sexo e eu sou, eu fa√ßo muito sexo. Eu tamb√©m sou muito bonito e sexy e fa√ßo muito sexo.

7896,if you play this alone without mods or additional maps its got about 10-20 hours of game content but with onilne and mods i know it could have well over 100 hours i would be careful not to get addicted. :)
7897,i can literally shove a microwave up my ass! great game
7898,a lot of fun and easy to install mods .Its the game i got first on my pc 10 out of 10
7899,Classic game = Good game. Makes me feel like a discord mod with my fingers deep in a cheeto bag
7900,"i strapped several bombs to a chair and blew up my fictional wife and kids with it. this game has had an impact on my life like no other game has. my life will never be the same. im afraid to keep playing because of what i will do to those around after playing. this game is an ever-growing tumor in my brain, infecting everything it touches and destroying the furthest reaches of my mind. i am alone no longer. 10/10 would buy again.

7928,the only game where smol ame can murder ace visconti from dead by daylight using a whole ass tree as a baseball bat
7929,This game is phenomenal. I love committing war crimes.
7930,"This is one of those games which is a little hard to define, well for a dumb dumb such as myself. What I can tell you is that this is a fun little game and it seems that the only limits are people's warped imaginations. Like probably many I noodled in the sandbox, spawned a 100 zombies and barricaded myself In a room trying to survive. But this soon got boring, and that's when I discovered the servers, and the power of RP.
This to my knowledge is one of the few games where you can role play as a stormtrooper, a prostitute and a German soldier depending on what server you find yourself in. This is where the enjoyment in the game is for me. The ability mess around with friends and infiltrate organisations and sabotage them was the peak this game has to offer, and the level of interaction is rarely matched. Even as I write this I want to boot it up and role play as a wizard and interact with the lovely people of the internet. That being said I'd give this a 8/10"
7931,"oh god where do i begin with this, this game is my childhood and so much more and this game has giving me so many good and bad memories and i have met new and old friends and i had a great time playing this game till the end but as of now i have went on and i see that its starting to finally died out since theres no ww2 servers or ww1 anymore, no fnaf (for the best) anyways god im finna miss this game after a few years from now once everyone stops playing it but for now im finna get back in to it and see what i can make of it till the end, Love you garrys mod and the things you have done for not just me but for all of us <3"

Game is good overall and you will have a blast with friends."
7942,Its a fun game where you can do what you want and download addons but to play online you need to download all of sombody elses addons or it doesn't really work

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock"

8082,"In my opinion, Garry's Mod is a game that everyone should have in their steam libraries. It's the perfect sandbox game in my opinion, and can easily be modified to any experience you desire; you want a Mirror's Edge type parkour game? Download Wheatley's Parkour aswell as some random parkour maps, Or maybe you want a horror game? Easy, Download the LIDAR mod or maybe some nextbots if that's more your style. Want a game with the customisation of the Call Of Duty games but don't want the shitty gameplay and price tag that comes with it? Absolutely, I'd download the ArcCW Mods, with customisation that simply blows through the roof."

This is one of the first games that I purchased on my steam account and one that I paid full price for. I have never once opened up a sandbox world or a game of prop hunt without having loads of fun (on the occasion that all of my mods loaded correctly). You can run this game on a cheese stick and it'll work fine. Would recommend."

8130,"I remember when I was about 5 years old, I used to watch my brother play Gmod with his friends. And I remember nearly every single mod he had. Since at the time I had just about nothing to play video games on I would always go into his room and watch him play it and beg to use his PC when he wasn't (and as always he wouldn't let me use it). Today I still don't have a Gaming PC like he did. Infact I've had quite the hassle just setting this up. I am literally playing this on a Mac that wouldn't let me play the game so I had to use a Windows 10 portal so I can play source games.


 Long story short, I have a soft spot for this game. And I always will. Buy this game, its a living piece of history. 

(just look up war of the servers)"

This game is like putting an attention-deficit 3-year-old in a nuclear-equipped sandbox and then leaving him unattended. Not only is he now glowing sickly green and is able to speak latin in reverse, but anything within a 3.2 mile radius of him has been sterilized from existance.

10/10 would be sterilized again"

8223,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

8254,"A quick background story on 1942rp

After World War I ended, Germany experienced great political turmoil. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) imposed harsh terms on Germany, which had lost the war. In addition, the country saw the overthrow of its monarchy. In its place was the new Weimar Republic, a democratic government. Racist and antisemitic groups sprang up on the radical right. They blamed Jews for Germany‚Äôs defeat in the war. These groups opposed the Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles. They were against democracy, human rights, capitalism, socialism, and communism. They advocated to exclude from German life anyone who did not belong to the German Volk or race.

In September 1919, Hitler attended a meeting of one of these groups in Munich, the German Workers‚Äô Party. This small political organization sought to convert German workers away from Marxist Socialism. At the meeting, Hitler‚Äôs public speaking skills attracted notice. He was recruited to a leading role.

In 1920, H***er changed the Party‚Äôs name to the National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party. ‚ÄúNational Socialism‚Äù was a racist and antisemitic political theory. It had been developed in Hitler‚Äôs native Austria as the antithesis of Marxist Socialism and Communism. Marxists, for example, advocated for the global solidarity of the world‚Äôs workers. They called for the abolition of nation states. National Socialists, however, sought to unify members of the German Volk in complete obedience to the state. They called for a strong state to lead the ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù in the ‚Äúracial struggle‚Äù against ‚Äúinferior races,‚Äù especially the Jews. 

H***er formulated a 25-point program in 1920. The program would remain the Party‚Äôs only platform. Among its points, it rejected the Versailles settlement. It also demanded to unify all people of German ‚Äúblood.‚Äù The program called for a Greater Germany ruled by a strong central state. The country was to acquire new lands and colonies. The program would deny citizenship and rights to all non-Germans, particularly Jews. 

The Nazi Party grew steadily under Hitler‚Äôs leadership. It attracted support from influential people in the military, big business, and society. The Party also absorbed other radical right-wing groups. In 1921, Hitler organized a paramilitary force called the Storm Troops (Sturmabteilung, SA). SA members were war veterans and members of the Free Corps (Freikorps), paramilitary units that battled left-wing movements in postwar Germany.

On November 8-9, 1923, Hitler and his followers staged a failed attempt to seize control of the Bavarian state. They believed this would trigger a nationwide uprising against the Weimar Republic. 

The uprising began in the B√ºrgerbr√§u Keller, a Munich beer hall. World War I hero General Erich Ludendorff, Hitler, and other Nazi leaders led the march. About 2,000 Nazis and sympathizers followed. City police clashed with the marchers, leading to an exchange of gunfire. Four police officers and 14 Nazis were killed. After the putsch, German authorities banned the Nazi Party. Several of its leaders were arrested and charged with high treason. Hitler was convicted and sentenced to 5 years in jail. After only eight months, he was released for ‚Äúgood behavior.‚Äù 

While in prison, H***er began dictating his book, Mein Kampf. The book set out his world view and personal mission. H***er believed he was destined to lead the German ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù in the battle between races to control land and resources. He would achieve this by creating a racially pure state and conquering Lebensraum (living space) in the Soviet Union. Further, he would destroy the Germans' ultimate enemy, the Jews, and their most dangerous weapon: Judeo-Bolshevism. Mein Kampf was published after H***er‚Äôs release. It did not become a bestseller in Germany until after he became Chancellor.

8337,"Good sandbox game, especially on public servers where for the first second your in the backrooms running from nextbots, then the next second your hearing fapping while your doing chair sex."
8338,"Over 2000 Hours Played and one of the first games i bought on this steam account i have to say this game is absolutely amazing, going back to when i bought this game i was only 14 years old (28 now) and there just was not another game like garrys mod out there at the time, the level of creativity you can bring to this game is outstanding even today in 2022, now saying that i have a few downsides that i have noticed over many years of playing Garry's Mod, it is my firm belief that certain players have no business owning/renting a server you have kids using their parents credit cards and renting their very own server, I have,  and im very sure a lot of other players currently playing this game have been victims of vicious unwarranted admin abuse by these children and sadly there is really no way to tell what kind of admins/owners your going to run into until you find a server and try it out unfortunately that means possibly wasting your valuable time progressing on these servers until the owners and admins get on and seeing what they are like... It Would honestly be nice to see Official Garry's Mod Servers for Every game mode (Sandbox, Prophunt, DarkRP, Sledbuild, Spacebuild, ect) it would cut down on the time wasted searching for a server in your favorite Gamemode with honest respectable players that just want to have fun and enjoy playing the game, and possibly a way to Verify the age of the owners of the servers (Like 18+ only servers for adults like myself that want to play with mature adults who also love Garry's Mod without the getting cussed out, RDM, Propkilled and DMs blown up by some immature child whose parents clearly need to beat more.)  All in All i Would say on a scale of 1-10 i would give this game a 8/10 just because of the things ive mentioned, there is alot of great memories to be made in this game and alot of good times to be had aswell, and very much like life and trying to find good friends you kind of have to waive through all the d*$&s to get there, but once you do you will know exactly what i mean =) I Truly Hope this review helps anyone out there on the fence about purchasing this game or maybe for someone who purchased this game and has not really gotten the best experience out of it because of the reasons i mentioned above."

8609,"Most excellent game.  Could do with a search bar in the addons repository.  It might already have one and I might just not see it.)  There's crashing, but the crashing might be because I'm on a Linux {inb4 interject for a moment} system and I'm using way too many addons or something like that."

8715,"Personally I love sandbox games and Gmod is one of them. You can build structures, cars, guns, aircraft, and possibly much more. Additionally, with the Wiremod addon it provides so many more opportunities for players to create literally anything they want. Moreover, if building isn't your thing, Gmod also has a massive multiplayer community with a variety of gamemodes.

8815,it is more fun with friends/players
8816,"Very First game on Steam that I bought, it is the whole reason why I have a Steam account. There are a lot of sandbox games out there that are good, but this just takes the cake! There is a wide variety of characters to pick, tons of user made mods for the game, and you can even make small tiny animations in it if you have the time! There are many mods spanning from Player Models (Avatars), Weapons, Maps, Player Sounds, Pill Packs, Vehicles, and more! There are also plugins you can add from the Workshop, some that can change the way Weapons look or make better different textures to your liking! This is a great Sandbox game that Valve has made, it's much better than most sandboxes! And for only $10 as well! If you can find this on sale you could probably end up playing $6.00 for this! The game can run on basically any PC from around 2009-Present, as it was made back in 2006. Overall, the game is fantastic and amazing! 10/10 Never gets boring."

8824,"My mum (82F) told me (12M) to do the dishes (16) but I (12M) was too busy playing Fortnite (3 kills) so I (12M) grabbed my controller (DualShock 4) and threw it at her (138kph). She fucking died, and I (12M) went to prison (18 years). While in prison I (12M) incited several riots (3) and assumed leadership of a gang responsible for smuggling drugs (cocaine) into the country. I (12M) also ordered the assassination of several celebrities (Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Jeffrey Epstein) and planned a terrorist attack (9/11). Reddit, AITA?"

Note: When Downloading Mods, make sure you look at the REQUIRED section to the right edge of the screen n a little below the screenshot box. Also, if there isn't anything in or even a required box, a little reading in the paragraphs below the scvreenshots box will help as well.

8985,"garry's mod is, in my opinion, the ultimate sandbox tool. with so much variety with the Gmod workshop, there are practically no limits to what you can do with this title. on top of that, it can even run on low end PCs, so even those who cannot afford a high end gaming PC can enjoy what this game has to offer. the only negative i have on this title is that textures are missing sometimes. 

overall: 10/10 would definitely reccomend."
8986,WASTED 10 HOURS OF MY LIFE
8987,"FUN
"
8988,"This game is very fun but can get slightly boring after awhile. The mods decide to change that up and make the game really fun and replayable. It doesn't really take that good of a computer to run. I'd give this an 8.7/10. Playing it with friends is even better, if you have friends that is. Definitely recommend this game if you're into sandbox games."

9284,Very fun especially with friends
9285,"I think this game is more for the ogs of steam and the creators on social media instead of the newer players, the game just throws you in and leaves the community to tell you what to do and a lot of the community is not very friendly to the new players, you also need multiple valve games to run this with no issues, for instance without cs most multiplayer server textures don't load. The community of this game is not as good as it used to be it feels more of a creative tool game for social media than a actual game to communicate with people and have fun. I know people who love gmod, its a very funny game, but I feel its lost some of its magic over the years. Imo it is not a game I could enjoy and people like me could enjoy."
9286,yes.
9287,"One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

9604,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

9700,"Now there's a standstill in the war, repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end, a few will transcend
They were under 25, and under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born, their enemies scorn
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!
J√§gers led the way, the pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained, advancement sustained
Lead through direct command, as they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks, and ravage their ranks
Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the Stormtroopers rise!
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored
As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation

9908,"The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

Hope this helps in your buying decision!"

10213,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
 	Cut to Barry's room, where he's picking out what to wear.
Barry	Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah, let's shake it up a little.
 	Barry uses honey from a dispenser to style his hair, rinse his mouth, and then applies it to his armpits.
Mom (Janet Benson)	(calling from downstairs:) Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry:	Coming! (phone rings) Oh, hang on a second. (adjusts his antennas into a headset) Hello?
Adam Flayman	(on the phone) Barry?
Barry:	Adam?
Adam:	Can you believe this is happening?
Barry:	I can't believe it. I'll pick you up. (hangs up, sharpens his stinger) Lookin' sharp. (flies downstairs)
Mom:	Barry, why don't you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those.
Barry:	Sorry. I'm excited.
Dad (Martin Benson):	Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.
Mom:	Very proud. (touches Barry's hair)
Barry:	Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mom:	Ah, you got some lint on your fuzz.
Barry:	Ow! That's me!
Dad:	Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Barry:	Bye! (flies off)
Mom:	Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
 	(Barry drives his car to pick up his classmate. Adam's outside his house, reading the Hive Today newspaper. The front page headline reads ""FRISBEE HITS HIVE ! Internet Down. Bee: 'I heard sound, then Wham-o!'"")
Barry:	Hey, Adam.
Adam:	Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry:	A little. It's a special day, finally graduating.
Adam:	Never thought I'd make it.
Barry:	Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school.
Adam:	Those were so awkward.
Barry:	Three days of college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam:	You did come back different.
 	(a bee calls out as they drive past)
Bee:	Hi, Barry.
Barry:	Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam:	Hey, did you hear about Frankie?
Barry:	Yeah.
Adam:	You goin' to his funeral?
Barry:	No, I'm not goin' to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.
Adam:	Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
 	(They make various noises as the car goes up and down some hills and does a loop on the road.)
A & B	Woah! Oooooooh!
Adam:	I love this incorporating an amusement park right into our regular day.
Barry:	I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
 	(They arrive, fly in and take their seats.)
Barry:	Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry:	Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam:	We are!
Barry:	Bee-men.
Adam:	Amen!
A & B:	Hallelujah! (bumping each other) Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Announcer:	Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
 	Dean Buzzwell walks onto the stage and taps the microphone.
Buzzwell:	Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... (presses a button to change the timer on the podium from 9:00 to 9:15) ...9:15. And that concludes our graduation ceremonies.
 	(Students cheer, throw their caps into the air as helmets are placed on their heads.)
Buzzwell:	And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Barry:	Are we gonna pick our jobs today?
Adam:	I heard it's just orientation.
Barry:	Huh. Woah. Heads up! Here we go.
 	(The stands for Winger University the students are sitting in begin converting into tram seating.)
Female announcer:	Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (flies down to go in the tram as it starts moving and repeats it in Spanish:) Mantenga sus manos y antenas dentro del tranv√≠a en todo momento.
Barry:	Wonder what it's going to be like?
Adam:	A little scary. (he and Barry mimic shivering and making scared noises)
Trudy, the Honex tour guide:	Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry:	This is it!
everyone:	Wow. (tram moves into the factory floor)
Barry:	Wow.
Trudy:	We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
everyone:	Honey!
 	(Tour guide grabs a beaker of honey as they drive by and tosses it to the group, which bounce it around towards the back.}
Adam:	That girl was hot.
Barry:	She's my cousin!
Adam:	She is?
Barry:	Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam:	Right. You're right.
Trudy:	At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
 	(Behind a display window, a bee puts on a helmet, then runs back and forth as levers holding a rolled-up magazine, flyswatter and a shoe move down to try hit him. He is hit by the magazine, dodges the flyswatter, but then hit by the boot and again by all three, followed by being sprayed with aerosol from two cans. He signals he's okay, but is flattened by the flyswatter, magazine and shoe converging to strike him together. He signals he's still okay by poking his arm up through a hole in the flyswatter and giving another thumbs up. The tram riders applaud.)
Adam:	Ooh. What do you think he makes?
Barry:	Not enough.
Trudy:	And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Barry:	Wow, what does that do?
Trudy:	Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
 	(A Krelman worker waves and Adam waves back.)
Adam:	Uh, uh, can anyone work on the Krelman?
Trudy:	Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life.
Barry:	The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam:	What's the difference?
Barry:	Huh?
Trudy:	And you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. Wooh!
Barry:	So you'll just work us to death?
Trudy:	We'll sure try.
 	(Everyone laughs while Barry looks uncomfortable. The tram converts into a boat that flows down a log-flume style ramp with honey in it, then converts back to a wheeled tram at the end.)
 	(With the tour over, Adam and Barry head home. Adam jumps with excitement.)
Adam:	Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry:	""What's the difference?"" Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam:	Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry:	But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam:	Barry, why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
 	(a filling station attendant yells at a bee for putting the honey nozzle into his own mouth.)
Barry:	Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?
Adam:	Like what? Give me one example.
 	(both stop in the middle of an intersection. the traffic adjusts to drive around them.)
Barry:	I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer over speaker:	Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry:	Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam:	Wow.
 	(Pollen Jocks fly into the hive and land.)
Adam:	I've never seen them this close.
Barry:	They know what it's like to go outside the hive.
Adam:	Yeah, but some of them don't come back.
 	(two lady bees wave at the jocks and call out:)
Girl Bees	Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
 	(the pollen is removed from the jocks and collected into storage capsules marked ""Nectar"", then trucked away. A General flies over to welcome them.)
General:	You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
Barry:	I wonder where those g"
10214,"This game is very good. You can play with your friends (that you don't have) and yes. but lets talk about the fact that you don't have any friends. You can get friends but you are too lazy. and you play Singleplayer all the time, because nobody likes you and you're really weird. You smell bad. you act weird, and you are really poor. You probobaly cant even afford the game. So get a life, and get Gmod B)

10266,"The basis of Garry's Mod is rather bland. However, the amount amount of user generated content has made it so that Garry's Mod is a game with almost endless possibilities. You could spend years browsing through mods and only scratch the surface of what you can do.

10284,"No game will give you this much replay-ability for just $10 ($2.50-$5 on sale even). I have been playing Garry's Mod since 2012 which is a literal decade. The limitations of the engine it uses, source, are constantly pushed to provide more high definition content akin to recent games, and there is a daily surplus of content in the workshop for all users to explore."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

10736,"[Narrator]
There are gajillions of stories...



of mischief and fun,



but to keep things simple,



let's start with just one...



about a mom and two kids...



and a house and a hat...



that, oddly enough,



was worn by a cat.



But soon enough
we will get to all that.



In the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill,




a city is nestled...



that city is Anville.



- [Kid] Hurry up!
We'll miss the movie!
- Any more tutti-frutti?



I'll check.
Thanks!



[NarratorContinues]
It's a town that's not huge,
but quite big enough...



for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff,



from shoes and shirts...



and elongated ladders...



to sailboats and gibble-grated

berry-juice bladders.



[Horn Honks]



So ourstory begins
at the corner
ofMain and Montroob...



in the spotless
real estate offiice...



run by Hank Humberfloob.



[Woman]
Humberfloob Real Estate. How can
we make yourdreams come true?



[People Chattering]



What do you mean,
you're leaving?



You're a babysitter.
Babysitters don't leave. They sit.



Baby-leavers leave.
I'm sorry. I really
gotta go, Miss Walden.



Well, I need to come home
right away.



All right.
Thank you, Amy.
Sorry.



[Sighs]



Attention, everyone!
It's 9:02.




Staff meeting!
Staff meeting!



[All Gasping, Murmuring]
Look alive, everyone.!



First I'd like to
welcome aboard...



our newest member
of the Humberfloob family,



Jim McFlinnagan!



- Mr. Humberfloob,
I wanted to thank you...
- [All Gasping]



Fired.
I beg your pardon?




Fired.
B-But l...



Fired!



One, two, three,
four, fiive, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10!



As you know, tonight is
our bimonthly""meet and greet"" party.



Tonight's host is...
Joan Walden.



This is where people can
meet our real estate agents...



in an informal,
yet hygienic setting.



Mr. Humberfloob,
I have to get home to my kids.



Ah, yes.




Your children.



Joan, let me make this
perfectly clear.



If your house
is as messy as last time,



you're fiired!



[Employees Gasping,
Murmuring]



That's pretty clear,
Mr. Humberfloob.




Don't worry. I promise.



My kids'll be
on their best behavior.



Great.



[Phone Rings]
[Woman]
Humberfloob Real Estate.



How can we make
yourdreams come true?

Please hold.



[Narrator]
Lfyou leave Humberfloob's
and turn left onto Main,



three miles down
you'll fiind Lipplapper Lane,



a pleasant-enough street
in a pleasant-enough way...



where a neighbor greeted neighbor
with a neighborly""Hey.!""



Hey!
Hey!



Here the hedges were hedged,

the weeds were all weeded,



and lawns were mowed daily,



twice daily ifneeded.



And at the end
ofthis street,



in a house like any other,



something magical
would happen...



to a sisterand her brother.



[Barking]




[Barks]
Shh! Nevins!
Stealth mode.



Today's to-do list.



Number one:
Make to-do list.



Number two:
Practice coloring.



Number three:
Research graduate schools.



Number four:
Be spontaneous.



Number fiive:
Create lasting
childhood memories.



And numbersix:

Amend will.



What is he doing?



[Sighs]



[Whines]



[Beeps]



Number 10:
Make tomorrow's to-do list.



Ladies and gentlemen!
[Nevins Barking]



Nevins,
your attention, please.



You are about to witness
the third most spectacular stunt...



ever performed
under this roof!



Do you know how hard it's getting
to tell people that we're related?



Relax.
I'll put everything back.



[Whining]



And now,
for the indoor stair luge!



Indoor stair luge?




I'll have to add this one
to my list.



Go have no fun
somewhere else.



It... is... showtime.!



- [Whimpers]
- [Grunts]



Whoa.!



[Yelling]



- Aah!
- Yeah!



[Groans]



- [Woman] Oh, my word.!
- [Nevins Barking]



Nevins!



Nevins, come back.!



Hey, Mom. What's up?




You are so lucky
you didn't ruin this dress.



Mom, I know
you're angry,



but there's something
you need to know.



This was all Sally's fault.
Oh, really?



And how, exactly,
was it Sally's fault?



Give me a minute.
I'm workin' on it.



Save it, Conrad.



Why today? Why did you
have to pick today
to destroy the house?




You know
what's happening today.



I tried to tell him, Mom.



""Mom's throwing
a very important party,"" I said.



""All ofher important
clients will be here.""



But he went right ahead
and wrecked the house
and let Nevins get away.



Now, again, I hope
you're going to ground him.



Yes, Sally, for a week, but
that's none of your business.



Aweek?
Come on. Two days.



I asked you to do
one thing today, Conrad...




keep the house
clean.



Do you know how frustrating it is
that you're always doing
the exact opposite of what I say?



Knock, knock, knock.



[Growling]
Someone lose a dog?



I found him next door...



in my yard... again.




You are a saint.



And here I thought
you were only dating me
for my good looks.



Lucky us.
Larry Quinn is here.



Hey-a, sport.
Call me Lawrence.
Okay?



You rescued Nevins!
Thanks, Lawrence!



It was my pleasure, Sally.
Anything for my little princess.




Oh, I don't wanna be a princess.



In a constitutional monarchy
parliament has all the real power.



I see.
Okay, that's great.



Uh, look, pal, be a sport.



Why don't you go
tidy up the living room.
Okay...dude?



I don't have to listen to you, Larry.



Conrad,
do what Lawrence says.




Have you given some thought
about the Wilhelm Academy?



You mean the Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy forTroubled Youth?



That's the one, Joan.



I'm not sure
it's right for Conrad.



Oh, Joan, Joan.



Joan, Joan, Joan.



I have so much respect
foryou, Joan.




Single mother, careerwoman,
raising two children on your own,




and still fiinding time
to be the best darned
real estate agent in town.



I know how hard it is, Joan.



It is hard.
Oh... I know.



And I know
how hard you're trying.



This is a once-in-a-lifetime
proposition,
and you must act now.



The Colonel Wilhelm
Military Academy
forTroubled Youth...



is what we call in the sales game
a win-win scenario.




A top-flight military school,
and it's only... eight hours away.



[Phone Rings]
Oh, the phone.



[Phone Rings]



I heard what you said.



I'm not going to military school, Larry.



Look, buddy,




I know I'm not your dad...



and this is probably
really strange foryou...



your neighbor's
dating your mom.



But here's the thing, son.
Come here.



I don't like you either.



But I'm gonna
marry your mom.



And if it was up to me,
you'd be at military school today.



I'm not going
to military school.
Ohh!



I think you're gonna love it.




It's just like summer camp,



except with brutal forced marches...



and soul-crushing discipline.



And one more thing...
It's Lawrence,
you snot-nosed son of a...



wonderful woman
who I'm absolutely crazy about!
[Grunting] Oww!



Gosh, I love children!



Oh, Joan,
I didn't see you there.



Would you be a doll
and help me bring up chairs
from the basement?




Nothing would give me
more pleasure, Joan,
but I do have to run.



I have a very important
sales conference downtown.



Oh. Okay.



- Well, I'll see you at the party tonight.
- Sure.



Mom, that guy's a total phony.
You can't let Larry...



It's Lawrence, Conrad.
[Doorbell Rings]



Kate's Catering.
I'm here to do your party tonight.




Oh, hi.
Where's Kate?



I'm Kate.
Oh. Okay.



Right this way, Kate.



Mom, you've gotta
listen to me...
[Phone Ringing]



Quiet!
Two weeks ago
you said you would...



[Joan Screams]
I ""specialed"" it.
See?



Quiet!
Nevins!




[Ringing Continues]
I said quiet!



[Ringing]



Joan Walden Real Estate.
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place likeJoan.



This is Mr. Humberfloob.



- Oh, hi, Mr. Humberfloob.
- Joan, I need you to come back to the offiice.



- Today?
- Yes, Joan.



- No problem?
- No problem at all.




Great!



- [Gasps]
- What's going on, Mommy?



Mommy has to go
back to the offiice.



Oh! I hope Mrs. Kwan
can babysit.

10929,"mostly depends on what servers, people, and general popularity is on the server, you might be on a server with very for FPS and ping with a large population and the people are pretty good while on the other hand you might run into a server that has HIGH ping that might only have 4-8 people playing and all of them are absolute human garbage but its a mixed bag so you never know what you might get"
10930,funny nextbot

10946,is good game
10947,"Okay, so first of all: the base game isn't the greatest. But, what makes Garry's Mod so good is that you can 1. easily play with friends, and 2. There are almost infinite options for mods and maps. GMod is pretty boring solo, but if you have at least 1 friend to mess around with, this game is a must. (I recommend getting terrified by Nextbots.)"
10948,great
10949,Im a thot hoe
10950,Pretty fun game if you want something cheep and you can affordable.Great way to pass time and fun with the more people you play The addon's give you more things to do plus more player models.Fun game 100% worth it

10955,"Incredibly fun game to play. I recently joined so I could play with things like the Obunga nextbot. But I now realize that addons aren't the only thing to this game. When you play with friends, the gameplay can be very similar to call of duty, or Halo. Amazing game. 11/10."

11052,Silly fun.
11053,i hate white people
11054,"It warms my soul to see GMod making a reappearance in the YouTube algorithm. It really goes to show that even after being released over 15 years ago, anything is possible with this game. It's not all about being chased by Obunga Nextbots, though!

Despite its decline in recent years, there are hundreds of gamemodes you can play either on a server or with friends. One of my personal favourites is Prop Hunt - I was absolutely addicted to it back in 2014. Shoutout and rest in peace to the Everyone's a Banana servers: lonely 13 year old me made many friends on there.

The best part is, you don't even have to play a specific gamemode to have fun. When I'm bored, I just boot up Sandbox on a random map and mess around. Sure, addons are practically required, but the integration from the Steam Workshop is seamless.

Oh, also, Garry is still updating the game monthly to this very day. Obviously, there's not much to update or change, but that's part of the reason why Garry's Mod is so good, and why it works. It's a must-have for anyone with an account on Steam."
11055,"A really fun game to play with friends. Without or with addons, this game is still pretty entertaining to play. It's got everything you could ask for and you can literally do whatever you want. The random messy looking physics and everything else that you are able to do is funny and honestly the reason why I probably enjoy it so much is because there's a lot of options you can choose from. The fun never ends in this game.

This game is a 9/10 for me. If anyone hasn't tried it out yet I definitely recommend everyone to play it with someone else."
11056,epic
11057,this game makes no sense but I love it
11058,pretty good
11059,best sandbox game out there love it

11071,"Love this game and also love the fact that no matter how old this game is, the community is still making new addons no matter what, making the game more fun etc. You can do pretty much anything, after all its a sandbox game, you can mod it out so its like a realistic FPS game or you can make it into minecraft (just an example). Also helps kill time when you're bored.

I very much recommend!"

11079,Garry's Mod is extremely funny (TommyInnit Titles be like) and you an always get a laugh out of it. The wide variety of Addons add to the fun as well
11080,"I love garrys mod. Its amazing, especially the naked ragdoll mods. I made bonnie rail a gensh8n impact character as i wanted her feet so bad, those grippers, those carpet rippers, those waffle stompers.

11689,It is the best game ever
11690,fun
11691,i reallly like this game but the next bots are funny i have alot of fun
11692,Still fresh. Very fun.
11693,"I can put tits on a building, what more can I say but play this with a close friend and goof off!"
11694,mmm yes very good
11695,"i see why people have thousands of hours on this game, years later and there's still games to play and things to do. It was gifted to me by a friend and i love it."
11696,good
11697,good game but i saw a statue on one of the maps that moved and im scared
11698,I've been playing this game for almost over a decade and I saw it change the whole way through. This game is a blessing to me and I've been playing for 416  hours total
11699,"I really like this game, even though at the core it's quite basic. It's still quite fun once you put some workshop addons into it, or get some source games. The Physgun, Toolgun, the basic weapons you need to get started on this game is all in the sandbox gamemode. I really like this!"
11700,"Very cool sandbox game, make weird shit, do shit,  the embodyment of 'fuck around and find out'"
11701,tons of fun try it out
11702,yes
11703,funny g man
11704,Made gordan ramsay ride mario (you know what im talking about) 10/10
11705,my ballls
11706,I love the game a lot great purchase by me so much free content  so many things to do its a bargain game take advantage of the sale and buy it for yourself
11707,This game is honestly one of the best sandbox games despite being 15+ years old.  The community is probably one of the best and is very enjoyable being able to ragdoll your friends!  The mods for the game are also phenomenal!  You want to add lightsabers into your arsenal and have cool Force abilities?  There are dozens to choose from!   Want to fly fighters?  LFS is for you!  Tanks?  Boats?  Guns?  This game more than likely has a mod for that!  Even mecha battles!  I really recommend everyone to try it out and just have fun with the Hundreds of Thousands of mods available!

11814,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

11925,"alrighty I received this game a while ago from a friend. and since i have nearly 300 hours in this game. 
so let's get to the review 

[h1] PROS [\h1] 

-Endless possibilitys

What i mean by this is that with the help with the workshop and of course some stuff built into gmod. 
You have alot of stuff to do
Like if you're into vechiles theres alot of cars to drive
Or if you're into horror 
Theres alot of horror maps 
 And etc. 
This makes gmod enjoyabale to nearly everyone 


-workshop
Self explanatory.
But to make it brief
The workshop is basically is what makes gmod fun lol 

-animating 
Despite being a game 
Meant for sandbox
You can also animate and make posters (which you can see on the loading screen) 
Tho granted it is very difficult and hard. 



-The gameplay 
The base gameplay is similar to half life 2 which i heard is already good (haven't played yet)
However it's pretty addicting playing this with addons
So many mechanism
Ones i like are the simpfhys cars
Those are one of my favourite addon bases and adds to the gameplay of gmod
Same with the addons meant for posing and animating in gmod. 

-Ambience
Its pretty scary :(



[h1] CONS [\h1] 

>Soundtrack

I didn't have much to put here so i just nitpicked 



Overall gmod is an amazing game and one of my favourites to play with Friends and alone
I mostly use it to joyride with simpfhys mod
However you can still do alot 
And i think everyone should have gmod in their library"
11926,very good and very goofy
11927,C.I.A.
11928,gud game !

The main reason I have buyed this game is, that some friends wanted to play the game with me. At the first time it was a bit complicated but I understood the keybinds fast. I know that the graphic isnt the best one, but for a game that was created in 2005 it is very decent!

Why do I recommend buying it? If you like roleplay this game is a very good buy for you. Its cheap and the gameplay quality of the most server are fun! Normally its 10$, but I got it for 4$!

I suggest to buy the game, but it is also an good option to wait for another sale if you dont want to spend too much money.

I hope you found this review helpful! Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title."

12261,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

12271,"subsequent editions of the Manifesto in English ‚Äì in Britain, the United 
States and the USSR. In 1890, Engels prepared a further German edition, 
wrote a new preface to it, and added a number of notes. In 1885, the 
newspaper Le Socialiste published the French translation of the Manifesto
made by Marx‚Äôs daughter Laura Lafargue and read by Engels. He also 
wrote prefaces to the 1892 Polish and 1893 Italian editions.
* * *
The very first version of the Manifesto was the ‚ÄïCommunist Confession of 
Faith,‚Äñ which was the draft programme discussed at the First Congress of 
the Communist League in London on June 2-9, 1847.
The Congress was a final stage in the reorganisation of the League of the 
Just ‚Äì an organisation of German workers and craftsmen. The League 
was founded in Paris in 1836-37 and soon acquired an international 
character, with followers in Germany, France, Switzerland, Britain and 
Sweden. Marx and Engels were working to promote the ideological and 
organisational unity of socialists and revolutionary-minded workers, and 
approached the leaders of the League (Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll, 
Heinrich Bauer) in London to ask for their help in reorganising the 
League and drafting its new programme. When Marx and Engels were 
convinced that the leaders of the League of the Just were ready to accept 
the principles of scientific communism as its programme they accepted 
an offer to join the League which was made to them late in January 1847.
Engels‚Äô active participation in the work of the Congress (Marx was 
unable to go to London for financial reasons) affected the course and the 
results of its proceedings. The League was renamed the Communist 
League, and the old motto of the League of the Just, ‚ÄïAll men are 
brothers,‚Äñ was replaced by a new, Marxist one: ‚ÄïWorking Men of All 
Countries, Unite!‚Äñ The draft programme and the draft Rules of the 
League were approved at the last sitting on June 9, 1847.
The Draft takes the form of a series of questions and answers, just like
any of the catechisms which were traditional for secret societies of early 
modern times. However, the programme testifies to Engels‚Äô influence on 
the discussion at the Congress, for the answers to most of the 22 
questions are Marxist, despite the fact that the members of the League 
were still predominantly under the sway of utopian ideas, as was reflected 
in the formulation of the first 6 questions and answers. 
After the First Congress of the Communist League, the ‚ÄïDraft of a 
Communist Confession of Faith‚Äñ was sent, together with the draft Rules,
to the various communities of the League for discussion, the results of 
which were to be taken into account at the time of the final approval of 
the programme and the Rules at the Second Congress. When working on 
the ‚ÄïPrinciples of Communism,‚Äñ in late October 1847, Engels made 
direct use of the ‚ÄïConfession of Faith,‚Äñ as is reflected in the many 
coincidences of the texts, and also from references in the Principles to the 
earlier document where Engels had decided to leave some of the 
formulations just as they were.
The text of ‚ÄïThe Principles of Communism‚Äñ is included in this edition. 
In the letter to Marx in late November 1847, also included below, Engels 
suggested to Marx the need to adopt the form of a manifesto rather than 
a catechism. It can be seen however that the Principles remains in the form 
of a catechism. It was not just a question of including some historical 
narrative, but of the need of the Manifesto to both speak to and give voice 
to the international proletariat. The form of catechism was tied to the 
practice of swearing in new members with an oath of loyalty and secrecy, 
something quite unsuitable for an emancipatory mass movement.
On the other hand, the ‚ÄïDemands of the Communist Party in Germany‚Äñ 
is included to place the publication of the Manifesto in the context of the 
mass movement in Germany at the time, the movement whose 
immediate demands are reflected by Marx in this pamphlet. Clearly the 
aims of the Manifesto were more far-reaching than the movement in 
Germany at the time, and unlike the ‚ÄïDemands,‚Äñ was to outlive the 
immediate conditions in Germany.
The ‚ÄïThird Address to the International Workingmen‚Äôs Association‚Äñ is 
included because in this speech Marx examines the movement of the 
working class manifested in the Paris Commune, and his observations 
here mark the only revisions to his social and historical vision made
during his lifetime as a result of the development of the working class 
movement itself, clarifying some points and making others more concrete, 
particularly in connection with the state.
 
1 The Communist League ‚Äî established at a congress of the League of the Just 
in London on June 2, 1847. Engels was in attendance as the delegate for the 
League‚Äôs Paris communities. The Congress inaugurated the Communist 
League as the first international proletarian organisation. The trial of the 
leaders of the German communists at Cologne in the wake of the defeat of-
the 1848 Revolution, brought the movement to an end and the League was 
dissolved.
2 The Chartists ‚Äî The first mass revolutionary movement of the British 
working class. The Chartists mobilised millions in demonstrations and 
marches and petitions to Parliament demanding universal male suffrage and 
other democratic measures. Although their petitions were all rejected, their 
aims were all eventually achieved, and between 1842 and 1847 a number of 
economic measures such as the Ten-Hours Bill were legislated to appease the 
workers‚Äô movement.
3 The Paris Commune ‚Äî In March 1871, under siege by the Prussian army 
following the defeat of a French military adventure, the workers of Paris 
took state power and set out to implement a socialist program. They were 
brutally crushed after only 2 months, never having been able to break out of 
confines of Paris. Marx saw the Commune as the first great revolutionary 
movement of the European working class since the crushing of the 
revolutions of 1848 and he closely followed all its actions and proposals, 
particularly in relation to the problems of the seizure of power and 
suppression of the bourgeois counter-revolution, and the form of state that 
the working class would itself seek to establish."

12288,"I`m a 47 years old freelancer and this game saved my life!
I born like a handicapped boy and I have problem with my legs. I was ""nailed"" to the chair basically entire my life.
Even when in my childhood I never had any friends cause of that. There`s was literally nothing I can do... I just wanted to be like an ordinary kid just running and playing some football. I hated this life. Nobody was understanding me except my family. Only thing I found really entertaining it was watching my brother plays. He noticed that and we started to sharing one old PC. It was really fun! We talked a lot of some games topics and he teach me basically everything I need to know. But after some time, my older brother have to move from our family to another town, because of his college and he gave me his old PC. PC gave me chance to forget everything I have experienced in my life. Time passed and I started to playing my life changing game, Gmod. There I met my dear friends and my wife. They accepted me the way I was. Right now I have a family and my son. We still playing games sometimes and I hope this will stay as it is. Never lose your hope in the best!"

Overall great game would recommend it.

12520,"Perhaps, without exaggeration, one of the greatest games of all time.

Starting out as a simple mod for Half Life 2, it has steadily grown into a gaming juggernaut and has rightfully earned it's place in the video game hall of fame. Calling it a 'game' would be an understatement, as of current the add ons provided by it's driven community allows a user to customise their experience to their liking to the point of making their own unique games within the engine.

The legacy and influence that his game has had is far reaching and extensive, and it has left it's mark PC gaming culture. It has inspired so many different people to create their vision for themselves and the world. It is also insane to me how this game is still relevant, not to mention fun to play, after more than a decade of being released.

12632,"good game vr chat

Once you get the schtick of the few options this game offers it becomes laxidaisical.

you'll meet pretentious people and mods of course but that's just life."
12633,"The ~600 hours I have on record are a fraction of the time I've actually spent playing this game. In many ways it was a significant part of my childhood. It inspired me to learn everything I could about math, physics, and electronics, which 15 years later has transformed into an extremely successful career in quantitative finance, machine learning research, and quantum computing. I don't think I've ever experienced something else that captures the same level of whimsy and wonder. 

This is definitely the nostalgia speaking, but I also think any game capable of creating such a strong reaction in someone (even an overstimulated teenager) deserves at least a bit of attention. Maybe we all have things like this: games that came along with the right mix of content and expression at the right time in our lives, that helped us figure out who we are and what we want to become. Either way, Gmod is and probably always will be what I think of when someone brings up games and creativity. Building a replica of middle earth out of cubes is cool, but shooting down your friend's flying dumpster with your own amalgam of props, turrets, and thrusters will make you feel *alive*

13269,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

13808,"This game is so amazing, the community is so nice. I could gush about this game for 50 pages, but this review would be too long. I strongly recommend this game, with this game, grab about 3 addons, and your set to express creativity. This game can get eerie at times (especially in gm_construct with the empty buildings). I've had this game for only a week and already have 120 hours! It's so much fun, creativity is never ending with this game! You can do literally anything! You can even make a ragdoll representing someone you hate and beat it to shreds. This game is the best game I have ever eexperienced, it's so good! I recommend this game as much as I can, it's so easy to learn and it's so much fun, a perfect gift for your creative friend, or yourself. If you have the money, you need to get this game!! <3"

13832,"this is my childhood game that i used to watch when i was a little brat. i would recommend buying this game to basically do anything you want. this game makes me jump and sometimes scream with these horrifying mods that i installed with my friend. this is the best game out there and for me, a world class game."
13833,no

13835,"Oh Garry's Mod, where do I even begin! 

This game is a classic and was well-part of my childhood; I have plenty of hours on my old account, and decided to get it for this one as well. This game may be a shell of its former shelf, but it's community is keeping it alive. From ""Sandbox"" to ""TTT"" to Serious ""Roleplay,"" this game almost has it all. I can't really talk about all the gamemodes though as I usually stick to Sandbox, but most of them are worth a shot. This game is great for playing with friends and finding new ones, too!"

13955,"A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!

What will the name of this young man be?
Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT. You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also like to play GAMES sometimes.

What will you do?
Your ARMS are in your MAGIC CHEST, pooplord!
Out of sympathy for John's perceived lack of arms, you pick up the CAKE for him and put it on his BED.
You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS.

You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means though.

There are other items in the chest.
In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.

You are neither of these things.

Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX], ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1) PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S ""WISE GUY"", BY MIKE CAVENEY.

Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the SMOKE PELLETS.
You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.

You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of the vernacular at least.

You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.
You aren't totally sure if ""EQUIP"" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.

Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room lousy with smoke!

Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE. You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and mildly irritating.

But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your SYLLADEX with a little more experience.
Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. This poster was one of your wisest purchases.

There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster there soon.
This note is rich with the aromas of FATHERLY AFTERSHAVES AND COLOGNES.

Beside the note is a ROLLED UP POSTER.
Another BIRTHDAY ARTIFACT. You wonder what is printed on the poster.

You'll need some way to hang it on your wall.
You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.

But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try to take the NAILS?

You guess it doesn't hurt to try.
You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a card.

The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!

Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.

In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally meaningful.
This is the dumbest idea you've had in weeks!!!

STUPID STUPID STUPID.

And yet the polished surface of your desk...

It beckons.
You MERGE the top two cards.

The HAMMER and NAILS are now captchalogued on the same card and can be used together.
You use the HAMMER and NAILS card IN CONJUNCTION with the card beneath it.
You use the HAMMER, NAILS, and POSTER on the blank space on the wall.

It's glorious. Exactly what you wanted. The old man really came through this time.
PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

I SAID, PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX.

WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT THE BUNNY BACK IN THE BOX?
Morgan Freeman's genteel, homespun mannerisms were perfect qualities for a president residing over a crisis.

OCEANS RISE. CITIES FALL. HOPE SURVIVES.

WOW.

Films about impending apocalypse fascinate you. Plus, a black president??? Now you've seen everything!
You've marked your birthday, the 13th of April. Another day you marked was supposed to be the arrival date for the highly touted SBURB BETA LAUNCH.

It's been three days already. It's starting to become a sore subject with you.
You are sick to death of cake!!! You've been eating it all day. And you have no intention of clogging your SYLLADEX with it either. The CAKE stays put for now.

You hear a notice from your COMPUTER. Someone is messaging you."

14112,"Garry's Mod is one of the best games ever made. It's extremely replayable, I have over 100 hours and I don't plan to stop playing anytime soon. From Sandbox to TTT to Prop Hunt or my personal favourite DarkRP, there is something for everyone within this game. The reason this game is good is because it is amazing the reason it is amazing is because it is good. I refunded several other games to buy this. This game features shaggy and minions."

14134,nice
14135,hamburger
14136,Just all around enjoyable.
14137,what if the game was called John's Mod? that would be funny i think
14138,"Community killed my cat. If seeing Ukraine RP, Mexican Border RP, exc, gamemodes isn't enough of a red flag to what you'll be dealing with on this end, let alone being monetized to hell and back once entering any of these servers. I'd not recommend this game out of that alone.

But this is only a review for the game. It's a Sandbox game and is moddable with Lua, a very basic scripting language. Source Engine and it's intuitiveness helps with this too, despite it's age. It got me into designing games. Pretty much how I got my hours in here, though only someone like me can take so much. Even my mental health got it's limits.

Plus, it does have some gems in community and servers. Try out Metastruct and Sunrust. Thank me later."

So when I got it and started to play it I immediately added this game to my favourites. I haven't had it for long and already have 37 hours on the game. If you ask me this is the best game ever because you can do what you want and make the game even better with modsl.

14264,"Played this game for a couple hours, it's alright."
14265,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

Im part of a multitude of multiplayer communities of various types now. RP, Custom Games and more and I really can't stress just how much enjoyment I was able to (and still am) milking from this game. For me personally the best experience comes from online play but from numerous videos around the web and my childhood I can say that single-player can suffice just fine with the hundreds of maps and similar you have on offer in the incredible workshop of the game

14418,"Quite possibly my favorite game. There is no story or end goal; the only constraints are those of the Source engine and of your PC. The base game offers a diverse selection of objects (""props"") and tools, but that's [i]nothing[/i] compared to the addons available for it: functional vehicles, custom maps, different gamemodes, weather controls, a [i]working programming environment[/i] (yes)... if I listed everything, I'd be here all day. And for the rest of time. 
Oh, and once you're bored of singleplayer, there are thousands of multiplayer servers dedicated to everything imaginable.

Also, you can make absurd contraptions, like trains that are literally 2,000 feet tall. [b]10/10.[/b]"

Being that I tend to play by myself, and that Gmod's playerbase is generally less than what it used to be, I would say that unless you're very very in to singleplayer adventure maps or running from nextbots on Roleplay maps, pass. 

I mean, you should still buy it, though. Just don't play it. Get me? Cool."

As we race towards the precipice of some sprawling wasteland.  On our left, the illuminated strip of a highway.  Or was.  We zoom towards the highway with the heat-seeking laser on our side.  As we race past (and around) the slowest cars, changing lanes, we find that.  a pile of open letters stands out amongst the ground litter.  The letters read: ‚Äúmany souls have many roles.  find your true calling.‚Äù  Along with assorted newspaper clips.  Photos.

There, sitting in the middle of the hot-squeeze of a cab.  She‚Äôs hunched over.  Imploding inside.  As we rush up.  the bus pulls up to the curb and we race towards the end."

massacre a whole bunch of female npcs
run away from a bunch of pngs while they blow your ears off}
act out as a nazi in a roleplay server
dress up as a dorito bag in an unfair server with guns (massacre)
sell drugs
become a terrorist
start screaming at old horror maps from 2013 with your friends
think youre nostalgic because youre playing a source game
get funny mods
find physics mod only to find out they lag out your whole game
break your keyboard
start bhopping away thinking you have good movement
kill someone in a server to find out they are an admin and will about to spawn one shots
play in single player and shit your pants (seriously)
blow up a group of glitched out npcs
fling a helicopter with a gun all about ""physics""
roleplay seriously to find out everyone around you is a troll
troll thinking youre funny only to find out that youre gonna be in a cage in 2 minutes
roleplay seriously in a walter white outfit
cook meth
cook more meth
cook even more meth
why not, just cook even more meth
use the game as a piracy for other games that you really cant be asked to pay for, if youre lucky
why not just cook even more meth than the last time that I mentioned meth
did I mention drugs?
lots of drug roleplay
run around with a crowbar (every source game)
start to play the game once every month
get back in the game
end your misery because all your friends quit and you have no more reason to play (or live) because you wasted your money
you had a great time tho

I will love this game to my heart, even though I only have 8 hours to my name"

If you like a game that's completely in your control, well here it is. There's a decade and a half of content on the workshop for you to explore and a server browser full of custom game modes for easy access. It's easy, it's fun, it's cheap, and ultimately the experience is whatever you make it."

The base game mode of Garry's Mod has no set objectives and provides the player with a world in which to freely manipulate objects. Other game modes, notably Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunt, are created by other developers as mods and are installed separately, by means such as the Steam Workshop. Garry's Mod was created by Garry Newman as a mod for Valve's Source game engine and released in December 2004, before being expanded into a standalone release that was published by Valve in November 2006. Ports of the original Windows version for Mac OS X and Linux followed in September 2010 and June 2013, respectively. As of September 2021, Garry's Mod has sold more than 20 million copies."

15199,"i am a bit of a strange person with reviews so heres the lyrics to i am all of me from 2005's shadow the hedgehog 

I see nor hear no evil
Black writings on the wall
Unleashed a million faces
And one by one they fall
Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero
I am all, I am all, I am
I, I, I, I am
Here we go, buddy
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare (dare)
One step forward, two steps back
I'm here (one step forward, two steps back)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
(Here we go)
I see and feel the evil
My hands will crush 'em all
You think you have the answers
I'll laugh and watch you fall
Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero
I am all, I am all, I am
I, I, I, I am
Here we go, buddy
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Here we go, buddy
Here we go
Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare (dare)
One step forward, two steps back
I'm here (one step forward, two steps back)
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me
(I am, I am all of me)
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
I am (I am, I'm all of me)
(Here we go)
I am, I am everyone, everywhere
Anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am, I am everyone, everywhere
Anyhow, any way, any will, any day
I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am
I am
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?

15342,"This game is legendary. This game was my favorite since i was a kid i used to love this game and now that i finally got it, It feels like a dream come true. Really fun game to Enjoy your time with friends and different ways of having fun. 10/10 Game"
15343,"Just a whole lot of fun with mods and friends!
"
15344,very good game 10/10 there are a few glitches but other than that very fun
15345,"A really solid ""do anything"" sandbox game with quite a bit of freedom. Make ragdolls look weird? Wanna go to the skybox? Fight off zombies on a survival map? If you're looking for some freedom and diversity in how you can play a game, this is right for you. Even if you're only looking to use this as an animation tool or time waster with friends, it's hard not to recommend the game because of the sheer utility many of the community made mods can provide, which can add countless hours of extra playtime. Even the base content the game provides is very fun to play with, and if you have other source engine games downloaded, you can use their assets in a broader environment. Overall, it's a good game for any time, especially if some friends have it too."

15402,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead‚Äì murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time ‚Äì something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange ‚Äì uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" ‚Äì on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."

15485,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

15538,"Garrys mod is a simple yet effective game that makes me always come back to it no matter what. 

Gmod's idea and design is so simple yet so good. The mod actually gives you powers to make your own type of mods, servers and other creations. 

its really up to the player on what they want to do. its a sandbox game, I love it. I suggest buying it. 

its not a triple A game but it is a great and fun game. its worth the 10 dollars.

if you can cough up the 10 dollars from a pocket of yours or a friend or family member, buy this game.

He disfigured my face and my fingers with his so-called Tool-Gun. He then enlarged my head and left hand, colored me green and sank into my kitchen floor, never to be seen again, leaving me as a horrible mess that's barely human and my entire house covered in blood and flesh."

15920,"After 1,000+ hours of playing this Game. It really is worth buying and playing this Master piece of a Game. The description of this game clearly states,You can do whatever your heart desires and is worth the ¬£6.99. Plus the game doesn't require a super overpowered PC and all you need is a laptop.But if You really want to get the 600+ fps experience on a game from 2006. go for it. by the way some mods can lower fps. or completely crash the game.But its not the Games fault since it runs on the source engine and its abundance of mods that are downloadable on the workshop."

15942,"If you have a steam account and at all care for sandboxes you've probably already played GMod but yunno what I'll throw my review in the ring too.

GMod is really funny especially when you're messing around with friends (crushing ragdoll models with blocks my beloved <3) but also REALLY cool, you can literally do pretty much anything you want and that includes putting your own assets into the game! Workshop has some sick stuff too!! Genuinely go pick this game up and give it a shot if you haven't (which I doubt), it's WELL worth $10 USD for the amount of fun you get from it."
15943,mc but better

16186,its a nice game to hang out with friends if you're feeling bored
16187,Well its Garry's mod so yeah
16188,"WOW can I get it
"
16189,"ive played this for a long time and i really like everything about it, its so customizable with your own character and you can spawn in new character. there is so many game modes to play. the game also has multiplayer to join and play with your friends."
16190,"I can say for sure that even tho i have 6 hours of play its good. 
The graphics are good for an old game,
The gameplay can really be fun with friends and without and the things you can do in this game make animations make screenshots.
Audio is good it can be sometimes loud if theres to many people sometimes (if youre playing multiplayer) and sometimes it can be loud if you spawn to much npcs,
Now for the audience i think it could be somewhere for teens its not for kids probally.
The requremints for this game is really low you could have a decent or potato pc so it doesnt need to be a good pc to play this game although sometimes you need a good pc if youre gonna have alot of mods,
Theres no grind which is normal since its a sandbox game.
The price is defintly worth it for 10 dollars? You could just have alot of fun and its even better when its on sale.
The bugs can sometimes happen with mods but theres really not that much bugs trust me.
And the rating i give for this game is 10/10 just buy it or else im gonna kill your whole entire family"
16191,funnet
16192,"doo doo fart
"
16193,i like the trollface and nukes
16194,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

16269,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

16465,"I've put so many fucking hours into this phenomenal game. I'm both happy and ashamed of how much time I've spent shooting my friends in the back on TTT, or sweating bullets hiding from people in Prop Hunt. Some of my favorite online memories have occurred in this game in dozens of different servers, across dozens of gamemodes. Garry's Mod was my first purchase on the Steam Market as soon as I booted up my first hand-me-down PC when I was 13 years old. Spending countless hours meeting people, developing communities, and learning the ins-and-outs of the tool menu, I've had an incredible time. For anyone who has a creative mind, wants to have a relaxing evening game sesh with the boys or loves to just fuck around sometimes, I highly suggest this game."

Oh an I forgot to mention infinite play-ability playing nextbots with friends in the backrooms map, somehow.

When game finally loads I spawn some zombies and kill 'em all with half life 2 guns. I have literally thousands of guns and maps and tools, I mean I can do anything but instead I spawn some stupid zombies and kill them all with stupid default 9mm gun. That's what Garry's Mod is. It's f***in beatiful."

16664,"Although this is a fun game for kids, the community is unbelievably toxic. From nude sprays, to mic spammers, racist/sexist/any -ist chat spam. I've seen many kids get harassed by adults or older teens whose voices are just as squeaky as the kids they make fun of. It's a good game if you have a group of friends or play on heavily moderated servers. Otherwise expect grief of some sort."

16669,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

16718,G Mod is a game where you can create or play anything you want! With countless add-ons on the steam workshop this game can be made into a game of your own. Play by yourself or with friends in a map pf your choosing. you can also play with random people across the U.S or the world! I love this game so much because of the reasons above and I feel like it never gets old because of all of the add-ons you can get. I would Highly recommend this game to anybody.

16957,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Countless workshop items that will keep you clicking that subscribe button. Think of an NPC or a weapon and it's probably going to be there. But I still can't find a Leman russ tank addon lmaooooo."

16995,try playing it alone with textbot and it will turn into a horror game
16996,"Oh my god this thing is the most greatest multiplayer game i've ever played :D This is the best.... Try it out... Too bad its not free :( my uncle bought it for me so i received it for free. And also the physics and the gameplay its self, so good!!!!!!! Recommended and also the time when i  spawned a mod called ""Obunga"", its the best and the nextbot chases me and also there are many mods in steam workshop so u wont get bored and also the gun shots sound isn't that good but the other guns does sound good except for the others..... the revolver sounds actually realistic.... and also there are many features to choose from.. you can spawn the nextbots you have in the gm_construct map and also i dont know why the nextbots already know the map.... and also there are many guns and weapons in workshop..... and also, guys, this is so recommended and also its actually horror and also, why do i keep saying ""also"", nevertheless, the game is not free and also i dont know the price of the game in dollars but im pretty sure that its not $100. So, its not that expensive and also this game is the best of the best of the best of the best that is even better than phasmaphobia. No offense dev of phas. And, This game is actually a platform where you can do anything that you want. u herd it right. anything that you want can be spawned as long as your pc can withstand it.
And, this game also has nukes, bombs, missile, rockets and more mods. You can also download mods in-game. You can also open the mod you're looking for in-game in workshop so you dont need to go to workshop and search it. It is the best of the best of all source games. And, this is the last sentence i will write; This game is the best, this game is what you're looking for (for sure....), and this game is for boyz and girlz. so any body cud play this. even my grandma can play this tho she's dead.///// so this game is actually the most recommended game i will say to you. I NEVER COMMENT THAT MUCH IN GAMES, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU. YOU WILL LOVE THIS. AND THIS GAME IS NOT MEH. LOOK AT THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GMOD!!!!!!!!!! GMOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS GAME IS NOT BORING(for some people). AND THIS GAME MIGHT BE THE GAME YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AND ALSO THIS GAME IS NOT FREE!!!!!!!!! BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT IT WILL NOT BE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND IT WILL BE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I was locked up on Thanksgivin'
I ain't get to eat with my john wick
I ain't get to hug my tedbear
Couldn't even give him no huggies
Can't even go to McDonalds cuz them pussy john wick be hunger
Everybody acting hungry
Might prolly say that I'm thirsty
When I'm all alone in my jail cell
I tend to beat my meat
And all I eat at Mickey D's
Don't pass me no nuggets
And I'ma eat all my pain away cuz the only thing gon' feed me
And I don't understand these burgers
Who go around pretendin'
They really don't really see me
So I flip em all with the finger
Cause the same burger so good inside be the main one I'm eatin'
Got ketchup mixed with lettuce, cheese cause every time

I wake up in the morning I got burgers on my mind
Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, Fries, Lettuce and Number 9
And all these yummy burgers tasty tryna get me off my grind
But I can't let em' do it
I got burgers on my mind
Bitch I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
Burgers on my mind
Burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind

Yellow tape around my burger, it's a fucking homicide
Ketchup on my t-shirt and I'm just traumatized
I didn't even mean to eat him, he caught me by surprise
I re-ordered my food and got it right back and ate it twice
My burger dropped down to the floor
It had a pickle on the floor
I grab that by my hands and said I'll eat you right inside
And now I ate my burger now it's time too say goodbye
I ate it and went down inside my tummy right inside
I got ketchup on my shirt

I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
Burgers on my mind

I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind
I got burgers on my mind

Watch out 'cuz they're right next door!

The past is in the present
Time's been twisted upside-down
These fossils are colossal
Only one can wear the crown!

Dinosaur King is what you want to be, yeah
(Make your move! C'mon an' make your move!)

Dinosaur King is your destiny, yeah
(Make your move! C'mon an' make! Your! Move!)

17114,ITS ONE OF THE BEST !!!! MY FAVORITE
17115,backroom saul goodman
17116,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there‚Äôs fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
17117,this game reminds me of the time i fucked a waffle iron against my own will at a 7-Eleven in New Mexico at 4 in the morning. pretty cool

It is a great ok way to be creative and have fun. it can be funny, scary, violent(adults only) or sweet and interesting. it is a game that can be played by different age groups and that is one thing i love about it.

If you are finding a sandbox game where you can manipulate objects and create an interpretation of any sort, play Garry's Mod."

17246,"Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator was one of the first games I ever got on steam almost 2 years ago, and not only do i only have about 4 hours on it, I also haven't played it since march of 2021 as of currently. I got Garry's Mod less than a week ago and I have almost 20 hours on it already. This game is infinitely 
re-playable and that is no exaggeration.  One of my favorite games ever, don't regret buying even a bit. You can basically do anything, you can pose characters in funny positions and give them funny faces and just mess around to see what you can do,  you can head online and mess around in servers, or you can just blow up whatever you want whenever you want. It only takes up 4 or 5 gigabytes of storage on download and it's usually on sale, which I found when i bought an already $10 game at a 60% discount. But regardless, it's not expensive, so just buy it now. And if you get bored with all the base stuff, there's practically an infinite amount of stuff in the workshop that's amazingly simple to download. Just look up what you want in the workshop, subscribe to it, and close Gmod (if it's already open) and then open it back up, and it's right there. And even better: the stuff in the workshop is all free! If I had one thing bad to say about the game, it's that it kind up eats up your storage if you plan on getting stuff from the workshop, but then again that's not really the creator's fault, since it's not really in their control. If you want a good game with and infinite amount of game modes and free DLC and you have a good few gigabytes to spare, Gmod is one of the best games you can find on steam."

17272,"Probably one of my favourite Sandbox games ever. It blends infinite creation with infinite tools, you are given paintbrushes and a massive canvas to do whatever you want to do! Interested in making Cool images for a wallpaper or avatar? We got it. What about making funny animations? Sure, if you want. Killing 50 citizens for no true reason? Yeah Gazza Mod has ya covered.

Game still holds up after 15 years and will continue to.

17298,"Garry's Mod is a 2006 sandbox game developed by Facepunch Studios and published by Valve. The base game mode of Garry's Mod has no set objectives and provides the player with a world in which to freely manipulate objects. Other game modes, notably Trouble in Terrorist Town and Prop Hunt, are created by other developers as mods and are installed separately, by means such as the Steam Workshop. Garry's Mod was created by Garry Newman as a mod for Valve's Source game engine and released in December 2004, before being expanded into a standalone release that was published by Valve in November 2006. Ports of the original Windows version for Mac OS X and Linux followed in September 2010 and June 2013, respectively. As of September 2021, Garry's Mod has sold more than 20 million copies. Gameplay Garry's Mod is a physics-based sandbox game that, in its base game mode, has no set objectives. The player is able to spawn non-player characters, ragdolls, and props, and interact with them by various means. Using the ""physics gun"", ragdolls and props can be picked up, rotated, and frozen in place. The individual limbs of ragdolls can also be manipulated. The ""tool gun"" is a multi-purpose item for tasks such as welding and constraining props together, and altering the facial expressions of ragdolls. User-created content Garry's Mod includes the functionality to modify the game by developing scripts written in the Lua programming language. Notable mods include Spacebuild, Wiremod, Elevator: Source, DarkRP, Prop Hunt, and Trouble in Terrorist Town. Specialised servers, known as Fretta servers, rotate between custom game modes every fifteen minutes. Garry's Mod version 12 introduced the ""Toybox"" section, through which the player could browse and install user-created mods. This was replaced by support for the Steam Workshop in version 13. Fretta Contest and Trouble in Terrorist Town In late 2009, Facepunch launched the ""Fretta Contest"", a competition in which people were to develop Garry's Mod game modes using the proprietary Fretta programming framework, with the winning game mode to be added to the base game. The winner of this contest was Trouble in Terrorist Town, which was added to the game in July 2010, alongside another mode, Dogfight: Arcade Assault. TTT assigns players to three groups: Traitors, Detectives, and Innocents, similar to the party game Mafia. Detectives are known to all players, whereas Traitors are only known to other Traitors and otherwise appear as Innocents. While Traitors attempt to eliminate all other players, Innocents and Detectives need to co-operate to identify and eliminate all Traitors. To do the latter, Detectives are given special equipment, such as DNA scanners that can trace a dead player's killer. Prop Hunt The game mode Prop Hunt was created by Andrew ""AMT"" Theis and popularised through Garry's Mod. In Prop Hunt, the players on one team are disguised as props and set to hide on the game map while the other team seeks after them. Game modes based on Prop Hunt were later included with games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, Call of Duty: Black Ops III, Fortnite Battle Royale, and Genshin Impact. Players recreated it in others, such as Rocket League and Fortnite Creative."

17380,"One of, if not the, first game I ever got on Steam. Endless hours of fun - whether you like to build elaborate dupes, set up wild NPC battles or mess around with ragdolls, there's something here for everyone. Of course, its real claim to fame is the Steam Workshop, with a limitless repository of maps, dupes, gamemodes, SNPCs, weapons, vehicles, and all other sorts of stuff to dive right into.

Multiplayer is a mixed bag - depending on the server, it can either be great fun and the source of the most memorable moments in gaming, or an absolute slog and the source of the most memorable moments in gaming for the wrong reasons. Or you could just get kicked for no reason. I suppose with such a large playerbase, mostly consisting of young children, them's the breaks.

Given the enjoyment this game gave me when I was younger, and even now, it would be a crime to not give this a positive review."

17427,"This game has brought me great memories through it's vast applicability; whether it be joining a server for roleplaying, going into singleplayer and building cars, or going into multiplayer and racing them. I have had this game since 2014 (8 years as of writing this) and to this day, I continue to play it. It is one of the best PC games I have ever played. There is so much you can do in this game, and I doubt I realize everything that has been made possible through Garry's Mod. Highly recommend for anyone who has ever enjoyed playing a video game."

17465,"One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter"

17468,"The story takes palce in Budapesz 2026 you are a brave terrorist S√°ndor (who work at burger king).



Fifteen years after a cataclysmic event known as the hungarian elections, the world faces a new threat: monstrous celestial beings called Boeing 747s invade Budapest one by one. Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the 747s despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Jen≈ë Polg√°r. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed ""a hivatal"" to combat the orb√°n korm√°ny with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.


Eccentric scientist S√°ndor has a never-ending thirst for scientific exploration. Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Jen≈ë and his roommate Bartos CS Istv√°n, S√°ndor founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable ""gadget"" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.

17624,"This game is something called a buggy masterpiece. It's riddled with bugs, but that is what makes the game so memorable. Take goat sim for example, it's a buggy mess, but it's remembered so well because of that and it's jokes put throughout the game. Anyway back on track - why play any of the other big games when you can install mods from other games in this game? Think about it for a moment.

10/10 Would mod it again."

17739,"	According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
 	Cut to Barry's room, where he's picking out what to wear.
Barry	Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Yeah, let's shake it up a little.
 	Barry uses honey from a dispenser to style his hair, rinse his mouth, and then applies it to his armpits.
Mom (Janet Benson)	(calling from downstairs:) Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Barry:	Coming! (phone rings) Oh, hang on a second. (adjusts his antennas into a headset) Hello?
Adam Flayman	(on the phone) Barry?
Barry:	Adam?
Adam:	Can you believe this is happening?
Barry:	I can't believe it. I'll pick you up. (hangs up, sharpens his stinger) Lookin' sharp. (flies downstairs)
Mom:	Barry, why don't you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those.
Barry:	Sorry. I'm excited.
Dad (Martin Benson):	Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. And a perfect report card, all B's.
Mom:	Very proud. (touches Barry's hair)
Barry:	Ma! I got a thing going here.
Mom:	Ah, you got some lint on your fuzz.
Barry:	Ow! That's me!
Dad:	Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Barry:	Bye! (flies off)
Mom:	Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
 	(Barry drives his car to pick up his classmate. Adam's outside his house, reading the Hive Today newspaper. The front page headline reads ""FRISBEE HITS HIVE ! Internet Down. Bee: 'I heard sound, then Wham-o!'"")
Barry:	Hey, Adam.
Adam:	Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel?
Barry:	A little. It's a special day, finally graduating.
Adam:	Never thought I'd make it.
Barry:	Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school.
Adam:	Those were so awkward.
Barry:	Three days of college. I'm glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive.
Adam:	You did come back different.
 	(a bee calls out as they drive past)
Bee:	Hi, Barry.
Barry:	Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Adam:	Hey, did you hear about Frankie?
Barry:	Yeah.
Adam:	You goin' to his funeral?
Barry:	No, I'm not goin' to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone, you die. You don't waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hothead.
Adam:	Yeah, I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
 	(They make various noises as the car goes up and down some hills and does a loop on the road.)
A & B	Woah! Oooooooh!
Adam:	I love this incorporating an amusement park right into our regular day.
Barry:	I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.
 	(They arrive, fly in and take their seats.)
Barry:	Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
Barry:	Well, Adam, today we are men.
Adam:	We are!
Barry:	Bee-men.
Adam:	Amen!
A & B:	Hallelujah! (bumping each other) Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
Announcer:	Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
 	Dean Buzzwell walks onto the stage and taps the microphone.
Buzzwell:	Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... (presses a button to change the timer on the podium from 9:00 to 9:15) ...9:15. And that concludes our graduation ceremonies.
 	(Students cheer, throw their caps into the air as helmets are placed on their heads.)
Buzzwell:	And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Barry:	Are we gonna pick our jobs today?
Adam:	I heard it's just orientation.
Barry:	Huh. Woah. Heads up! Here we go.
 	(The stands for Winger University the students are sitting in begin converting into tram seating.)
Female announcer:	Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (flies down to go in the tram as it starts moving and repeats it in Spanish:) Mantenga sus manos y antenas dentro del tranv√≠a en todo momento.
Barry:	Wonder what it's going to be like?
Adam:	A little scary. (he and Barry mimic shivering and making scared noises)
Trudy, the Honex tour guide:	Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
Barry:	This is it!
everyone:	Wow. (tram moves into the factory floor)
Barry:	Wow.
Trudy:	We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
everyone:	Honey!
 	(Tour guide grabs a beaker of honey as they drive by and tosses it to the group, which bounce it around towards the back.}
Adam:	That girl was hot.
Barry:	She's my cousin!
Adam:	She is?
Barry:	Yes, we're all cousins.
Adam:	Right. You're right.
Trudy:	At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
 	(Behind a display window, a bee puts on a helmet, then runs back and forth as levers holding a rolled-up magazine, flyswatter and a shoe move down to try hit him. He is hit by the magazine, dodges the flyswatter, but then hit by the boot and again by all three, followed by being sprayed with aerosol from two cans. He signals he's okay, but is flattened by the flyswatter, magazine and shoe converging to strike him together. He signals he's still okay by poking his arm up through a hole in the flyswatter and giving another thumbs up. The tram riders applaud.)
Adam:	Ooh. What do you think he makes?
Barry:	Not enough.
Trudy:	And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
Barry:	Wow, what does that do?
Trudy:	Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
 	(A Krelman worker waves and Adam waves back.)
Adam:	Uh, uh, can anyone work on the Krelman?
Trudy:	Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life.
Barry:	The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
Adam:	What's the difference?
Barry:	Huh?
Trudy:	And you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. Wooh!
Barry:	So you'll just work us to death?
Trudy:	We'll sure try.
 	(Everyone laughs while Barry looks uncomfortable. The tram converts into a boat that flows down a log-flume style ramp with honey in it, then converts back to a wheeled tram at the end.)
 	(With the tour over, Adam and Barry head home. Adam jumps with excitement.)
Adam:	Wow! That blew my mind!
Barry:	""What's the difference?"" Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
Adam:	Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
Barry:	But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Adam:	Barry, why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
 	(a filling station attendant yells at a bee for putting the honey nozzle into his own mouth.)
Barry:	Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here?
Adam:	Like what? Give me one example.
 	(both stop in the middle of an intersection. the traffic adjusts to drive around them.)
Barry:	I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Announcer over speaker:	Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Barry:	Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Adam:	Wow.
 	(Pollen Jocks fly into the hive and land.)
Adam:	I've never seen them this close.
Barry:	They know what it's like to go outside the hive.
Adam:	Yeah, but some of them don't come back.
 	(two lady bees wave at the jocks and call out:)
Girl Bees	Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
 	(the pollen is removed from the jocks and collected into storage capsules marked ""Nectar"", then trucked away. A General flies over to welcome them.)
General:	You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
Barry:	I wonder where those"

17802,"I am a 40 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I killed my son. In cold blood. Yep. I ended his life. The police are still searching for him and have no clue that I killed him. His body buried in my backyard of 4572 Brighton Circle Road, Hutchinson MN. That was the final straw so I took things into my own hands. Shot him in the back of the head while he was playing this game. But other than that this game's ok 8/10."

18014,i finally got it after years of wanting this game (i was a dumb child back then who doesnt know how to buy or get games) and im already having alot of fun with it
18015,"Considering how cheap this game is, it is 100% worth the buy if you're into RPing & interacting with people. I've been in a lot of communities and have been staff in most so I do warn you most the player base is underage and you'll hear a lot of bad things but when you find the right community for you it's almost like a second home. Garry's Mod brings you a variety of game modes from Prophunt to DarkRP so there's almost a guarantee you'll find something you like, and if you join a server you don't like there's a ton more!

Just be careful with how many servers you join as some of the DarkRP or even just regular RP servers need a lot of downloads to make it run properly which overtime does take a lot of space on your computer. If you aren't concerned about that, make sure you have CSS maps and content downloaded as most maps use those add-ons. If you need help installing content feel free to add me and I can walk you through it‚ù£"

18063,"The Game concept is really really nice and it¬¥s surely fun to play with friends (but I have no)

But I have to give some critic to the game:

The game is like: here buy it and try to find out how it works I personally needed like about 5mins to learn the basics of the game and I had no nerves to learn how to use Workshop or play Multiplayer.

All in all it¬¥s surely pretty fun but I don¬¥t have the nerves for it but I recommend it for everyone who has the time and the nerves to fully learn this complex game!

18177,"this game is great, if u like making wars with mods (u can get them in the the workshop in the community for the game). I never thought i could get hulk vs sonic vs t rex from jurrasic park vs shredder. not only can u make fights u can also do parkour after installing a parkour mod, and if u watch youtube to the core u may have seen people running from images called next bots, you can turn gmod from a fun action game into a horror game. I love this game a lot, i hope it can go on console."
18178,fun to rap
18179,Its A very fun Game To just Mess around and Have Fun in! trust me. I've been playing this game for 655.8 Hours! XD
18180,It's a great game I have seen a lot of YouTubers play this game and when I finally got it I was filled with lots of joy
18181,"I love Garry Mod. There are some mods on here that have big breasted woman figures. I like very much! Sometimes I start to feel sad in this world, finding no purpose. Garry Mod wont help with that at all, but it is still a very good game. I recommend it is very fun, I can live out my countless fantasies in my head and convert it over to this game. I don't play multiplayer but I have made many friends in the single player. Sometimes I wish I had friends in real life."
18182,"it is really fun

18194,better with friends
18195,"Really dependent on community content and addons yet that's what makes it fun. I've spent a considerable amount of time just playing around with the stupid things people have made for the game and enjoyed it quite a bit. While servers can provide actual game modes and more organized things to do with friends, the entertainment Garry's Mod's sandbox provides can be satisfactory enough (given you have at least a few mods installed)."
18196,This one of the best games I played
18197,money ba

18205,Very fun with freinds
18206,nice game
18207,"A game were you can basically do anything. Along with that, you can meet new people online in the multiplayer section. Some people like to do roleplaying, some like zombies, and some maybe just wanna go to the movie theater, you can do that too! You can also be whoever you want simply by just searching up playermodels in the workshop section. Garrys Mod is a great game and is something I highly recommend you play."
18208,"I nuked 50 Batmen, That‚Äôs really it"
18209,if u play thia game ur like

18254,"fun game, can play with others or just be in your own world messing around building stuff"
18255,"do random stuff 
with random people
"
18256,"This game is a classic, it's a sandbox in it's purest form. This game is built for mods, however after a while it may get hard to play with friends if everyone's mods aren't synced up. Never the less there's something here for everybody, whether that's building, RP, or just messing around."
18257,"crazy
"
18258,"This game is good for spending hours making up a cool scene, complete with lighting, and effects. Only to stare at it for a few seconds, and then switch maps without saving."
18259,"It's fun to play with friends so you have no reason to play.
"
18260,"OBANGA RUN
"
18261,"I Reccomend this game if you like sandbox games, it's very fun to make npc's battle against eachother, also building is also pretty good in this game! However if you want to use this for multiplayer, definitely buy Counter Strike: Source, otherwise every texture will be missing."
18262,i love star wars rp

18276,"Who needs a social life when you can download car and airplane mods?

18296,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
18297,played for a couple hours fun game 10/10
18298,its like half life 2 but sandbox. So basically not half life 2
18299,"One of the main reasons on how my personality developed. 
ive made many new friends that i randomly encountered and it was an amazing time.
you can literally do anything you want to do, theres a mod for like everything. 
and if it doesnt exist yet, itll be made somewhen.

18420,"I've tried to like Garry's mod. I really can't. I know I'm probably dumb or stupid or boring or whatever, but I bought this game for 20ish hard-earned dollars when I was like 13, and hated it then, I'm 25 and I hate it now. I  thought that maybe I was too young to appreciate it, and came back to it in 2022. I'm good. I see it's value as a fun little movie making tool or whatever, but I am not a content creator, so I don't have a niche to fill in that aspect. As a ""game"" it's just not fun. I *know* you're supposed to create your own fun, but there's just so little structure, that there's so much to do, there's nothing to do. Other games that fit into the ""create your own fun"" category I have a blast with, but there's just nothing there for me here. Sure, there are RP servers, and other game-style servers, but there are a million *real* games that do what they do so much better, so much easier, with so much less fuss, without the jankiness of an ancient engine that was never great to begin with. And don't even get me started on actually getting shit to work. Want to play on a server? Get ready for an hour of fucking shitass downloads just to play on a server that may or may not still be missing models and textures. Awesome. Sure, I know they want you to have the orange box or whatever, but I don't want to have to buy more games to support a game I *already own*. The load times are atrocious, the base game seriously lacks content, and it's all around just bare as hell. For it's time, I'm sure it was great. But looking at it now, I fucking hate this game. I'm probably spoiled or missing the point, but I still had to say something."

18729,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

18839,This was my first steam game and I got it in 2016 when I was 13. Garry's Mod has remained my favorite game 5 years later now. I'm a fairly creative person and I like to build and set up scenarios to go through. I came to purchase it because of Vanoss Gaming videos which peaked my interest. This game was the closest thing to the matrix for me and I thought that was cool when I was younger and to this day.
18840,very big sus but very good

18850,this can be a horror game if you try hard enough.
18851,A open world game with many different possibility's is a good idea expectantly with ad-dons to make the game better so if your looking for a game to hang out in then I would recommend giving this game a try.
18852,this game is a masterpiece of building and glitches and amazing stuff i would suggest to play it it is amazing

19029,"I am a 38 yo virgin father, probably not one of the oldest people playing this game. I am, once again, a virgin farther to my adopted Son, rightfully so, who is 57 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 1987 from his now dead uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 27,581 hours on this game just by playing with furry models. This was horrible for me, as I rather have a thot daughter over a gay son. To end this, I made a Steam account 32 years later. I loaded into the game, picked my femboy avatar and my mcdonalds map and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. He called me a fucking moron because the game literally gives you hints and tells you what to do the second you join in on a world. He also told me theres no objective, you do whatever you want. He also told me he knew he was adopted and told me to off myself. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my non existent wife had died."

19065,"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of
the waters.
¬∂ And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.
¬∂ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the
firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.
¬∂ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.

19295,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

19506,"According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

19522,"I definitely recommend the game.
Garry's Mod is a fun game that you can play with your friends.
there are infinite maps infinite options.
You can create your own game very easily and the best part is you can create it with your friends.
You can make literally anything. 
You can make any idea come true in Garry's Mod.
You can play for example Prop Hunt where there are infinite rounds and every round the hunter switches, in Prop hunt there are hiders and seekers, the hiders hide from the hunter by becoming anything (Any Prop) and the hunters try to find them. Its hide and seek but way better and more fun. And the best thing is you can play it with your friends.
There are Infinite fun games on Garry's Mod any genre (Action,FPS,Horror, and more)

19610,This game is so amazing especially back in the day when this game was released
19611,"Really amazing game, it's basically multiple games within one once you find out the true potential of mods. Thousands of hours can easily be spent, and I look forward to the modding capabilities of this game in the future. Truly awesome. The only thing bad about this game is that the graphics seem somewhat outdated, but reasonable since it is after all a physics simulator. I'd give it a solid 9.5/10"
19612,the multiplayer is really good

19703,"You woke up this morning, got yourself a gun
Mama always said you'd be the chosen one
She said, ""You're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes""

You woke up this morning, all the love has gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong
But you're looking good, baby, I believe you're feeling fine
(Shame about it)
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

You woke up this morning, the world turned upside down
Thing's ain't been the same since the blues walked into town
But you're one in a million, you've got that shotgun shine
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like a voice telling you there was something you should know

Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know
The meaning of things as they appear to the others
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers

Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink
Well, you do so make up your mind to go on
'Cos when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone

When you woke up this morning, when you woke up this morning
When you woke up this morning, mama said you'd be the chosen one
When you woke up this morning, when you woke up this morning
When you woke up this morning, you got yourself a gun"

19777,"What's there not to like about being god in a sandbox? You can literally do everything and anything you could ever imagine. Want to have a toast with the boys? Boom, done. Want to rain nukes from heaven while unleashing deadly tornadoes, earthquakes, firequakes, and everything else quakes on top of a tsunami all at once? You can do that too. But, of course, the most important thing that you can do: have a sip of mountain dew straight from your gromit mug while watching a live action film in a horror theater. Fun times."

19801,"This may be the best game of the world, indeed I classified it one of my all time favorite games. You can do whatever you want and anytime you want with/without friends or with/without people in public servers. Basically a game for everything, with also mods/custom maps. But there is a catch, it needs other games to prevent Missing textures and errors but good thing this Summer Sale I manage to buy the Valve's Complete Bundle.

10/10
I would recommend it, it's freaking worth it."
19802,"I think I'm ready to write a full review after playing for about 100 hrs. (135 hrs at the time this was written.) 
Garry's mod is a sandbox game that actually allows you to do anything. Let me show you an example.

Like running away from things? Garry's mod (Nextbots)
Like running away from disasters such as torandos? get garry's mod.
Like roleplaying? Get garrys mod
Like hide and seek? Get garrys mod
Like Building a computer? Get garrys mod.
Like building your school bully then blowing it up with tnt to satisfy your unmoral desires? Get garrys mod
Like spawning an Nukeclear bomb then blowing it up and destory the whole map? Get garrys mod.

As you can see you can do anything in this game! And this is just a tiny amount of what you can do in this game. 

However this review isn't without some criticism. First off after a while some point the game feels bland like you don't wanna join it.
You do get bored after a hr of immersive game play then you leave. Garry's mod isn't enough to catch the attention of players for hours. My advice to is to not play Garry's mod if you don't wanna come back when you feel like it!
Another thing that helps is finding a server on to play on and just play on it for hrs and when your bored just switch to another server. But even multiplayer does have it's issues.

Multiplayer:
First off multiplayer completely violets what garrys mod is all about. Now there is sandbox multiplayer that allows you to do anything in singleplayer but with other strangers at least :) Let's take darkrp for example. Don't get me wrong darkrp is actually decent depending on the server you play on. It's just that darkrp your only restricted to do what the server allows you to do. Meaning no atomic bombs no building just following rules.
Now what about the people of multiplayer? Well the people of multiplayer is like a tiny box of candy with every piece having a different flavor. When you take out a piece of candy out of the box you don't know what it taste like. When you eat it, It could either be good or bad. Samething with the players on multiplayer. The players can be nice or be super nasty. This is the resson why I prevent my little sister from joining multiplayer because of that resson. I was onetime threatened to get doxed and leak my sensitive information. There are also a lot of annoying kids who swear at every sentence thinking its funny. There are also a lot of rule breakers like people in darkrp killing each other for no resson (Which is againest the rules on most servers at least.) and just ruining the fun in general. So yeah I think I covered everything I wanted in this review!

So with that being said I will give this 4 stars for being fun but sadly getting boring after a immersive gameplay.
I recommend this game but the multiplayer is a bit stinky.

19869,"This game let drop a tsar bomba on a group of alien slaves and then revive them only to send them to a pocket t dimension using the infinity gauntlet with a group of racialy motivated adventure time characeters. this game gives the player more power than they need you get bored if you dont controll yourself with how many mods you download because smaller things seem less significant and cool esentialy putting you on a power trip.

I have had very little time in this game yet the entire time ive enjoyed it and its freedom to descibe it is like trying to describbe the flavour of chocolate but ill try regardless, this game feels like you went on a fever trip after smoking a adult blue whales aproximate weight in weed and passed out, woke up in minecraft jojo style found jesus' corpse absorbed it and became a god with limitless potential the only limit being how much your pc can handle.

i would heavily reccomend this ""exerience"" to anyone and considering the game cost $5 AUD when on sale the graphics may make some people afraid that this game is ""outdated"" but the playerbase and gameplay makes up for that 100% reccomend this game."

20051,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

On its own, it features a fairly impressive physics sandbox that you can use to make silly machines or NPC battles but with mods and other UGC like dupes and saves, the potential this game has for creativity and fun absolutely skyrockets. Mods can completely change Garry's Mod from one game to another - one moment you have the single most terrifying horror game you've ever played, the next anime girls are running around with CS:GO weapons shooting at each other. If you had any doubts about getting this game, then don't because there is not one thing Garry's Mod doesn't offer. 

10/10"
20076,Its fucking epic

20099,"Old Fashioned Pumpkin Pie

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin pur√©e from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin pur√©e (can also use pur√©ed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see p√¢te bris√©e recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425¬∞F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices ‚Äî cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin pur√©e. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425¬∞F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350¬∞F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

Cool the pie on a rack, then serve:
Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours.
Serve with whipped cream."

20260,"cool game. wish it could be more cool though. it still is pretty fun with friends though. needs to have cooler stuff in the game though. I'm not saying it's not a cool game though because it really is. just the cool is at like a 9 the cool should be a 10 so i'm sad about that. Honestly they should do collaborations with different religions like Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Baha'i Faith, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Atheism, Catholicism, Rastafari, Taoism, Confucianism, Protestant, Shinto, NOT Mormonism, Chinese folk religion, Polytheism, Traditional African Religions, Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and modern Paganism. A fortnite collab would be cool too."

There is no limit to Garry's mod, but if there was, it would be downloading every mod in existence, not counting the fact you can import source film maker and blender mods, even when doing that, people will just make more mods for different things or Garry's mod and find a way to import other mods into Garry's mod and completing everything and doing everything in Garry's mod, you can do and create such wonderful things in Garry's mod.

Fantastic game, full of plain stupid fun. Oh, and did I mention that this game is from the 2000s and still being updated with a massive community of creative and awesome people constantly bringing new content into it?

20446,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Although It's a shame that the game has over time died from a lack of new features or revival campaigns."

"
20525,"I think garry's mod is one of the best games on the steam store. But it depends on what other games you have which use the source engine, if you don't have counter strike source you won't be able to use most addons correctly. So ontop of the price of gmod you also need to pay for counter strike even if you never use it you still need it. But when it works this game is amazing and it deserves all the praise people throw at it."

20624,"""It's a great game. Some would even say its the best game."" - The consensus among me and my friends reviewing this game.
As a sandbox game, the limits are your own imagination! At least, thats what they say. It has no limits, and then some. There are a plethora of community created servers, with their own quirks. Some could be sold as a standalone game! Don't believe me? This game had a community created server that started the prop hunt rage. This game has been with us for so long, and I think its time we pay tribute. If you havent downloaded already, save up 4 - 10 dollars and get spending!"
20625,"Very good game no complaints

20626,I have spend thirty hours of my time on this master piece of a game. Nuke = Funny vine boom
20627,It‚Äôs fun with friends and terrifying without.
20628,"It's a lot of fun, but you need a list

 1. Mods
 2. No guided mindset
 3. Friends

 2 is more optional, and if you're having a hard time with 1 or 3, try a multiplayer server, there's bound to be a person ready to be your friend, or just fun people to play with.

There is the unfortunate usual of mean assholes, being racist, mysoginist, or homophobic, but look through the storm of shit, you'll find your new friend soon."

20727,"This game is extremely fun, if you haven't played or heard of it, it's a must have. the biggest downside in my opinion is that having Counter Strike: source is almost required. Other than that, it's a game to burn your freetime away, and it get more and more fun the more people you play with. because the community of this game is very dedicated, the workshop is constantly getting updated and there are infinitely many fun addons to get. you can find a playermodel of almost every iconic character from popular franchises, and there are also endless amounts of chaotic picture scenes you can make with ragdolls. This game can also appeal to you if you are big into Star wars or historic weapons, as there are so many choices of weapons, from Katanas, fish, sniper rifles, 2d doom guns, bow & arrows, laser-firing wii remotes, and so, so much more. this is just skimming the top of all the comedic fun you can have in this game, and to think it's only $10 makes it seem like Facepunch is losing it's money. I'd gladly buy this game full-price."
20728,"Pretty fun. Does crash on my computer, but Don't take my Word for it. My computer is shit. Anyway game is a solid sandbox. A few things I would change like for example making it a little bit more intuitive, but honestly it is a Great experience to mess around with regard less. If you get good you could probably make something funny like Smg4 has shown. (hes the reason I got Gmod in the first place)"

20841,"Enjoyable chaos fit for all. Tons of addons, dupes, and save games to check out. Some are obviously broken tho... but beside that factor, there is simply so much stuff to check out.
Also it used to be that when the game was younger, that the amount of addons you had greatly affected your performance, and it kinda still does if you pick out certain addons to use with the rest that you choose to use. But otherwise you could easily have 1000 addons and still run the game just fine. The only downside to such is how long it'd take to download all those addons, and also the collection creation system on steam for collections. (which, unrelated to the point of this review, i think need to be reworked for the editing/creating menus of collections for adding addons to said collections so that they are far less of a pain to deal with.)

I, alongside many others however will easily suggest this game to anyone who hasn't played GMod before, or even seen it, which if you haven't seen it before, I would recommend checking out people who have played gmod before to see what kinds of things they've done in it, when it comes to people who have put videos of such onto Youtube."

if you're somehow not in the know, this game is a sandbox game where you are basically god, and you can spawn stuff in and do a bunch of other stuff, build, fight endless hordes of mobs u spawn in, etc.

the real fun comes when you get mods, which open up endless oppurtunities to expand how you play the game, and extend its lifetime thousandfold.

it's so open ended, i literally cannot describe all the things you could do in a 5 page bullet point summary list

21003,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

21266,"It all started when I was 9 years olf. My dad came home from work with an old computer (he worked in computers) and he said ""here, son. Have a video game."" I took it and installed it that noight. What he DIDN't NOT tell me was that the previous owner (who was a really they/them) had DIED while playing Gatty's GMOD. 

Later that night, when I was playing a game of game's mod, I saw a scary blac kfigure appear and say ""BOOFEDY BOOG"" and disappear. I was so scared, I ran into my dad's room (mom is also dead) and screamed ""DADDY DADDY! THE COMPITY IS HAMPITY!"" He got so mad he hit me with a belt. He then told me to never wake him up again or next time it'll be TWO belts that spank me. I was more scared of him than the game in that moment.

So I went back iot my rooooooooooooooom to play more game. Then this time, a white figure (for diversity's sake) appeared in game and said ""WHOOOOOOOO! THE ACCIDENT WAS DAD'S FAULT! YOU WERE ALSO AN ACCIDNET"" and disappeared. I didnt' want to tell dad because two belts is scarier than one. And a belt in the hand is worth two in the bush. So I kept quiet and went back to gaming. 

I then opened up Coutner Strike and saw that there were no American servers. Not that there's a problem with that, I just don't like high ping. So that's when I opened GMOD and installed a pack of AIs that would act as bobts in place of real people so I could play Counter Strike maps.

The next thing I know, I woke up with a headache and found I wasn't awake, I was in the GAME! I was fighting against the white figure and the black figure and they were terrorists and I was CT (that's ""counter terrorist"" for anyone who DOESN'T PLAY) and I had to fight against them [no I'm not done yet] and I had to save Counter Strike Garry's Mod from terrorists.

I was then bullied in voice by the figures who turned to be my mom and my mom as well (BOOM! PLOT TWIST!)!!!)!!!!!! M Night Shamalamadingdongthatmanmakesnogoodmovies and then I saved them from being dead by letting them possess me. Now my dad is taking me to a therapist for screaming so loud at night. Thanks, Garry. IF THAT IS YOUR REAL NAME....>!!!!!!

21307,"The game has a really good premise, I'm aware. It's really funny to screw around with ragdolls and there's really no limit aside from your PC and what it can handle. Here's the problem: it's the most pure sandbox you can possibly think of. There are ZERO instructions (to my knowledge) on what the various tools do, and no real suggestions on what you could do. This leave people with an incredibly small imagination like kind of staring at all of this and just thinking ""Well, now what?"" The game's incredible if you know what you're doing, according to friends, but if you don't it's kind of overwhelming. This review is more of a warning of what you intend to get yourself into with this game, but there's fun to be had, I just haven't had it yet (as seen with my very low hours) and had no motivation to find it. Still, if you want to try animation, this is for some stupid reason a valid engine for 3D animation. Still, set a timer for about an hour and 50 minutes while you play and pause it when you take a break, just so you know when to refund it if it doesn't click."

21444,"-According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.

-Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.

-The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

-Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

-Ooh, black and yellow!

-Let's shake it up a little.

-Barry! Breakfast is ready!

-Coming!

-Hang on a second.

-Hello?

-Barry?

-Adam?

-Can you believe this is happening?

-I can't.

-I'll pick you up.

-Looking sharp.

-Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.

-Sorry. I'm excited.

-Here's the graduate.

-We're very proud of you, son.

-A perfect report card, all B's.

-Very proud.

-Ma! I got a thing going here.

-You got lint on your fuzz.

-Ow! That's me!

-Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.

-Bye!

-Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!

-Hey, Adam.

-Hey, Barry.

-Is that fuzz gel?

-A little. Special day, graduation.

-Never thought I'd make it.

-Three days grade school, three days high school.

-Those were awkward.

-Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.

-You did come back different.

-Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

-Hear about Frankie?

-Yeah.

-You going to the funeral?

-No, I'm not going.

-Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.

-Don't waste it on a squirrel.

-Such a hothead.

-I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.

-I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.

-That's why we don't need vacations.

-Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.

-Well, Adam, today we are men.

-We are!

-Bee-men.

-Amen!

-Hallelujah!

-Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

-Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.

-That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!

-Will we pick our job today?, I heard it's just orientation.

-Heads up! Here we go.

-Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.

-Wonder what it'll be like?

-A little scary.

-Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group."

21556,"Uh, addicts arise, when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side, bitch
Reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming, ""Tyler, stop""
The big bad wolf to me you're just a minor fox
Red riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of, like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch, ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang will be diminished, Bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenants daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it
Face it, me and Ace's is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me, ""Tyler toughen up""
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Haagen Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilly chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentlemen
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it moron, snorting Oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dykes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open

21561,"This game saved my life.

I am 22.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
21562,"its a good game i love it plus the addons are freee if you got this game your gonna enjoy it

21573,kill things yes
21574,super fun best thing ever
21575,yes
21576,"This is quite a fun game to play around in and do endless challenges and mods with friends.

The almost no end to things you can do makes it an easy choice to play again. Even though it can get annoying having to wait for server mods to load and you might not always have friends to play with.

The game does have a refreshing replayability role though and the tools we are giving are enough to keep our brains in our own creative world for hours on end.

It does deserve a nice 9/10. Not 10/10 because of the almost endless loading screens, the lonely feeling when not playing with friends, and the fact that when downloading mods sometimes it won'y work without some other mod that you had to get for it all to work.

Overall this game was great for a couple years but lately, it has shown many signs that it has died out.

RIP the golden age of video games."

21579,fun and good game

21582,"The freedom and creativity this game can unlock is amazing, playing it with friends and on servers is a blast. mods for just about anything are available and are just one click to install due to steam workshop.

only flaw I see is a small (by today's standards) world size limit, but i fully understand its a limit of the source engine at the time it was made."

21596,"Being a single parent to my daughter‚Äîwho is now 17‚Äîhas been difficult for the past two years; whether it's supporting my daughter's cello lessons, or catching up with her usage of the Xbox Game Pass, I've tried. Finding ways to connect with her through hobbies most natural for her age has been a tough journey, for she is always out with friends now, or watching Disney+ in her room.

I let her customize my Steam profile for me‚ÄîI asked for a goofy theme, and got something else instead, but as long as it makes her happy, so am I‚Äîand bought her Garry's Mod to see if I could perhaps play alongside her.

I recall all sorts of fun modes such as Prop Hunt back in my college days, groups of friends and online folks playing in-between study sessions. The highlights of those memories, those bits of enthusiasm, now I can share them with my Sarah. For the first time in the past five years, I was able to teach her a thing or two about a game! Come to think of it, this is the happiest I have ever seen her while being 'Player 2' for a change.

After spending countless hours playing this in the past, now I can make it easier for Sarah while she takes her Steam Deck whenever we go out camping at our local lake. If her mother hadn't passed away due to C-19, I know she would be here with us, proud to see our beloved daughter spend some time as an extroverted adolescent. Now Sarah's all into crazy mods and physics videos! Thank you for bringing new, geeky moments for me to share with my little girl!"

21675,"WHAT CAN I SAY About Garry's Mod. Gareth's Modification. Like War and Peace there is seemingly no end to the seamless blending of suffering and joy. You will laugh, you will cry, you will come to know this game as a family member, like a son you can't entirely relate to despite trying your best, or perhaps an uncle who gets a little too political at the thanksgiving table. This game has excellent finger-feel. I press the W key and watch as my virtual avatar glides across the soft, summer grass as though it were effortless, hearing the crunch of a field, the click-clack of my virtual feet moving across virtual pavement. This is Garry's Mod (Gareth's Modification). When I go to GM_Construct (The GM stands for Garry's Mod) I can build anything my imagination so desires, all while being watched by a strange man of black, my guardian angel perhaps. If building does not suit my fancy I can change modes with the press of a button! I can become a masked man playing a game not unlike the popular award-winning video game Among Us. I can become a common object (Referred to as ""props"" in this game) and hide as alien hunters seek me! Much like the popular award-winning video game Among Us. Or Perhaps, if I would prefer to challenge my creativity, I can enter a mode in which I must build a ship to survive a flood and then battle against others in Pirate-esk warfare. NOT like the popular award-winning video game Among Us.

What more could I possibly say in regards to this incredible work of art? A gift to the generations. Were my words to be etched into history in regards to my thoughts on this game what would I say? 

Screw you Garry, join my server so I can get the stupid achievement. That's what I'd say."

21706,"One of the greatest games ever made. Let's you push the limits of your imagination (and the source engine).

It's hard to describe what garry's mod is. On one hand, it's a sandbox with the choice of adding 1000's of mods to play with. Want to pit some dark souls boss against a resident evil one? Go ahead! Set up a massive firefight between stormtroopers xenomorphs? Sure!! Even if you don't want to touch the mods (it's in the title so, why not?) you can still have loads of fun with the tools the game comes with. Pose models, position lights, the skybox is the limit with this game. 

On the other hand, there are countless custom multiplayer modes which were the foundation for some of the greatest multiplayer games today. Trouble in Terrorist Town, prop hunt, deathrun (which is sadly dead from what I could find). The games are janky at times and filled with custom mods, but it only adds to the charm of the game. Role Playing servers can also get intensely fun and immersive with the right community. 

Don't be intimidated with the lack of direction the game gives you. Just go play and see what happens."

The dynamic nature of Garry's Mod is what makes this game so enjoyable. You can have anything from large-scale NPC battles to weird role play. The list is not limitless, since this game is very much limited by its engine, however it offers a large enough list of things to do that it makes the game play entirely up to the person and their imagination. The game modes made available to the player are numerous and many are enjoyable with random people or your friends.

[b]Maps and Textures[/b] - [i]8/10[/i]
Despite being released for Half Life 2, in 2004, the graphical integrity and quality for many custom-made maps is extremely outstanding, even by today's standards. The thematic qualities of different user-made maps varies, as one can guess, but the overall quality is very much there. The largest challenge that most maps suffer from is grass texture issues, in which the grass does not load properly on many maps, anymore. This is usually caused by different kinds of mods, but it remains to be a long-time issue prevalent in classic and modern maps. The other largest challenge with the variety of maps is finding specific maps with AI Nodes and Navigation meshes. What these meshes do is that they allow NPCs and different kinds of Nextbots move around on the map. Sadly, many maps lack the nodegraph or navigational meshes needed and so this may limit your choices of maps, extensively, depending on what you're looking for. Another additional problem, one that is extremely common-place, is the need for additional games to be downloaded and mounted onto Garry's Mod. This is a common issue, since many custom maps are designed with custom textures added, these textures can range from set pieces and props, to level textures and many of them are used from other games, such as Counter Strike: Source or Day of Defeat: Source. As a result, not only are you downloading Garry's Mod, but you are also downloading three or four additional games and mounting them in Garry's Mod, to allow various levels and custom maps to use certain texture settings. It's a pain and frankly can make this game harder to justify, when it sacrifices tons of space on your drive. However, these are just precautionary warnings.

[b]NPCs[/b] - [i]7/10[/i]
NPCs are a major part of game play and make up a significant chunk of my personal play time on this game. The world of NPCs is vast and features a lot of options, ranging from simple reskinned combine soldiers to fully mounted, configured, and developed custom NPCs with their own base systems and everything. In this review we will be looking at the two most common types on the Workshop - reskinned NPCs and VJ Base NPCs. The reskinned NPCs are self-explanatory, but are essentially the most easily found mods on the Workshop. They are usually some of the simplest and are therefor the easiest to use in your games. With some extra mods and tools, you can easily craft a large and highly dynamic experience with modded NPCs using custom weapons. They are heavily limited by the aforementioned nodegraphing that is necessary in custom maps, but with this exception being made, they are some of the most fun and simplest to use. The other most popular NPC type is VJ Base NPCs, which use a separately customized system and are far more intelligent compared to the base-game NPCs that are simple reskins. These NPCs are not reliant on the nodegraphs and are therefore superior when it comes to using them on more maps. However, they are more demanding on your server and can easily crash your game, if there is too much happening, at once. There is also many mods that use VJ Base, that haven't been properly updated or taken care of, being abandoned by their mod authors, which causes significant issues on your game.

[b]Weapons[/b] - [i]8/10[/i]
As previously mentioned, the dynamic nature of Garry's Mod enables you to easily mod and change your game play to fit your needs. This is especially the case when it comes to weapons. The vast amount of guns, explosives, melee weapons, and nuclear weapons that can be downloaded is extremely extensive. Many weapons can range in quality, some being simple and using the default Half Life style and system of gun play to the more modern and advanced gun-modifying systems of CW 2.0 and TFA. The choice is entirely up to you and your preferences, as well as your willingness to try out new and strange things. The use of guns is more prevalent compared to the modding of melee weapons, on the workshop, meaning that most mods will change how guns work and feel, while melee weapons are available, but don't offer a lot in the way of changing game play from the original days of Half Life 2 and using a crowbar. All around, with the advancement of different custom-made systems, like the Grewitch Emplacements and Tanks, as well as the aforementioned gun modifying mods, has seriously unlocked the possibilities made available to you that were previously unavailable.

[b]Engine[/b] - [i]6/10[/i]
This game is extremely fun and offers a lot, but the modding community is unfortunately stuck with the current engine of Source. This means that there are massive limits set on the abilities that different mod authors can and can't do. The world of Gmod is sadly condemned to the restrictions set in place, when the developers were designing Half Life 2. This means that massive battles of over several hundred men are not possible, maps larger than 1/2 km (0.3 miles) are not possible, and having too many props can easily dismantle frame rate. The largest of these challenges being that mod authors have basically outpaced the system and severe limitations set by the Source engine. While Source is not a terrible engine, it is sadly an engine that suffers from its age and the numerous limits set for it. The modding community has very easily outpaced it."

21766,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

21864,i built a penis then i was brutally murdered by a 1d dog
21865,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

22203,got baned cause hotdogs 10/10
22204,"Essentially, Garry's mod, is a sandbox game created from Valve's source engine and released in 2006.

It basically has no set objectives, you as the player, can freely do what you please with objects and the world around you. This is a mod for the creative, for the fun, its experimentation, learning and great social interaction. Its basically just silly goose time!

From manipulation to building, there are integrated mods,maps, props, characters and contraptions to use. Its a free for all, for the creative and great to play with friends.

Its an absolute classic with overwhelming reviews.

If  you are this way inclined go for your life, what other ways to do this shit than in real life!"
22205,this game sucks
22206,"yea
plz
dont"
22207,"great game, but you might want to get an experienced friend to help you learn the ropes just like i was able to. the servers are prettyy laggy and take a while to load into for the first time, but it‚Äôs worth it for the experience that comes with meeting new people and just having a fun time. overall 9/10"
22208,who is garry.
22209,"downloaded a pack of furniture but as cars. Got a car that is made of kleiners that makes screams and ""it's your turn gordon"" as the engine sounds, as a bonus to the other cars, without any notification that I would get this wonderful vehicle.

22228,My brother has too many hours on this cat making game.
22229,"It's a fun game where you can mess around and do whatever you want, it's better with community addons and a great time waster, and you can even make videos with it, as you may have heard people describe this game, it's ""Minecraft but Half-Life 2"" and also such a shame that the game is badly optimized and runs bad and crashes no matter what PC you're on and that you need to have Counter Strike: Source for most textures and models and people need the same addons or they will have to wait until the game installs some things so you can join and there will be a bunch of missing models and textures"

22307,"This game is the most terrible monotous thing ever, no effort or goal whatsoever, dont play it unless you want to be surrounded by idiots and morons, making content for it is also stupid and a dead-end goal.

DONT BUY IT.

Update 01/072022: THIS GAME IS STILL A BITCH TO PLAY I RECOMMEND GETTING THIS FOR LOSING EVERYTHING THAT YOU LOVED IN THE WORLD AND BEING A VICTIM OR A MINDLESS EFFORTLESS CONSUMER YOU BASTARDS

Update 29/07/2022: ITS A WASTE OF LIFE AND TIME AND RUINS YOUR SELF ESTEEM AND MAKES YOU GULLIBLE AND WIMPY

Update 20/08/2022: This game is still a bad source of theft, bad morality and time wasting, why you morons still play it is beyond me but i just play it for the sake of trying to give this stupid game an objective, dont buy this waste of life, if you saw it in an youtube video, dont buy it either, just dont.

Update 26/08/2022: i may give this game a second chance is there is a objective for the game.

Update 12/09/2022: dont trust this games community, they are very weird and scary and stupid."

22584,"What is there to say that hasn't already been said, really? I mean, it's gmod. Everyone loves gmod. A friend of mine has, multiple times, described this game as being every single game in one.

22593,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

Low lives who suck up to staff of servers. Player who just want to play/grind/create and then there is me who does not care about the rules after I hear the fateful sound of ""Im calling an Admin"" coming from some 8 year old on their mother computer. This game is an experience you need and I definitley recommend it."

22871,"Addicting and very fun. Got this game because a friend wanted to try Prop Hunt and found that I really enjoy it, especially jumping on public servers. It is definitely a big creative outlet with many maps, assets, mods, and more that make each play (of whatever gamemode you're playing) unique. You have the possibility to connect with people locally and around the world, play through countless maps and discover new tricks and downloads. It's a great game to get to feed your inner creative and test your mind (in Prop Hunt). You may need some games to have assets load in on common maps, which might cost more but is a great investment in the long run."

22957,"[h1]A must-have for every player [/h1]
Garry's mod is a masterpiece when it comes to being a sandbox game. It's easy to play with friends or singleplayer and you have tons of diffirent choices you can make with this game. The workshop is pretty much the main concept of it then, which allows you to try out custom made gamemodes, maps, showcases, weapons, entities and much more, even change the whole look of the original game. The devs also keep the game regulary updated and listen to our responses. 

From the price (especially when being on sale) and overall content you can get with this game. It's a must-have for every steam user and everyone should at least try it out once."

23065,"Personally I love Garry's Mod, I remember when I was younger I would watch venturiantale play this and I've always dreamed of having the freedom to play a game where you could make and spawn anything you want, The game mechanics are fairly easy to learn and I've always been happy playing this game, Even multiplayer servers are nice.. I guess well it depends but in my 90 hours of playing this I think I'd rate this game a 8/10. some times GM gets annoying because it crashes and you sometimes have to get an addon just to have a wall texture in some maps. but other than that I have no problem, You can get bored of this game but I always come back to it when I get bored. It's definetly worth the money."

23448,"now now, lets be honest, If you found this game, you know what you were looking for, a sandbox game you can burn more free time than you thought you ever had into a game with few limitations.  the best way to sum up only half of what you can do is as follows; ""You can be Master Chief riding a T 90 MS using a lightsaber through a crowd of Minecraft zombies who have plasma cannons, while an ARC 170 dogfights a spitfire in space, on the moon.""  if that doesn't suit you, then try building an incredibly complex machine with WIREMOD, or just download some particles and ragdolls and master the posing tools.  that doesn't work? try highly organized team battles, free for alls while riding horses, get trapped in a Pok√©ball and thrown off a cliff, or terrorize your friends with nexbots.

If the fandom is big enough, or old enough, you WILL find it on the workshop in one form or another.

I recommend this game with the 1600(and counting) hours I have in it."

23643,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

23954,"I can't fucking believe this. Pink from 'Among Us' ruined my marriage.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.


""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

24053,"Garry's mod. In my 3000 hours of modding, crashes, and raging friends, I didn't feel like any amount of my time was wasted. I didn't enjoy the online multiplayer that much actually. I think that most servers are just pure garbage. What I have spent the most time doing in Garry's mod was launching Peer to Peer servers to play with my friends. I would do this every day. Buy this game on steam, don't wait for a sale, it's always worth it. By the way, there are  8760 hours in a year, so I have wasted almost half a year playing this game. No regrets."

24093,"Despite the age of this here video game, the refinement Garret's Moderation has required is like a vintage wine; it only gets better with age. The Garret's Moderation community has crafted such refined products in the workshop, such as an un-unaliveable Shrek that totally wrecks your shit, Elmo, and Sans Undertale. The interface is lovely as well. To anyone that believes in true gaming and want such an exquisite experience, Garret's Moderation is the game for you.

24163,"This game defined the joy and nostalgia of an entire generation of internet gremlins; nowadays, it's full of has-beens playing washed-up, uninteresting stories. Built upon an engine that is nearly 2 decades old and essentially requiring the additional purchase of Counter-Strike Source, Garry's Mod is a game defined best by its infinite replayability. Want to be Freddy Fazbear piloting the TARDIS through Star Wars planets? You can do that. You want to get a bunch of friends together and play a private game of Prop Hunt and build life time memories? You can do that. This game has anything you could ask for; however, after a decade of playing Garry's Mod, the memories stick and overwrite the new to be had, and prevent any fun to be had and instead being replaced by the eternal longing for the past. 

Is this a good game? It's one of the best. Built upon one of the most key, industry-defining titles and engines, and supported with thousands, if not millions, of mods from its very dedicated fan-base, Garry's Mod is a game worth checking out if you are new to PC, looking to revisit better times, or just looking for something to kill some time. 

Tl;dr: buy it and CSS."

24215,"My great grandchildren said I should play this game, I'm going senile so they thought it would be a good pastime as i inch closer to the unknown. After 300 hours I can positively say that rearranging ragdolls into old memories like my first wedding and when I lost my virginity(Alex was a stand-in, god bless Marie RIP), that Geralds Modification is a great way to spend your time in the retirement home, your house, your porn den, your grand daughters baby shower, and your deathbed you will have fun. Perks for me because when people ask why im playing in public i can blame it on alzheimers, however, sometimes i am playing it and dont realize it which means I really am ging senile. 10/10 game."

24252,"I must remark,

I'm very gracious to have been gifted this game by a friend.
When I first began playing ""Garry's Mod"", I finally realized that this was the part of my life that had been missing. Like the lost puzzle piece had been found.

This computer game is quite enjoyable when playing with friends, a myriad of hours playing Sandbox, hysterically laughing as we compete in You Touched it Last, Prop Hunt, or Gun Game, mocking bad horror maps, or have an appalling time on a good map that manages to spook us.

I have had many fun times from this game, I could never recommend a game more. If you have enough currency to cough up, this is a purchase you won't regret.

Thank you, Mr. Garry, for your mod."

24388,"I've always been lookin' for games where I can do whatever the heck I want. Garry's Mod is EXACTLY that! What's particularly immersive is playing with NPCs, making them fight and whatnot. Sure, you might need addons, but they're free, and don't even take up that much extra space for the game! This is definitely my favorite physics and artificial intelligence sandbox. If you like screwing around with either of those and you like feeling like a god/goddess, this is an AWESOME game. With the local multiplayer, and lots of realistic features, it's also good for setting up immersive little games with your friends. I would definitely recommend this if you want to have a good time with your friends and even by yourself."
24389,There have been many different opinions on this game and I am here to set the record straight. Through the 120 hours I have played this game I can say with 100% certainty that this game is definitely a game that people play.

this game is easily a fantastic game. the reach of creativity the mods can give you is endless. there are thousands on thousands of mods created for this game specifically in order to make your experience the best possible. whatever you can think of, whatever games you like, theres probably a mod for it. 
this games created many memories for me over the years. ive been playing it for years, nearly a decade now. this game always finds ways to keep me entertained, especially with friends. the possibilities are nearly endless. do what you want, and enjoy the game.

At the camp, they gave us electromod therapy to mod us into beta males. I resisted the treatment, being a Gmod male, you cant Gmod me out of being Gmoded. I fooled the counselors into thinking they had successfully Gmoded be into a beta male, and i returned home. To this day, i live a double life‚Äî one for my parents, who still cannot accept Gmorbality, and one where its always Gmod time."

24639,"I bought this game at around 2020 just to make my self entertained while quarantine was occurring. It turns out, this was not just a grab-n-go type of game, no no no. This game is a masterpiece of the source engine and a gem in the store. Garry's Mod also has an amazing community that is active 24/7 creating dupes, mods, models and so much more!
The multiplayer in this game is okay, but not at its peak. 2012 was the best time to play Garry's Mod for the multiplayer, also in 2012, Prop Hunt was one of the reasons the game was so popular. 
If your gonna play a multiplayer gamemode(s), make sure to play DarkRP, its one of the more active gamemodes upon the others.
If you are going to buy the game, I really would recommend getting this game if you have $10 lying around. Its an amazing game once you add at least 10 mods and play on a server."

24659,"I have a very very fond opinion on this game, while the game may not be perfect my memories are. I met almost all my friends on steam from playing Garry's Mod. I had relationships met my first serious girlfriend from this game. I have screenshots saved to a usb of old friends who passed away that I used to play with. I miss waking up everyday logging into steam playing GMod with my friends for hours and hours. The game has a very special place in my heart. I remember watching Seananners and Gassymexican play PHunt and TTT which was just a thrill to 13 year old me. I was an admin for multiple servers throughout my time in this game. From TTT Prop Hunt Star Wars RP, and even death run. I played so many games made so many memories and sometimes I miss the ""good ol times"" because the good times for me where with Garry's Mod. I know they are working on a new version of the game and I hope it sparks the love I have again and that maybe I can even meat new people and make new friends. I have been friends with the people I met on here going on 6 years now. I l0ove this game so much with all my heart. Thank you for creating such amazing memories. This was also the game to get me started in the PC world. I remember playing phunt with my friends on my shitty old laptop. Now I am here typing this on a 2 thousand dollar setup and I just hope anyone who still plays this game for the first time can make the same memories I did with this game <3"

This game is great both online and offline. I mostly went offline for the time period I tried this game, and still had a great time. This game is never-ending fun; there is always something new to discover. 
I love how you can do anything you want. The sky is the limit.

All you really need to know about this game is that it is low-end, fun, and there is always something new to discover. You can do whatever you want, and there is endless content. Why not get it?

Multiplayer is what got me stuck into the game with all the servers, players and community. Multiplayer has heaps of game modes including my favourite dark rp. I highly recommend this game for people who want to waste  time and have an great time doing it."

24823,"f you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, go below, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

I remember watching a DanTDM video of a rocket powered minecraft cauldron and I asked my dad to buy this so called minecraft mod.

25710,"Garry if he made a game about zombies, but instead of a generic name for a show or movie he called the game a very original and organic name of 'The Walking Dead: Garry's edition"". This is a great game where you can do a plethora of crazy and quirky things, you can put any idea that comes to your head into this game. the walking dead also has that same concept except they milked it for 11+ seasons and decided to make 3 movies after the show has ended. Garry never did that because he forgot about this game, what he didn't forget about was his son, which in my honest opinion is much more worthless than this game but to each their own. He thought it would be a good idea to make his son a Roblox cake for his birthday, while Roblox is a game that can be quite litty at times, fails to have one key aspect, BITCHES! this completely ruins the game because us the players of such games as Garrys mod and Counter Strike: Global Offensive need that desperately."

25828,Its fun once you get some mods.
25829,"If we're talking about the base game, it's quite bland not much to do and it gets boring fast. But it's the community made addons that truly make this game as legendary as it is. different avatars weapons items enemies and gamemodes. this game, with mods never gets boring. and if it does just install more shit. (although it probably isn't the greatest for people without much disk space i would to play this game you should have atleast 80gb of disk space to truly expierience this game."

25937,"This game is everything. I spent years in Gmod gamer school in deepest Tibet in order to play this game, I sacrificed everything for it; I sold my faith, my money, my dignity - now all I have left is my virginity. I would literally die for this game. This game is everything to me. When my whole family tragically passed away in an accident with a comically large lemon press, this game was here for me. God bless this game and its developers, and may those who doubt this game, God-willing, be struck down by the might of the heavens and earth. Amen and god bless."

26053,"2,200 and 3 hours later and it's finally time for a review. This game was and is pretty amazing for what it's worth. Great way to make friends and lose track of time printing money just for it to get stolen. I don't have much to say because this game pretty much speaks for itself. But I will say this, many memories were made here and I still hope to make more.  Shoutout to Garry and his silly mod."

pretty cool"

26260,verry good
26261,This is the biggest piece of of a shit a game i have ever played. Gameplay is unplayable to basically that means there is no gameplay. You spend 20 minutes downloading the shit and then you get booted in 20 seconds. I would recommend this game for either people on their deathbed just wanting something to get their quicker. Either way this for animals. This is for Nick Wild and his friends. Humans should not play this game. PS. please bring back the Bubblegum Mcflurry

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

26697,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

26699,"Even though i do recommend this game, i only recommend it for people who would play with friends in private lobbies. I played a ton a couple years ago but that was when all the official servers were up and running. Now that ive returned to try and play i have realized a lot of the gamemodes dont have official servers anymore... its full of mic-spamming kids on unofficial servers that take forever to load into bcuz they jack it up with so many unneeded mods and attachments."
26700,its a great game bet you play it!

It's not really my cup of tea anymore because a lot of what made this great has been done better by other games, in my opinion. Lots of fun if you're very creative, but still enjoyed my time with it."
26720,this game is very funny. i like to kill both npcs of characters i hate and love. also very customizable (obviously). i just love this game with every inch of my being and play it as much as i can.

26777,"I love Morbius, Morbius is the magnum opus of all Marvel movies. I don't want to see Morbius in the MCU because it would ruin the perfection of such cinema. Morbius has surpassed any modern movie since the Godfather. Anyone to consider Morbius a ""Bad"" movie is simply not educated in the industry of film. Morbius has such a compelling arc from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end. His arc is so important to the Sonyverse as a whole and I'm really excited to see ""Morbius 2 Morebius"" in theaters in 2025."

Bensinpriset ligger nu p√• 23:33 kronor litern och dieselpriset p√• 24:31 kronor litern.

Drivmedelspriserna h√∂jdes √§ven p√• m√•ndagen samt i fredags.

EU:s nya sanktionspaket, som stoppar st√∂rre delen av den ryska oljeimporten, fick oljepriserna att stiga under tisdagen. P√• f√∂rmiddagen ligger priset p√• ett fat Nordsj√∂olja p√• runt 123 dollar, den h√∂gsta niv√•n p√• tv√• m√•nader.

26957,"This game relies on YOU to make it as fun as possible, Which is not hard considering the uncountable amount of fun I have had on this game may it be on a server, with friends in sandbox (definitely recommend), or even alone in sandbox. most definitely worth the small amount of money compared to how much fun you can have on this game. Also, if you have friends that have it or can get it and even if you have nobody to play with, you can most likely find someone with it on steam or even in game to play with. would even recommend getting it to play alone just because how easy it is to have an immense amount of fun playing this game. Take it from somebody who has spent about 700 hours on this game (probably more than half of which in single-player). I am happy to say i do not regret a single nanosecond of playing this game out of my 639.5 hours on it :)."

27015,"this game is actually super fun. the loading times are a wee bit slow but to be fair the game is over 10 years old. i always love playing this with my buddies and running from next bots like obunga and nerd. I've always had a soft spot for this game since i grew up watching vanoss gaming. there is such an insane amount of things in the workshop that you have thousands of hours just in maps and mods alone. a mod that i would really recommend is the Trevor Henderson mod. it adds a bunch of different Trevor horror creatures like siren head and day 17. even without mods there's still a bunch of servers you can do with multiplayer like TTT, prop hunt, death run, you name it."

27151,"This game is honestly so mid. I wish it would just disappear and then come back because of how mid it is. Also, the mods are great but when you play it alone its scary and terrible. You literally have to rely on your friends and only your friends to have a good time playing this game. My final thoughts are I would give this game a 7/10 and I would say its mid."

27210,"Gmod... What a game. Garry's mod... what a game. A game where Garry mods stuff... what a game. Countless memories, Countless mods, Countless friends that i have made on here. I can remember the smell of burning food because my dad would beat the shit out of my mom while she was cooking and the food would just sit there and burn, I would play gmod to get away from it all. Gmod has done nothing but help me escape from reality, It was my peace of mind, my security. I would play it night and day and sometimes I even thought I was Garry. But then like a car crash, I would snap back to reality and realize that I was still stuck in the same crack house with my stupid mom and dad. Garry saved me. The mods helped me. and the game freed me. i recommend this game to anyone who thinks about running away from it all and starting a new life. You can be whoever you want inside of garry's mod. You know, I heard a saying once. I think it went like ""In a world where you can be whoever you want, Be yourself. Anyway, This game is great and if you are debating buying it. Don't. it will make you fall down a dark spiral of depression. It will make your normal life never amount to what it could've been in gmod. You will wake up and only want gmod. You will hate your life because gmod is where you can really live. You will start using heroin, so you can black out and be in gmod. You will lose your wife, your kids, yourself. You will lose everything you've ever loved. So even though it is a great game. DO NOT BUY IT. Please enjoy your life and do not lose it to gmod. I miss my kids."

27347,"[h1]Before I start[/h1]

Nobody can resist Garry's Mod for it's creativity. Sure it might be very old and unoptimized but from all the hours that I have played, it has changed. from increasing the max addon size limit to adding it's own features even in 2022.


[h1]Pro's[/h1]

[b]1.[/b] From years and years of experience, it has a lot of in-game tools. (including the large amount of addons)

[b]2.[/b] It's unlikely for you to find any malware in the well-rated addons. (I have only heard of malware in some addons but yet again, it's so hard to find actual malware unless you look at the badly rated ones)

[b]3.[/b] Garry's mod inspired many people to make content. You can easily make content from animation to cinematics using this game. (Even I managed to make some content out of this)

[b]4.[/b] Endless fun. You can go from feeling like a noob to laughing your __s off in a mere year of playing Garry's Mod.

[b]5.[/b] Multiplayer. It has plenty of community created game-modes and servers. And you can host one yourself too with not only p2p, but also a dedicated server and/or LAN servers.




[h1]Cons[/h1]

[b]1.[/b] It's hard for new people to understand this game. (but usually the hints help with that)

[b]2.[/b] A lot of the multiplayer gamemodes and servers can be unbalanced or empty. most people like one certain gamemode which causes this imbalance.

[b]3.[/b] Connecting to any multiplayer server usually takes long especially with all the addons on the server. I got used to it at least.

[b]4.[/b] Addon conflicts may or may not happen. Luckily, the Garry's Mod developers made a solution to this issue by showing what addon is causing what issue. And the error message(s) is/are the real focus of solving such issue. Sometimes it's difficult to find what addon conflicts with another.




[h1]Rating[/h1]
I'd give it a 9.25/10. nothing is perfect."

27380,Its a really fun free based game where you can download & play any mod or maps that people have made! Totally would recommend trying out this game!
27381,yes
27382,"It's very fun. There are a lot of creative add-ons and maps, which makes the game really fun!
Quality: Not bad but you can enhance this with add-ons
Gameplay: It's not crazy fun without addons, but it's still playable if you have an extremely creative mind

My whole views on it: It's great. It was extremely fun when I first played it with no addons but with the addons I have now, it makes my whole game more realistic-ish and more fun. I like everything I have.

In a whole sense: 100% should buy it. Definitely worth the money."
27383,i love valve and sandbox games idk they just have this charm to them that make them so special
27384,"honestly this is a fun game and i think its worth the money, there are lots of cool downloadable skins and lots of maps and mods and so much more and i love this game"

27395,"Garry's mod is good. its really fun to play with friends, you can do wacky stuff like make a really fast car or make and an epic battle scene with your favorite addon. For addons they have everything like real life gun or a fucking kfc bucket. Most of the thing you need for some addon, you will need any half-life game and counter strike source for most thing. this game is worth your 10 bucks. so get your friends, gear up with cool addons and have fun doing the most dumb shit every!"

27527,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

27588,I DONT HAVE IT BOUGHT BUT I CAN REVIEW SO I CAN RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR FREE TRIAL
27589,gmo
27590,IDONT UNDERSTAND GAME#
27591,who the fuck is garry and why did he make such a good mod
27592,"With about an estimated 5k hours stretched across several accounts, this game was fun, WAS. Everything post late 2019-2020 in this game fucking SUCKS. I dunno what happened but it just seems like I've experienced everything, and this game is meant to be replayable with numerous amounts of game modes. I'm gonna split this review into multiple topics that I believe hold my argument up.

Let's start off with TTT. It has been taken over by inventory systems, which I don't mind, I've put more hours into those servers more than I would like to admit and probably got a gambling addiction from them. But they're ALL. THE. SAME. Same code, same shit. Almost everything uses the old moat code because everyone saw how that titan did after it fell. They're show very little variety over each other and now I feel like playing them is a chore. After deconning everything on Tera about 5-6 months ago I came back just out of boredom and was met with the new player experience. Not fun. Didn't stay long. New players just won't understand or will get discouraged because some sweatlord with a chell model killed them with their cosmic/planetary gun. That's just how it goes, it's always been like that. BUT Tera does do a good job at welcoming them and giving them a meh ascended to start out with because they were aware that this would be an issue. I don't know if they still do that anymore, but that was the most notable thing that I noticed back when I joined the server in October. I think, I dunno I'm bad with dates. GarnetGaming is so popular because it's just barebones TTT but with CS knives because they have to do that for everything. Velk and Tera should adopt ways to teach players about the economy and gun system. Because the first thing new players see is a black screen that only tells them they have an inventory, guide them through the system with like a tutorial or something. But with the options of Velk and Tera, they're most likely going to join both of them and see nothing unique between the two. They're just the same server. Now you could argue with gun difference but that becomes obsolete because both of the servers do absolutely NOTHING to change the core gameplay. It's just become Call of Duty at this point. I swear every year I see a new inventory server that uses the moat code and join to be met with disappointment. 
I am DESPERATELY trying to find a server that does something different. Speaking of servers that did something differently, Pluto. Someone revive Pluto. Please. I would but I am not very code savvy and have no idea how to run or even start a server. Pluto was the most fun I've had on this game because it was something fresh and not just another moat clone with a new coat of paint. 

Gmod is just not what is used to be. I'm sure you've heard it a fuck ton of times relating to old games but it is AGGRESSIVELY present with gmod. With the community refusing to adapt and change this game's entertainment value slowly became to fade away. Nothing new is ever made anymore and it's all just the same shit. Now, if you're JUST NOW buying this 16 year old source mod and going into it with the intention to play sandbox alone or with your buddies, GREAT. This game was intended to be a sandbox game. You will 100% have fun with the multiplayer but once you play it enough you will become jaded. Because no one wants to change or adapt and only want to do the things they know will rack in player counts.
This is destined to happen to more players that have this exact issue since nothing is changing. Whenever I was playing Tera I always felt disappointed that the players I used to play with constantly had stopped playing. 

Now. If you look closely in the gamemodes list. You may see two little letters that stand out. 'RP'. This isn't just a TTT issue, this has affected I think the second biggest game mode. But at least these servers change up the setting and add related weapons, playermodels, etc. So I can't nag on them much. 

Idk maybe I've played this game too much

27720,"just another 1000+ game hour review. I have enjoyed my time in this game greatly. From dicking around on gm_fork with npcs, to flying a huey in gm_bigcity to attack the twin towers. This isn't a game to be that can describe through text. It really is a sandbox, a community sandbox that has a fuck ton of maps, npcs, weapons, props, wiring, ideas, gamemodes, servers, nice people, shitty people, and awesome adventures. This is a steam library must-have."
27721,Yes.
27722,very good chad moment
27723,yes
27724,very sexy game would smash if i could
27725,fun

27830,"Great fun, but I wish I could have a better experience with it. Local multiplayer would go a long way.
Trying to play with anyone online inevitably means downloading gigabytes' worth of crap like random guns and vehicles, or joining a public server full of morons that just want to troll you.

But messing around on your own is pretty fun. I think it's worth it for the goofy scenarios you can make. Feels pretty lonely after a while, but it's fun to return to periodically."

27934,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

"
28296,good.
28297,Gary's mod is one  of the best building games i have ever seen next to mine craft. VALVE¬Æ and Face punch studios have obviously put a lot of thought into this game. I think my favorite part is that you can mod this game to the maximum. I have also played Valve's Portal games. (Awesome job on those too.) Anyways Valve and face punch studios has made steam a place for gamers to do almost anything. So thank you Valve and face punch. That is all goodbye now.

(RUUEHEHEHEHEHEEHE) I have been arrested for multiple crimes (AHHHHHHHHHHHHH) including: Battery on a police officer (WHAT), Grand theft, Declaring war on Italy, and public indecency (RUHEHEHEEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE X2 speed). I will be escaping prison on, MARCH 28TH! After that.... I WILL TAKE OVER THE WORLD

Greetings! Quandale Dingle here. My cousin Henry Dinglenut got arrested for putting TNT in a daycare center. (WHAT THE FUCK??) I put a camera in Joe Biden's bathroom and watched him take a poop. (WHAT????) My Asian brother, Quanliling Dingle put illegal substances in my ramen and I died.

Hey, Quandale Dingle here. I just escaped prison and staying at Juandale Pringle's house. As I was running away from cops, I fell and scraped some of my foreskin off. A guy named Garfield Jenson bit me over in the shower while I was in prison. My baby momma Shiniqua Inderson told me to pay child support so I gave my baby to a creepy old guy,"

Whether you play it or not, if you have spent any time in the gaming world at all, encountering Garry's Mod is an inevitability.

A better sandbox you will not find... I can guarantee you that.

Well, unless S&box lives up to its promises of course. Although nothing it does will ever compare to the memories I've formed with this game."

28389,"One of the best pc exclusive games there is. i have roughly 2700 hours on this on an old steam account and 450 on this and i love this game.

It has endless possibility and if you're creative this game is definitely for you and worth the money 

performance wise as long as you don't go blowing up 10+ nukes at once your game shouldn't crash ;) but genuinely this game can come in around 250+ fps depending on the maps and addons you're using

the game modes and servers available on this game are again something which makes this game amazing because no matter what you will find something that you'll either enjoy or something that you can eventually enjoy if learnt how to play it correctly. 

Price? Definitely worth it at full price considering the possibilitys i think the price is perfect for this game.

Graphics are pretty decent especially considering the date the game came out and are just in the medium field but definitely aren't terrible

If you have ¬£7 buy this game now as soon as possible. you won't regret it

28663,"One of the first things that struck me when I started playing Half-Life: Alyx was the dirt under Alyx Vance‚Äôs fingernails. It‚Äôs a simple thing, but it‚Äôs not often that you see that level of fine detail in a VR game. Usually, virtual hands are either low-detail ghostly apparitions or gloved. This grit also tells us something about this character, a scrappy survivor raised in the aftermath of the Seven-Hour War in which the alien Combine conquered Earth, and it quickly establishes that she isn‚Äôt as buttoned-down as that MIT-educated nerd Dr. Gordon Freeman. Subtle as it is, it sets the stage for the best VR shooter I‚Äôve ever played by a mile ‚Äì and one of the best in any perspective.

The next thing that stood out, jarring me out of gazing at my hands like a first-time stoner, was probably the gigantic, 30-foot Strider leg that smashed down directly in front of me as it moved past, going about its business. That established, with great force, the immense scale of the mosquito-like alien tanks we first fought in Half-Life 2 ‚Äì if you didn‚Äôt take them seriously as a threat before, it‚Äôs now impossible not to. The same otherworldly sound design that made the landscape of the gulag-like City 17 so memorable back in 2004 is in full effect here as well, and full-3D surround sound intensifies all of these recognizable pieces.
Aside from the new perspective, Alyx feels very much like a traditional Half-Life game. It‚Äôs set up as a linear series of areas, starting with a normal City 17 neighborhood and then moving underground, through industrial areas like a distillery, high-tech Combine facilities, slimy alien nests, and more. Each chapter of the 15-hour campaign feels substantially different from the last, including one that relies heavily on an unkillable antagonist you have to work your way around, and some that are all but pitch black except for your wrist-mounted flashlight.

Combat is a major part of the journey, but so is puzzle-solving. Some hacking puzzles pop up when you go to unlock various Combine technology. None of them are terribly complex ‚Äì for instance, there‚Äôs a memory-matching game where you connect points on a holographic sphere and a very cool-looking one where you trace the path of electricity through a wall and rotate connectors in a power-flow puzzle ‚Äì but all of them make heavy use of VR‚Äôs ability to work in three dimensions, and some of them actually get tricky when they scale up in the later levels. Disarming tripwire mines by tracing a path through rings as a burning fuse chases you ‚Äì while being careful not to accidentally trip the mine with your hand ‚Äì can get fairly intense.
And then there's the environmental puzzles. In true Half-Life fashion, getting from point A to point B is often more complicated than it sounds. I‚Äôd sometimes wander around an area wondering if I‚Äôd hit a bug and an event that would open a path forward hadn‚Äôt triggered; I always felt like a goof a few minutes later when I figured out that the solution was a trick that‚Äôd been explicitly taught to me earlier, or was pretty clearly marked by a wire or something. It's all there, once you learn what kinds of cues to look for. All of this serves as a welcome cooldown and counterbalance to combat.
This may be a prequel story, taking place five years before Half-Life 2, but you should absolutely be up to date on the events of the series through Half-Life 2: Episode 2 before you play Alyx. (You‚Äôve had 13 years ‚Äì it's time.) Alyx‚Äôs quest starts out as a simple mission to rescue her father, Dr. Eli Vance, and turns into a heist to capture a Combine superweapon stashed inside a massive floating vault above City 17 ‚Äì but of course, it‚Äôs not that simple. The ending is fantastic and a must-see for anyone who‚Äôs been invested in this story, and rest assured there are plenty of surprises you should avoid spoilers for.

All the while your remote, lovably oblivious and blunt sidekick Russell (distinctively voiced by Rhys Darby) chatters away in your ear with some laugh-out-loud gags about vodka and sandwiches, among a great many other things. It‚Äôs a very similar brand of humor to what Valve gave us with Wheatly in Portal 2, although he‚Äôs not evil. Probably. His rapport with Alyx gives her a chance to shine as a character as well, allowing her to reveal her optimism about the future and naivete about the world before the invasion. Appropriately, Russ‚Äô signal tends to be blocked out during the moodier, more horror-flavored moments, which lets Half-Life: Alyx create some fantastically spooky atmosphere.
Detail is one of the things Valve does best. Environments look amazing. You can see the hairs on the legs of the bloodthirsty, turducken-sized head crabs as they leap at your face trying to eat your brain ‚Äì although counting hairs is hardly the first of your concerns at a moment like that because animal instincts kick in and cause a jolt of panic. Healing stations squash a gross antlion grub in a vial and then inject its juices into your fingers through delicate robotic needles. Just about every poster or newspaper clipping you see up on a wall is fully written, either in English or Russian (I assume, anyway ‚Äì I can‚Äôt read Russian). Smashing open a supply crate yields a shower of packing peanuts as well as items.
It‚Äôs remarkable, and so is the actual way you interact with all of these objects. Outside of Boneworks, I‚Äôve never seen this level of physical interactivity in a VR world. Physics play a huge role because the vast majority of stuff that isn‚Äôt nailed down can be picked up and tossed around. Even better, your hands are real objects in the world that collide with everything realistically. Moves like sweeping your hand across a table to dramatically wipe everything off of it, pushing on a door ‚Äì not its handle, but anywhere on it ‚Äì to open it, and having to carefully move your hand between two bars in a fence instead of simply reaching through it like a ghost all make a huge, huge difference in establishing a feeling of presence in this world.
In the beginning of Half-Life 2, Alyx equips Gordon Freeman with the Gravity Gun ‚Äì but this is five years prior to those events. So here, Alyx straps on intricate Gravity Gloves that aren‚Äôt nearly as powerful as the gun, but are much more compact, always on-hand, and still extremely useful. Just point at any object you can see so it lights up, make a fist to grip it, and yank it toward you to send it satisfyingly flying your way so you can easily catch it out of the air. It‚Äôs the simplest of Jedi tricks but it works well after some practice. The secret here is that this is a clever way to cover up that moving around and bending down too much in VR is awkward and it‚Äôs much easier to bring objects to you than it is to move you to them. The gloves elegantly turn that weakness into an empowering strength.

That said, there isn‚Äôt as much physics-based mayhem as I expected coming off of Half-Life 2. Unlike the Gravity Gun, your Gravity Gloves have no launch ability, only a pull, so you can‚Äôt bisect enemies with saw blades and the like. Grenades have to be tossed with your normal human arms. It all works fine but as someone who loves the Gravity Gun I couldn‚Äôt help but want that full power in my hands. Room has to be left for a sequel, I suppose.
Instead, guns are your main instruments of defending yourself from lurching zombies, lunging headcrabs, dangling barnacle traps, armored Combine troopers, and worse. There are only three weapons (or five, counting grenades) in Half-Life: Alyx, but even the basic pistol you‚Äôre handed from the get-go has a powerful punch to it, and emptying a whole magazine into an interdimensional fascist feels awfully good. Keep in mind, though, that handling it, the shotgun, and the SMG are big adjustments if you‚Äôre not familiar with VR shooters and the more elaborate reloading procedures that are common when you‚Äôre holding a virtual gun in your hand."

28677,"I've played this for 357 hours the time of this review, I've played with friends, randoms as well as by myself, i would like to say to people to buy this game but with my experience this game will make you feel a sense of heartbreak as well as betrayal. When you join servers with friends they will talk about you to randoms and say ""That person is gay"" and with that i  have lost a many of friends. So i will not recommend this to others as you will most likely lose friends and make foes with the people you once though you would take a bullet for. I wish you the best of luck and please don't buy this game."

28684,"Now, while I had fun for a bit with this game, it gets pretty depressing. For starters, half the maps in TTT don't work unless you have CS Source. That's not a big deal. Most of the servers are completely dead. No problem, just make your own - well, if you know how and get lucky that it'll be at the top of the server list. 

The biggest thing that my friends and I ran into were servers that we would hop onto, play on for a while, unlock items on said server (cosmetics, weapons, etc), and then the server would either shut down or stop being updated by the admins, effectively making it unplayable. 

I wouldn't recommend picking this game up at this point. If you are looking for a party game, there are MANY better options than this."

"
28940,fun
28941,"I've had this game for nearly a decade now, and it is a very fun game, from the mods to the multiplayer experience, this game kicks up the fun very much. Although I don't play this game that much anymore, it's still fun when I play it. This was the first game I bought on steam after a friend recommended it to me, I'm getting old lol. I would recommend this game if you are into sandbox and creativity, if top notch graphics are a must for you, you might not enjoy this game because it's not the greatest graphics in the world, but I could care less about graphics since there are games I play that have similar graphics to Garry's Mod.

Rating: 8.1/10"
28942,Garry
28943,"Even after all these years, this was one of the most well known game that everyone enjoyed back then and now.

Would recommend this game to everyone if they enjoy the slightest bit fun."

In the end, if I'm sitting around the house with nothing to do, this is typically the game I throw on even if it's just for an hour. Solid time, don't really see myself ever getting tired of this game."

29428,Garry's mod is a pretty good game. Some servers can be toxic but other than that it's pretty good.

29437,"Personally, I really enjoy how much freedom this 'game' gives you. I say 'game' because calling Garry's Mod a game isn't fully accurate. It can be seen as a tool for animators, as best seen as a lot of the scenes of popular YouTuber SMG4. I've had a lot of fun just throwing around ragdolls or doing some other dumb shit and it's great fun. A must have for people that enjoy sandbox games."
29438,"10$ For years of fun and memories. (especially with friends)

With the amount of mods being made every day, it is impossible to become boring."
29439,I love the game because their are many servers within this games. When first play it was easy and hard to learn the use this games but now it easy and it very fun me. Download this games because it very fun

29485,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories. this is satire. i reposted it because i was was bored, now shut the fuck up"

29597,"This game saved my life.

I am 22.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

29708,"Usually I use a template for my steam Reviews, but here I go for this one.

Gary's Mod is Probably one of the best games ever. This game has the best Sandbox I've ever seen in a game.
You can literally do anything here, even installing shaders to have fun. Not only that, you can tweak the physics 
how you want, ""Are you a coder? Do you like Gary's Mod but don't like it's Combat? Change it.""
People have done amazing things with this game, and I have underplayed it. This deserves to be my most Played Game. This game will always go on. This game shall never die.
Seems like the end? Not yet.

Those 33 Hours I have on the game? 30 Of them have been with friends.
This game is even BETTER with friends. Goofing around until 12:00 AM is the best thing I have ever done in
my steam account. Heck there are PUBLIC SERVERS. And this game has no limits as I said before. With people making maps that are HUMONGOUS, or really Tiny. The possibilities are endless. ""Do you not own a game? Find a mod for it in Gary's Mod. PLAY IT IN GMOD"" 

This is my biggest review because I cannot explain how fun this game can get.
PLEASE. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF BUYING IT. YOU. WILL. NOT. REGRET. IT.


:D Have a nice day!"
29709,"Gmod
"

29795,"I used to play Fortnite all night. No sleep! But ever since Obama told me to try Raid Shadow Legends for free, I am addicted. This game is a game. It has graphics. It has characters. Best of all it has a loot box mechanic to enhance my experience even more by adding another exciting chance based layer to the game! Two week ago I spend all my money becoming a Raid Shadow Legend. Now I live in a dumpster outside a McDonald‚Äôs with free WiFi. At night I sneak into the McDonald‚Äôs like my new raccoon dad, Stripey, taught me to do so I can charge my phone. Through the cracked screen I am still perpetually amazed by the graphics of this game... they look so real! Thank you Obama, you truly changed my life!"
29796,easy to make your own gamemode and stuff love the amount of creativity
29797,yes i can make pink monkey and shoot it
29798,"Gmod, even all these years later, is the perfect little sandbox when all the other games in your steam library don't have the right vibe."
