2,good

4,Great.
5,fun game with unlimited new experiences
6,Great game 10/10
7,"Have to have time to play because thinking what to do with different materials, critters, and weapons essential. That is what I like. Several ways to do things as well."
8,"This game is amazing, you have dinos and survival. What more do you need?!"
9,8/10
10,"   Can I say Ark is a good survival crafting game? Not really. And that's not the fault of the current team. The elephant in the room is that early development on this game was absolute dogshit. With later staff coming in with fresh ideas, and more programming experience with making video games...they have made a genuine effort to make this game work. The controls are clunky, especially on the Tek Armor (I frequently make the joke about I don't wear Tek boots, I just stick my feet in sticks of butter.). Hitboxes are janky, snap points on buildings are an actual nightmare as someone who loves doing mega bases in their free time on pve, and not to mention that this game could probably still assassinate your motherboard if it looked at you funny. 

   Can I say Ark is a fun sandbox to just mess around in? ...Actually, yeah. Despite all the problems, it's goofy and fun. I once spent weeks slowly breeding Equus to see how much damage I could stack, and eventually one shot the broodmother with it. Why? I just wanted to see what would happen. This is a game where you could go in to it two ways. Playing it like your standard survival crafting game, or...just letting your inner kid appreciate the fact that you're riding on a candy raver colored Rex, dressed in a top hat and Hawaiian shirt with no pants on, wielding a flamethrower and fighting a dragon. Embrace the madness, and you'll have fun.

   Honestly, with what I have seen the developers doing ...I can see ARK 2 being a solid title for anyones collection. I just hope they don't forget what made me want to play this game. ...Which is playing Pokemon but with Dinosaurs and frighteningly uncomfortable platypus hellspawn that sprays milk like it's a childrens waterpark feature."

30,````
31,"cant play this game at all, i spent 3.5 hours staring at a loading screen"
32,Ark is a amazing realistic game that is expensive but has sales lot that make it super cheap I would get this game since well I only have 700 hours on it :D

43,I love this game but I also hate it this games its like a bad ex that you cant seem to stop going back to
44,"I wanted to give this game a try again after taking a long break from it. My experience follows:

- Not much has changed since my previous attempt at playing this. Even with the paid expansions, game is just as crappy as I remember it being.
- The community is just as bad as CSGO.
- Poorly optimized even after all these years of being out. There's no way in hell my computer's frame rate should be tanking. Specs below. This is absurd.
- Some of the dumbest mechanics ever. There's no reason why I should have to unequip a tool just to grab something off the ground. (This might be me being nit-picky but why is this even there?)
+ Sounds are great.
+ Taming Dinosaurs is fun.

Ryzen 5 3600XT 6-Core 3.8Ghz
AMD Radeon RX 6600 8gb VRAM
And 32gb of RAM.

I'll stick to Conan Exiles."
45,"sometimes fun, sometimes aggravating, sometimes jank, always entertaining."
46,yes
47,"its good

48,BEST GAME EVER PLAYED

52,"no

53,The game ARK in general aren't optimized for the latest Mac operating system. When will this be fixed? We are eager to play the game.

56,Just. yes.

63,"Good game, played on PS4 before coming to pc and is still a great game"
64,"very good game

65,a
66,this game is very good
67,"ark 
"
68,too much fun
69,Cool game with lot of fun activity and expansion maps are also cool and deferent taming mechanics
70,"echt een kut spel, dinos neuken 24/7"
71,Ark: Bugs Evolved.
72,"If you're not as petty as the negative reviewers or don't play in official servers, you will love this game. I highly suggest starting up a server with friends"
73,So much to this game and so impressive the attention to detail
74,"I have played a lot of this game over the years going back to when I played it on xbox. Every single time that something bad has happened in the game it was never due to an enemy fairly beating me. This game is about offline-ing people, insiding them, cheating..(look those words up if you don't know) The game itself is great, build a base, tame dinos, grind resources, craft a bunch of different stuff, defeat a number of different bosses. It's honestly very fun and if you have friends then it's even better. Work with them, build with them, fight with them. But eventually something will go horribly wrong, meshing and undermapping and other words I used to not understand very well will become words your very familiar with. All of a sudden an enemy is in your base wrecking you, all of a sudden someone whistles your tames into the water to drown them, all of a sudden all your hard work is ruined by someone that didn't even have the balls to fight you head on. Also, get used to mega tribes. They want you to be their slaves for resources and wont take no for an answer. These No Life Gamers will absolutely spend their time tracking you, following you, and ultimately screwing you over. They have no issues with using resources gained over years playing the game to wipe a base built over only a few weeks or months. Using, for example, a huge OP Mek(looks like a transformer) to completely demolish all you have just for the giggles. 

So the game itself I give a 9/10. I wouldn't come back as many times as I have if it were not fun, but the community is a bit rough. Do not trust anyone, do not let people into your tribe if you don't know them. Do not let anyone know your base location, defend what you have immediately and hide anything valuable. People will screw you over, trust me. And if you didn't know.. change your steam profile name to 123. It adds anonymity to your profile and makes it tougher for those that use battlemetrics to follow your account. If they have a grudge with you believe me that these no life turds will follow you around maps and servers just to punish you.

And because of this widdled down, only the bobs and no lifers left community, I give the game a 4/10. They say it is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. 

Well... after playing this game as long as I have I'm not so sure about that."
75,fun
76,Dino chep.

78,it might be a very grindy game but there is a lot of fun things to do and it is extreamly exciting

86,it run like i have a ptado
87,Love this game!
88,ya
89,Good game insane system requirements.
90,"I know, it's a semi-finished survival game, it's not supposed to be perfect but good god this thing is so broken.  Creatures clip through walls and then get stuck in them (so do players), tamed dinos fall through the map never to be seen again, following AI is entirely busted, hitboxes - yeah, we've heard of them.  And so on and so on and so on.  Couple that with no QoL features to address these issues and I'm done with it.  Of course a feature to teleport my favourite dino back to me after the game decided to drop it into the abyss would break immersion.  Like the bugs that made me want that feature don't.  I've played lots of buggy early access survival games but there's a limit to how much I'm prepared to put up with and this exceeds it."
91,gfuh
92,"This game is VERY niche, you have to be willing to dumb hundreds of hours into this game just to get past the early stages, super grindy. it can be fun if youre willing to invest your time and soul into this game. wouldnt buy it at this point and hope that ark 2 fixes all of its downfalls. i think that the game has some mechanical designs when it comes to taming, spawning and interactions between dinosaurs that could use major improvement. playing on a server has generally sucked. at this point just wait for ark 2, ive always loved the dinosaur thematic in games and movies and this game piques my interests in those regards but needs some rounding out."

100,"How they managed to get this footage of my mum in her youth, I will never know."
101,"My opinion, probably the best survival game around. Enjoyable and intriguing game-play. The ability to tame dinos and breed them is excellent. I love it!"
102,"Game was at its best in Early Access up until the devs released the first DLC... while the game was still in Early Access and incomplete. Not a huge fan of Studio Wildcard's business practices, still the game is visually stunning and made for a memorable 2015. All that's really needed to enjoy the full experience nowadays is the base game and the free Ragnarok map imo."
103,mm
104,awesome
105,This game is really fun and the graphics are decent and the animals are so cool. The only part that is bad is the wait for the game to load.
106,been playing since its conception still loving it
107,Love the game very fun. Recommend for groups of people or to play on private client.
108,This game is so fun but its at its maximum amount of fun when you mod it i reccomend you buy it
109,"Wanna play a game that makes your heart stop, or makes you shake with rage when your base gets raided? Or make you cry when you just tamed and dino and a big dino that eats leafs comes over and just randomly decides to attack and kill your new tamed dino? This game is for you if you like that!"
110,dinosaurs
111,Very fun to play with friends
112,Regret
113,"lost complete interest after being thrown out of the group and being locked from all my gear

still would recommend it for hardcore survivalists

114,fuck this dog shit game spent 2 hour getting a wyvern and got killed by a Chinese dude on a lvl 300 mana
115,too addicting
116,"i just redownloaded it and it keeps crashing after loading into the game, i hope we get a huge fix for this missing file error, i do recommend it tho for when the game gets the much needed update"
117,Minecraft but in the dinosaur ages and a little bit harder depending on the map you're on. Overall a really fun game to play with your friends
118,"Best Glitchy Game i ever known

119,"I only play in single player, but i love this game."
120,It's ok
121,"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.""

"
122,"First i will start by saying i am a pve player.

if you try to play this game on ""Official"" servers you will have a bad time. thats all i will say about the matter.

unofficial is where it is at. this game is best played with friends, there is much advernture, a steep learning curve, and plenty of things that will get you screaming. 

this game is where the survival genre started, harvesting, building, eating tameing.

when you first log on, you may find yourself being killed repeatedly, by weather, by little angry dino's, but dont get disheartened, most people start this way, the game is well worth sticking to.

there is much hidden lore and a wealth of things to do. go from a naked caveman to iron man flying through the sky shooting lasers and piloting giant battle meks. 
playing in scorched desert worlds worying about heat stroke and where to get your next drink. stealing eggs from dragons nest. surviving in a broken world where the creatures of the deep want you for lunch and the sun wants to vaporise you. building massive treehouses on the giant redwoods, growing vegetables and tameing all dinosaurs big and small.

i have played this game out, so it no longer holds much excitement for me. however there are many good memories and nostalgia for me in this game, i dont regret the many hours i have played it.

i invite anyone to try this game, just dont go official. if i were to give you some tips for this game, 

Dont overlook food and kibble, it can make your game much easyer
Dont overlook fishing, all of my best loot came from it
Spend some time on/underwater, some of the caves make fantastic hidden bases. building a portable base on a raft is so useful. or even better, building your home on the back of a massive underwater dino. or building your base on the back of a giant flying dino is fun too

anyhow im out

130,full of cheaters and admins dont ban them!
131,You will most likely sell your soul to this game but it is worth the time. Such an enjoyable game and is great solo and with lots of people.

136,"Very nice. Disclaimer, it is very much unlike Noah's Ark, which I think despite the namesake, now has no connection whatsoever to this game. So if you downloaded this thinking that you will get to collect 2 of every animal, you are sadly mistaken. Great game anyway"
137,"I played quiete shortly, good game."
138,"so bloody bad, darius carius marius the fatius lim ate all the bloody food and fucked the dinosaurs"

144,This is an amazing game.  I have been playing Ark since it was first released into beta and have stayed with it as its grown over the years.  This game will always have a special place in my heart because of the amazing experiences as well as the friends I have made along the way.
145,gg
146,"Broken garbage. Frequently fails to load, bugs galore, nearly unplayable without mods. Beware though, if you use mods external to the workshop and launch without Battleeye, the game will get your entire account VAC banned with zero warning, even if you're playing on a private server that you're paying money for that has cheats enabled and VAC disabled. Reminder that they're non-debatable, so thanks ARC for getting my account banned while fixing code that your devs couldn't fix on their own.  Just an absolute trashfire."
147,"Man this game would be great if it didn't demand around 180-300gb of storage depending on how much DLC you actually care to use (That is, if you don't want to manually compress it, which shouldn't be necessary at all)."
148,"Best game on steam, best lags and bugs ingame"
149,"I love this game in every way! Being someone that loves dinos and mythical creatures, this hits just in the right spot! As excited as i am for Ark 2, this game will always have a special place in my heart!"
150,"The people you play with will make or break the game.

Hardest I've laughed in awhile was watching my character curl up in the fetal potion and fall off a 3 seater mount after being tranqed from a teammate aiming for a wild dino.

10/10 would die again."
151,rust but with dinosaurs
152,I hate this game
153,"I love this game, I don't like the fact that you can spend hundreds of hours taming dinos, breeding and building and then log in one day and all the shit is wiped, gone. I have almost 1200 hours in this game and it has happened more than a few times."
154,i like it.
155,my dodo died to a dilophosaur 2/5
156,Best game ever!
157,Not bad.
158,"great pass the time type game if your in single player i love it and its awesome how there is always an update, there are some great community mod makers that if you have the mods make this from a 4 out of 5 star game to a 10 out of 5 star game XD i urge any looking into buying this game to give it a try or check some ark youtubers out to see the base of the game and give it a chance to make your day better but that's my thought on the game, in the end of the day it's your's that truly matters because what someone else likes could not be what you like."
159,The best Survival Game.
160,its cool adn fun
161,"I love this Game the queen is super into

162,it is vary fun ok

190,"I have 700 hours in the game, but I feel that even with how cheap it is, just not worth it for a few reasons:
- The inconceivably stupid amount of space required for the game
- The horrendously ugly character creation and physics
- The outdated graphics
- Gameplay itself feels clunky as hell, especially while riding tamed creatures
- If you don't have reliable friends to play with you, you will more than likely just get steamrolled in most servers (especially publics), whether by the wildlife or by assh*le other players"

For a survivalist gamer, ARK properly reaches those itchy spots that you will want. It's learning curve can be steep, but once you understand the flow of technology and get in a few videos from content creaters (*cough*Pterafier*cough*) you will have a somewhat comfortable time leveling up. Ironically, the way the game is set up many players say they enjoy even the experience of starting fresh more then any other community I've seen.

First thing I would recommend is any creators video on setting up the game's settings. This can be an extremely big difference in how you play the game  but yea there are some very big QoL sliders. Some let you shorten the Night/Day time, let you focus  less on gathering,  effect breeding, and more. I personally increase the gathering strength and the amount nodes have (you can adjust how quickly and  how close to your buildings they can respawn) if in solo. Many PvP and PvE servers will have their own settings to allow for their particular flow of game play. 

Dinos, Dinos, Dinos..
Yes, they are everywhere, along with much more as you will soon be murdered b... I mean come across in epic discovery fashion. Watch how majestic and effortlessly a pack of Raptors cover the ground towards their prey (you.). Nothing like the sight of a rare and beautifully colored Spinosaurus basking in the midday sun (also coming for you). Hear the proudness in the voice of the T Rex as he tells you how happy he is to claim this side of the mountain his home (and why the hell are you in it?). Still, they are the  key to both survival and progression. This games first step into it's deep cold waters starts with probably a Parasaur. Almost every sentient being you come across can be tamed. They are all unique, and all hold a purpose. Parasaurs can hold weight and move about whatever map you're on fast enough to outrun a majority of the beginning opposition (They can also gather Narco berries faster then you, but not as good as a Trike.) They come in many colors, and one day you might even come across versions of certain dinos that will make your jaw drop. They have random colors on set pallets, but events and breeding can produce some very unique companions. (Don't get attached. Food chain is real.) Three horns do indeed play with long necks. You will need many dinos to make the game comfortable. Ground runners (Parasaur, Equuis, Iguanadons), attack and defense (Raptors, Stegos, T Rex), workers (Dodas and Ankys), flyers (Ptredons, Argys,) and even aquatic life (yea... Megaladons and Sarcos.. but you have to tame them to appreciate them. Until then it's them appreciating you). Every dino has a use, just gotta learn how to catch them (we got Pokeballs.. kinda. But you won't see them for a good while. Until then remember Ash never had to worry about being gutted for dinner. You do, and you got a pointy stick)

Building Bedrock:
The building system is best left to content creators to explain and demonstrate. You can do some interesting things with placement and item used to produce some beautiful structures. But honestly if your reading this and you're about to experience this game for the first time, you will find yourself huddled in the dark in a 2x2 (or smaller) straw thatch house with no head room and dino walking right outside your tiki hut, waiting for daylight You will soon graduate in Minecraft fashion as you level to Wood, then stone, and then metal. Not gonna spoil what progression is there, but it's there and will surprise you. Base characters will not have enough points to buy every engram upgrade. Some people will create a Builder character, a smitthy, or a combat oriented build so this has impact in what you unlock. The games building allows for some good creativity though, and you should be able to have a nice home to place for your dinos. My personal style I enjoy the leveling and let the primitive/stone go enough to enjoy building a few locations before I out-level into metal tier. But upgrading beyond stone increase the damage it can take so in many situations stone and wood is just fine (and twice as good looking). I prefer to getting to level 16, then building a wood raft. At first when you see the raft you will fell like taking to the oceans. Ironically the canou and the raft have almost opposite usages as intended, but I won't spoil any surprises. Just remember... food chain and never become attached to anything. But seriously.. the raft. Go watch a video on house boats. 

War. It never ends, and neither does the fight to be top of the food chain. Be it PvE cave runs with your tribe, PvP wars between tribes for positional domination, or simply surviving solo on an island where everything wants to kill you, a torch will not be enough. Guns and Dinos. I love Murder Chickens and Shotguns and so will you probably. Be ready for your first PvP server experience. Most servers will have a Welcome Committee on Ptradons who will gladly help you reach new heights :) Welcome to the ARK. Not only can you fight outright, ARK holds some interesting options. Like sedating your targets (human too) and putting them in shackles. They won't be able to visually see during, so feel free to thrown them in a previously dug pit and fill it with human and dino feces. ASSERT DOMINANC... I mean come to a mutually respected understanding that this is where you like to bring your Sarco's to sunbathe and they might have a better experience on another beach. On the other side of the map.

Graphics are good, each map is atmospheric and unique to it's own. Sound is on par. 

Content and DLC:
You don't need paid DLC, but the do give unique tames and equpiment. You can check the wiki and normal spots to find locations and on which maps tames spawn on. Some paid DLC tamesare in the 6 free maps. And those free maps likewise has unique tames. I personally enjoyed the challanges from Scorched Earth and Arbitration, but Genesis 1 and 2 I didn't like and felt to linear and out of place with ARK as a whole.

Cons:
There are a log of bugs as with any game that uses physics and AI. Be careful and do a bit of research. I've lost a few dinos and such to crashes. The game doesn't hold you hand either, so personal effort will be needed to learn everything. I prefer that, some don't. I personally haven't experience anything gamebreaking though, and this game has been out a while so it's received many updates. Though rightfully so,  vets of the community can point out some vaild issues still waiting patching. Otherwise it's been a great experience and place to sink some of my time into

I must be honest thought and say it can be very jank in some aspect like building and such, and some processes are needlessly slow. But overall the good outweighs the bad and I have had a whale of a time.

332,While the game could certainly use improvements it dose provide many hours of entertainment for those into open world base building games. Note: It is very important to adjust the game settings if you are playing solo as the default settings assume group play and will be extremely brutal to a new solo players.
333,"I absolutely loved hosting modded private PVE servers for my friends and family.  The dinos and interactions with them are extremely fun.  Base building is fun.  Raft building is fun.  Exploring the oceans is fun. Crafting is fun.  Exploring ruins and caves is fun. Running from giant angry dinos is fun.  Beautiful art and huge maps.....

The official servers?  Lets just say I had to ban anyone that tried to bring that attitude to my server.  Toxic doesn't even begin to describe the mental illness that grows there thanks to the lack of abuse mitigation.  It's a completely different experience tailored for exploitation and devoid of kindness.

I would never recommend this game in it's official state.

I give it a thumbs up for my WONDERFUL experience exploring the maps, and building/crafting with friends and family that didn't want to kill others or exploit nature."

359,honestly one of the better games ive played
360,"This game is not an easy one to review. I have a great deal of time in this game, more than any other game. Around 5000 hours on pc between steam and epic, 7000 hours on  Windows. 

That being said it is not a game worth getting into at this point. I cannot recommend this game in its current state nor the state its been in the last two years. It has one of the most toxic communities that goes out of their way to bully anyone and everyone.

There is so much cheating that goes unpunished, in the rare case someone is banned its barely a slap on the wrist. Accounts with all DLCs are often bought for well under 10 dollars. The duplication of items has created a massive RMT market that has over saturated the game with end game structures and gear. Aimbot or as it is referred to in this community ""spinning"" is a plague that affects every official and dedi server. Meshing, where players put themselves outside of the normal playable areas to by bass your defences. What this means is the bases you have potentially spent 10s, 100s or even 1000s of hours into can be raided from the inside out. The final cheating method worth mentioning here is account spoofing. So many tribes with 100s of players have lost their servers as of late due to this. Accounts can be hacked by discord spam bots sending malicious links to players to retrieve sign in information among other things.

This was once a one of a kind clunky masterpiece of a game that thousands of players once loved to hate. In 2022 though it is a far cry of what it once was.

It was fun to play and taming dinos was super cool. However when I brought along my Pteranodon, Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus and Triceratops on an expedition to find new dinos and stuff I got lost. No big deal I had a compass and the map but right about when I think I found my home I hopped off my Parasaurolophus and before I know it ALL MY DINOSAURS disappeared! Just like gone. No death messages no anything they just vanished. I uninstalled the game and have no intent on playing it again. Also Troodon are really annoying."
374,F6T
375,Fun game
376,"To summerize: DON'T buy this game if you don't want to be VERY dissapointed. 
It would have had a huge potential, but the devs never cared about the balancing (high lvl players VS new ones and PVE issues) and thus it is unplayable due to the toxic community and not to mention the cheaters everywhere.
I have tried to play ARK many times, and sometimes even enjoyed it, but after 1K hours in it I cannot recommend it at all. 

Details read below:

The official PVE servers are so full of structures, that there is no place to build on them, literaly. Thus playing PVE is no option due to the fact that on these servers people will build these structures everywhere, so that you have no place to live and as you can't destroy these, there is no real place to make a base. And eventualy you WILL give up.
As a result you can only ""try"" the PVP servers.

The official PVP servers are toxic. 
This game so unbalanced, that you can get killed/hunted/farmed/griefed by Lvl 90+ players riding 200+ lvl dinos, even when you are lvl 1. There is no balance, no aid, no chance. NONE.

The ""Mega clans"" or so called ""Alpha tribes"" dominate the officical servers and if you are not in them or are ""allowed"" to exist by them, then you have no chance at all. Literaly none. AND they WILL hunt you, grief you, not let you live and farm you as they please. You have NO chance against them. NONE.
They do not just have way many more people then you, but are so much higher advanced, that you don't stand a chance, not matter what you do. You cannot build any base, as they will raid it, you cannot tame any dinos, as they will kill it, you cannot do ANYTHING, because they won't let you as this it ""their"" server. It is a total nonsense. AND the game supports this. Devs don't care and NEVER cared about it.

I have been a member of such a mega tribe before, seen how they dominate ARK, what and how they operate and what stuff and dinos they have, and believe me: you cannot imagine and don't stand any chance if you try to do anything. Most likely you will simply give up after the 60+ time raid by them. 

If you don't believe me and belive the ""Very positive"" recent reviews, then go ahead and give it a try. 
Eventualy you will come to the same conclusion that the time spent on this game was a big waste of time.

379,yes
380,"Really good game you should play it on single player first and get hang of the game and if you decide to go online you'll quickly realize how cruel some people in power can be, but you also get to see the other side, the nobility of people in power although is quite rare. So if you're a working man or woman and just want to enjoy playing video games you should play single player and if you have friends to play with even better and enjoy the journey of learning and the joy of your achievements within the game."

412,Its a great concept but unless you play with at least a party of 10 or more you will not get anywhere and will be trolled constantly.
413,The best survival game that you can play right now. The game is perfectly optimized. There are no bugs to be seen. Official servers are up and running all the time and don't shut down without any warning. So you don't lose your valuable loot. Specially PVP players are so much friendly. Always help and welcome new players. You can have a great time with your friends.

421,"Pros:  Amazing graphics and gameplay.  The only game I know that includes about 5+ different  roles in one game.  Immense does not describe it.  You can play solo or online. Several different maps are available.

Cons:  Other players may OR may not be toxic, just find a good server and stay with it.  You die....  It's a big part of the game. Get used to it.  THE LAAAAGGGG! Ark is infamous for it. Amazing graphics do come at a price after all."

Solid entertainment."
444,"Hello steam, I have a problem with ARK: Survival Evolved, for some reason to download the player requires 260 GB of memory space, I searched on the Internet that the game requires 60 GB of memory space, can this be solved as soon as possible.thanks in advance!"

451,"I have no clue how this game is rated as highly as it is. The concept of the game is great for a survival game, but man this game is notorious for running like straight cheeks even on capable systems. Atleast now the games down to $20 now though."
452,"its fun and has good graphics

458,Amazing

"
460,Best game ever!
461,great game
462,"Would not recommend this game for any living organism in the known universe. Does not matter if you have a high consciousness or is of the lesser folk... This game is not for you. High end PC or a PC from 98, does not matter... This game is not for you.

It is completely unplayable in all aspects. Installing the game is a pain, getting the game to run is psychological warfare. If you get so far as to play the game and if your setup is by some holy authority allowing you to play the game without lag(Despite your 3080TI and 24gig of ram) you will have the same chances as if you were born in Stalingrad 1943 and as soon as you got into the world your mom and dad died and there he stood... A guy pointing a .45ACP in your face and someone actually expects you to come up with some idea to survive, fuck this game. You will die before you have loaded the game if you don't have the blessings from the gods.

If you are not in the need of a Navy SEALS grade psychological nightmare for self progression this is not the game for you!

I have tried to meditate and dissolve from me the burden that this game has bestowed upon me, but I cannot find any happiness in this life anymore as I know that more and more people stumble into this game and god... Think of the people that will end up playing Ark 2? Think of the pain and struggle?

Isn't the current situation in this world dire enough? Do we need this game on top of it?"
463,Welcome to hell where everything kills you!
464,good Dinosaurs
465,"10/10 you'll lose yourself in this game, I have no words for it."
466,10/10
467,bok ama ye
468,Glitch Sim with a great concept it better than the console version tho
469,this game is extremely fun and entertaining and i think people should have that too
470,I am having performance issues. Not only that the game has bugs. Most of the times you will either die by a dinosaur or you die from boredom.
471,me punch dinosaur but then dinosaur eat me 10/10.
472,I keep dying
473,.
474,L
475,"My friends and i play very frequently, the graphics are very good and it is a very good game to play, it is worth the money! Fun fact, My friend is such a nerd that he has over 660 hours on it
"
476,dinosaur balls
477,nice nice
478,Ark is one of the best survival games IMO I loved playing it I mainly played it on Xbox but with Pc there is so much more you can do im not a server person I just do single player but I still love everything about this game :D 10/10
479,yes
480,Just Don't
481,i love the game i would just like that we can transfer maps on single player
482,big scary dino things. funny
483,Peak survival evolved

485,Yes.
486,"my laptop is gonna explode :steamthumbsup:
"
487,HAVE BACKUP SAVES. lost 130hrs of play because of a bug or glitch that happened after i switched to a different map... and was killed by a creature there.  but this will not stop me from playing again. .. just need time to reset. play a different game for a bit... then come back when I have a weekend to get a good start
488,YES!!!!
489,Maps are buggy and it is not even fixed on updates.
490,dsa
491,Meh... its ok for the first 2500 hrs or so...
492,space is soooo cooooool
493,"I have played quite a few hours so apparently I like it..

I play single player pve and use mods at this point.
They can really enhance the game play.

I did not watch any videos before trying this and it was a crazy experience.
A fun game with not so great running/agility mechanics.
You will get stuck on stuff that looks like you should be able to traverse over.


"
494,"I am a 53 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
495,Nope Way to buggy. Servers lagging back up crashes. Hacks to exploit and crash servers. They don't care if you buy this game or not. They got their money from us. And you too if you buy it.
496,a
497,the game
498,"Got this when it was free.
My friend and I kept dying at the same time and we both got the same amount of damage. 
I don't know if this was a glitch or some stupid future but, I'm glad we didn't pay for this. 
Terrible."
499,"This Game is Amazing , Too much Content , Good Graphics , Addictive xD , I highly Recommend it."
500,dinosaur
501,"If you like playing a game where you put in hours of work just to have it all deleted the next time you wan to play then this is the game for you. the second you log out of your single player world it will delete everything and all your time will have been for nothing. has happened to me 3 times now, i dont even want to play anymore since i know its going to be deleted anyways"
502,fun
503,If you like survival games this one is for you this is hard and also realistic but there is dinos you either have to survive with one or try not getting killed by one if they try to kill you then you might be ded but not all attack you some run or some you can tame without knocking them out.I've only been playing For about 3 hours and i really like this game its a really good survival game
504,The only thing bad is load times. This game is great for groups of friends
505,i love freezing and starving to death every 5 mins the part is when ur freshly tamed dino pet gets eaten by an alpha 10/10
506,great game
507,oooooooh
508,gang
509,fun (sometimes)

532,Dino
533,Best survival game ever
534,JÓ A GAME
535,"Very fun and additive game.  I recommend playing on modded servers that have a boost multiplier to help things progress faster.   Big time suck on this one.. Worth it most of the time. Then ""ark"" happens and you die and have to try and get back what you lost."
536,5y3
537,"15k hours on ps4, moved to pc for more mods and options...fun game for dinos"
538,Dinmosoors
539,i got killed by the same rex 4 times in a row!
540,Tame Dinosaurs and survive as best you can.
541,just died to a damn flying fish but still greatest game ever made and get ark 2 or else
542,"If you like sandbox creativity, survival, and dinosaurs...
perfect game for you.
8/10"
543,Ruins your life
544,mod good :)
545,I have many more hours on console the game is to addicting and very fun
546,you can be gigachad in this game 10/10
547,Lots of Content! Fun to play with friends!
548,It's buggy but good
549,PISH GAME
550,"this games servers are piss, fix your game, i crash every time i try joining a server. this is horrendous, may as well just delete the game off the entire platform. Ridiculous
"
551,very gud gam rekomend tu fren very gud jes
552,if you like creaturs and adventuring
553,"having invested thousands of hours into this game I would recommend it - as long as you have your own server for your friend group. my experience on official servers was something along the lines of spawning, seeing pillars every fifteen feet (preventing me from building) being kidnapped by a random flyby dino and dropped into a cage where I was knocked out, put into a cage and force fed berries/food to prevent me from dying. 

On my unofficial private server however, with heavily modified settings and a few mods, this game is wonderful. working together with your friends to tame and level creatures.
There are still many bugs, some related to mesh issues, spawning issues (one time that really ticked me off was when i had a bronto gated in and taming and a rex spawned INSIDE THE GATE killing my bronto while I was out getting food for the tame...."
554,I cannot put into words how much I hate and love this game.

560,"Simply a great game, been returning to it every few years since its release and its just a blast. The RP servers are some of the most fun i have ever had"
561,My legs broke from being hungry
562,"It's a survival game. Maintain food and water, while building/farming/taming.  Dinosaurs are used for harvesting, breeding, attacking, defending, and pretty much everything. Great game."
563,"Ark is one of those games. You'll think you've only been on for an hour farming up some resources, and boom, it's 3 A.M."
564,"its good but a bit buggy sometimes
"
565,"I like everything about this game there is just one thing that i cant get over or fix is on single player it will just randomly wipe all my saves and force me to make a new character no matter how much progress I have made 
"
566,w
567,cool
568,it was literally free so that was nice
569,"would recommend if you only plan on playing pve or with friends on a local server. pvp is a mess, basically rust, except dinosaurs, and as long as you grind long enough you'll never be raided. with that said, you can still have limited fun on pvp.
if you're looking on Ark SE for xbox crossplay, go look on the Microsoft Store because that's where you can play with xbox players."
570,very good when combined with mods
571,love this game!!!
572,y
573,this game could use a little update in the graphics around the genesis areas but overall this is by far the best dino survival game ive ever played. if you get into the lore. its story is amazing. im tempted to write an article on this games backstory. its well worth every second
574,"I absolutely love this game from the bottom of my heart. Cant wait for Ark 2! This game was amazing from the start even in early access but the more it was updated the more i loved it! The DLC's felt almost like a new game every time and it was impossible to get board. Mods were an amazing part of the game as well, changing the game from fun to even more fun with a few different builds like the castle mods, all the way to changing armor, buildings, dinosaurs, and bosses. This game was an amazing way to have fun and I am so happy I played it."
575,WARNING ! IS NOT CROSSPLAY ! BUY ON WINDOWS STORE TO CROSSPLAY WITH XBOX

588,"tbh there is not much to say to this game, its fucking awesome, especially with friends"
589,This game is too hard- My girlfriend
590,"IT has stolen all my time I have over 1500 hours in this game. Run while you still can
"
591,FIX THE CORPSE ISSUES!!!!!!!! its frustrating to go back to get your bag and its no longer there because it disappears upon death making it non recoverable. I have lost alot of valuable shit because of this bug that isnt fixed. Its been an issue for several years FIX IT. Its make you quit the game because why work so hard in game for a bug to take everything from you.
592,Ark is the best survival game in my opinion you can play with friends or all by yourself but no matter what you will enjoy the trying to survive and grind.
593,This game is so addicting. Love this game
594,Game is full of exploiting and cheating.
595,only thing i like was the self poop

598,its alr on pc but its a bit easier on consoles like xbox or ps5
599,i love this game
600,Its the best.
601,no vry scare
602,Ark is Amazing
603,Amazing game. The building the taming the exploring. Many Maps all have great things to see an experience. I have spent many years playing this game hardcore on the PlayStation. Me an my friends ran many servers by the name Lost Ark Addicts. We deff had one of the best servers running for years with our stats an cool dinos. If you haven't given this game a try yet you are missing out. Play with friends for a way better time. They offer maps with PVP an PVE. To be truly honest play PVE its a better all around experience. However if you are one of the people that love huge Waring clan fights then you should do the PVP an play on a nice server. Happy Arking friends.
604,I hate this game.
605,I think I have a new obsession with raptors now
606,awesome dinos
607,I poked a Trex with a stick. He did not approve. I was lunch. Nom Nom. 10/10
608,i very much like this game have been playing it for a long time now first on the xbox now on pc the only thing that is holding players back is the fact that you need a powerfull pc to play it well
609,"Fell into a hole, stuck, falling forever, was waiting an hour to dehydrate, then it rained and refilled my water 0/10"

627,"THIS GAME IS SO NICE!!
"
628,i love this game with a pasion
629,"dinosaurs, for thje win"
630,"If I could give this Yes but No I would. This game is either something you really will like and play a lot of or a game you will pick up once and never come back. I've seen this with my friends and myself. Now I know it says I only have 4 hours but I have put a better part of 400+ on Xbox. I personally love the game I haven't really gotten to play it on PC so I can't really say how well it runs or how well it plays on here. I can only assume it will play better because of the Community modders that I'm sure like other games will help fix bugs and issues to make the game run better.

For anyone looking to get this I would just say. Expect bugs. Wildcard Studios is well know for this part of Ark. I know that this game has been riddled with bugs since launch and will be riddle with them even up to ARK 2's launch. But other than that it is a cool survival game that has dinos"
631,yes
632,"very good game
"
633,Cool Game Lol
634,i love it and i also make da dinos suck me
635,Dinosaur

641,hella addicting
642,"its literally fucking dinosaurs

what else could you want"
643,a lot of dinos
644,perfect
645,I play single player and love how I can adjust every aspect of the game to suit my play style. You can make the game very very difficult or very very easy. The dinosaurs and topography are amazing. I highly recommend this game. I don't play multiplayer but the game has many multiplayer users. There are multiple maps and some free dlc maps that I find really enjoyable.
646,Dinosaurs
647,playing with husband good enough
648,good game play
649,"its hard and scary but once u get the hang of it itll be amazing

659,If You Like Survival Games You Will Love This Game.
660,"It's Rust with plastic dinosaurs and pooping mechanics. Weird game depth where you don't expect it, shameless phoned-in hackery everywhere else. Runs 5x slower than it looks like it should, crashes a lot.     10/10

Use the tech tree to turn a Brontosaurus into a battle mech to protect your Zen garden."
661,"shitty, dont waste your time with this ""i contantly need to go on the wiki to play this game""
no explanation and game is unbalanced as fuck

663,LIKEY
664,cool game more fun with mods and also friends to play with I really recommend this game its sometimes goofy and also enjoyable at the same time obicham te aga <3
665,OK GAME
666,Glitchy as shit but fun.
667,Fun with friends or even solo would suggest watching some videos but not too many.
668,lol meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
669,Dinosaurs good
670,Great survival game- super easy- really makes you feel invincible! 0 bugs or glitches too! The developer really cares about the quality of their product as evidenced by all the bug fixes!

672,great survival game!
673,great game
674,Reaper mommy
675,"It's fun, exciting, glitchy, and can be frustrating which is when you say ""I've been Arked!"". So many mods that change up the game it never gets old. Has a bit of everything for everyone."
676,"Just being able to build with your friends on a server or flying solo with stats to make it so you can just build is amazing. Plus you get to have adorable dinos and fantastic colors when events happen. Can be a bit buggy and have its issues, but mostly a fun game you can sink so much time into."
677,great game
678,It’s got dinosaurs.

689,cool dino game
690,cool looking dinosaurs and mods
691,Best game
692,"Biggest bullshit ever. A game that spawns enemies who need some late game items to be killed next to your house is bad game design. And after dying, the enemy camps around there forever. So I can basically start over again. Overhyped crap. I'm so glad I didn't pay for this ""game""."
693,My friends and I love this multiplayer game

705,"Been playing Ark since the beginning, and it's still fun in 2022."
706,"the game itself is 10/10 for me.
solo offline gets boring after 100-200 hours or so. 
Official servers are a no go for me, since its impossible if you don't play regularly and a lot. 
renting a server and playing with a couple of friends/family members is ideal"
707,good
708,Stay off official PVP/Large PVP servers and then you will both love and hate this game with a burning passion
709,"quite fun but ruins ur friendship

710,Dinosaurs Cool :)

712,got pooped on by tec rex :(
713,It is a awesome game
714,really fun game to play although you definitely need to make friends with or all ready have friends that play the game otherwise the grind gets to much
715,"This game is hard to get into but once you understand, it becomes really fun. I do wish there was an easier way to play with friends. But unless you are on a public server or a player dedicated server it can be rough. Small radius within the host for the joiners and it can cause a lot of problems. The graphics can also throw you for a loop but other than that it is a great game. Definitely would recommend trying it out!"
716,":D

717,"It's ok, but not worth the pricetag"
718,i liked this game

722,dinosor
723,Awesome
724,i became a racist and round house kicked a pregnate muslim women and screamed bomb defused
725,"SERIOUS REVIEW:
This game has some serious annoying problems from unhelpful devs to bad hit boxes to and toxic player base. However if your a Rust player or Conan player you may really like it, for rust players and you just wish that there was a bit more going on with pets aswell as more playstyles available to you. For Conan players if your hoping for basically the same game but your pets(actual animals) will be less useless and have more dynamic controls and commands this is what you have been looking for. The last thing i wanna say is that this game is a really bad rabbit hole ive played 8000hrs on console and ive heard of people losing their families because this game became their addiction. This is my warning. Goodluck

"
726,good game
727,You can beat unsuspecting animals to death. Good game 10/10.
728,WOWIE WOWZA I LUB DIGNOSOR!!!!!!!!
729,great game
730,"What?
Survival is evolving"
731,"I hate this game; the bugs, the “working as intended” issues, spawning in and falling through the world, new survivor spawning in and before the animation can finish scratching your arm you’ve been eaten by raptors, hitting “E” while flying and falling to your death, dying in invivible lava so you can’t get your stuff back, transporting to a new world to lose your stuff, breaking a leg because you’re cold (or hot), temperature that changes from one extreme to another based on what pixel you’re on, logging into a destroyed base and the “where would you like to spawn” screen and an giga standing where you used to have a bed.

Worst. Addicting. Game. Ever."
732,fun trash
733,Good game tbh dont play alone tho it gets boring atleast for me
734,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?! CLICK OFF THE STORE PAGE!! ONCE IT HAS YOU IT WON'T LET GO! I HAVE BEEN PLAYING NONSTOP FOR 40 YEARS STRAIGHT!!
735,play the game and fuck other niggas up dont be a pussy
736,"This is a tentative positive review. I do legitimately enjoy the game, but the balancing is so bad. Everything takes forever to do in vanilla, So unless you'd like to spend a ton of hours on building just a simple house I would recommend really boosting at least weight limits for your inventory. Also another major issue with the game is just the sheer size of it, why is it like 100+ GBs for not even that much content. Please devs learn how to compress and reuse assets better, this is ridiculous."
737,the long play time and beautiful maps
738,like tameing and breedign and rideing dinos
739,
740,i want to kill myself
741,oaaahhhh
742,"ARK is so sad because the theory behind it is nearly everything I want in a game. The exploration is fun, most everything is tamable as a mount or pet, multiplayer, PVE or PVP, etc. And I have genuinely enjoyed playing the game in some ways. 

HOWEVER:
As many big developers have been doing recently, they launched the game in early development, and a lot of actual gameplay hasnt changed since. There's new dinos, new maps, hell a NEW GAME, but they haven't polished some of the most frustrating and disappointing aspects of the game since day 1. The hit boxes are abysmal, animations are a let down, you can get stuck in cracks and crevices, almost everyone installs mods and changes settings drastically to make the game very playable, ESPECIALLY outside of PVP. Instead of releasing new money grab content it would be nice to see work put into making the game feel higher quality, be better optimized, and feel like a smoother, more immersive experience. They were so close but I wish someone else could take the IP and make it feel like a good quality game. I've stopped buying all of their products because its the same disappointment every time."
743,
744,craches to much
745,The game that makes you feel like you want to do chores. Don’t buy it. Run away.
746,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
747,"Very fun, and has you occupied for hours!"
748,"heheheh, big dinosaurs"
749,Lost 18 hours of progress because of a flying tiger that somehow got my pteranodon
750,Best Game Ever!
751,"No Doubt Best Game, Can't wait till Ark 2"

754,nice
755,played this game on my ps4 and ps5... great game continue to love and support this game
756,it is fun with friends but by yourslef it is quite depressing
757,"best game ever
"
758,it is a great  game about dinosaurs and combat!!!
759,its a high quality game with an amazing fanbase
760,"Impossible to play the amount of cheaters in this game is just aburd for an example i go grief 6 servers out of those 6 in 4 i find cheaters, aimbotters/speed dinos/esp and not talk about owner account getting spoofed and people losing full servers that they haved builded over the years.
The developers expect the players to spend huge amount of time to acomplish sht in the game to lose it in a couple minutes by a few cheaters.
For example i havent been in a tribe that hasnt been both meshed aimbotted at esped lucky didnt get spoofed yet but i dont wanna jinx it well wildcard this is a honest apeal fix ur fck game its actually a good game if u take care about the cheaters."
761,A good pvp/Modded adventure

766,"the best dino game ever
"
767,ye
768,"i think the game offers somthing other games just dont. but the game alone for new players can be fun as learning machanics etc but once you done with that modding community has done soo much work, theres so much involed and can be done it makes endless storys or ways to play ark fun and possible its kinda what you imgination is limited too."
769,a steamy turd
770,this is hell
771,"horrible optimization, terrible game, and i feel bad for all those people who legit bought this before it went free. embarassing."

784,dinosaurs hehe
785,always doing somthing. chill game
786,Dino ate my butt off but i enjoyed it!
787,"why does it need so much space. if im not playing it, i need to uninstall it so that it doesn't interfear with anything."
788,"I cannot express how much I love this game. I have been playing for years and always have so much fun with it. Even though it's not very accurate to the real-life dinosaurs that existed, there's something very fun about being able to ride them and wreak havoc! Building is also very fun in this game. if you like survival/base building games this is a necessity--especially with the added challenge of taming massive, dangerous dinosaurs and keeping them safe."
789,gud game :)
790,yes
791,dont waste your life lads its not worth it get a job
792,very fun
793,"pogger game
"
794,BHH;TFHYT
795,GOOD
796,yes
797,"I think that ARK is the best game in the world, there is nothing that can compare to ARK Survival Evolved from personal sides. Good updates coming, I think it's brilliant What do about the past and how the dinosaurs were what they are called is a good lesson for children and adults who may not have heard much about dinosaurs or not so interested in dinosaurs and other animals of your imagination (Keep up your good work)"
798,"its a nice game
"
799,It is pretty fun
800,YES DADDY
801,Great memories on this game.
802,Can eat dino 10 out of 10 do recommend
803,i love the game  a lot it has  a lot of stuff to do
804,chesssssss
805,GAME IS GOOD
806,"Very fun, just need a lot of space"
807,it is soooo fun
808,"My family and I have been playing this game off and on for years.  It is one of the games we always come back to (along with 7 Days to Die and Minecolonies).  I love that you start out with nothing and build.  I also love that there are so many different creatures that you can tame and build an army.  The one thing that I think is missing is some kind of threat that the player has to prepare for.  Something like the hoard that comes every 7 days in 7 Days to die.  Like, maybe a herd of crazed dinos every so often or something like that.  Essentially, something that allows the player to flex his muscles and put his army to use."
809,i love tish game i also play it with with my best friend
810,"This game is shit. If youre looking for a relaxing game, this is not it. Its full of bugs and you will never be able to find your server due to the ammount of them going down constantly"
811,dragon man kill dino which sad he then proceeded to kidnap me put me into slavery and procceded to bum me
812,Is good. Me happy. Big file size tho
813,10/9
814,i cant join a public game or host a private game or join any game fix ur game
815,"This game allows you to poop. 
Truly magnificent.
"
816,character creator
817,Do you like dinosaurs? Do you like taming a small army of said dinosaurs? Do you like being eaten alive? Do you like being dead (a lot at first?) Do you like crafting things? Do you like going back and getting revenge on the things that have been slaughtering you without mercy (later on). Then this is the game for you. Would die again with pleasure. I only have 758 hours ingame so i am still a n00b.4
818,"scarry
"
819,this game is hard but good
820,i think it is the best game ever.And you can get mods for free (witch makes the game better)
821,"That sure is one funny looking dod-AUUUGHHH

SirCrabapple level 46 was killed by wild Terror Bird level 99"
822,"vey fun game 
"
823,sita goodo?? ?/👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
824,"Edit*: This 100% a ""look it up on google to work how it works game."" There are no in game explanations. 

The game makes no effort to explain how saving works. And the dev's seem to have gone out of their way to make it obscurely complicated.  This is one of those games where you can expect to alt tab out a lot to Google what something is/does because know what your doing would be too handholdy I guess. 

Hints:
- If you run a local server, enable admin commands so you can use ""admincheat saveworld"" to save your game. You (and your mates) can exit the game safely after this because their character data is stored host side (with the world file I think?).
- If you want to transfer your character between worlds (i.e. load a new map but silly play Capt. Billy Strangler) you need to upload them at one of the big floating towers. Remember to transfer your items into ""the transporter"" first. Because the dev's figured that 'upload character' should mean upload only your character's stats and delete the items you spend hours grinding for.

825,"game yes

826,its a fun game but its really buggy and it requires alot of grinding

831,good
832,"when i got this game, i had a real shit computer, and so i was confused, looking at a 9 fps server browser. i just intended to play singleplayer, not on a server, but it seems as though that's the point. i'll give it an average review as i wasn't really able to experience the game, but it seems really cool in concept."
833,It's bloody reliving the childhood fantasy of dino's and being able to master them and taming them to ride and battle other dinos its just overall sick
834,"This is actually a nice game!
"
835,"its a good game
"
836,Best game ever. Played once and got hooked instantly :)
837,much excitement
838,"Was having fun, didnt look up any guides to help. Loved it for the 12 hours it let me play, was a blast killing and making a base. Till the game bugged out and i got stuck in my house inside the bed. Uninstalled and everything which took a while, was still stuck. Cant rec due to that"
839,AAA
840,Its good
841,"If you can get past the constant crashing, lagging, gamebreaking bugs, and having your game consistently wiped for no reason, its pretty fun. However I cannot recommend the game simply because the devs did absolutely nothing to fix the bugs and only would release new content as a cash grab."
842,"This is by far my most favorite survival game I have ever played. This game is buggy, takes up 90% of my SSD, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. 11/10 of a game. Fantastic"
843,i hope the devs get shot
844,Game is full of cheaters and the devs dont care for it
845,Terrible quality servers. Gen2 server 1015 crashes constantly with downtime from 40 or more minutes before anyone reboots. They can't seem to keep this server up for more than a few hours at a time before it crashes?!?

867,Just Shit
868,very good survivor game
869,cool game
870,Ahhhhhhhhh
871,took me 180 hours to realize how bad a game this is
872,"I played a lot of Ark on Xbox, and Ark on PC is a big upgrade from the console version. Just being able to add mods alone makes the game so much better. I mainly have added clothing mods, but I wanna add different mods later on. Overall, Ark is a fun game solo and with friends. However, official servers are tedious and time consuming. If you don't have much time to play this game, play a single player with adjusted settings for quick taming, breeding, etc. That is just a recommendation, though. You can play however you wanna with whoever you want."
873,"Fun

874,love it
875,"dino game

876,"Pvp is dead, solution: remove gen 1 & 2 transfers, add kill boxes in the mesh or remove items used to mesh, and perm ban on any mesh offense, only buy this if you want pve.

i will not buy Ark 2 before developers show competence."
877,"This game is a tragic loss simulator.  You're a survivor among dinosaurs and other wild creatures, not to mention the other survivors around you.  You band together in hopes to keep what you spend many hours into creating and achieving, but whether it's due to native gameplay or random bugs in the code, you're always at risk to losing everything.  The devs try their best to keep the players happy, but this game was released and maintained in a broken state for all its years on the market.  I've dumped 1,646 hours into this game, only to be leaving it feeling like I've achieved nothing.  Those that have the will to maintain and keep going become desensitized, and feel the need to continue to bully the players which they come across, much like the game bullies each survivor with every turn at the corner. It's not healthy and it takes away from the true nature of life, teaching the wrong things to those that strive to learn everything about this game. I don't recommend playing it, albeit it is an experience to experience. We'll see how Ark 2 evolves, but I don't have my hopes up."

929,yes
930,"love it, bit buggy and laggy but still love it"
931,great game just avoid servers like Black bush lots of admin abuse
932,"Friendly Clans, very helpful"
933,Great game with a wide range of gameplay opportunities. I love that it has many bosses and late game content. It has many free expansions that bring different dinos and maps which makes the game fun for longer. Would recommend this game 100%.
934,! GOOD BUY OR U ARE CACA !
935,its a very fun game and its easy to install mods for the game
936,"Fundamentally broken. It wouldn't be as bad if not for the fact that things that kill you then have your stuff under their feet, so unless you have gear that's just as good as what you originally had, chances are you're not getting it back. Also of note, you only tend to have reliable and efficient access to materials *after* you needed them."
937,i have no more brain good game
938,"WOOOZEERR !!! I LOVE GETTING OFFLINE RAIDED BY 14 YEARS OLDS !!! 

THIS GAME IS SO FUN !!! 

EXECPT FOR THE TEK PART :((  

OVERALL 9/10  :D


"
939,good and mostly better with mod as long as you have a good pc other than that 8/10
940,a whole bunch of cool content built upon a foundation of dirt. A real shame
941,ghj
942,"it has dinosaurs yo
"
943,dinos go rawr xd
944,"trash, laggy, garbage, bugged, pile of steaming dodo dung."
945,"Got this game on sale for 10$. 25$ for the DLC's. 
MULTIPLAYER PVP : As a survival PVP game similar to Rust, I'd have to say it is bad, experienced tribes with massive bases, filled with members that seem to have unlimited time on their hands litter the best spots on the map. After a day or two, these guys control most of the high tier resources (metal, obsidian, artifacts, element), which can make the game increasingly frustrating when your base gets wiped while you were offline.
SOLO/MULTIPLAYER SURVIVAL : Playing this game in survival, especially with no prior knowledge, can be almost like a second Minecraft. Good graphics to back up the almost overwhelming amount of content, but a surprising amount of bugs and annoyances. It is quite easy to get stuck on funky hitboxes, or to have trouble turning with sometimes terrible dino turn radii (probably a skill issue on my part). Not sure if many other people experience this bug, but keep it in mind: while Ark is a fun game to play, be aware that there is a bug where the game decides to not load anything in your save file. The icon representing your ""save"" is still present, but your character, dinos, and builds are all wiped. It is just as if you started a brand new game, but you didn't. Overall, especially if this bug doesn't persist or gets fixed, great game."
946,"Best game ever. Very fun and taming dinosaurs and building buildings are fun. Some bugs, but overall very good!"
947,Good
948,good gam
949,Perfect for adventure worth the money
950,"it may say only 188 hrs at this point but i have enjoyed this game for much longer and i hope it is not scraped when ark ii is released, awesome game wildcard, <3"
951,
952,"The game that I have spent/wasted most of my time.
For now, only one problem for this game:....

damn it, could you please release ARK2 as soon as possible??? OTZ"
953,Best game played it on my ps4 and favorite game since release can’t wait for ark 2 and you never run out of anything to play because you can always get new mods and stuff to do so much more fun stuff
954,-rep Dinos
955,gud game with guns and dinos
956,bad game
957,"infinite replay-ability. every year i come back to ark because who doesn't like conquering and taming dragons, dinosaurs, and other crazy creatures!"
958,good
959,good game
960,dinosaurs. what else do you want?
961,"So I don't hate this game i really don't I genuinely love this game it's just that the problem that I have with this game is how it's moderated because, i was banned  for being in a tribe that had apparently meshed and I had no idea that they had because I had just been in this tribe for only one and a half DAYS, to find that my account had been banned from official which sucks because I was not the only one that was banned there were a couple really nice people that got banned that were also very to the tribe. and so i don't wanna come off as ""Wildcard give me a second chance"" but I just wanna say please try and confront the leaders or the people who did mesh then just ban everybody. sincerely just some random guy trying to enjoy a dinosaur game"
962,what the hell is wrong with you
963,owwwwww game so confuseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i get team up by 40 dilophosaurus and die
964,ass
965,"good game

967,fun
968,GIS THIS GAME IS THEE SSSSUUUUUUUUSSEEEEE BUKU EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
969,Once you start playing this game you cant stop
970,great to play with friends
971,this game is just satisefing to play and extremmely fun because you can make challenges that dont exacly fit with the game like: 100 days to beat the island on hardcore with just terror birds or 100 days living on brontos or 100 days on scorched earth only using wolves. so many diffrent challengs that can be tested and done and its fun to have the experince of beating the game in a diffrent way then just Rexs or spinos.
972,Very nice
973,"good game, but you have to do your research on what server to play on. 

if you just wanne chill, build, go on adventure -  join a unofficial pve server cluster that hase a active community and you should be more than fine for the next 1k hours xD

Dont just join official pvp and expect to have fun.... you wont"
974,"one of the most unfair, unfun and unbalanced games i've ever played. the second you think you might've accomplished something, the game takes it away immediately and shits on your face. plus, it looks ugly as hell."
975,funny dinosaur game

990,"just a fun game thats all im saying i dont wanna write a long review
"
991,very cool game
992,"The concept is amazing and the PvE side is fun especially with friends, but it is undeniably riddled with bugs that the developers don't care to address. Glitching and clipping on creatures, structures, and sometimes even the ground itself, frustrating building system with false visual snap points, and for a game focused a lot on its creatures, it has the most half-baked pathfinding AI. Most players choose to ignore the issues and give positive reviews because the game is still fun at its core, but the developers' lack of care for these since day one really makes you question their ability of making ARK 2 even good. 

I wouldn't recommend this game without quality of life mods such as structures plus, auto engrams and ultra stacks. Without a doubt, it's the modding community that's keeping this game alive. "
993,🐐 game
994,"gud ghame
"
995,good game. just started this game. i would love to play other also. so if you can invite me i'll be happy to join your tribe and play with you. thanx.

1001,"it just a school simulator
"
1002,rlly fun game
1003,"So many broken things and cheaters. Work for many hours to build/tame something and some cheater comes along and wrecks it. It is is the way of Ark. Always has been. I suspect it always will be. Now that Ark 2 is on the way, they won't dedicate any resources to fixing it. Why would I ever play Ark 2 when you so thoroughly mishandled Ark 1?"
1004,1212121
1005,my love game thanke for dev <3
1006,You can charge anything with an army of dodo's
1007,fun
1008,lost/timedout connection to host idk how to fix it i tried everything
1009,lit game
1010,"good
"
1011,"Once my favorite game ever.  I returned to try the new content that's released since I stopped playing.  The game is amazing, the official servers are trash.  The additional stress this adds to an already stressful game is enough to make anyone quit.  The fact that this is still an issue this many years beyond launch is astounding.  Why aren't these devs working on a solution instead of pushing new events, adding dinos and maps?  Some servers go down about every 2 hours for 45 minutes, before they are rebooted.  Oh you were taming something?  Well that's unfortunate, I hope it wasn't something like a shadowmane that is already a cancer taming process.  

On top of that, EVERY server hard freezes every 15 minutes for 10-30 seconds.  What other games would you tolerate that in?  You wouldn't, and that's why this is so sad to me.  I love this game, but I hope they do better in the next one."
1012,I got this for free and I still want my money back.
1013,"I am a 57 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 13 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 32 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

1041,Great fun.
1042,Love this game. Play on PC and Xbox. love the Mods that I can get on PC
1043,"For me, this was the origin of open-world sandbox survival, my first experience with the genre, and it amazed me.  I've moved on to other games and came back time and again.  My only complaint about this game AT ALL is the difficulty in getting started with ANY multiplayer scenario.  Less trouble and almost worth the effort to rent a server, but maybe not worth the cost.  Playing single-player, I have absolutely nothing in the game to complain about in any way.  But it would be nice to play with friends."
1044,this game has some terexs and some birds and tjhres a snake in my boot cuh

1050,YES FUN YA HAPY DINO DIE SAD :(
1051,i got an allosaurus and named it walter white
1052,"I had a lot of fun playing with friends on Xbox and using the Windows Store version to host. But, trying to get back into it, I just hate reading the options. Reading anything for the settings for going solo or hosting feels like I should hit myself in the head several times to be a caveman and accept how backwards a lot of it feels. You raise values to lower something. I remember the settings didn't have consistency on raising values.
It's a fossil in my library now. There is no way I am going to appreciate this ever again.
I don't like PVP or anyone else's severs. It's friends only and even my friends got sick of this game.
It feels date and plays dated. There's still grass with a hit box of a half a pixel and now that development has stopped to work on part 2, I can't be bothered anymore to learn how to get back on this wobbly bike.
Also really mad I paid for the DLC now that it's free.
It's a history I want to forget now."
1053,I done poo'd
1054,Ark is A Great game i absolutly LOVE this game but there is some things that need to be  fixed or reworked lets hope ark 2 is better!
1055,"I like this game, its pretty good."

1057,(:
1058,"very good game, been playing it forever :)"

"
1060,ITS AMAZING
1061,game full of cheats if they fixed the mesh and aimbot issues would be a good game
1062,After all these years they still continue to make new dino's and things for this game. I really appreciate developers that continue and care about their games.
1063,dino
1064,fun
1065,not working
1066,mid but i like it
1067,"Teaches people to get resources together as objectives to fulfil plans. Like life, everything has a cost. Craft what you want, only you have to pay to maintain it. The dinosaurs are virtually all historically correct and inspirational. One of a kind. Classic!"
1068,Lots of hours of fun to be had and plenty of stuff to explore with maps and expansions
1069,awesome game if you love dinos.
1070,This is a very fun game with very cool animals.

1072,Hard but awesome

1078,"Still don't know what I'm doing, but I'm having fun.  The game definitely needs a tutorial.  Given that it doesn't seem to, youtube is your friend."
1079,Best game if you like survival and dinosaur games
1080,Nice game
1081,its a really good game not much else to say
1082,"the open world, and the dinosaurs."
1083,its got dinos what more could you ask for
1084,one of my top favorite game i have much more time on console but its even better on pc just wish i had people to play with.
1085,grind but fun
1086,"It's Cool Yeah ;)
"
1087,"I was wanting to buy Ark long before it was free, I have not been able to play very much, noting how busy I am with school, life in general, and people, but every once in a while I will get on and play a bit, I do enjoy the game, modding capabilities, and multiplayer, I absolutely recommend it for anyone who can afford it."
1088,"LOTS TO DO,, NEVER BORING,, DOWNSIDE IS IT COULD POTENTIALLY FRY YOUR GPU.."

1103,Very addictive
1104,"VERY fun game with plently of things to do with large and new and creative maps

1105,good
1106,for several years i was playing ark mobile since the game been free it is really the best game in the world for me after csgo and rdr i really recommend it if you love survival games
1107,How much did they pay to people to rate this trash pile good
1108,"game full of cheaters and devs do nothing about it, you can watch hours of work gone in minutes to cheaters"

1136,goooooood
1137,Mega fun game. Best used with friends however single player can be fun. A little buggy but very great game overall.
1138,"Not a fun game. It is a waste of time and energy. It has no story and the graphics are horrible. It is supposed to be a coop game so playing solo isn't fun. You can't even unlock everything in the game. All the dinos kill you in one shot, but when you tame it, it sucks literally ass"
1139,"This is a long somewhat extensive review explaining several points.... the quality / state of the game, its development / enforcement team, history, and my personal opinion on it. More so a rant tbh but hope it helps you!

At the height is the graphic settings / memory leak. the game is ran on an old version of unreal engine, the game is not optimized its come a long way but there's still some aspects. IE Particles slider or something. so many times do i see people crash after they blow something up due to the dust particles that come up or tek bouncing in a suit, managarmr dust, gen water particles etc. If you got a good comp with proc youre good but even ppl with new gear still have issues sometimes. Most ppl who pvp tinker with a file called console variables / INI. that being said PVE wise the game is gorgeous af!!!!!!!!!!

For PVE i would highly recommend it. Specifically if you're new to the game or just buying it..... i would start off in single player for a bit, if you have friends to play with this is a warning to you about the official PVE servers. They can be more toxic than pvp. Examples: In this game people cannot build close to one another within a certain range, so tribes on pve will spam their foundations / increase their perimeter / block build spots  for newcomers or other tribes etc. They will drag dinosaurs that can destroy metal or soak turrets into your base just for fun. so join at your own risk there are servers that are not that toxic, there are also fresh servers sometimes. 

If you want pvp.... the current state of the game on official PVP servers as well as ARKPOK is riddled with EXPLOITERS DUPLICATION BUGS OR CLIENTS HACKERS AIMBOTTERS ESP REAL MONEY TRADING INSIDERS. i would recommend you joining unofficial servers that are populated and actively enforced. MTS is alright there has been occasional admin abuse but for most part atm it has been cleaned up last i heard. However it is a server where you will have to no life to keep up with everyone otherwise you can be offlined / wiped fast.
(That being said, you are subject to a random persons rules / ethic / moral Meta etc. In most cases admins of unofficial server abuse their admin role and spawn items/tames in for ""bribes"" or ""personal"" ""friend"" etc where as official you wont see that. now thats not every server of course)  

My unbiased opinion is that there is no other game like it...that is what makes it so great / sad at same time for pvp players. i have multiple accounts with total of around 20,000 + hours give or take a couple thousand being either afk or unaccounted for. ive played since alpha.

Unfortunately the PVE community is much bigger than the PVP so the developers will cater to them over PVP community, for the simple fact that the PVP community creates most the problems that devs have to spend resource on.... they will only do anything to fix certain things when they are put on blast by the entire community or reddit YT etc. IE HOD GAMING MESH REDDIT INCIDENT and Currently RAIL GUN HACKER EPIDEMIC....they have since removed the ability to use rail gun bc of hackers but prior to the epidemic the railguns purpose was to help raid caves for the cave meta or defend against meshers. meshing is the act of going into an area you are not intended to in the map ie under the map or inside of the mesh.... bypass another tribe/ players defenses and gain advantage by blowing up their stuff going inside their base / stealing etc. 

Enforcement is an absolute joke now, theres too many hackers to devote the time and resources to. i get it.. their job is limited bc their is so many ways to get around being banned or hardware id banned so its unfair to place the entire blame on them for the hacker side of things. theyre basically fighting a losing battle / 24/7 at this point due to the limited anticheat software. Theres tons of controversial topics on some of enforcement's choices in the past IE the og enforcement lead ""Valor"" leaving etc. i wont go into that. Oh and there are tribes who have ""game testers"" or friends with testers that get the first inside scoop on bugs / exploits to abuse before theyre patched!! cool right?

i will go into is the legal history of the 2 gaming companies that run the game. WildCard + Snail games. if you have ever seen the show ""silicon valley"" you will know that if company 1 uses company 2s facility/resources to build something to benefit company 1 without company 2 knowing, they are liable to legal repercussion. which is exactly what happened between the 2 (wild card or mother company and snail games). in this snail games owns/ operates a portion of the gaming service. IE official conquest / classic cluster and Pixark. They have since abused the cluster for their own personal advantage for a tribe that includes a player who's relations involve a exec in snailgames. whether or not this is entirely true is a blurr. the proof however lies in their actions towards said tribe / history of said tribe. insider information etc... The tribe being referred to can cheat with amnesty given...if you raid them and beat them more often than not they will cry to a enforcement member they have under their payroll / finger to unban and then ban all the attackers....or they will just cheat towards your tribe... leaving an unfair advantage over other tribes. there so much history to go over about said tribe but i will not go into any more. you can find videos on YT if you would like to learn more. just search hod gaming wipes cheating tribe. 

PVP has had its ups and its downs with metas, theres so many niches and tames to choose from to kill people with.. its great to have a arsenal to choose from. That being said most ppl just follow a meta. Personally for me the best point in time for this games meta history was the start of new servers. Had around the Most active players on official pvp, (255 ping and 20fps was truely still awful looking back xD but 255 ping still happens on wide scale pvp) asia was still open to fight with dinosaurs werent completely bred to hell to the point where they 1 tap players or other dinosaurs. There wasnt these op dinosaurs to soak turret bullets with. it was pretty level playing field on foot pvp as well. there was actually bases above ground. now the game has progressed from a simple dinosaur / primitive buildup on land game, to a futuristic mythological cluster F of rats in caves. Tek grenade launchers Flamethrower bobs mind control  flying space dolphins with laser beams / whales with laser cannons hawk that saves your items if someone kills you also allowing you to just kys whenever someone shows up to kill you and get the satisfaction of looting the kill. Giant monsters kaijus dragons griffs weird little alien fish wolf (shadowmane)  Theres so much ridiculousness now...that being said it is refreshing to have new dinos / items. 

To wrap up this rant, to any new players......i love and hate this game.....for me i am done due to the state of the pvp community / meta hacker epidemic etc and i have given enough time to the game and its time to wait for ark 2 release as well as bordom........

I would most def say BUY THE GAME!!!!

Play it with friends, just dont get sucked into the no life aspect / toxic sector. let things go dont get attached to pixels, play for fun, play in moderation. Experience every aspect you can that this game has to offer, funny bugs, disappointment / joy etc. balance this game with your life dont prioritize it like ive seen some of the sad souls here. 

Just dont cheat and add to the toxicity of the community please. Like i said this game is like no other....if you can ignore alot of the big negatives you will enjoy this game ive made many of my friends from this game ive enjoyed alot of time in this game. ending on 20000+ hours i can say you still will learn new things in the game even at my level. There's a vast amount of things to do in this game!"

1164,Great game make sure you have strong hardware tho or it will not run
1165,"this game is ass, you cant even play it because the ""easy"" spawn has level 135 raptors making it impossible to play not a fun experience. ill never recommend this game of play it again"
1166,"I wouldnt currently recommend this to my worst enemy, unless they were very open about ball smash torture being a fetish.  Anyway, When I first saw this game I was so amazed at the concept of it and I watched videos for days.  I finally purchased it and absolutely fell in love.  Once I was able to play the game for myself,  I couldnt believe how much fun it was.  I have I think 3000 hours on xbox and then moved here when I got a pc and have 316 hours.  This game is definitely one of the funnest experiences ive ever had and all of that is RUINED by rampant CHEATING.  I dont think i've played another game with this much cheating before.  You've got people duplicating items, which also ends up shutting the servers down for everyone and they end up rolling the servers back 15 mins, and you better just pray you weren't fighting something or flying or doing something dangerous 15 mins ago cause you will load back in and fall to your death/be killed by whatever your fighting.  On top of that the amount of Real World Trading that goes on, (Selling in game Dinos, items, WHOLE BASES/Locations) on the public servers is insane.  You almost need a group of 50 friends to combat some of these cheap tactics, but even then when the cheaters are exploiting Railguns and can shoot you through walls from 97867659698 yards away so thats just 50 targets for them to practice on. Dont even get me started on the amount of players meshing their bases into the walls/floors of the map so you literally cant raid them properly.  If you would like to see a nice overview of some of the cheats check out H.O.D. Gaming on youtube, he has consistently been one of the most entertaining/helpful producers of ark pvp content for years and hes done a nice video about the cheating, that being said, once Wildcard actually shows an effort to support their existing game and bans the cheaters/infiltrates all the RWT facebook/other social groups and shuts them down  instead of focusing solely on Ark 2 then I will revise my review and remove all the cheating talk from my thoughts while reviewing."

1199,"I like ARK as it is a challenging survival game and if you have played Minecraft and found it too easy and like survival games than ARK is SOOO much more challenging, fun and you would probably play this longer than you would play minecraft. The graphics are good. The maps are GREAT. The dinosaurs and great. Overall this game is definitely worth playing if you have the money and space."
1200,"dying game, wild card aren't supporting the community against cheaters/hackers, I will not buy ark 2 if they don't fix ark 1"
1201,"TL;DR - It's pretty good, 5/7

It's hard to put to words exactly what ARK has been to me. I was obsessed with dinosaurs as a kid, so when my buddy told me about a new early-access survival game with dinosaurs, I was immediately sold. 10,000 hours later I can say that ARK - even with all it's numerous bugs and frustrations - has provided me more enjoyment than probably every other game I've ever played [i]combined[/i]. It's not without it's flaws, as I mentioned, and those honestly gave me more frustration than every other game I've played combined as well, but in the end, the allure of the creatures, the taming, breeding, exploring, and most of all building always brought me back. I finally reinstalled one last time (quite the ordeal since the game along with a normal amount of essential mods and the expansion maps takes up around 300 terabytes of disk space) to cross the 10k mark and get the last couple achievements I somehow missed, and now I can finally retire and [b]finally[/b] click ""yes"" to recommend this game to other players.
 
If I could start over from the beginning, I absolutely would. If anyone out there [i]hasn't[/i] experienced ARK, you're in for a massive, deep, time-consuming ride.

PROS:
massive creature variety,  taming, riding, and breeding creatures, amazing landscapes, challenging caves and bosses, unexpectedly immersive story (from vanilla ark to Genesis 2) with hidden lore around the world, creative building (aided by mods) and on a related note, a [b]substantial[/b] community of modders that flesh out an already massive game. 

CONS:
Bugs. Every game has them, this one is no different. More frustrating than that is human nature though - the survival genre attracts aggressive trolls, and your far more likely to be ganked or wake up to your base exploded than you are to experience gratifying world-PvP. PvE exists of course, but simply doesn't provide enough challenge to warrant continued breeding and building, which were my main long-term goals in game."
1202,my brother told me this game was on sale for free on epic games the day after the sale ended im still mad
1203,"Honestly wasnt to sure about this game before i played it but my friends finally convinced me to get it, in my honest opinion i love this game i racked about 40 hours in the first week and kept staying up all night to play with my friend. Great times playing this cant wait to see how Ark 2 is going to be."
1204,"Well; I decided to dive into this game when it first released to alpha, and I've also come back to play it when they've added tek, adobe, and a host of other things.

I want to like this game, I really do. I try to like this game, which is why I play it with friends, but every single day there is something with this game that aggravates our group.

Bugs out the rear end to start. Even some known bug where the game will freeze if a wireless headset disconnects. The game will just completely become unresponsive and has to be restarted. I decided to look online, and there's a slew of other people with the issue, most of them unable to fix the issue. One guy even had to purchase a wired headset to circumvent the issue. 

Performance has gotten better since the alpha, but there's things with the engine this game runs on that make it unimpressive. Things like light-bleeding inside of structures when you place lights down. The developers also had some huge obsession with bloom, because it's everywhere. I had to utilize console commands in order to remove the bloom completely and not make it look like crap. At some points I felt like I needed to genuinely wear a pair of sunglasses when I play. If you really want to blind your friends, use the flair-gun. Guarantee they'll yell at you.

I've played all the maps; and the first few offered nothing special. They all were just maps with grass, and snow. Then the developers decided to get kinky and add a volcano. Fjordur and The Center are the only two maps where I felt like they tried to add variety.  I also do enjoy the massive desert biome in Ragnarok. 

Also not too impressed with the ""Paint"" functionality in this game. I come from 7 Days to Die, and those developers did painting functionality where it was easy to use, and you didn't dread it. If you use a paint brush and you have a decent size building; then be prepared to scream and want to throw yourself off a cliff. It's the most painful and tedious task ever in this game.

I wasn't impressed with the build limit either. I noticed a lot of other players were also complaining about this on the servers I tried. Unofficial servers can raise / modify the limit, but as far as official servers; not impressed one bit with this. For a game with SO many assets, the limit seems very low-balled.

If you want to have fun, it's definitely a game to try. But be prepared to get annoyed as time goes on. 

I recently heard that they are developing Ark 2; which is quite puzzling, considering the fact that Ark 1 doesn't even look like a completely finished product. Now they're going off to the next money grab. Hopefully it's polished this time around."
1205,I don't recommend it
1206,Don't waste your time with this game. It's addicting
1207,This game sucks in your soul and refuses to return it. play at your own risk.
1208,"ok

1235,Tja...
1236,"an interesting game to escape from reality and to relax on your computer, fun to play, you can play with your friends or you can play alone, I recommend it, a very good game"
1237,"The developers really dropped the ball this time. 
There are a number of exploits on the fjordur map alone. Bats have a long grab range (bad for pvp).
They allow building in loot caves so alpha tribes can block resources to other players stunting their progress.
Constant cheating/ meshing.
Wildcard never listens to the community pertaining these issues. They spend more time promoting new dinos or ark2 then actually listening to fans/consumers about these issues. This has been going on for years. Wildcard will loose their franchise if they continue to ignore the community. And it doesnt matter if Vin Diesel is Santiago.

1238,great game
1239,save urself dont do it
1240,it is a amaizing game
1241,I missed 6 exams of my end year college which costed me 3000$
1242,"*Spoilers Alert- If you don't want to read this whole review, I highly recommend this game!

I got this game when it was on sale for 100% off one time (a few months ago from when this review is posted), and decided to try it out... I already had a love for dinosaurs for my whole life, and knew a lot about them, so this game seemed right up my alley, and it is! I have been having so much fun playing this game, there is just so much to do in each and every map! And sure, you can get annoyed at times from things like a raptor killing you over and over again when you first start, or if you get killed by piranhas when trying to cross a river- and then try to get your stuff back from the river and just keep getting killed over and over again, but once you eventually find a way to play, you will have so much fun! And the taming part is definitely my favourite part about this game, being able to tame a powerful creature that has previously terrorized you, or just for fun is just such an amazing feeling! I remember a time when I was just starting and got attacked by a carno, and I only had tranq arrows on me so I just kept running away and shooting it with those until it eventually got knocked out... so I just gave it some food and I tamed it! I absolutely recommend this game to anyone with a love for dinosaurs, animals, survival, building, exploring, etc.!!!"
1243,"I have 3 PC and one laptop at home. Test it on GTX 1060, 2070 and 3070TI. That game is so poor optimised, thats horrible. Better the PC/GPU, worse is the optimation. On 3070TI you can get 150-200 FPS but GPU get etremly hot...for this kind bad graphic(even on epic), thats not ok. There is no in game fps limiter. You must edit config or limit on GPU panel.

Game idea is good but there is also many problems and bugs...after so many years not get fixed."

The devs have no interest in clearing up after themselves, just pile on more and more crap with each update. Shame, because it's very enjoyable but 36 hours to patch after an update? Yeh right, uninstalled."
1250,Minecraft with Dinosaurs
1251,p
1252,yes arking is fun
1253,Ive played for 143.8 hours i LOVE this game
1254,Great game. Easy to spend a lot of time playing it to say the least. The really nice thing is that you can play PVE or PVP and have  a really great experience.
1255,"Great game. It's fun playing with friends together and build a base or work with the Dinos. There may be some bugs in the game, but they weren't annoying for me. This game brought some good moments with friends and it was a lot of fun playing it. I would recommend it!"
1256,its a really fun game even more fun when u add mods to the game!
1257,"i love this game espiaclly the fact that you can tame dinosaurs and ride them you cant do that in many other games, the techs are also cool"
1258,Super fun with mods
1259,mhhhhhh dodo

1264,the game is fun but i played to much so i cant get a refund and there is a bug i cant play with out it crashing now
1265,"Ark is really only fun on unofficial PvE (personal server, solo, or some random community server.) for the most part if you don't take fun in taming dinos and building small settlements with others this game isn't for you, simple as that. 

On the other hand is PvP.... Official PvP is a mess of glitches, hacks, and whatever else people can slip through with to turn your hours of play into nothing more than smoke and ashes, If you go onto Youtube rn and look up meshing you will get plenty off 60 second videos of some rat clipping through reality and either raiding a legit player or building a base so impossibly good they can raise a family of 86 without a single one being disturbed. Sometimes they also live in their own little rat communities creating whole villages in the fabric of space and time. My point being Its awful garbage the devs don't care about.

On the final other other hand is Non-Official PvP it can be fun depending on your style and how good the server owners are, I personally prefer the PvP where you rp with eachother not to be mean spirited just compete. This way you won't get your thatch hut nuked but when you build your tek castle you have to use diplomacy and war since others want your crown.

All in all 8/10 game I hope Ark2 has more PvE focus since well PvP is a joke"

In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game."

1296,"one of the best games i have ever played, it takes awhile to learn/master and a lot of grinding to actually progress far in the game. yet every aspect of the game is enjoyable and rewarding whether its taming and breeding creatures, exploring the many maps, caving, gathering resources, or making an attempt at fighting one of the bosses. Two things I will mention as downsides are 1. the game is very large and with all DLCs im actually pretty confident it is the largest game and 2. the building system is not the best, the snap points some structures seem very strange, and i have had some structures break for practicly no reason (example:recently i built a bridge connecting two buildings together then i placed a wall on part of one of the buildings but picked it up because i did not like it and then the entire bridge broke) yet it is still possible to make very large detailed buildings just very tedious. yet exluding these two aspects the base game provides hours of amazing play time then adding the DLCs it provides you with even more, with over 1,000 hours on PC a little more on the ps4 the game dosent get old and i havent even gotten around to beating the bosses on some of the maps yet. I strongly recommend this game to everyone even just to check it out running around with no tools on the beach can be fun with a couple friends and the game goes on sale for really cheap ocasionally."
1297,an amazing game.I recomend getting the DLC
1298,Addicting to play. Extremely fun with others but also fun alone. I recommend it o anyone who likes dinos or survival games :D

1309,i got a triceratops and named it forehead
1310,Its really good its like a more detailed and harder version of minecraft but there's so much you can do its hard to get bored
1311,its like mc but more realistic and better tames
1312,its my favourite game and nothing compares to it! i have way more hours on xbox
1313,"i have played this for a few day straight now,and the game is very fun and addictive.
there are just a few problem in this game,mostly its AI,and spawning problems.
first of all what i find a problem is that some dodo's only take one arrow to kill,while others take like 5-6.
it lacks a bit of consistency here.
everybody knows about the raptor problem,running around like some killing machine.
sometimes they nicely stay in one area other times,there run like crazy and spot you from miles away.
sometime i get this feeling animals are spawned in just to annoy me.
or only attack me and nothing else.
now the biggest problem with the raptor is the jump glitch,where it jumps on you,and you end up inside the raptor,not being able to move.
this should have been fixed ages ago.
also some servers forced my running speed too 130% this is unacceptable in my eyes.
i want to spend those points myself.
so i log back in,and i can only carry half the weight,i selected.
resource gathering is also big problem,some servers have boosted it way to high.
and normal is too low.
so you swing you axe one time,and you weight capacity is full.
the whistle wheel is missing an aggressive stance.
how ever if i whistle neutral all,i need to manually reset all my dino's.
so setting up dinos is hard,if you want them to protect your base in pvp.
a lot of times dinos get stuck behind rocks and trees,mostly when 2 trees are too close.
so you have to walk all the way back to go get them/keep an eye on the constatly.
the path finding system is a straight line,or an area,it does not try to find ways around things.
and generally feel like ever 5 meter has a spawn point for something that is out to kill you.
just a little too much....in my mind.
while other areas feel almost feel abandoned.
"
1314,"Crappiest game I've ever played, I tried to get a refund but the crappy steam support didn't allow me to cause I ""played too long"" and now i'm stuck with this garbage game 100% would not recommend buying its not worth your money or time."
1315,One of the worst studios when it comes to release dates and managing their game. So many exploits and cheaters its one of the worst out there for this. Game has so much potential but until they get their act together and stop focusing so much on pve content they will never be great.

1324,"Devs don't even fix their exploit problems, Official servers are basically unplayable due to cheaters, meshers and exploiters, abusing the game, using tek railgun to shoot through mesh using aimbot, pushing the player base away and simply making the game no longer fun, owning an official server is simply ignorant in the fact they thought admins wouldn't abuse their power as well and there are even real money trades happening all the time, outright selling meshed bases and exploits."
1325,"This game is super fun, even though you die a lot, but that part helps you learn! Be patient."
1326,"I love ark with all my heart, but Ark is full of Meshers and Cheaters. Do not waste your time, do not give them your money, do not buy Ark 2. 
If the devs can't fix Ark,  then how will they be able to stop meshing and cheating on Ark 2?

(p.s i have 4k hours on Xbox/win 10)

1327,Nice game
1328,"Although the game by itself is great, i absolutely do NOT recommend buying the game in it's current state.
Studio Wildcard does absolutely NOTHING about meshers and hackers on official servers nowadays, thus making it unplayable for fair / new players. Studio Wildcard doesn't even bother banning these people so save yourself the pain and do not buy it!"
1329,is cool
1330,i been playing ark sence it came out 7 year ago. it a very fun game to play and meet new people. also you can rent your own server. i would check it out
1331,Interesting game. I only play solo mode. I have no comment on any of the silly drama with multiplayers using cheats. No idea why folks do that. I am sure playing with a dedicated server and group of actual friends can make Ark very enjoyable. For me it seems a fine diversion. It has been around long enough for the modding community to enhance the game. Being a free download was nice. Exploring the worlds is not a bad way to spend some time.
1332,"piranhas kinda gay but yh, would recommend with more people"
1333,Good stuff
1334,"ط

1335,"Game runs pretty poorly modded and is very slow paced on vanilla, no thanks."
1336,Funny Dinosaur game
1337,very good game lmao
1338,developed by studio wildcard
1339,I've been playing this game for about a week now and find it very challenging. I am enjoying it quite a bit.
1340,"I like to play with my friends all the time
"
1341,"This the worst game I have seen in a while, wouldn't recommend it to anyone. For a game that seems to require houndred of hours, then sure seem to not care about their player bases time and constantly allow cheating and exploits. If your thinking about buying this game don't!"
1342,an interesting game that tests skill
1343,after 5 years its still bad
1344,Its good game but big file

1346,"Is the game good? Yes.  Would I recommend it to friends? No.  The Devs literally do not care what players think about this game since they try to keep it unofficial as long as they can and then when it is officially release there is not enough enforcement for the game.  Pocket devs are a thing, Meshing.  I am just self loathing is why I play this game still."
1347,Wake up on the beach and scratch your arm. Kill dodo burd. Build house. Make tools. Build better base. Tame dino. Tame flying dino. Fly around. Steal dragon egg. Raise dragon. Fight boss. Die. Kill yourself

1357,there were a few things i didnt like about some of the maps but for the most part one of my all time favorite survival sandbox games and would recommend it to any player looking for that authentic fun gameplay

1360,imagine rust with dinos 8/10
1361,What's the hope for ark 2 when 1 is still struggling with mesh bugs
1362,Dinsor nuggy
1363,I love ark
1364,PvP is unplayable the PvE experience is great to have fun with friends but the game is very unforgiving.
1365,"This game was released 5 years ago. 
Never have I seen such weird and game breaking bugs. 
- Not being able to pick up certain items. 
- Item descriptions and ingredients don't show up, making crafting a nightmare. 
- My mouse randomly hops over to my second monitory, I need to alt+tab the game, move the mouse back onto the screen of the first monitor and open the game an.
- Building snap-on is frustrating and ruins the experience. 
Would have really loved to tame dinosaurs and ride them into battle....
This has been a massive disappointment."
1366,Fun game
1367,.
1368,"Incredible game, however it seems to be abandoned or even abused by developers and admins. 

It's currently full of cheaters, account hackers/spoofers, meshers, and OP gear/ingame items that discourage new players from playing.

We have a fantastic game here, it just needs to be policed by it's admins. 

Sad..."
1369,"The 20GB recommendation for storage space isn't gonna be enough to store this behemoth of a game. On my disk it's pushing 40 gigs, and I don't mod the game.

EDIT: Not 40 gigs, I misspoke. 139.22 GIGABYTES required to install."
1370,"perfect for a more animal taming based version of Rust.
get DLCs if you want to experience next-level glitches and/or experiences

got it for free from a sale in june in case you are wondering why it says that"
1371,"The game is great if you are playing single player or PVE. but its very bad for PVP as a survival game. 

Full of exploiters and cheaters, many teaming tribes and really annoying you cant get far without a cheater finding your stuff. Maybe ESPrs and unplayable at this moment."
1372,ITS AMAZING PLAY PRIMAL FEAR ITS THE BEST MOD FOR ME
1373,hi
1374,its good game
1375,"It's a decent survival game.

However, I really dislike the UI of this game, it's like the UI was made in the 90s, even ARK Mobile uses more modern and better-looking User Interface than the PC version."
1376,plastic dinosaurs
1377,maow
1378,"ok
"
1379,"Official is virtually unplayable, dont waist time or money"
1380,Do I recomend this game that I have 500+ hours on... No never this game has ruined my life I HAVE 500 HOURS ON A GAME THAT I GOT LAST SUMMER. ITS NOT EVEN MY FAVORITE GAME ITS JUST TOO ADICTIVE. I THINK AND DREAM IN ARK I LOST EVERYTHING TO THIS GAME EVEN WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DO I PLAY AND PLAY. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAND YOUR SOUL OVER TOO THIS GAME.
1381,Love the gameplay. Graphics are great and the survival aspect is nice
1382,"is good
"
1383,"Fun game, but if you're easily attached to VIRTUAL Dinos this isn't the game for you :( Maewing straight to the pits of SIZZLING hot lava and turned to ash :("
1384,fun game
1385,game good

1389,Worst clipping to ever exist and somehow we all still play it.
1390,everything
1391,deez
1392,plenty to do and alot of dinos to tame!
1393,cool
1394,Dino go brrrrr
1395,Great survival game many things to do played the game since 2015 but sadly this was beat short the game is filled with hackers and cheaters I also been ddos playing back on xbox with cross play this has open up portal to hackers so people who download the windows version can join xbox side aimbotters and exploits game isn't fun we all can stand and fight back for now my review will stay negative till things are done I am worried about the future of ark 2 at this point!
1396,I have a toxic relationship with this game.
1397,"Game is full of cheaters and hackers. Meshing is a huge  problem and wildcard has YET TO STILL fix this issue. Its been ongoing since the game released. For whatever reason, they have no intention of stopping it."
1398,Nice sandbox survival game.
1399,good
1400,"Spawn into an easy zone, get immediately killed by an alpha raptor. 

Respawn, start building a base with a friend. Upgrading armor, weapons, and defenses. Things going well. 

Go out to explore and get hide, alpha raptor kills us and then glitches in a loop on our corpses. Approaching it and it insta-kills us. 

Ok, cool, lure it away in a steady string of corpses until we can recover our gear from the first death. 

Back at the base things are going well. We got walls, defense, still upgrading gear. 

Alpha raptor attacks, destroys everything, glitches inside our house and is stuck. All our stuff is lost. 

Super fun game /s 


TLDR: Don't buy this game. It's buggy as hell. 

"
1401,You can castrate dinosaurs 10/10
1402,The perfect dino survival game!! <3
1403,Best game ever!
1404,"If you want smooth gameplay, this game is not for you. It's really clunky."
1405,"***PLEASE READ TO THE END***

The game itself is the most amazing thing, and I have been playing video games since the advent of video games! Played this one since day one of early access, and still love it! 
All 6100 hours of it.
IF you want to play single player, or set-up/rent a private server, you will find thousands of hours of enjoyment in it.  From the survival aspect all the way to having tamed pet dinosaurs and other extinct, and some fictional animals, as well as worthy endgame goals and bosses. Many different maps to play on as well as the ability to link maps together in a cluster, and switch map to map with all of your possessions.
BRAVO!!
The workshop has tons of awesome mods that you can enhance all aspects of the game with and have an amazing experience.

However...

...The official servers are the biggest FLAMING TRASH HEAP I have ever experienced.
Wildcard studios has continually tries to address all of the cheating and exploits in the game and on their servers.
But they let it get too out of control.  Nothing they do makes any difference anymore.

Their (official) servers (PVE and PVP) are literal CANCER.

PVE is nothing but unskilled players clogging up the maps with Walmart style boxes for bases, not allowing free movement or suitable places to have your own base/structure. Most players only log in to keep their stuff from de-spawning, rendering it unplayable.
PVP has mega tribes that exploit every aspect they can, including map exploits and the ability to acquire end game items through a black market system involving real money.
You WILL get wiped.  No question about it.

The negative review is based in the official server side of the game, and should only be considered relevant if you want to play on official servers.  Other than that, go for it!"
1406,Singleplayer or private server with friends is the way to go!
1407,very gud
1408,"the server creation doesnt work, and im unable to full screen. tried to make a server with a friend for a half an hour, and it doesnt work"
1409,this game good but i hate the bed mechcanic
1410,i have a birb
1411,wonderful environments plenty of information can be gathered from other players and the s+mod is perfect for gameplay.
1412,Dinos go pew pew
1413,I really like collecting the animals. They are my friends and I love them.
1414,just a game that is worth £40 for evry map
1415,Dinosaur
1416,dinosaur go rawewewrws and bit grrrr nje
1417,Fun
1418,support needs do something! start caring about your game
1419,Rust better
1420,very fun pet monke
1421,PUTIFUILYYIEYLE GAEMEEE
1422,yes
1423,"The game itself is great and i played it for 3 years now. 

However!
The developer Studio Wildcard is doing nothing to fix in game exploits or ban cheaters you won’t have any fun on official servers. The only way to enjoy the game are Unofficials."

1437,good
1438,drugs
1439,i have over 2000 hours n this game so obviously i liked it a lot amazing game idea but is full of cheaters that needs to be addressed and from all the videos on meshing i haven't got high hopes for ark 2
1440,"its gud
"
1441,I will not buy Ark 2 if it will get the same dev support as Ark 1
1442,great game
1443,Extremely buggy. Couldnt get dedicated server or local co-op to work. Not optimized in any way.
1444,its nothing but cheaters now and the ark devs left and now focusing on ark 2 and forgot about ark. will not be buying ark 2 because of the dev support shown on ark.
1445,"Pretty dissapointing, often crashes, bad visuals and runs poorly, AI is dumb and exploration is uninteresting. Also UI is terrible. Do not recommend."
1446,"i like it,needs less bugs"
1447,first person dino taming with elements of minecraft's harvesting/crafting mechanics. Ive played this title on xbox for thousands of happy hours.
1448,good game
1449,"All pain, Gain? probably not"
1450,"Can tame and ride prehistoric and mythical creatures, what's not to love."
1451,"Hackers, aimbotters, cheaters, horrible help. Play unofficial but theres not many for steam."

1453,"This game is full of mesh monkeys dont even waste your time on this awful game, it is bound to bring you sadness 😭"
1454,"I really liked ARK: Survival Evolved, this game is really good"
1455,Awesome game!
1456,"Love it, but don't expect to play on PVE servers at all. Most (official too) are ""claimed"" by pillars around the whole map, even in the water. And sometimes even PVP people are nicer than on the PVE"
1457,nice 69
1458,ppp
1459,Ark is a decently good game and i would recommend it. Just get it when its on sale.
1460,fun

1462,Yes

1465,"played this on xbox and epic, its a great game although it still feels like a beta and servers can suffer from lag due to population size. i hate it but i love it and always end up coming back to it after a few months break."
1466,"Best survival game i've ever played, the graphic is gorgeous. the graphic gap between low with medium is really high, which is good for lowspecgamer even u still need atleast had a decent spec, still has so many bug, but overall it's really a fun game even you play solo, because of the dino's, we taming we gain friend also pet, and every dino has their own characteristic that's the interesting thing, made me want to explore all of the map just to discover a unique creature and tame them. the RPG system is the fun part because they give us freedom to build our character however we want. and there is no quest unless you playing in genesis. the best map i've ever played is fjordur, really it's beautiful. also cave is the mysterious part of the map, it's like a place we need to visit every time we met one, but unfortunately we shouldn't do that just because if you are not prepared enough you will die eventually in the cave."
1467,pls fix the cheater problem and mash rats

1479,"Dinosoar, Roar"
1480,"can't stop playing lol.
"
1481,Official is virtually unplayable. Save your money. Game devs gave up the second Ark2 was thought of.
1482,"Great game, fun, dinosaurs, look into it"
1483,"Really fun!! so much to do and its easy to get lost ""time-wise"" in this game. parts can be a grind but its always different circumstances."
1484,fun.
1485,yes i would recommend this game da title say it all Ark survival evolved
1486,I lost my whole life to this game.  That's right... my whole life.   Family... gone.  Wife... gone.  Even my husband left me.  I have no friends left and no money for any more weed.  All to this game.  Don't play it.  Or do.  The choose is yours.
1487,i once named a dilophosaur i had cheese
1488,Play it you fucking cowards
1489,It fun
1490,Good game
1491,"Excellent game but duping and cheating have always been an issue, TEK off balance for a Dino game and have to join mega tribe for longevity and that gets old. But still was great game until you have enough."
1492,yes
1493,"challenging game, i only play on single player because i dont feel like doing the online grind either way this game is really fun and challenging highly recommend"
1494,booty hole yum yum
1495,I died with everything fighting one of the easiest boss in the game I farmed for 70 hours straight and yet it was still so much fun I couldn't stop laughing
1496,goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
1497,"I started playing the game when it first came out in 2015 and it had a lot of potential to be a great sandbox game, but unfortunately the developers didn't manage it so cheats, hacks, and meshing have spread like a bad rash and now dominate the game.  Not only would i not recommend anyone buy this but i also would not recommend them to purchase Ark2 as it is managed by the same people and once they fill their pockets with your hard earned $$$ will most likely led to the same outcome."
1498,I love it to relax. Only play singleplayer with my own settings and that’s what I love about this game.  You can adjust the game and play it just how you like it (eg. reduce taming time etc). I hope ark 2 will follow a similar path
1499,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!
1500,This game is absolute garbage dont buy it
1501,it has dinos
1502,Danger Noodles everywhere.
1503,Most glitchy game iv ever played THEY NEED TO FIX THE FUCKING MULTIPLAYER
1504,The best dinosaur game in my opinion.
1505,"Very nice with good mods. I love the fact that I was able to get it for free when summer started! Play it, you won't regret it!"
1506,cool dino
1507,full of cheaters
1508,if you like survival games then you most definitely like this game. it has all different types of animals in it including goats. idk what it is about this game but having all friends ride a t rex and take down other alpha animals is very satisfying feeling.
1509,"Yes. You should. 
Warning: Protect your Otters at all costs."
1510,mmmm i love buying a vpn in order to play on servers that dont have shops and kits
1511,"I've played thousands of hours on the ps4 version, but coming to pc didn't change much outside of the ability to use mods. Not complaining really, I just kind of figured it would be a little further along. I play almost exclusively solo, and I will say that the solo game is limited in terms of endgame unless you want to give yourself near god mode stats in order to fight bosses. Bosses are a whole ordeal just to get to fight them, and even then most if not all of the tames you bring with are going to die. Beating the bosses is the only way, aside from mods of course, to access endgame resources and gear. That said, I've had a ton of fun in this game, even if the only time I've ever had tech equipment was the time I essentially cheated to get it. If that doesn't bother you, or if you have no problem playing online, great, go for it! The other thing to keep in mind is that most PVE maps have limited resources and land available, so if you want a better shot at being able to build you'll need to go solo or PVP, which means you put up with the PVP crowd which can be pretty aggressive even if you say you're friendly."
1512,This game will consume your life and make you antisocial. I lost countless days of sleep from this game having played for years on console and recently switched to pc to continue playing with my friends. The only reason I was able to find a relationship was because my console broke a few years back and I couldnt play ark. Now here I am engaged ONLY because I had to stop playing ark. This game takes over every fiber of your being therefore I recommend it %100!
1513,"i want too kill my self after jacking off to this

oh wait thought this was phub"
1514,Im addicted.
1515,Dinosaurs!
1516,
1517,this game has adventures and is fun to play with your fav dinos
1518,game good but in start i want to hang by my balls off a  plane but later in the game its alot of fun
1519,buggy asf but dinosaurs make my balls tingle
1520,"good game
"
1521,its just a fun game if u know what your doing :D
1522,Its verry fun to play with friends or without this is a alltime good game
1523,L game every big clan esps on alts so gg
1524,dinosaur
1525,game is full of cheaters and exploiters they hardly care about there player base official servers are unplayable this game is so fun but its unfortunate they dont care
1526,"Good Game, personally play with higher rates as I can't be bothered with grinding all that much, regardless I still have fun playing :)
"
1527,Ark 2 . 2023
1528,"This game on paper is great and one of the greatest games i have ever played. However in reality the ark official PVP scene is filled with mesh holes, aimbot and account spoofing. The enforcement team takes too long to respond to tickets and by the time they do respond, irreparable damage has already been done. 

I strongly advice against purchasing this game, the developers release unfinished maps and the enforcement team is lazy."
1529,Great graphics. Smooth gameplay. Just a great time-killer.
1530,this game is amazing and the best thing i could ever play!!!!
1531,"Short review:
I have almost 7000 hours on record for this game. It has dinosaurs, that you can ride. Enough said.

Long review:
It's horribly addictive, entirely due to the fact it's ""always online"". It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but because it's an online game, you'll always have to consider the safety of your base and tamed animals.
If you play PvE, you'll only have to worry about the natural decay of your structures and tamed animals (they will despawn from the game world, if you haven't been near them for several days)
If you play on a PvP server, however, you'll have to worry about other players possibly ""raiding"" your little scrub base, while you're sleeping or off at work. If you play the game long enough, you'll learn to determine when an enemy base's players are probably not online, meaning you can more or less safely work your way through their defenses. So if it's your base, you'll come back in the morning or after work, and find your base gone, your character dead, and probably all of your tamed animals horribly murdered.
The only way to properly play on a PvP server, without losing sleep that is, is to join a ""mega-tribe"", a tribe so large, that there's always members online at some point in the day (or night) that will defend your collective work from aggressors.
In short, you either get destroyed while playing solo, or need to play with many other people in a large tribe, if you want to play on a PvP server.
Then you might ask yourself, why would you want to play on a PvP server? Because it's obviously how the game was intended to be played.
Many, MANY animals, items, and structures are clearly intended for PvP purposes. I won't even start to list and explain them.
But PvE servers are also very passive-aggressive.
Not only because you cannot destroy another player's base on a PvE server, but also because there's anti-grief mechanics on the PvE servers, so you cannot place structures too close to another player's structures, it means there's this passive-aggressive stalemate between people, playing a single crate or wooden pillar next to your base, in order to prevent you from expanding further, because they think you've already taken up too much space of ""theirs"". You can report them, and GM's are fortunately fast at responding to these things, but impotent drama of it all just makes me sick. Therefore, PvP servers are the optimal, and frankly in my opinion, only way to play the game.
I still recommend it though, because it's an amazing experience, once you've gotten the hang of it, and you've tried a few large-scale tribe wars. Yes, wars. With 30-40 Vs. 30-40 players duking it out with massive Giganotosaurus dinosaurs, flying dragons, laser-guns, and other crazy stuff.
Buy it and give it a try, currently only 17 Euro, which isn't much for a game I've spent nearly a year playing, every day."
1532,"rlly good game, but I've had some problems while downloading it, it would't load, crashed etc. But now it works and its a rlly good game
"
1533,"decided to give it a try again with my partner after not playing for 2 years. sad to see that it is still a buggy sh*t as it was before. 

not sure how this can be ""very positive"" rated recently tbh.

Edit: Oh god I just found out that there will be ARK 2. Was the ATLAS fiasco not enough? Spamming Addons like there is no end instead of fixing the bugs and then bring an entire new game? Gaming devs 2022"
1534,Hard game
1535,"Well ARK may be fun if you decide to venture through the PVP side of this game it will be the biggest waste of your time. After spending hours do get work done you will get meshed by a player. This means that a player can go under the map and
destroy all of your hours of work in a matter of seconds. The developers refuse to fix these issues and are just covering it up with ARK 2. If you choose to player Official ARK be careful."
1536,Dino go brrr
1537,good game
1538,I loev ipv6
1539,Ark Survival Evolved is home of the hackers. This game has good mechanics but the developers are terrible. There are a lot of bugs and lag but the game mechanics are excellent. I would not recommend playing this game though due to lack of support from developers. If you want to see hackers on another level then join the ark. Also if you are a hacker you will not get banned because the developers are probably hacking with you. Ark 2 is on the way but the developers will mess it up also so I would not spend money on the game.
1540,this game is aweful it is filled with cheaters and meshers would not recommend buying ark 2
1541,good game
1542,"Great game. Worst code of conduct enforcement I've ever seen. 

Waste days, weeks, and months to lose your stuff to cheaters. Tickets take days to receive a response and usually without resolution. 

Not a great outlook for Ark 2 since they can't support Ark 1."
1543,It's Alright.
1544,"Worst game ever made should be shut down immediately never to return again, on top of being extremely buggy to the point its almost completely unplayable, completely unfair, unbalanced on top of the fact of faulty mechanics, and repeatedly spawn trapping you with groups of hostile dinos to kill you or damn near killing you before you are even fully spawned back in the same spot to end up killing you over 20 times in a row,  all to piss off their player base and to make up for their lack of skill in coding to make a game truly difficult. yet another prime example of a game studio coming up with a great concept but then completely botching its execution and this is why this game is't worth even a single penny of what they charge, hell this game isn't worth playing even if it were FREE!!!"
1545,"Is this the best game ever... no, but is it fun... yes."
1546,hm dino
1547,Monki
1548,Hope ARK 2 soon!
1549,One of the worst games I've ever played
1550,"Nice game ever see
"
1551,SHIT  GAME   DONT  EVER PLAY  IT
1552,e
1553,my love this game
1554,"If you go to advanced settings and put the add per level to max, you can get your dinos to do over 1mil damage >:D"
1555,no
1556,Dino yeahhhh daddeh!!!
1557,"played it a bit, it's alright."
1558,its absolutely worth it
1559,"a very good game
"
1560,good game
1561,i have so much fun playing this game
1562,no
1563,ed
1564,Bad and buggy. Non dedicated servers are trash and doesnt work no matter how many times you try to fix it
1565,maybe this is the best survival game i ever played after rust so this game cool and nice
1566,Work and preparation is rewarded with success and high adventure.  What child hasn't dreamed about walking with dinosaurs.  Or swimming and flying!  This game plays all the strings deep inside of us all.
1567,"cheaters and hackers have ruined the official cluster and some unofficials , duping and meshing is also big problems in ark and devs do litterally nothing"
1568,"It's just a good game in general,"
1569,good
1570,i
1571,good game would bang again 10/10
1572,Its a grate game and its better when its modded and when you play with friends
1573,Fucking ass game
1574,"best survival game in my opinion but you should definitely play with mods or just play how you want to.
"
1575,i tink tis gam very god
1576,"An all around fun game if you are playing by yourself, aside from having your progress completely erased every other day"
1577,"This game is the best game I know so far, just don't let it ruin you."
1578,always fun to go back to.
1579,Highly recommend
1580,Dino
1581,"good eat













































"
1582,i like but too much storage
1583,cheaters make the game unplayable! The meshing is out of control.
1584,"Before the Chinese took over this game, it was incredibly boring. All of the servers were super active, which meant there was never much ""alone"" time, to really enjoy the peace and quiet the island had to offer. There were always people online, talking, trading, killing one another, or creating long-lasting friendships. That part alone was extremely obnoxious, and not at all what mass-multiplayer open world survival games are about.

Before the Chinese, I frequently survived for way too long. Sometimes so long that I ended up experiencing parts of the game that really shouldn't be experienced. See, the only part of the game that is really enjoyable is picking fiber with my bare hands, and the Chinese make it possible for me to repeat this process every single day, two days at the very latest. Pre-China, I made it all the way to a metal base, and let me tell you, it was hideous. After the first six dozen times that the Chinese demolished my metal base and turrets, I realized I'm more into boho theme. Thatch and wood are more stylish.

To me, nothing is more fun than repeating the first 15 minutes of the game, anything past that you start to realize how stale the game is. The Chinese swoop in and ensure that you get to re-experience the most thrilling parts of what the game has to offer."
1585,fun
1586,gmae was soooo poopy it made my toilet and bathroom smell like dumpy poop fart direaha
1587,good like nut human nut
1588,"Got over 20k hours on 2 platforms. Game is so trashed when making crossplay. i really would like to be face to face with some of these devs. they take money to help cheaters cheat and hurt the ones that play legit. sad really, hope ark fails and the team goes poor."
1589,yes
1590,Top Tier game would recommend to people that like games such as Subnautica and below zero but also for people who like dark souls because of the grind that is needed in ark
1591,game fun bur game bug also host sticky wick kinda sucky wucky
1592,"I LOVED the whole idea of the gamw! Graphics are wonderful, very realistic. I do wish the night was shorter though"
1593,good game.
1594,wont let me join
1595,bug
1596,"this is a really fantastic survival game one of the best i've played and if your a minecrafter out there looking for a new game likeIi was, then I would STRONGLY suggest this game."
1597,childhood game
1598,it is very wonderful game
1599,FUCKN RAD
1600,good game
1601,"I think if someone wants to spend a lot of time grinding, and who has a really beefy computer, and someone who has a lot of money should play this. Unfortunately, this game does take a lot of time to update or even just simply load up, so if you're prepared for that, go ahead and buy this game."
1602,best game ever
1603,Great Game
1604,
1605,"ITS A GOOD GAME
"
1606,Great Game
1607,"Very nice game , i like this game only on modded servers"
1608,Awesome game.

1612,SO FUN a little on the expensive side but so worth it ITS AMAZING fun and cool for Dino lovers!!!

1617,yah
1618,its lit
1619,Dinosaur :)
1620,Because its had the same bug for 7 years
1621,one of the best open world survival games
1622,this game is poggers
1623,dont give up
1624,fun if you like bad games
1625,Dinosaur game :)
1626,If you want to experience every emotion and ignore everything else in life then this is the game for you.
1627,Nice Nice Nice : )
1628,grat gam
1629,family
1630,"The dev's are useless cunts and the game is full of cheating faggots, don't buy this game or ark 2."
1631,"Ark pvp is full of cheaters, bugs (for example mesh methods at every corner) and other exploits. Cheaters are destroying big bases unfairly and even getting real life money for that: So basically you can only win this game by cheating. So sad"
1632,Best dinos
1633,Dodo killed me
1634,"this game is simply a buggy mess, not worth it"
1635,"I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.

But playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend."
1636,it good but sometime gets annoying
1637,"Very good game for people that love dinos
"
1638,fun game for people who like to do anything in a game invloveing dinosaurs like rideing i big pteridon while shooting your rocket launcher at t rexes
1639,"what a game, but dev dont do shit. Too many cheaters and nothing is done about it!"
1640,doddos är goda
1641,This game is good There are dinosaurs rawr
1642,Cant connect to a frickin private servers... Do not waste your time trying to play this shitty game
1643,personally i think ark is a great game theres so much to do and so many cool tames and mods i feel like this game could fit anyone i really enjoy playing it even if it can make me smack my keyboard
1644,"Filled with cheaters, meshers Etc,
Played for a little over a month and was killed by aimbot on several diff occasions, speed hackers and Esp users.
Official small tribes also never wipes and the game is filled with people using real money as a Advantage over other users. Buying Boss fights, dinos, kits, bases and etc"
1645,"good game and good mods would recommend
"
1646,I like jerking off to the parasaurs and velonasaurs
1647,"it good
"
1648,Ark Survival Evolved is a game full of mesh monkeys and cheaters and exploiters and I will not be buying ark 2
1649,funny with friends
1650,"First and most important, ARK as the game itself is an awesome game, that's why people still play and keep playing. Their is no alternative like ARK.

And secondly, ya the cheater, hacker, aso, aso problem is hugh on offi pvp, but stop always blame wildcard. Better look behind wildcard and who runs the company, it's Snail Games who also f.e. monitor apocalypse servers who are full of chinese cheaters. So just think about it.

And lastly never ever forget, cheaters have tiny tiny d*icks."
1651,"Lived naked among dinosaurs, pooped when fighting one and then the toxic dino from Jurassic Park killed me in one shot"
1652,hwll yes
1653,"this game sucks
"
1654,Very fun game
1655,They killed my fucking monkey
1656,"really fun cheating simulator. That helps you learn the best way to aimbot.
"
1657,The Developers dont care about cheaters in this game.
1658,"You get to tame and ride dinosaurs... Everything before and after that is meh, and can be found in a better game with better graphics. So, yeah if you're bored with all your other games, haven't tamed or ridden a dinosaur and can afford to throw a wad of cash into street? Sure, give it a try."
1659,Great game cannot wait for Ark II
1660,dinosar
1661,good
1662,"This probably is my fav game of all time legit worth every penny even when it was 80$.


Also be aware of what your Graphics card can handle before buying this my old gtx 970 had trouble running this on low with 1440p. but on the other hand it was able to run like med on 1080p."
1663,NO DEV SUPPORT!!!!! TONS OF HACKING SPOOFING AND CHEATS DEF NOT WORTH ANY OF  YOUR MONEY ESPECIALLY NOT YOUR TIME
1664,dino ate my ass
1665,Good game
1666,Tons of fun with friends. I would recommand playing on a private server / friendly server for the beginner!
1667,very fun and there is cool dino and cool survival
1668,its a great survival game with tons of things to do
1669,BAD GAME I WANT TO PUT HITLER INTO THE GAME
1670,There are so many challenges and so many things to do in this game! It isnt like any other survival game! I suggest to play with friends!
1671,"I genuinely love this game. However I have to say, ignore those comments about cheaters or other annoying players as this game can be solo and you can get servers without other people on. It doesn't matter what other people do, just play your own server. You don't have to play on those bad servers. It's a reflection on the servers not the game itself."
1672,it's also a good game
1673,I love this game!
1674,iyikhnkj
1675,great game
1676,"I dont know what the fuck are they doing with this game , after a last so called update , the game keeps crahsing even before I enter in the map , even in the starting screen . Same thing used to happend like a month or a month and half before, they did some kind of update it kept crashing and after another update it was just fine.Now they make another update and i can not play game at all . As it seems I won't buy ark 2 once it comes it . considering they are keep doing one step ahead, 2 backwards with this game."
1677,E
1678,Too many exploits
1679,Its alright
1680,I love this game
1681,balls game (balls is awesome)
1682,this game is very fun and o think people should play it
1683,Good if you are looking for a lot of fun!
1684,Yes T-rex
1685,great game
1686,good  dino pets that will eat ur brains out
1687,"Good game, fun, fun"
1688,very fan
1689,cool
1690,Full of cheaters and Bugs but the Devs don't do anything
1691,"nice
"
1692,pretty crap game
1693,"There's a lot of things to love about this game.
And yet it is so simple to lose everything at once. No game has ever made me question my life choices like this one."
1694,"ark 2 better have a complete 3D render of Vin Diesel including his dick and balls. if not, bad game

(1000 hours on xbox and formerly part of SUPREMECY. Cool game but to many chinese alpha tribes on pc servers)"
1695,"full of hackers, meshers and duplicators and the developers don’t care. In-game characters are hacked without you knowing it. One of the best games, but the worst Dev Support you can have. If Ark 1 has the same bugs for 5 years and the developers don’t do anything about it, how should be it in Ark 2? Don’t buy Ark 1 or Ark 2 unless the support gets better!"
1696,"Played on PS4 I love this game. I made my own server called The Remix and similar settings like for PS4 so it was pretty simple for everything to be transferred over. I used Ark as an escape from in real life stuff going on and found out it can also be used for children with disabilities as an escape to help them get their mind off things. Its super fun game but not as fun playing alone, its more fun playing with friends or family. Ark can be very addicting which I'm not complaining about. lol"
1697,سسشي
1698,Keep crashing the game on my Laptop.
1699,"sick, dinosaurs.. bro."
1700,"I put 16 hours into this game just for my character and world to disappear, I know 16 hours isn't alot for most people but it is for me."
1701,I love this game. it's challenging but in a good way. lots of modding options and super fun to find resources and build. one of my favorite games.
1702,yes
1703,Great game :)
1704,"If cheating is getting worse towards end of ark 1 without any actions taken what hope does ark 2 have (if people even go to it) need more active enforcement team.

owner accounts being spoofed left and right by people who dont play the game so they can sell your stuff with no action taken to fix"

1706,fun dinosaur game
1707,that good
1708,"If you have no family, friends or job i would recommend this game 10/10"
1709,great game
1710,"I have bought this game on xbox as well and i recieved it for free on steam during the limited period of time it was free. Ive been playing this game for about 4 years now and have loved every second  of it. If you like survival, dinosaurs, PVP, and open maps with endless possibility, this is the game for you. There are bugs but none I've personally dealt with that make it a negative experience. PS: can be rage inducing"
1711,"Ark is an incredible journey from The Island to Genesis and even the recently added free DLC Fjordur. This game is so much fun, especially with friends. Crafting, taming dinosaurs, doing arenas fighting bosses, and so much more!"
1712,yes good
1713,fum
1714,Nice game to play if you're bored
1715,game is really fun if u like survival games and dinosuars its great

1724,i hate this game
1725,PEDIS
1726,dinosaur go brrrrrrrr
1727,"its a game full of issues that won't ever be fixed. if you can get over servers crashing and rolling back, wasting all the time you spend working on something, then this is the game for you. this has been an issue for well over a year and yet still hasn't been fixed. wild card could careless about the quality of this game and is more focused on producing their next game."
1728,Fix your game i switched from windows 10 servers to steam and there is so much esp aim botting in this game and meshing
1729,"Primal Fear makes this game better than vanilla, but its still a good game without it."
1730,"There are so many things to do and ways to play that it never gets boring
"
1731,i have done 4000hrs i enjoyed the game a lot but i have stopped playing because of aim boaters esp and meshing wild card hasn't done anything to fix this in the past 3 years i was playing having to rebuild my base a lot i couldn't hide my loot in reapers around the map cause of esp
1732,killed five alpha trexs than died to fall damage 10/10 best game ever
1733,This game has prevented me from going outside and doing normal active healthy teenage things.
1734,i love the mods that vie no clothes
1735,Dinosaurs go brrr.

1741,"Love survival games? I usually don't; but if you add DINOS and some friends, its a dream come true. Go create a new world!!!!"
1742,"If you like survival and grindy games, Ark really hits the spot."
1743,"Boring, tedious, unrewarding, unforgiving.  The grind is real.

1746,rrrrrrrrrrrrr
1747,"I'm not sure what happened, but this game is just full of hackers now.. I just saw a titan on the island die, and a giga flew across the map to eat it and then it vanished. There have been people that would one shot everyone in the map almost at the same time. 

I don't think I'm going to get Ark2 if this is how Wildcard treats there games.."
1748,This game make you spend a lot of time in it
1749,i played this alot on my xbox and microstoft account i got this one day cause i saw a modding video and havent played the microsoft one ever since
1750,"i fucking hate this shitty game, 300 hours lost coz wildcard cant run a fucking game, shit anti-cheat, shit anti-mesh, shit everything."
1751,"fun
"
1752,Awesome!!!!
1753,Dinosaur go Roar
1754,"everyone play this game can suck me
its game is good for simp people 
if you dont have 4 friend and they are not simp its better you dont play this bullshit
but 125 gb for this trash ?? dude realy why
i just can say this game is a bullshit and only simp or girls play this game
if you love your money dont buy this game 
Or if you got it when it was free, and if you like your internet, it's better not to download this bullshit game."
1755,full of cheaters
1756,Had tons of fun playing with friends.
1757,Yes
1758,"It's fun. You progress at your own rate, and you can pick up pet along the way."
1759,"So far thumbs up. It feels I started a little late in this game. Lots of stuff built and no players around. However if your starting out that's perfect. There are more populated servers to join though for fun interactions. Also those interactions may be cancerous.
Each server you play on you have to start over and create a new character.

The only buddy I have to play mutli-player with, currently has the Steam bug no one can fix, where he never shows up as online, and can Never invite him or vice versa to any game. So Steam needs to listen to players on that. Been years and the bug still exist. So I cannot say what playing with friends is like yet.

You die, you drop all your inventory and have to go loot your corpse."
1760,It's ARK...Why wouldn't someone want to play??
1761,"This game has so much potential. But in the current state it's a trash heap on fire. Simply because of official server issues:

Major issues:
◉ Cheaters.
◉ Lack of server admins.

Minor issue:
◉ Lack of support for small tribes."
1762,bg
1763,dinosaur game good
1764,The game is great but is currently full of cheating and exploiting
1765,good
1766,5raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1767,"good
"
1768,"GAY PEOPLE PLAY THIS I SWEAR MY BROTHER TOO, HE S GAY SUCK"
1769,dinos and shit
1770,too many cheaters..
1771,"this game is a game where you can survive the challenges of multiple islands,including:the island,ragnarok,the center,valgeuro,abberation,extinction,scorched earth,genesis,and genesis two. personally,this is my favorite game of all time,though it does have many bugs and glitches,it is still an absolute blast to play! now go gear up,and survive the world of ark!"
1772,"I ruins your life, aslong as you dont have social life"
1773,A massive dino dick killed me 10/10
1774,awesome
1775,great good game many play yes
1776,"the devs dont care about legit players, Aimbotters and meshers can come to your base and wipe you and even if you report the devs will not care and send automated messages and even say issues are solved when they are not. yes in the past few days they tried to fix aimbotting by removing the railgun, but they should have removed it a while ago. And on top of this the M rated game doesnt allow trash talking as you WILL get banned faster for trash talking in this game than for aimbotting or meshing."
1777,"ARK IS NOT POLICING SERVERS SO MESH MONKEYS AND CHEATERS ARE TAKING OVER, DON'T BUY ARK 2"
1778,"litterally one of the most beatiful, fun exciting, creative, modded and saddest game in the entire steam library/store"
1779,"game
"
1780,"dinos, trees, rocks. very nice"
1781,amazing
1782,"Game is a good game however the dev support is HORRIBLE. You can make numerous tickets and get a ""solved"" and an automated message with NOTHING being done to the people who you made the ticket to report. Dev support or the lack thereof is the downfall of this game."
1783,"ark is full of cheaters and meshers, play local only. I would not recommend online play to anyone except and headstrong masochist. don't buy."
1784,Ark Survival Evolved is full of cheaters and mesh monkeys and i will NOT be buying Ark 2 unless the devs prove they haven't abandoned the game that made it possible.
1785,Love this game so much!!
1786,Allways a GOOD game
1787,Monkey evolve
1788,shit game :)
1789,Playing ark at least once a day does not keep depression away
1790,This game sucks
1791,great game love all the building and the dinos
1792,"This game is full of cheaters and expoliters. the developers dont give any shits about 1k hours, your base will be gone easliy"
1793,"So many cheaters and exploiters on official that it's basically unplayable. Love this game, it's one of my favorite games, played it for thousands of hrs on console, but I just can't deal with all the meshing and aim botting currently in the game. It's sad that they have let this game rot like this instead of patching the mesh holes and banning the cheaters. 0/10 for now unfortunately."
1794,"Game is meh, look at this instead.

1797,very good very nice
1798,"Beware. This game will eat at least 300gb of your disk space.

Game is decent enough, could have been more polished. Scorched earth is not worth your money. Thats pretty much it.
A rtx 1650 or above is recommended or else it looks like weird blobs."
1799,It's aight.
1800,"Only played this for the achievements and someetimes with friends, not worth it.

1813,"For all its good aspects, the pvp servers are broken.. you have to deal with it being laggy, buggy, full of cheaters (Aimbot, ESP, meshers and INI exploiters)... maps are fun to explore but don't plan on keeping anything you work for unless you are part of a zerg clan... Wildcard need to fix so much at this point that I highly doubt it's even possible...especially as they seem to have given up supporting it to focus on ARK 2, which I will not be buying.."

1835,Five stars! I really enjoy this game even though it is older. Its even more fun to play with friends!
1836,Ark is by far the most amazing game i have ever played. the gameplay is simply beautiful and immersive. I usually get bored in survival games but i never got bored playing Ark. The best game <3
1837,"Quantity over quality, so much but also so little."
1838,Just an over all good game!
1839,"full of cheater

1840,Please fix the PVP state of this game. Please... I love ARK PVP but I haven't been able to play for a couple years now due to meshers and cheaters.. Just not fun at all... :( Happy H.O.D. is trying to help.
1841,"Game is full of cheaters, and exploiters. Unplayable on the live official servers."
1842,"Super cool game!!! The only thing to be worried about is becoming addicted.. I first played it on xbox console, but then bought a ps4 to play it on, aswell as my current gaming laptop for Steam version!! There is never a shortage of things to do, and breeding mechanics are simple yet complex, and reward you for you efforts."

1850,if ur a fat discord admin play this game
1851,yes
1852,WHY IS IT SO FUCKING LARGE ITS 328GB FOR ALL FREE DLC
1853,dino
1854,good
1855,"1,156.6 hours and I'm about to go check out Fjordor for the first time, so yeah.. I'd say I like it XD"
1856,Dont buy this game!!! This game is full of cheater. All kinds of cheater. And Wild card (creator of the game) is doing nothing to solve this. The cheater are not being punishing and they are getting away with their cheats. Buy another game that is well balanced and you cant enjoy. between my 2 accounts i have more then 5k hours and I dont recommend this game at all. There are many other funner games than this one. Have a great day!!
1857,Really good except sadly you can't make burgers for the dinosaurs.
1858,I *love* this game!
1859,"A Game full of Aimbotters, Cheaters and ppl who exploit the Game in other ways. I had fun playing this game with friends but in the end the fun gets overshadowed by the cheaters. Another big problem is that there is nearly no dev Support in the game and Wildcard is bluntly ignoring the problems and the community."
1860,"Great looking game with a wide variety of flora and fauna. Lots of fun. Only issue is the base building is the worst in any survival game I've ever played. Very restrictive placement issues and very few base building parts. some of the most basic parts needed are not there and things that should snap together , dont."
1861,"ARK 1 is a game with huge potential and it's super fun, but it's filled with cheaters and the player support is awful. Official servers are unplayable and basically everyone is hacking or using exploits. Not buying ARK 2 unless wildcard fixes ARK 1, there's still a huge community that loves that game."
1862,yes
1863,"For PVE its a nice game but everything else its the worse. Zero Dev support, full of cheaters, prob more legit players banned then unlegit players, thousends of bugs, cheats and other exploits that are easy to do but never get fixed (some are in the game for years now). Its easy af for others to destroy thousends of hours of work with just a few simple cheats/bugs or exploits and wildcard does not give a fuck. If you wanna have fun dont waste your money on this game!"
1864,"The dinosaur taming makes this game unique in my experience, combine that with the crafting and it's a very engrossing game."
1865,"Game is full  of cheaters, laggy on public servers, and admin abuse.  Just watch H.O.D. 's latest video on Youtube. https://youtu.be/i50-MORzzog"
1866,da
1867,too many cheaters to play
1868,"The game is dead hacker mesheres spoofing acs shit developer its really bad it was the best game ever 

THANKS WILDCARD YOU SHUT READ YOUR WILD REPORT CARDS FULL OF PROFF WITH MESHERS HACKER AND ALL THAT SHIT

DONT BUY ARK OR ARK2"
1869,good
1870,เป็นเกมที่ ดึกเวลาชีวิตมากๆเลยจ๊
1871,Give me a refund
1872,"10/10

Tis really good play with friends cause its more fun but get on a rex and destroy everything in sight."
1873,Full of cheaters and exploiting and the developers dont take care of the game at all.
1874,good game
1875,It's good
1876,love the challenge of having to survive in the wild with dinos
1877,isss ight
1878,"A game with a massive community that has been almost completely abandoned by the developers.

The official servers are rampant with hackers, dupers, and every other form of cheater while Wildcard is doing virtually nothing to support the fair players who have dumped countless hours into the game. 

They’ve made their money off of us and now they have moved on to make the second iteration which will undoubtedly be the same dumpster fire.

Do not buy, and boycott the purchase of Ark 2 until the devs come out of hiding and address all the issues plaguing their current game."
1879,"Full of cheaters, meshers, aimbotters etc on official pvp servers and god knows on how many other servers.
When wildcard is contacted regarding these said tribes of cheaters, they only say they'll look into it and then the issue gets ""buried"", never to be heard again while the cheaters still ""move freely"" on their servers.

I'm sure they have people to take care of the official servers BUT... BUT they need way more than that.

Railgun is as well broken... way way too broken.
Either disable it or to stem the cheaters a bit, make it unlock at lvl 150-200 or something like that. In my opinion, disable it completely since it doesn't have a... necessary functionality to the game, for example, a boss that requires only railgun to be defeated or.. something like that.

ARK is a very cool game and its a shame that cheaters and lack of taking care of them is destroying it.
This review will remain negative until i see the issue is being taken care of, with proof!"
1880,the game is broken and the devs don't care about the player base anymore
1881,Fun
1882,yes
1883,"Hackers Cheaters and meshers
Do not buy.
Not getting ark 2"
1884,"Cheaters everywhere in ark, it ruins it for the people who actually want to have a good experience playing. You think the devs care? They do not. You'll waste your life playing just to get meshed or aim bot to the skull. Sad."
1885,"lots of cheaters might as well disable all guns and just leave it to dino pvp at the moment esp, aimbot, dupes and other hacks run rampant developers do not care about online multiplayer which is the only reason i buy and play the game so no point if ark 2 is single player"
1886,"official servers are awful, they're either dead or run by hackers. you can so easily find videos and discord servers of people running hacks and advertising real money trading.
play unofficial servers instead, makes the game significantly better when studio wildcard isn't in the picture.

also... if this is ark 1, then what can we expect from ark 2? really shouldn't get your hopes up."
1887,nice game
1888,"The current state of the game is LITERALLY unplayable, aimbotters everywhere, lots of cheaters, people will raid your base by meshing it aka going underneath the map. Games definitely not worth purchasing as of right now. I wont be buying ark 2 if the game will be like this."
1889,"I love this game so much, but Official PvP is overrun by cheaters, exploiters, and corrupt enforcement staff who play alongside some of the game's biggest tribes. ARK 2 will turn out the same way if they don't prioritize enforcement and clean play in their official PvP environment. ARK is one of the most expansive, immersive, and wildly unique games out there, but the Official server experience has been abandoned and truly insulted by the developers themselves. For that reason, the review is negative."
1890,diner saw
1891,"fun game but cheaters and meshing insane, also corrupt moderators"
1892,this game is full of cheaters and exploiters i wont be buying ark 2 such a disapointment from devs
1893,love
1894,"Its a fun survival game with Dinosaurs and Monsters, what's there not to like?"
1895,gud geme
1896,"i love this game 
i wish if i can play with my friend on the same pc like 2 players"
1897,very good game I like birds like dodo so cool like yea so good birds
1898,Get rid of you entire storage drive and buy a new one to play this game.
1899,"A Cheaters Paradise!

As someone who was here at the start we could cut Wildcard some slack, it's an EA game and we are along for the ride as they build it out.
Fast forward 7+ years and the cheating and exploits have grown faster than the number of Dinos in the game.
Wildcard doesn't punish and prevent the cheating, they pretend it's not a thing and figure out more ways to get in your wallet.

Anyone who thinks Ark 2 won't be more of the same is kidding themselves.
If you don't mind a company who doesn't care about their customers you should buy Ark 2
If you actually want a game company to oppose cheating and exploits and stop the offenders look elsewhere and don't give Wildcard another dime."
1900,its fun
1901,"Hi there, if you're looking for another type of Minecraft, this is it, i played on console before but never really hook on to it. but since i bought it on PC platform its been one of my favorite games of all time. i play solo and its still fun! It goes from Primitive< TEKhnology ;) I haven't reach that point because im on a conquest of taming all dinos and making buildings. there's also a lots of mods that improves games and some other add a twist in difficulty! i can't really find any complains about it and i got roughly 250H+ of gaming! It's a ++++ for me enjoy the game!!"
1902,"Full of cheaters , and Hackers and the devs dont do anything about them . Wont be buying Ark 2 if this is how they treat their player base"
1903,"Too many cheaters, I'm not buying ark 2. The game is not being enforced at all. Ark 2 will be much worse"
1904,"To much meshing, to much botting"
1905, .
1906,it okay
1907,funi dinosaurus momento
1908,"I have played this game for over 10k hours on windows 10 and on different accounts and anyone who has played this game as much as i have will say with certainty it is a horribly designed game and the dev support is even worse. The cheaters, exploits, glitches, meshing, and sooooo much more makes this game is unplayable, not only does it make it unplayable the devs wont do anything about it. They lie and tell you that whatever problem you had was taken care of and most of the time it was never even looked at. Fix your issues wildcard. I have play this horrible game for to long and I wont be buying ark 2 and recommend no one does."
1909,ark is ruined because of mesh monkeys! please fix your game
1910,"the best survival game i have ever played 
strongly recommend this game"
1911,Goofy ahh dino game. Beaver is not a dino ?
1912,"a lot of cheaters / meshers
Will NOT BUY ARK2"
1913,"Why i don't recommend play in Ark: Survival Evolved. Because this game at technical make really bad.
For example, we not always can connect to friend host. Or in game available more bugs."
1914,"there is dinosawer, so is good game :)"
1915,dont use hacks and dont ruin this game in any other way pls
1916,i have good memories.
1917,"I think the games pretty fun, I know almost nothing about it so I'm still learning. Other than that a nice alternative to rust which has ruined my life completely."
1918,No dev support at all
1919,STOP THE MESH MONKEYS!!!!!
1920,"best game I've ever played
"
1921,"okay so im not gonna say how this game is not ballanced every1 knows i got globally banned on main account for living in mesh i had 6k hours i know im not the perfect guy to talk shit about wildcard but man now ppl living in mesh do not even get banned they get warning after 3 days i dont really care about ppl living in mesh or pelargonis spots its not that aids but bruh fjordur have more meshholes than wildcards owner dicks in ass

and finally cheaters every ark smalltribes/official video from 6months includes cheater there is no legit tribe in top spots even pvp u cant call out for pvp without getting aimbotted invisible dino hack/speedhack dinos/esp'd"
1922,"Game is a lost cause. Full of cheaters, exploiters and all kind of people who ruins game experience and does not get punished. Dont waste your time and money on this game."
1923,"If Ark 2 have a mesh monkeys, I not buy it!"
1924,This game is equal to meth
1925,"at least 5k hours on xbox, This game COULD of been amazing but it seems the genuine fans care more about the game than the devs do, ive loved playing ark with my friends until all the meshing and cheating became too common, i didnt enjoy cheating to not be cheated... i have hop they fix these issues for ark 2 but after Atlas i have my doubts..."
1926,ark suvival evlove
1927,Its fun but I have raged so much from losing dinos to stupid things. But its a very fun game and would recommend.
1928,"Toxic from the get go.  Top tier end game players crushing those that have not purchased the pretty much P2W Genesis pack.  Who thought it was a good idea to allow transfer of top gear to beginner servers.  Spam all over the maps.  Just pathetic.  Why play the game, just go to g2g and buy what you need?"
1929,"Game has been ruined by cheaters and exploiters . The devs don't care anymore and wont do nothing to change it .

100% not buying ark 2 .
It will most likely just be the same ♥♥♥♥ show as ark 1 ."
1930,ok
1931,This game is full of cheaters and exploiters. Its full of corrupt admins who are in the big alpha tribes who have cheaters and sell base locations for real money after cheating to raid them. Real money trading has killed this game and its been done by the admins.
1932,hey wildcard why dont you take some of that money your paying vin diesel and actually hire admins for official servers! the game is a wasteland of cheaters right now and you plan on coming out with a 2nd game? insane stop being greedy douchbags and fix whats in front of you......
1933,cant sex the raptor
1934,"If you want to experience non-stop cheating, and that makes you happy, then buy this game immediately!  Full of cheats.  Awful support for the game."
1935,"The original game is great but once you get into modded ARK it turns absolutely crazy and fun.  it is a bit of a resource hog, and an SSD is a must have."
1936,full of cheaters please do something wild card
1937,this game is full of cheaters/exploiters and WILDCARD hasnt done anything about it for years.
1938,"devs don t care about their players ,they ban who they want,if u have a base into a rathole and they destroy the rathole they will ban you etc not worthy full of hackers and they don t get banned, also duping ,ppl having pocket admins to help them,not worth playing anymore until the devs start caring about players base etc"
1939,"Full of mesh monkeys completely unplayable ARK 2 will probably be the same I won't buy it even though i love this game, but it is so frustrating to see that there are so few arbiters. Meshers and bug exploiters won't be punished, and that is the main issue of this game..."

1942,great game
1943,nic
1944,The game is full of cheaters and devs doesnt give a damn about hte players who play their game. Unplayable.
1945,sell yourslef 
1946,"If you're hoping to play with a controller, forget it.  The controller support in the menus is awful.  If you're hoping to play single player, forget it.  The game is awful.  It's clunky and ugly.  It feels like those Turok games from N64, only they were fun.  Everything about this game is a chore.  Not only that, it takes up over 125 GB of hard drive space.  FOR WHAT?!  Those garbage textures must be seriously high-res"
1947,"It ""was"" such a great game but than the devs decide to just dont give a fuck, cheating meshing account stealing all that stuff happens for years and nothing happend u cant just play it on official cause the devs and even on unofficial if you dont have active admins you cant play casue all the cheating esp aimbot dupe mesh what so ever. waste of money waste of time now days. Also will be 1000% same with Vin Diesel Ark."
1948,The official servers are trash and full of cheaters. From people who aimbot to meshing into people's bases. The devs haven't cared about this game for a long time. Over 10k hrs in this game from the beginning of the alpha stages I have played this game. My advice is to stay away from official servers if you want PVP action.
1949,)
1950,big dinosuars
1951,The worst game ever made.
1952,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! Game is full of cheaters who will aim bot and mesh you ( enter your base from underground) and ARK developers don't do anything about it. So yeah all your progress will be lost to some kid with cheats. Good job Wild Card
1953,"The game to start with is very poorly optimized, you have to have a super computer if you want to play it with good graphics. And it's only good to play it in pve, because in pvp it's full of cheaters and the WC studio doesn't do anything about it, they already abandoned ARK 1 to focus on ARK 2, with this history of not supporting their games, I don't think I'd buy ARK 2, I don't recommend anyone to buy ARK 1 or ARK 2 when it comes out."
1954,yes
1955,Love it :)
1956,Devs doesn't do shit about cheaters! You can't play anymore. It's so annoying.
1957,"All versions of ark are ruined, its full of aimbotters , meshers and more . they game is unplayable . the devs dont care they just want ark 2 . even windows 10 is as bad i spent hundreds on the game just for people to mesh or install cheats for free. the devs need to fix there game and become unblined by money."
1958,"The developers have abandoned it for Ark2, and left it as a cesspool of cheaters. :S"
1959,"Ark was a great game but now is completely over run by cheaters, exploits and hacking. There is also a large amount of Real money trading involved in this game now where some people make an income from the problems with this game as you can see i have over 11 thousand hours in this game on steam and around 8 thousand on epic. Would not recommend until these issues are fix"
1960,very good but requires a very beefy computer with ad least 20  GB of ram
1961,"If you have never played ARK before, heads up. ARK is NOT well designed for PvP, so don't expect much from the PvP aspect. Just focus on the PvE aspects, the surviving-crafting-building aspects of the game and have fun. 

Also, remember that structure collision settings is friend of creative builders. If you play online servers, look for ones with structure collision settings off."
1962,"pvp in this game is trash , must be fixed"
1963,"cheating is rampant. genuinly, any official server and cheaters are everywhere. devs will do nothing, claim your tickets are ""Solved"" but nothing was done. (plenty of proof if you look a little) exploits are also rampant such as god mode stuff and meshing. (going through the terrain and world border to access areas, including bases). spoofing is also a thing, somehow able to steal characters (not accounts but literally characters, entire megatribes brought down by this) and still devs do absolutely nothing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS."
1964,Official is full of cheaters and meshers. Do not recommend
1965,"A very good game where you can get aimboted, meshed, very easy to buy the cheats. 

Buy it with pleasure."
1966,The devs don’t care about the state of their game and don’t do anything to punish the rampant cheating. Honestly the devs of this game should be embraced by how half asses they have policed their game. I have submit multiple tickets and have never once received a response. I will not be purchasing ark 2
1967,one of the most poorly made technical atrocities ever created
1968,After playing this game for almost 3k hours on ps4 and pc and paying a lot of money on it I made sure that this game is a complete trash after seeing the insane amount of cheats and exploits on both unoffcial and offcial servers not even gonna bother buying Ark 2
1969,Devs dont care about cheaters and meshers - wont buy Ark2
1970,Ark sucks so many Bugs mesh methods and nothing is getting fixed not gonna buy Ark 2 if this stays like this
1971,"Game has been ruined by cheaters and exploiters . The devs don't care anymore and wont do nothing to change it . 

100% not buying ark 2 . 
It will most likely just be the same shit show as ark 1 ."
1972,"This game is rather boring if you were to play it solo, but with a group of friends it's awesome. The more people the better it gets."
1973,"This game is full of cheaters, they go inside the map and raid you and destroy everything, also aimbot and god mode in a ""official server"" where you are not abble to have those things DONT BUY ARK2 IT WILL BE THE SAME ST*H OR WORSE"
1974,The game is full of meshers and cheaters. The devs of the game do not care about this game nor do they care about banning blatantly obvious cheaters. They add broken dinos and items into the game without fixing issues with old dinos and items. They are a lazy bunch of people with no integrity or respect for their player base. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
1975,"This is one Game that will Piss you off, Make you Angry and Frustrate you a LOT
BUT>> Its one of the most breath taking, Beautiful Worlds iv played in, With close to 2000Hours i still end coming back every few months and playing it non-stop 
The Developers really got this one right 10/10"
1976,"I have played this game for a very long time since it was first released on Xbox. In total between Xbox and steam I’ve put a little over 6000 hours into this game. I do love ark and the game has a lot of potential, but I do not recommend it.

The game has serious issues that the dev’s don’t seem to care about because after years they never get addressed. While playing on official pvp servers you will run into people who mesh through the map which is incredibly easy to do. They can wipe your base without being shot by your turrets, attacked by your Dino’s, or hit by your character in anyway. 

Not only is meshing a huge issue but there are tons of hackers. Thousands of players using third party software like aimbot, wall hacks, speed hacks, and general esp. trust me it’s disgusting and no fun to play against whatsoever. 

The dev’s have been aware of these problems for years and they don’t do anything about it. For a live service game that is always online in real time there is LITTLE TO NO SUPPORT FROM THE DEV’S. They made their money from the game and now are focused on ark 2. Which I am not looking forward to since they never fixed any of these issues on the first game I doubt the second game will be any better.

In short I do like playing this game and it’s been a lot of fun at times however it has way to many issues. I have since stopped playing this game and will never recommend it to anyone nor will I be buying ark 2. 

DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1977,takes too much space for all the craps your character makes
1978,"epik game
"
1979,just no
1980,Unofficial is better. Official is full of cheater and mesher.
1981,"Too many hackers, meshers, exploits, etc. After 5 years still waiting for a fix. Do we should buy ark 2 if u dont fix ark 1? Don't think so!"
1982,"DO NOT BUY, FULL OF CHEATERS THAT DEV'S DON'T CARE ABOUT. WILL NOT BE BUYING ARK 2."
1983,good
1984,A fun game. Love the graphics and mechanics to bits
1985,this game is full of exploits anc cheating
1986,The game is full of meshers and cheaters. The devs of the game do not care about this game nor do they care about banning blatantly obvious cheaters. They add broken dinos and items into the game without fixing issues with old dinos and items. They are a lazy bunch of people with no integrity or respect for their player base. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
1987,Well maintained game. Little to no bugs. Hours and hours of content.
1988,Very Buggy
1989,"worst dev team out of any game I have ever played, game is full of exploits and garbage. #MeshMonkey"
1990,Been playing this game since its release on the ps4 and have all the dlcs and am currently playing on pc and ps5 with a couple thousands hours easily played but the Development team has been the absolute worse at fixing bugs glitches and combating cheaters.  They try and act all positive on social media while continuing to ignore the communities wants and needs when it come to fixing balance issues implementing things that actively HELP THE CHEATERS and doing absolutely nothing to combat cheaters and these cheaters are not even pvp only it is worse on pvp servers no doubt but people will even cheat on pve server crashing servers to dupe items and exploiting in game mechanics to harass and destroy thousands of hours of work. This has been ongoing for many years now and each time they milk the player base of there money for a dlc and the dlc is ultimately swarmed with cheaters and new ways to cheat they refuse to do anythign until a new dlc is ready to go to try and use the publicity towards there next dlc while never actually doing much to combat the cheating to begin with. With Ark 2 on the horizon I would also suggest avoiding that as well as anything related to studio wildcard.
1991,Useless devs
1992,really enjoy playing this game
1993,full of meshing an cheaters an the devs do nothing to fix it
1994,"This game is 100% full of cheaters, hackers and real money traders. This happens in a lot of games HOWEVER there is ZERO policing to catch any of these cheaters and it completely ruins the PVP experience.

If this game just worked how it should it would be the best game of all time. But until then I can't recommend buying it and I encourage everyone to not buy Ark 2 until something is done to change this."
1995,amazing
1996,"Developers have never been committed to stopping cheaters and exploiters but the situation has grown out of hand recently, to the point where there's essentially no point in playing it in multiplayer anymore. If that's how Studio Wildcard cares for their active community, then I won't be buying Ark 2. I won't pay them twice just to get treated like garbage twice also."
1997,I LOVE SURVIVAL
1998,"Full of Cheaters Exploits and Devs doing nothing about it they dont ban players or fix their bugs, they even make it worse by making certain cheats even more OP"
1999,"Official servers are full of cheaters and lacks support from admins. Maps have mesh holes in them that haven't been fixed since release. Admins are just sitting back and doing nothing to help until a week or more you put a ticket in for help but by then it is way to late for your stuff you spent hours getting do to cheaters.
"
2000,Its very addictive.
2001,its great!
2002,Devs dont care about the game dont buy it
2003,Fun
2004,"full of mesh monkeys, never gonna buy ark 2"
2005,"Ark is a game full of Cheaters ussing Aimbot, speedhack, rapid fire, mesh, HACKING YOUR PERSONAL STEAM ACCOUNT, rmt, and CORRUPTED ADMINS owned by people in game with a lot of money that are the leaders of the most powerfull tribes. Everything in this game is duped and sell in discord RMT shops. No one should play this game or any other WildCard Studio Game ever."
2006,Full of meshers
2007,"Very unfortunate the state of this game has become. With how quickly the devs jumped ship, I now have very very serious reservations about ARK 2"
2008,so much esp and aimbotters plus the meshing spots not to mentions the sorry excuse of devs that do nothing to help the community there single handily killed off most of their player base gg
2009,"I have spent 100s of dollars across Ark on my xbox and Ark on my PC, played for ~1.5k hours in total, 5+ years, and have had a severe problem with this game. The game is filled with cheaters across not only the official but unofficial servers on every version of the game. Your base that you spent 100 hours on? Gone in a night because someone went under the map and bypassed all of your defenses. Of course you can always make a ticket to the support team so they will help you... except the cheaters don't get banned and your stuff is never given back. The worst thing that happens to the cheaters is that there base might get deleted from the server and if your lucky they will get banned. I will not be buying Ark 2 if they don't fix these issues. This game is amazing but the cheaters have completely ruined it. With hope from a long time ark player, fix your game or me nor many others will be buying ark 2. Also if you're looking for more info about this check H.O.D. on youtube as he has covered this topic recently."
2010,BAD GAME CHEATING GALORE
2011,Official servers are full of cheaters and lacks support from admins. maps have mesh holes in them that haven't been fixed since release.
2012,"its an amazing game and i would recommend this game to all of you who like to just do random things, play online with friends. fight bosses or even do raid events on your own, there is limitless potential!"
2013,bad game full of cheaters
2014,"you cant play an offical server without running into aimbotters. I also got false banned for meshing and i cannot get unbanned because  i made a ticket on their offical website and just got a copy paste msg saying that they will not be looking into it any further. now anytime i try to make a ticket to get unbanned it gets insta close because their site has a rule that makes it s you can only make 1 ticket per steam account. TLDR spent $200 buying game and maps, play for 8k hours and then get false banned and cannot play anymore. gg WC"
2015,It has good graphics and is very realistic overall very well designed game just watch out for the lyphosours on the lost island near the volcano they are tough
2016,like it
2017,hard
2018,"This game is unplayable and is full of cheaters 
(watch H.O.D 's video on youtube on the problem for more explanation)"
2019,ss
2020,Punch a 15 story dinosaur in the ankles until it passes then force feed it berry's so you can ride it with your friends and maybe even other dinosaurs!
2021,The gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable. Every once in a while it is fun to terrorize some defenseless animals. Lots of fun stuff to craft too.
2022,"great game but official is full of exploiters, cheaters and meshing. Played xbox almost 4k hours and also steam. Xbox is by far worse with cheater but overall this game needs to check itself"
2023,Devs don't give a crap about the game once you have paided for the game full of cheats/exploits/accounts/servers etc all getting taken
2024,hot
2025,"The official network its full of cheaters, admins dont even care if ur getting railgun aimboted thru the mesh unless u have their contact / ur their friend, i doubt most people that played official pvp will even want to play ark 2 when it releases theres no guarantee that wildcard will treat ark2 playerbase diferent from the ark 1 player base (they dont care).

If ur planning on playing PVP, the only way to defend against railgun aimboters its by having a railgun aimboter in ur tribe (not free), tickets wont make a diference it usually takes 2 days for them to reply (assuming they even reply).

Anyways, if u were planning on trying out PVP in this game either go play pve or dont even buy the game at all cuz the ammount of cheating, rmt, account/char spoofing, admin favoritism that this game has its insane ( not to talk about the ammount of bugs wich its actually impressive for a game that has been getting updates for 5 years)."
2026,"Needs to fix slot cap invasions and loosen rules on 6 man tribes regarding teaming, otherwise game is solid"
2027,cool
2028,In love
2029,good game
2030,The Official cluster is seriously at a point where if you want to survive you need cheats to defend against other cheaters. I have never seen ARK in this bad of a state since my entire legacy-present day experience. It's like the enforcement devs quit their jobs so that they can mess up ARK 2 all over again.
2031,Fun game 10/10
2032,You like Jurassic Park? What if you were a part of the zoo?
2033,"Hi everyone, i've been playing this game since 2005 and was amazed at the potential of this game i still love the game however its gotten to the point where i dont love the games developers they're are useless. The game is a mess in terms of cheating, if people aren't duping meshing and aimbotting they're now spoofing accounts off players and stealing their hard work, literally taking control of a players account without doing it through steam and the developers literally dont care they see it as they've made their money from this game there now gonna let it tank so people move on to to ark 2, I will not be buying another studio wildcard production ever again its really not worth getting invested in something that is so fragile and could and most probably will end up in the exact same predicament as ark and with the lack of action taken to rid ark of cheaters it doesn't bode well for their next release sorry. disgusting how the developers treat their loyal community"
2034,Game is very laggy and devs do nothing about hackers a ddossers
2035,the
2036,Amazing game. Only thing i would like to say is don't jump on an unconscious flyer because you get stuck on the wings.
2037,Online servers are literally unplayable. Servers would have long lasting ddos attacks on highly populated servers. Constant cheating with players aimbotting  and shooting through terrain with a tek rifle. The support team is no help on any reports and close off cases with an unbothered investigation. Is this how Wild Card will be on the release of Ark 2? This game just feels abandoned from the creators themselves.
2038,Great game still. Hope they didnt mess up number 2.
2039,Game Good
2040,"Game full of cheaters, devs dont care"
2041,"idk my wyv got randomy killed by a low lvl raptor so i was  kinda mad, good game tho"
2042,i game i ... gammeee..
2043,"5369.9 hours and I ran into every single type of thing that ruins the game. 
1. Players forcing mutations in official and unofficial coding in 8 billion mutations.
2. Code-logging(spoofing) another players account in a server that's being tracked in Battlemetrics.
3. ESP or aimbotting with esp using railguns and/or blatantly cheating with every admin privilege.
4. While raiding and making fobs the cheater somehow locks that official server from downloads? How the crap do they not get automatically banned...
5. Mesh building... Enough said.
Lastly please give more than 3 defensive turrets, why is that so hard. Raiding is so easy to the point where having a base means nothing. No one can enjoy having stuff with these terrible defenses, base locations or ""hidden holes."" It takes 0 effort for someone to just throw a turtle or a stego with 8 billion mutations and perfect stats and soak someones base offline."

2082,"When i first played this game it gave me the sense of wonder and exploration about what i would find around the next corner. The sense of danger and no idea what i would find next gave me that same sense of exploration that i hadn't encountered since player vanilla World of Warcraft many years ago. I know this game is very different in terms of its game loop but its the only game i found that scratched that itch.

The game loop is satisfying and has countless hours of replay ability despite a few bugs that add to the charm. After you start adding mods to this game its even better! 

Highly recommend 10/10"

Thank you for reading my review of ARK! I really hope you enjoyed it. Check out my other reviews, I got tons of cool stuff on there."
2095,shit
2096,"This is a really in depth game, and has a lot to offer.  Be aware before you buy though, it is not very noob friendly.  If you can make it through the first about 20 character levels, things start to make sense and pick up, but before then, there isn't a whole lot to explain what you should do or how you should go about trying to do it."
2097,"if you wanne go single player go for it! Its def worth it!!

But if you trying to play Smalltribes or even official forget it.
Hackers, Spoofers, Cheaters you name something  bad dont worry ark got ya.
The Devs just completely ruined this beautiful game....sadly"
2098,´great game with friends until the paralysing raptor rapes your entire family
2099,game sucks dix
2100,im not keen on black people
2101,"It's a fun game to play with friends. You can play single player just fine, but I recommend staying out of public servers with randoms. host your own for best experience :)"
2102,love it
2103,very awsome game
2104,Dinosaur
2105,filled with cheaters and devs dont do anything about them
2106,Trash game full of exploits and cheaters
2107,this game is full of cheaters and they just profit real life money from doing it.
2108,DINOSAURS RASSMPAGE STROLL TAME KILL
2109,"Got combined with other accounts more then 10.000 hours into this game.
Game is dead its full of cheaters and devs dont care.
Reason enough for me to not buy ark 2 or any game made from wildcard."
2110,This game is full of cheaters. This game is PAY TO WIN!
2111,very good game very fun with friends
2112,"I play this game in a window because i'm on a very big screen. Sometimes the mouse leaves the window and closes the game on me, which can be devastating on a PvP server! Happened to me just now, and when I tried to load the game again, it forced a new game update on me, and can't connect to the server because the server also needs updating. I died, my wyvern died, my otter died, my stuff is gone. Really bad game design to force updates like this! Updates should be servers first, then client!"
2113,Everyone in the game is cheating
2114,"Wildcard is probably the worst game studio out there, not only does the game have a ton of bugs, cheaters, its 800 gigs.."
2115,"A honest review.

Ark is just not worth it.
The devs just dont appreciate their player base and do NOT deserve any player base at this point.
After reporting multiple cheaters, dupers, hacking discords everything ive come to realise that it doesnt matter because they do not care. Official servers are filled with hackers and unplayable. Your account gets hacked if you mess with the wrong people and no matter what you say or do , wildcard doesnt care.

Youtubers have finally spoke out against the devs and wildcard. 
The pvp community is dead, official is unplayable and this game doesnt have the right devteam to back up its potential.
Unless you go to complain about issues on their official discord because within 10 seconds you are banned if you even say the word cheaters. Wish they had this support on the actual servers.

Game wise, lots of bugs, game is more than 500GB of space and you need a NASA computer to run 60FPS on this game.
You can have fun with friends but for a limited amount of time, because if you jump into pvp you will realise that you need to sacrifice your sleep and work to survive. 
Even if you survive for multiple weeks, there will be cheaters that just destroy everything within a few hours.
Walking through the maps , making sure you cant move because they use aimbot and having Cheats for their dinos making sure you cannot win any fights. You will come to realise that you can do nothing against it and you will see your base get destroyed before your eyes. AND THE WORST PART Is , even if you recorded everything they will do nothing against it.

Like i said, i had 100% proven that people where cheating against me and till this day they still arnt banned.

WP wildcard, you made such a high potential game into a pile of shit."
2116,Full of cheaters on officials and unofficials with zero policing from Wildcard - would not recommend the purchase. Would not recommend it even if it was free.
2117,"Game it littered with people cheatig, meshing and bugs. This game is not ideal if you want to play on PVP servers at all, because of the many cheaters, meshers and people abusing bugs. The only way this game can be played is if you play on PVE servers. If you are thinking about buying this game to play PVP, DONT, you will simply regret it after you have put hundreds of hours into something, only to lose it to a cheater. Wildcard needs to step up and fix this game, but it seems like they cant, instead they are working on ARK 2, which will probably be just as bad. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
2118,its the best game fr
2119,"Bad Dev support and they get never control of the cheating commity in this game..
so never start playing this game dudes!"
2120,good bro
2121,"Its ark, we know whats up."
2122,good game but i have the urge to k!ll myself
2123,"So many hours. I had a lot of funs but the truth is that the game is not playable anymore due to the massiv amount of cheaters, exploiters and real money trading.

The worst method which is going around is that your ARK ingame character can be spoofed which means someone else can login with your char ID and takes the owner control of the tribe.

Everyone who reads this should not waste your time because its not worth it anymore."
2124,"Beautiful, Glitched, Rage inducing, peaceful, games got all the ranges of emotions"
2125,"Fun game (was) ruined by cheaters and lazy devs. Dont play unless your playing singleplayer/unofficial servers. Oh and also people in mega tribes who are friends with the devs slip them a bribe and they spawn in anything they want, corrupt game that had  so much potential"
2126,well the mods fun but lag
2127,Ark takes up nearly 700GB on my 1TB ssd. This is ridiculous. This stupid unoptimized game is addictive. Would not recommend.
2128,the game is full of cheaters and the devs are not doing anything about it
2129,ujzhgfd
2130,devs dont  do anything
2131,"full of cheaters and aimbotters. Account Spoofing, meshing and duping is also a big part of the official server in  this game. The Devs are doing nothing. Do not buy this game trust me"
2132,This game is  very fun
2133,Yes
2134,"The game is dying 
Sheater / Mesher / Dupper every where offi and unoffi
WC do not care and no SAV 

That's sad"
2135,verygood
2136,"After Playing for nearly 1000 hours I've encountered most the game has to offer, from the spawn camping Rex on a beach to killing all of the endgame bosses on each map. Through all of the bugs in the game from having the mesh swallow your dino and character to wildcard breaking servers and deleting all of your progress on their servers. Yes the game is a buggy mess and has a lot of downsides but the community is great, there is a reason so many maps in the game are ported from mods and that the community is still playing the game regularly to this day. It's a difficult grind and consumes a lot of time, but if you enjoy sandbox games where you can do what you want then I fully recommend getting it, but it will definitely test your patience. Also, if you want to play PVP prepared to be more paranoid than any tryhard Rust server you've ever been on."
2137,jjjjj
2138,Game wouldve been perfect if trolls were not allowed to jump servers
2139,sometimes it can bug..
2140,A fck mess this game right now. Only Cheaters and incompetent Support. DONT BUY IT!
2141,"12.5k hours all in pvp, mostly official. Game is worst state it has ever been in, do NOT buy this.. FULL OF CHEATERS! DEVS do absolutely NOTHING!"
2142,":D
"
2143,"200,000 hours of play time on official servers 361 and 417 completely lost due to a game breaking exploit that has been around for years. This has happened to a list of tribes in the past and nothing has been done to prevent it or help the tribes this happens to. Hundreds of players have lost their items they spent so long working on due to this."
2144,This game is actually amazing the thought process everything is on point. Some minor bugs here and there but what really killed it is the dev support. Devs don't give a damn about their game and they won't care about ARK II either don't buy it no point your stuff will get wiped by cheaters and you will loose everything!
2145,Full of cheaters unplayable game
2146,"Don't bother with this game unless you like getting destroyed by cheaters that face zero repercussions. It's very obvious Wildcard doesn't care about their playerbase, and unless something is done I'm sure Ark 2 will be just as disastrous."
2147,"This game is full of cheaters. Especially the official servers are not playable anymore due to aimbot and other cheats like taking over someoneelses character in the game. These and multiple other issues have been in the game for years (some of them are newer than others) but Wildcard doesnt do anything against it, A lot of stuff would be easy to fix, but even the game developers are corrupt. 
Ark was always a game with a lot of potential and cant be compared to any other game because its made so good, but getting destroyed by all these Problems and so its just a 2/10 in my opinion."
2148,This game is so FUN!!!
2149,Good game
2150,Cheaters everywhere
2151,"bad game to much duping of items, account sharing, spinning, meshing en many more bad thing"
2152,this game is so shit please dont wast your money full of cheating and the devs dont give a fuck if u ask me there the ones doing it they sell bases tames servers everything ark 2 will make alot of money and be the same watch these devs r the most fucked up people who ever made a game i promise u that!!!!!
2153,"cheater filled game, official is ruined, unofficial ruined, cannot step outside without being aimbotted or spun. Terrible dev support, bad game mechanics, bad pvp metas, pay to win maps. terrible game do not buy"
2154,just dont
2155,shit
2156,Official Pvp Is just full of cheaters some that have ties to devs so that they do not even get banned when u make tickets against them. Would not recommend to anyone.
2157,glitchy but once past primitive stage lots of fun
2158,good game
2159,"this game is pain, ive never wanted to end my life more then when i play this game."
2160,still gonna play this wen the sequel comes out
2161,G
2162,game full off cheaters and exploiters wild car needs to remove tek railgun and watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i50-MORzzog
2163,full of cheaters and needs to be policed better
2164,A Bloatware. But it is fun
2165,"GUIDE FOR NEW PLAYERS!:

Don't get attached."
2166,"
veri gut game would waste hours of time i could use for something useful again."
2167,Rage but funni
2168,probably the most enjoyable game i have ever played across all my devices
2169,GUD.
2170,"""what the fuck is that??"" every 2 seconds simulator, fun :)"
2171,easily the best survival game ever. not sure if Ark 2 can live up to this....
2172,good
2173,dino
2174,love the game it is a goed game
2175,Its really fun if you play with friends
2176,"Game Is Full Of Cheaters, Dupers, meshers."
2177,its the best game you must play it
2178,HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO BANG A DINOSAUR SO BAD THAT YOU BEAT OFF TO VIDEOS OF PEOPLE DRESSED LIKE DINOSAURS??? I'VE NEVER DONE THAT...
2179,"this game is awful ive played a little on pc but mainly on xbox since it came out in beta and i have a absurd amount of play time like over 2 years worth which a ton of that is afk where my xbox was left on but theres been times growing up where i legit lived ark slept ark and thats all i did for weeks because you just get so sucked in if you have nothing goin on and it sucks to put that kinda time into a game and have to deal with the kinda issues you deal with on a daily basis. not even  talking about the poor game design or bugs or litterally loosing a fulll inventory because you hit the ground the wrong way. its all the in game stuff combined with the other players. every one always has to figure a way to cheat ,get the upper hand, or just ruin some ones day for a laugh. i remember the days where getting insided was the worst thing ever and it still it but your lucky if that happens because youll just be meshed aimbotted anyways. the amount of time you invest is not worth how easy you can loose it all with no help from the devs ive put tickets in where they tell me to fuck off and i have to spam ticket them to actually get a reply thats not copy and paste automated. its just sad"
2180,"11/10 would reccomend
Cute animals like the ferox which ate my face a couple of seconds later"
2181,it was good
2182,"They haven't ever compiled any files properly, full game is about 400gb.
it's so buggy, and ARK II isn't even going to have first person mode as an option, I now hate this game and I want a full refund, as it's now unplayable for me, and forces me to spend more money to be able to use all the content. I am extremely unhappy with this game.

I REQUEST FULL REFUND!!!"
2183,"This game is absolutely dog shit you can't even leave ur server without getting aimbotted let alone if you can even keep your server if it hasn't been railgun aimbotted or meshed.
0/10 would not recommened"
2184,The Game is interesting and fun! (Wouldn't recommend it to all players)
2185,its fun maybe add some mods to help but only add mods when u know the game and maybe played the whole thing and finished it
2186,"Fix aimbot and cheating on official servers. Also tons of bugs, also takes like 400gb to install with all official maps which is absolutely ridiculous."
2187,game nhu cc toan bug
2188,10/10
2189,the game is a really uneek game with mods it is a lot more fun i have played ark on ps4 but pc is the best bc of the mods and ark is just a fun game
2190,"Too many cheaters on Official PvP.  Used to love the game, but its unplayable now."
2191,"Good Game, Nice mechanics"
2192,This game can create oppurtunity to discover new world my favourite game is ARK

2200,"Please note this review is by a SINGLE-PLAYER perspective who ran this game using bootcamp (windows on mac) on an i5 with 8 ram. Sometimes it runs perfectly, sometimes it has to load overnight. Weirdly inconsistent. 

I loved it. I like the maps, I like the gear, the amount of control you have over the stats of your server, the way the weather and environment works. I like the look of the environment and the animals (player is…weird looking but fine) 

All this said, grinding to do bosses is a pain on singleplayer. The challenges to get the articacts are CONSIDERABLY harder than the boss fights them selves with some exceptions (assuming you don’t try and use wyverns…and then have no dinos in the fight). 

In general grinding to get the best gear is a nuisance even with increased rates. It gets a little unnecessarily complicated in my personal opinion. 

Still, love the game. What little I don’t love can mostly be fixed with settings, the extensive workshop, or cheats."
2201,"The game is plagued with bugs that have at best, a solution that takes 2 hours of research and at worst literally no fix. Excusable if they were small bugs but instead its things such as a boat that might be your base can get stuck on an invisible wall make you completely stranded, or eels that literally phase through walls and the very ocean floor itself while also stunning you, i cant recommend you buy this game simply because you would be throwing that money at devs who dont care to ever fix the problems with game, they will instead roll out a dlc or another unfinished, buggy, mess of a game."
2202,Ez Game Ez Win
2203,cool game
2204,"fun, if you have friends"
2205,deno
2206,"the game is very good, high quality sound effects and high quality dinosaurs even on low graphics. My potato of a computer can run this game easily with the game looking beautiful!"
2207,u r stupid if u dont play
2208,the game is amazing i really recommend it the graphics are good the dinosaurs in the game but they can bug when you kill them but over all it's great
2209,yes
2210,"I wouldn't waste your time playing this game. Officials are ridden with Cheaters, Tyrannical Mega tribes, and Exploiters. Also the amount of bugs in the game will make you wonder why they keep producing new items, creatures, and maps, when not 
a single asset doesn't come without a massive number of flaws. Wildcard doesn't want to employ someone to make a decent anti cheat system, nor do they play there own game or understand any of the current flaws. So I'm assuming these issues are going to stick around forever. I'd just look elsewhere to spend your money, rust is pretty good."
2211,nais
2212,its fun
2213,very fun with friend
2214,dino
2215,The controls are a bit complicated but the survival experience is really great!
2216,"Played this game with my girlfriend it soon became 400 GBs of setting changes, figuring out how to even play the game, and then what are we even supposed to do. Once we got everything actually settled I started learning the crafting system, soon was building a small hut while my girlfriend looked at all the dinosaurs nearby. However, by the time the hut was pretty much complete we both were done with the game since we had no clue of what to do next or how to do anything else."
2217,Dino game 🤯
2218,game is very broken
2219,This game is full exploiting. This game is full of cheating. Family!
2220,Game is full of cheaters and exploits.
2221,asdfghjkl;
2222,"Pretty fun survival game, Would definitely recommend to play with friends if you can as it makes it alot more fun, Probably wait till its on sale though."
2223,It's All Cool
2224,you are gonna die a lot
2225,fun but very annoying when u die
2226,good
2227,yes
2228,Best Adventure game
2229,"awesome everything just awesome
"
2230,My favorite game
2231,fantastic game. Amazing with friends
2232,the game is still shit
2233,love the mods
2234,hufg
2235,very pog
2236,its a rly good game
2237,hey there i have played ark with my friend and its so good but i need steam to make a 50% discount on it because some of my friends want to purchase it and play it with us but they only have half the price of the game right now and they cannot charge more money to buy it so please accept my request and thanks Saad
2238,"You play, you love it.  You lose your favorite dino and have to start from scratch, then swear to never play again, only to start again a month or two later.  Wash, rinse, repeat."
2239,"Game is full of exploits and cheaters, who use aimbots and other paid hacks which are obvious to players. Even when reported unless you are streaming or have a ""Pocket"" dev/admin you are on your own, this is not just in Official Servers but unofficial as well.

"
2240,"Before I played ark I had a job, 6 hours of sleep and had a good life. Now I still have a job but I only got 1-3hrs of sleep a day because of breeding and farming resources, would recommend to people who got no job and is single,  11/10 Will ruin your life, not kidding."
2241,yes
2242,This game is full of exploits and cheaters and the admins do nothing to police the servers!
2243,h
2244,the game is full of cheaters with no help from the devs its unplayable on the official network
2245,full of hacks exploits glitches and cheats
2246,"This game doesn't pressure you. It doesn't force you to proceed. It has a storyline perhaps you might want to advance some of your tech. However, The dinos and megafauna will kill you. They will also become jealous of your preoccupation in building and stomp all over your progress. This is the best game ive played that will probably never go away. If Vin diesel was too busy to save Paul Walker because he was playing Ark, and somehow manages to screw up Ark 2- I still wont blame him. This game won't die. It will go on and on, and people will continue to host servers long after the main ones are powered down. Modding will continue will all new dino advances in science perfecting the look of that damn Spinosaurus until it looks like an aquatic penguin. 11/10. Almost 2k hours on it, baby."
2247,dinos yes
2248,"i love this game a lot but it isnt working cause of a ""game is able to load cause of DX 11 level 10"" issue being unable to work when it did yesterday. If anyone is able to help me please do. I tried installing Directx 10 and 11 and neither worked not only that but they never even installed fully and the application didnt get created. Please help i wanna enjoy this game again."
2249,"Эта игра идеальна в пве, пвп пока не играл, может поменяю свое мнение скоро"
2250,Was a fun game but ruined by silly additions like wyverns and tek guns that can shoot through walls with an increased presence of cheaters that mesh
2251,"its the best game i've played for 3 years now i think i played on xbox look at me now im on a computer
"
2252,I've been playing for 4 hours and it's already been 15 hours
2253,"ark
"
2254,"Was a great game but the severe lack of enforcement for all the cheating is putting the game in an early game. Mass Duping and real money trading is eliminating any sense of value for items now there is account spoofing where you can lose a whole server in minutes and the devs just watch by and let it happen. That's without all the aimbotting that is a common occurrence anywhere you go. RIP to such a good game ,avoid Official servers like the plague and incompetent enforcement team(If they even exist)."
2255,Full off cheaters exploits game is in a mess and so will ark 2 all the devs care about is money
2256,"This needs to be in the $5 bin at Gamestop. Its glitchy dinosaur pokemon.

This is a MMO past its time. Play with your friends, but not strangers. Online community is toxic.
Despite the option to play 1P, it is not a single player game. The difficulty does not scale down to what 1P is going to spend time doing. Late game equipment will have you grinding for hours. That combined with item durability degrade over time means you'll be grinding those resources all over again to fix your gear after only a couple of battles. Your tames, that you've spent days leveling will get permanently stuck on bad terrarain, accidentally murdered en masse trying to teleport to a boss fight, or butchered by the random Alpha variant of wild dino. You're going to have a bad time.

That is unless you unlock the in-game cheat menu and just hack your way to God-mode, resources, equipment, dinosaurs, exp.... But after that buzz wears off, there's not much point left to the game. 

"
2257,dinser
2258,Ark is my favorite game. Been p[laying for almost 7 years and i am still doing things in the game ive never done before. yea it could use some polishing and some dinos need some TLC but id give it a 10/10. so much fun to play.
2259,"Exploits, cheaters and inactive devs, Really adictive game with alot of hearthbreaks from issues thats not supposed to be in the game, dont get it!"
2260,"A game with big potential

sadly wildcard dont give a fuck about : 

-Dupplication
-Cheat
-Exploit crash server & player ip
-meshing
-Black market

and fresh new one : Spoofing 
GG wildcard"
2261,"very good game but very complicated to learn, it would be nice if more information for guideness were provided"
2262,it aussom game
2263,Would be a great game except the community is ridiculously toxic and people will cheat and hack at any given chance.
2264,yes
2265,roar
2266,what a great game but 130gb my pc died lol
2267,DAM BOI THIS GAME GOOD
2268,it shit
2269,if you have friends to play this game with you i recommend to play it and even if you are solo its really fun
2270,This game made me neglect my girlfriend and not eat or drink. 10/10 would recommend and do again :)
2271,.
2272,GG
2273,i had a family
2274,amazing game
2275,its a great game i love it and maybe youll like it to

2277,very good!
2278,"terrible game, no too many cheaters admins are not active its just terrible.
"
2279,"Actually this is one of my fav game. It's very relaxing, specially when you are on 6th level and have 5 rex all over you killing you and your stupid little house! I love this game c:"
2280,"u 
"
2281,"Ark is a game you only start to understand when a rex spawns eats all your dinos, destroys your base and kills
you, and your left naked and afraid in the jungle crying that something else will eat you in the jungle.  

10/10 would die again"
2282,I can put up busty anime wall scrolls in my primitive shack. 10/10
2283,fun
2284,jk
2285,this game is shi* with some kind of salt and sugar kinda worth
2286,"Fucking addictive game, the grind can be endless, an amazing game that still holds its interest and enjoyment for how old it is. I only play PVE on my own server and 120 hours in there are SOOOO many things to still do. i recommend not using cheats in your own server. Being able to spawn resources and dinos actually killed the Grind vibe for me. Awesome to play with friends. thats when its the best."
2287,Funny dinosaur
2288,"Great with friends, kind of terrible alone. Expect Glitches and frustration with the building mechanics.
Mods make it fun, but nothing will fix the jank of the building system. Difficult to know if I recommend this or not, the company is a terrible greedy monstrosity that seems incapable of fixing basic bugs, but I enjoy it all the same with friends so hard to complain too loudly."

2295,i have put many hours into this game and i enjoy it. the game play is easy and fun it can be scaled up or down with the difficulty or just enjoy slow play.
2296,good
2297,"Stay away from Official server because you will grind for hours....take a 4 hour nap and come back your base in gone and dinos wiped...so many hackers just save your self time and go to a private server with about 2-5 friends and have a blast, modify setting lower taming speed, egg time etc. Best survivor i ever played."

2360,"Amazing game, i've built countless bases across many different maps. The Modding section for the game is totally free and adds so much customisation. Both the modded and official content is made by top notch programmers and digital artists. I can wholeheartedly recommend the game to gamers looking for a open world sandbox game where not even the crazed titans are the limit."

2389,"no
"
2390,The game is full of cheaters and some glitches are still in place since day 1. Please do not mess up Ark 2.
2391,"For a dinosaur survival game, it's definitely up there. There's no lack of things to do, and it can be quite fun to play. Then again, it's difficult to survive for any amount of time even in the easiest spawns until you get good at the game. The game feels old, outdated, even though the devs are updating it regularly. I don't like how archaic the dinosaurs are-they behave too mechanically, with little to no uniqueness between them. I dislike the crafting system as well, as the points you get from leveling aren't nearly enough to unlock recipes for what you need. All in all, if you want a good dinosaur survival game, don't get this one."
2392,Decently fun for survival/building/PVP
2393,The embodiment of paleontology and prehistoric life combined with mysterious action adventure and scientific endeavor. This game is for those who love dinosaurs as much as me and prehistoric life and science in general and want to rule the world with dinosaur side by side with man.
2394,Dinos are sick

2417,"The game in its current state is not playable and rampant with cheaters. They refuse to make any effort to stop the cheaters. Official PvP servers are the worst I've seen ever.

2430,"Really great game, i love the concept of dino survival. But multiplayer is glitchy and it takes a lot of time to join my friends wold."
2431,"Its ARK, the best survival game"
2432,"God awful game, has no anti cheat or any systems in place to keep cheaters away. Only been 5 years since release. maybe in another 5 years ill be able to compete. 
"
2433,its amazing
2434,"I do not know where those possitive reviews come from but the curent state of the game is unplayable on official pvp servers. The positive reviews probably come from PVE players. on PVP official servers there are hundreds of cheaters everywhere, aim botters, meshers, godmodes. The game is not policed at all, it has no online admins on any servers. Wildcard does not care to hire more admins for years now. I strongly recommend you do not buy or get into this game it is a total waste of your time and you will be strongly disapointed. The only viable servers are private Unofficial servers with adtive admins. Officials is unplayable and you need to spend hundreds of dolars on cheats every week to even servive for a few days. The locations of your bases are revealed to cheaters so you cannot hide, they have godmode that they do not die at all, they are basicly immortal, and they spawn kill you in yor bed with aimbot, threw walls with wallhacks etc So much potential wasted"

-Like collecting creatures? This is a great game for you!
-Like survival? Ark is a fantastic balance of fun and challenge, riding a robot dinosaur into a battle where you fight a giant spider is wicked fun (and difficult)
-Just like dinosaurs? This game is full of them. They're everywhere!! You can even find Tech variants of some!
10/10 wonderful game with equally enjoyable DLC!"
2442,very good and fun game

2477,"Too much of a grind
"
2478,Egg
2479,"Ark's depth and variety is incredibly surprising. Between the expansions and mods there are hundreds of hours of play even at the casual level. The customizing options let you make the game as challenging or not as you want. In some ways the gameplay has a lot in common with Minecraft in that the kind of game you play is really up top you.  Some people like to push to endgame Tek and defeat all the bosses, while others stick to primitive play, collect dinos, or build extensive structures.  It's an incredible amount of content for the price, and well worth checking out."
2480,It's a good game if you like survival and exploring games!!
2481,yay

2493,its just an amazing survival game
2494,"340GB hours of download, Crashes on start up, no mods"
2495,Hacking is out of control. The game has been abandoned by their Dev team.
2496,d
2497,"It's a good game, but in the current time there's a lot of things to inprove over official server, the exploits like aimbot, esp, meshing etc is huge problem with many people quitting because they have no way of defending their base when they just get pulled up on by aimbotter's etc. The devs really need to take it more serious if someone abuses exploits and rather look thru the tickets insted of just removing them without them even sloving or checking in to the issue, way to many people get wiped off official server in a un-legit way by exploits. 

Tho the unofficial servers are often in a much better state than the official ones, because they have better admin support, nerfed rail guns, fixed mesh holes and much more. Would really recommend it for unofficial, but like 50% of the game is official so I can't fully recommend the game.


Over all the game isn't in the best status ATM, there's a lot of things to inprove but there's as well a lot of things that are good (most of them only on unofficial). Would really want to see some real inprovements in the future of this game, I know the potential of the game but it it follows this path it will not reach it."
2498,"It is honestly an indescribable, unique experience. Can't wait for Ark II."
2499,good game buy ple4se
2500,trex scary
2501,if they cant solve cheating in this game on there official servers do not buy ark 2 rmt is outrageous blatent cheaters everywhere you cant do anything on official anymore without cheaters on burner accounts etc and wildcard does absolutely nothing about it at all
2502,monke
2503,this game is enjoyable for the most of us that enjoy pain and just the right amount of unbearable clunkyness and pain. some of my fondest memories are of me buying new keboards because of the fits ive thrown at how much i enjoy dying to glitches and horribly designed dino spawns. god i love it so much. please end me
2504,"Really cool game... i like that you can host your own game and learn how to play before hittin the community servers. Cool stuff....way better than R**t. 
Lots of cool stuff to learn, drop offs, critters that kill ya... lots to do.

2526,"Not worth it. Badly optimised, and many exploits simply haven't been patched. many of the servers are full of try hard tribes who just feel the need to make everyone else miserable and ruin the game. There are many other games similar to this which are far better optimised, you will have more fun playing them with friends."
2527,good
2528,eeee
2529,"game
"
2530,This game is life.
2531,Full of glitches when playing single player. Full of glitches when playing multilayer too and also the thousands of cheaters and exploiters that own all the servers. FIX THE GAME
2532,I love this game!! I enjoy being able to craft items and then use them to tame dinos
2533,dodo
2534,Ark Survival Evolved...Alpha...Beta..Primitive...and soon Ark2...whatever the changes and however it evolves..it will always be the Best survival game EVER!!!
2535,"This is the only game I can honestly say, I wish I had never heard of it. There is so much potential here, I've been playing for years, but ultimately, it's unplayable. Unless the AI is intentionally set to kill and destroy all players and their builds, it's fundamentally broken. I only play singleplayer because this game's players have a reputation similar to GTA players. 

Here's a quick description of how the game always plays: First 6 hours, repeatedly killed without time to gather resources until you've leveled up enough. Next 6 hours: Grind and gather resources as you excitedly finally get to play. Suddenly: A nonsensical event will take place like a giant whale in a shallow lake or an alpha carno stupidly overpowered will not only kill you, but destroy everything you've built, making you feel like you've just spent hours for nothing at all. If you happen to luckily respawn nearby after the event has ""randomly"" destroyed all your beds, the container bags will all glitch and you will loose everything without the decay bags appearing. 

The devs of this game have spent zero effort on balance. Building games are an art form that take skill to balance properly, this game has nothing like that. It's beautiful, dinos can be fun, but overall, there are better games will better payoffs out there. Since I discovered Conan, I stopped playing Ark altogether, but came back to try again. It's just a shame that this game was so badly managed."
2536,This is the best survival game I have ever played.
2537,I love dinos
2538,that game is ass
2539,best game. I love dinosaurs and survival and this game has both. serously you have to it. DO NOT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWSSSSSSS

2548,its fun ish
2549,
2550,"ARK is such a painful experience that becomes trivial once an amount of progress is achieved in game. Official servers are so overloaded with structures there's nowhere to build. I can't recommend playing on official servers if you enjoy solo play or small group content.

ARK is otherwise an incredible game with consistent updates, so many quality of life and content mods available in the workshop, and a persistent dedicated community. Playing solo or with a small group of close friends on a private server is an incredible experience, and I absolutely recommend the game for that reason alone."
2551,a really good game if you like having a life or a relationship 11/10 would recommend

2586,"When I first bought this game 7 years ago (back when it was early access), I was pretty skeptical. It was incredibly frustrating to play and learn, especially for someone new to survival games. 7 years and 3331 hours later, I can confidently say Ark has changed my life.  Not only is it incredibly fun to play, I've met many amazing friends along the way. I may still have a love/hate relationship with the gameplay at times, but this is still the first game I go to when I sit down at my computer. Thank you Wildcard for this amazing game and I look forward to seeing what you do with Ark 2!"
2587,I liked playing this game for long periods of time and like dinosaurs in this game is fun but the thing that annoys me the most is pego.
2588,"full of cheaters, came from ps4/5 and was the same problem on console, do not play until fixed."
2589,N1
2590,yo
2591,Best Game ever
2592,I can't play this game if I'm not in the mood for it.

2594,"This is an absolutely amazing game, there are a few gripes that i have like how WildCard don't really listen to their fan base regarding bugs, glitches etc. But all in all it is a great game! Definitely recommend!"
2595,ark is the beast
2596,very fun enjoyed it alot its even better with pokemon mods
2597,good
2598,i love this so much and i like to play with friends this game is so much fun to play
2599,dinosaur
2600,fun lol
2601,too many cheaters for how long the games been out there more worrying about ark 2 when ark 1 is so broken as hell and full of cheaters wildcard is a joke and never do anything about it
2602,"Goofy ass 
"
2603,"Amazing game (unless if you have a bad device like me and can't process alot of stuff) I recommend this game if you love dinosaurs and survivor games, or Just need a game to grind out and enjoy. :D"
2604,"pretty good survival game
"
2605,Every once in a while I play this game again and remember why I stopped playing in the first place. It also seems like 2/3 of the game is locked behind DLC.
2606,ggod
2607,dinosaurs = cool

2610,Very Enjoyable and entertaining
2611,Awesome
2612,Good game
2613,"very fun, but ridiculous file size and difficult to keep up with online play, better in single player but the game is not really balanced for it."
2614,"full of exploits
"
2615,"The PvE side of things is aight but don't even bother with PvP it is riddled with cheaters, meshers, and losers who pay irl money for bases. Also the Optimization needs so much fucking work it's disgusting. Gen 2 killed this game, if you're thinking of buying this game for nostalgia DON'T the game is genuinely dying very quickly. Just pray Ark 2 is better I guess. The Devs gave up on this game."
2616,
2617,very good
2618,ABSOLUTE DOGWATER OF A GAME
2619,"i like this game, but the cave-exploring to find the artifacts and stuff was very annoying so I didn't do any of that, I just tamed the dinos i wanted and built a house and left."
2620,you can punch dodo bird
2621,"Awesome and fun game, works well with mods"
2622,its worth the money
2623,Cheating needs to be fixed!
2624,balls
2625,"Great game concept and idea, thats pretty much it with the positives. Full of cheaters, racist and toxic players.  Admin abuse on official servers, RMT, aimbot, esp, duping pretty much every expoit you think of is possible. Dont waste your time because lazy enforcement und endless amounts of exploits will ruin your day.

Only buy if you want to play PVE but prepare for super poor server performance. PVP is dead and its pretty much hacker vs hacker at this point. 99% of this is on a lazy studio aka wildcard and bad anticheat"
2626,I love and hate this game at hate same time
2627,Shitters
2628,"was good for a few months in Early Access, then they announced that alot of their new dinos would only be available on their new PAID DLC maps
this destroyed the balance of online pvp and ruined the performance/fps of the game entirely

now the game is over $100 and you dont get half the content (most of which is made by the players at this point)

can still be fun to play in single player but you should NOT be paying for this game ;)"
2629,THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE IN THE WORLD SUBSCRIBE TO 22 potato monkey AND syntac ON YOUTUBE
2630,GOOD
2631,I have slain many dodos and want to harvest penguins next
2632,Love being killed by dinos over and over... lol

2644,Is funny :)
2645,love the game a little laggy sometimes
2646,My dinosaurs can climb vertical cliffs but not a set of stairs. 10/10 would recommend

2648,"tuyệt vời
"
2649,"Personally, I absolutely ADORE this game very much, including all of the unique dinosaurs in it. They are all different and even have their own attacks and dossiers! I love everything but one thing (more of a like for the thing that I'm about to explain) about this game. A minimal amount of the dinosaurs have actually gotten new skin textures or new animations. but what about the others? So many new dinosaurs have been added, but what about the classics? Sure the Raptors, Argentavises, Mammoths, Stegosaurs(...etc) have gotten TLCs, why not others? Lots of people have suggestions, like me! For example, I personally think that the Dilophosaurus, Gigantosaurus, or the Brontosaurus all should have their own TLCs. Anyhow, that's my review."
2650,"Engaging as flip. Survival grind to start, quickly levelling up once a rideable creature is tamed. Exploration of the map is somewhat essential to find certain resources and creatures better bred for specific roles. 
A great community and with mod-creators galore make this an extremely engaging and fulfilling game to play years after release! There are some bugs and graphics/model meshing can leave a little to be desired but the game still more than makes up for this with the possibilities and communal spirit. Whether maintaining a primitive play-through or rearming a Tek fortress whilst breeding your army of *insert fearsome creature of choice here* or stretching your coding skills in developing your own map/mod, Ark can show you another level of involvement and I encourage all to try it, especially with a tribe!"
2651,someone named pearl_harbor was flying in the sky then landed in my base and killed all 6 of my dinos and then my wooden walls all exploded and I was disconnected
2652,amazing
2653,"awesome
"
2654,amazing game better with friends and mods
2655,so much more fun when not alone
2656,"One of the best games I have ever played. Though stressful at times, I find it really enjoyable!"
2657,I MET MY WIFE ON THIS GAME AND NOW WE ARE HAPPILY MARRIED WITH 34 KIDS.
2658,"I decided to review this game after 1500 hours played. In one word: meh. 

The content is pretty good, lots of stuff to do, creatures to tame, breeding mechanics, while very grindy, are second to none. But that's basically all that is good about it. The game is eons old and it's still very very glitchy. Game breaking glitches like getting stuck onto creatures that are attacking you, your character dying for meshing when you're simply close to a wall or rock, full character wipe while teleporting. Etc. I've had situations where I spent months working on a good breed line, raised a full imprinted creature, crafted the best saddle, only for it to be one shot by a lesser creature in a dumb alpha mission in Genesis 2. 

Long story short - don't waste your time. The game isn't good. The developer does not care about player reports, does not police their official servers at all. It's plain and simple a cash grab."
2659,i love killing Dinosaurs :)
2660,ive played over 7000 hrs and i hate it....just playing i love ark

"
2664,full of cheaters and exploiters.. unplayable on online servers.
2665,good
2666,If u play single player be ready to grind this game is gonna consume ur life lol but still very fun
2667,Official is full of cheaters and hackers and the dev team doesn’t seem to care. The game is unplayable and the servers need more policing
2668,"I [i]really, really, really[/i] wanted to like ARK. It's survival mechanics aren't totally awful and can even be tuned to how you want, the progression doesn't feel awfully slow, the dinosaurs are fun as hell, base building (while extremely limited in certain cases) can be enjoyable and even relaxing. 

There are far too many bugs in a supposedly finished game to be excusable. The performance is one of the worst in gaming and that is not the fault of the rig it is the fault of awful optimisation. Multiplayer is a dead concept to me personally because of either cheaters or the influx of a clan of f*ckheads raiding everybody and teabagging them and deleting hours of progress, so sticking to a private server or just singleplayer is the way to avoid a massive headache. The devs are a joke, releasing paid DLC content before the launch out of early access and dedicating time away from actually making the game functionally enjoyable into other endeavours to moneygrab as much as possible.

Over 250GB download and install? Because you refuse to optimise your game?

F*ck off.

4/10. I genuinely wanted this to be good."
2669,dinosour
2670,I like!
2671,dinosaru
2672,the mods
2673,"Ive Played this game since it came out, and have 20k hours on console and ive had tons of fun but since the beigining there has been cheaters and recently it has gotten so much worse. people are able to railgun aimbot over and over again and so many more exploits. And the devs completely neglect there players and continue to focus on the pve side of ark, and working on a new game when they have a amazing game here already the devs continue to neglect the status of official servers and people have to resort to playing mts or other unnoficial servers, or actually cheat themselves to stay competitive to live on smalls and you will most likely get outcheated by someone who has better cheats and dont care bcuz the devs wont ban them. Do not buy this game it isnt worth ur money"
2674,got
2675,Wild Card does Not enforce rules against cheaters. They spend all the money making a Part 2 to a Broken Game. Until they fix Part 1 I will not play Part 2 ..Esp with no 1st person gameplay.  I have 10k hours into ark 1 and love the Game..But the support is really really bad ..Cheaters everywhere not dealth with.
2676,great game
2677,good yes
2678,Full of cheaters that are never addressed. Official is in a broken state
2679,"Playing multiplayer is just too difficult for new player not wanting to join into alpha clans. With some sort of reset it might be alright. When I started playing years ago, there were still server alphas bullying new players, but atleast you had a fighting chance with some c4 and rifles."
2680,"Fun game, very technical.  Super interactive and has a ton of stuff to do.   Quite grindy, but playing on a modded server can eliminate or reduce that to whatever degree you want.  So many options."
2681,This game is full of cheaters and exploiters who gain real money for cheating. I personally would not recommend this game as I have ran into cheaters on multiple occasions and have had the devs do nothing about this. Very bad game in its current state!
2682,I love it too much
2683,great game much buggy
2684,"Good solid survival title, however difficulty is lacking once you tame a flyer. The game essentially becomes trivial. While this is a game I would recommend to everyone, it is far from perfect. Combat is as bad as it gets, extremely janky. PvP is essentially turret warfare.  8.5/10"
2685,y
2686,love
2687,"This game is really fun to play with friends. PvE servers are still PvP servers but instead you're figting for a place to build since people spam pillars, that cannot be broken by you, everywhere. However, in PvP servers, people will kill you no matter what even if you have literally nothing a lot of the time. 

Also steam what do I do if I got the game for free but not the DLCs?"
2688,Developers of the game are making extra money by selling exploits and in game items on discord.
2689,Dinos = Barney = Fun
2690,full of cheaters and admins that do not care / help takes 24hrs to get an answer from a ticket when hours and months of hard work is gone by cheaters. would not recommend my worst enemies to play this... LETS NOT ALL BY ARK 2 CAUSE ITLL BE THE SAME TRASH ADMINS BEHIND IT
2691,"Official PvP Servers on this game are filled with low-lifes that hack the game & raid you from underneath the ground, aimbot, dupe, etc. Do not buy this game if you intend to play PvP official servers. Wildcard Studios (The game devs) don't/won't do anything about it & it's been this way since the game was released in early access. They are the worst dev team I've seen to date when it comes to enforcing their own game rules. Find another game if you're here for official PvP."
2692,This game is full of cheaters. I wouldn’t recommend playing this game unless you play on unofficial servers. But even at that point can’t guarantee there won’t be any cheaters. They need to focus on the game they still have instead of ark 2 especially since they already delayed ark 2.
2693,Wildcard the company who created the game is scum. They are complete sellouts when they got sued they released the whole game for money and ever since then thats all theyve done is release more broken maps. They could care less about what I think or what anyone thinks though. They are just here for the money.
2694,"This game is just neglected in every aspect , from lazy devs and support team too terrible map design . Been Rapant with cheaters for the years and no active devs in the community . All I got to say is cheats are cheaper than the game !!!"
2695,"ITs a great game, If you do host/local and use creztive you can run around and enjoy yourself plus you can forcetame by hitting tab and typing forcetame while looking at what you want to forcetame and hit enter then boom all yours, its rideable intill you cryopod it and pokemon it out, hope this was helpful"
2696,"no

2698,best game ever
2699,it is the best
2700,"[b] Pros [/b]
- Dino hunting/taming game simulator for dino lovers
- Open world exploration (caves, bosses, wildlife & lore)
- Long term content meaning the lore and content take time to be completed (requiring you to acquire good tames to fight 
  bosses to proceed with the lore that connects from many different maps including DLC maps, may take like months)
- DLCs are not priority if you prefer vanilla but if you wish for more lore and content then DLC your way
- Plenty of servers to pick from (Officials and 3rd Party Servers/Host your own)
- If you love challenges, know the fact that even with endgame stuff, you are not invisible. You can still die very easily

[b] Cons [/b]
- If you play on Official, you may struggle trying to find a good spot to build (Beginners love to build on flat land but its 99% taken)
- Every structures have decay time ranging from weeks to months if you stay offline for too long you gonna lose everything
- Beginners gonna struggle a lot trying to not die here because dying is like 90% if you don't have a safe place to respawn
- If you died, all your items will decay in 30/25 mins so make sure you act fast if you have precious stuff in your inventory
- Buggy at times, your tame might just clip into the ground and die or be out of render distance and die or you die
- On Officials (its all I play) you will experience frequent server lag from time to time (reasons could be server saves or players exploiting duping methods)
- If you hate challenges, know the fact that even with endgame stuff, you are not invisible. You can still die very easily
- Momentum in this game sometimes can lead to your own death (jump near a slope and you will gain momentum to your death without bhop)
- If your tame dies, there's no reviving it ever
- You can get very op tames but if you encounter wrong enemy, you will lose everything so bare that in mind
- Breeding takes quite some time and you have to give constant care if you don't have a Maewing (you will know if you google)

I do recommend this game but only because its more entertaining to play with friends. If you solo its gonna be quite a challenge from zero to hero. Struggle together or struggle alone its up to you."
2701,Fun.
2702,rlly fun and enjoyable survival game its one of my top ten games
2703,"I have played around 7500 hours in this game which is 312,5 days so i have been through ups and downs.
The current state of the game especially on the official servers is  very very bad. everyone is hacking ( aimbotting speedhacking godmode esp etc) and the devs dont do anything. do not buy or play this game."

2719,Best Game EVER! Hours of playtime along with mod support for small things like S+ for easier building to things like Primal fear that adds a whole other meaning to Survival.
2720,"i love this game. dont get it, its so bad. unless you play on a server with friends or boost the rates on everything, this game fucking sucks."
2721,the game has memories and if the option of getting the game free had not been then i think i would have still got it
2722,it is fun but also hell
2723,"This game is full of cheaters, exploiting and the Devs do nothing about it.

Fix your dam game."
2724,"Official servers are unplayable, cheaters and exploiters everywhere and the devs do not care one bit. I sent in multiple clips of my base being undermapped and the devs ignored it. Hundreds of hours of work down the drain. They say they will investigate but never do ,the cheaters are still on the server even though I sent clear proof with names and player ids of them under my base. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
2725,"Ark is riddled with cheaters, it has ruined pvp in the game."
2726,l3bh zg
2727,"As of now, I dont play mainly on steam but on windows 10. The game is riddled with hackers. I put countless hours into crossplay official and at the time of typing this. Just hours ago my base was completely wiped with in thirty minutes. Yes, I had turret walls, had turret cap and slot capped them and I still seem to get raided in less than an hour. Please fix the hacking issues within the game. With the state the game is in I wont play it anymore and I suggest any players facing the same issues to do the same until something is actually being done about it."
2728,As someone with 8k hrs across 3 platforms i do not recommend mainly due to the fact the devs are lazy and plain given up on the game it is riddled with hackers and aimbotters speed hackers its nearly unplayable you will run into these hackers daily they do not even get banned anymore and dev support will not help you and will close your tickets without doing anything do not waist your time the devs are banking on Ark 2
2729,This is a game for people who like a challenge

2737,"This game kinda trash ngl. As someone who has 15k hours on multiple accounts, there is not anything about the game that is not broken. If your a pve player, good luck not losing your dinos, bases, or save files every couple of weeks. If you play pvp, expect to be meshed, aimbotted, or play with dupers. Wildcards admins on the official servers either don't exist, or are corrupt. Not worth buying at this point hopefully ark 2 is better."
2738,dinosuar
2739,"aimbotting, meshing, speed hacks, small tribes teaming, in game money trades, corrupt admins. you name a way for a game to be ruined i bet Ark has it. i've played for over 1k hours on ps4 and have collected 600 more hours on pc. Most of these issues have been present since 2016 and have not been resolved. this company cares not for pvp nor their players. This game is truly unique but is plagued with so much cheating it's practically part of the game. This is one of my favourites but i can not recommend it. Take a stand and get the message across to WC."
2740,"the best game ever made after minecraft,wow,lol"
2741,"The Dev's do not care for the PVP player base, watch HOD's recent video on youtube to get the details on how much cheating is done is ARK and why playing is pointless now. Used to be a great game but now its gone to crap. Wildcard needs to address these issues and stop pretending they don't exist."

2746,"Alot of cheating, meshing, even using thinks like meks to mek mesh your base. they have no way to stop collision meshing in the game, only dino they did it with was the giga, when it was the meks that needed it.

they dont care about the pvp part of the game, which honestly is the real survival part of the game, pve is just a zoo typhoon with dinosaurs . but if you like zoo typhoon and dinos this is the game for you, but if you want a legit survival game with players vs player don't come you will just get hit by a mega tribe, or a cheating small tribe on 6v6 servers."
2747,"This Game is so much Fun, I've been playing for years, I love it and I can't wait for Ark 2"
2748,"Everyone loves a good survival, even if you dont like the newer additions like mythical creatures such as griffins you can still play on the island which is all regular dinos.... sorta. its as close as ya gonna get. as if you get bored with regular ark, mod the crap out of it to add creatures such as gods or dragons or dragon gods or gods dragon.... really anything is possible."
2749,"There are a lot of things that I love about Ark. Great lore, interesting worlds.
But the game itself is so so poorly optimised. In general this is hard to work with but in the Gen1/2 maps some of the missions require really finicky handling that is largely not possible with the lag and rubber banding. That is on my own private server which has a low population... It's even worse on the official network.

I sometimes wonder whether the devs actually play their own game on the official network or just on super powered private clusters in their office. Because the mechanics of some of the missions are janky as hell. My entire community got sick of the missions and either quit the game, or i helped them cheat through them.

The official networks PVE are a wasteland of pillars that WC do nothing about. PVP official is full of cheaters. GM enforcement on servers is virtually non-existant. Having played both official PVE and unofficial PVE I would recommend avoiding the official network entirely.

Many many long term bugs that go all the way back to the early access days that remain unfixed. SP worlds resources not respawning. Dinos and/or players not respawning outside after a boss battle. Are some examples.

Oversights and lack of attention to detail. ""Berries"" in the game are all the same colour and are actually ""cantaloupe"". For years the AB Dimorphodon gave birth to normal dimo eggs. Like sure these might seem like small petty things... But they add up and after you see this time after time it begins to change your perspective of the game.

Mod handling by the game is pretty poor. People frequently start their SP games after a mod update to find that their world loaded without one of the mods they were using previously. I have played games that warn and prevent you from loading a save like that and allow you a chance to fix the issue before retrying. The same issue can happen on servers but is rarer... Still though the server should be able to detect its missing a mod and ask what to do.

On the topic of servers the amount of logging available is pitiful. There is very little actionable intelligence on whats occurring in the world to help admins with troubleshooting or enforcement activities.

The server transfer menu in game for unofficial clusters relies on the steam public servers listing filtered down to those with the same cluster ID as your current server. This is a PITA for those who may have issues publishing to steam or otherwise only want a LAN only cluster. The transfer menu should allow you access to LAN and favourites filtered lists so that you can access additional servers.

I could be here all day going through the many issues I have with the game... I guess in summary it just feels like everything in the game is only ever half done."
2750,Dinosaurs are epic

2752,"do not buy this if you do not like a game you have to grind in. This game will take hours to learn, hours to get decent at, and HOURS AND HOURS to learn everything you can do. There is so much to do even without mods. If you have the time, or friends to play with, I highly recommend buying a server for your friends and having a blast."
2753,Nothing but cheaters and admins that do nothing at all.. for about 6 years now..

Wildcard this is your game, and what people will see Ark 2 being.  Get your pocket admins off the servers. No reason someone should be able to give your admins money for shit.  Ark 1 was great, but I know many not going to even try Ark 2 cause of how bad you are currently dropping the ball on Ark 1.  
"
2762,This game is full of cheaters and exploids
2763,game without administration and full of cheaters
2764,loved it
2765,"based
"
2766,"I love this game but so much of it is unplayable. Cheaters meshing an exploiting the game. 

On console the amount of blue screens on “paid” maps is horrendous an P+ doesn’t work lest last time I attempted it."
2767,Game is one of the best on the market. 11/10 will keep playing.
2768,great game! highly recommend! you are able to cheat and glitch under the map while  making a living off of selling resources to other people
2769,Very good game i like it because its very fun to play with my friend pera.
2770,"Minor annoyances fixed made it much better. Difficult game at times, but i prefer that cuz it feels like you actually accomplish something when you succeed. progression makes sense."
2771,ass but addicting
2772,"the most horrible game ive ever played with the amount of glitches, bugs, cheating and the horrible toxicity of other players with no sign of admins stepping up to fray the cheaters or fix the glitches."
2773,have a good pc
2774,love the game hate the micro-raptors
2775,"Nice anti-cheat
"
2776,"tons of cheaters, devs dont care about their game anymore"
2777,at first my ark wouldnt work but after i wiped my pc it worked and i have around 2k+ hours on xbox so i do suggest coping this game : )
2778,"Great game, but cheaters everywhere. If the developers fixed this it would be amazing.
Starting out is better, once you get all the tech its not as fun. Large clans ruin the game."
2779,Game is full of cheaters has no admins patrolling live servers DO NOT PLAY IF YOU GRIND THIS GAME people will just come and mesh your base everything you worked for gone. Poor map designs I have over 2000 hrs on Xbox ark and nothing seems to get fixed from these devs either play 50x harvest unofficial so you don’t grind at all and everything you lose from cheaters won’t really matter please don’t not play this game.
2780,Official servers are full of cheaters!
2781,"Absolutely stunning gameplay, graphics and pve. Haven't tried pvp but I've heard it isn't as nice, but even without it I'd still recommend the game!"
2782,Ive played a lot more hours on xbox before i played on steam and there are just so much hackers in all official servers and it just makes people not want to play. Arkpocalypse is a very popular server but its full of cheaters.
2783,Nice anti-cheat
2784,Official pvp is full of cheaters trading for real world money. Dev team says it's fixed with a minute skim through. When the way to play is cheating it ain't fun. Ark 2 will be the same
2785,"This game is the best I've ever played.
I have met so many friends with it and had amazing times.
The amount of liberty and possibilities is crazy.
However, I cannot recommend it in its current state.
There are tons of cheaters and exploiters on the Official servers and the response times from the game studio that manages those servers can range from 12-24h to no answer at all.
I will change my review to positive if Wildcard shows some care for their current game but I doubt they will.
Regards."
2786,"The Official server network is full of cheaters which makes it unplayable, would be a great game if they would do something about the cheating.
"
2787,"I love this game, but its full of cheaters. Wildcard fix your shit"
2788,"Talk about tedious! So. Much. GRIND!!!
On the plus side this game made me realize I dont actually want to play a grindy survival game that doubles as a full time job."
2789,i love to play this game it keeps me busy the grind is real but worth it. The only thing that bugs me is that it sometimes crashes do to a error for the game file. I have tried to find a work around on this game but havent found one yet
2790,"I mean, Dinos"
2791,cheaters everywhere. don't bother buying if your intention is pvp. ark 2 is going to suck
2792,Cheaters make this game unplayable
2793,They need to address the cheaters. Aimbot and ESP are making the game unplayable.
2794,"Allthough i have spent most of my time during Covid playing and enjoying this game, the state of official pvp is ath the lowest it has ever been. The amount of cheaters aimbotters meshers and other things really makes this game un playable, admins say they will fix the issue but it goes unsolved. A simple removal of the Tek Railgun would make it so ur safe in ur base so youre not getting shot through the mesh.  Ark is ahead of its time and  everyone realizes this, which makes it such an enjoyable game to play. I recently switched to Unofficial servers which ive been having fun on, but its not like the official servers that i have grown to love, but now hate."
2795,This game is full of cheaters and exploiters
2796,The official servers are a mess right now. Cheaters number has been increased unbelievably and Wild Card isn't doing anything about it.
2797,awsome but if you get it on steam you can not play with your friends on xbox
2798,good game 10/10 because when dino die their dead body ragdoll
2799,good game
2800,Dinosaurs go brrrrr.Game has dinos what else do you need
2801,i mean it has dinos
2802,Full of cheaters and exploiters which makes the game unplayable. Its been like this for the past 2 years.
2803,its gud game
2804,"Cheaters Ruin Game, Fix."
2805,Too many cheaters
2806,Game is full of cheaters lol R.I.P ARK
2807,Lots of cheaters and terrible enforcement of their official servers
2808,"GAME IS BROKEN!! Admins and alpha tribes work hand in hand to work against you when you’ve paid your money for something that quite frankly is exploited to the point of extorting the other players for powerful base positions to force legit players from their maps!!! Don’t buy this game, it’s broken in single player as well!!"
2809,I LOVE ARK GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2810,fun
2811,cheaters
2812,nice
2813,"They need to fix official servers, unplayable with the railgun aimbot."
2814,great
2815,dinos go brrrrrrrrrrrr
2816,I think this is a very good game based on graphics and Gameplay.
2817,Good Game
2818,123123
2819,"i got over 6k hours on ps4 and on pc 126 so i have a little knowledge about the game, i just cant reckomend it, it got too many mesher cheaters and dupers and the devs dont want to do anything about it.

very sad to see a good game go bad just because the devs are to lazy to do anything against cheater and mesher."
2820,"This game... what a wonderful idea and amazing game. however...

this game is amazing at first glance until you really divulge into it, there are so many exploits/cheats YEARS after release and almost the bare minimum support as they are working a NEW GAME which wont be any better in my opinion, the wildcard team doesnt have enough staff to enforce rule breaks among the official servers which is where ive spent a major amount of time, as there is still people that mesh your base and still people that can railgun you through walls so you cannot defend your said base as they wipe you off the map, and then meanwhile theyre using duplicated dinosaurs and gear to do so, the game is going downhill more now than ever, the cheats get worse and worse and the devs seem to not care as they made the game FREE for a week+ so any cheaters can have 1200+ accounts now and just cheat as much as they want because if they do so happened to get banned on one account the other 1199 will do just as much good. and this all funds their agenda, because the cheats are expensive, hundreds of dollars to buy cheats so they are able to afford this because there a hundreds of discord servers which people sell ingame items for real money which is the entire lore for cheaters because they can make money off exploiting anyone who wants to try and play legit, and dont get me wrong you can try to play legit for a certain amount of time but it wont last... may ark RIP"
2821,the fact that I got this for free and now its 16 dollars makes me feel proud HAHuwdh also yes very cool dino game brrrr
2822,"I have 1306 hours in game. Steam asks would i recommend this game?

Yes. yes i would."
2823,"Full of exploits,map meshing, and cheats oh and don't forget the admin abuse and pay to win on dedis."
2824,full of cheaters
2825,"Iam playing for a long time now and on the official servers it not worth to play 1 hour. You built up and a Aimbotter pulls up, people are meshing caves and just destroyed 100 or 1000 hours of playtime in seconds. The game is full of cheating at the moment and you can play only on privat servers if you want to have fun. Its a really good game but with no Staff or aktiv admins its not worth to play."
2826,I switched to console ark because of how many aimbotters there are on PC
2827,cool game but dont go near the alpha raptors got my shi rocked
2828,"dog game its actually shit dont buy it buggy ass piece of shit
"
2829,"I have played this game for 1,000 hours on Xbox and 200 on PC. This game can be fun and it has its moments. However, this game after 7 years is still extremely clunky and buggy. Most of my time was spent on Official PvP servers. You have to treat this game as a hardcore survival game because you will never survival unless you've been playing for years and are in an alpha tribe. The latest dlc genesis part 2 makes the game mind numbingly easy. It makes it easier for you to start. but it also makes it infinitely easier for bigger tribes to farm a ludicrous amount of top tier weapons to wipe you. The only, and I mean only, way to survive even just a little bit is to hide. 

The game balance was and still is stupidly broken. You have to buy the dlc to be on somewhat of a level playing field. If not you will be locked out of powerful dinos and resources. These developers literally sold a dlc with one of the most powerful dinos locked away WHILE STILL IN EARLY ACCESS. I will give some credit as they do bring it free maps implemented from mods, but there is always a paid map with newer better things so they free players are always behind.

Any turrets you make are useless so don't waste your time. These tribes have existed so long that they have bred dinos with 200k health and farmed 120 armor saddles. They have vaults worth of tames to soak your base. You can make explosives so easy its not even funny. Anyone that knows what they are doing can have c4 in under 2 hours with enough to foundation wipe a base. You can never go toe to toe you must fight like a guerilla. Hidden with a small enough base to stay off the radar. This also becomes a problem as you need space to breed and place indy forges, indy cookers, and tek replicators. You hit a ceiling and if you build up any more you are on limited minutes. It is just a matter of time before someone comes to destroy. It's no joke its so easy to raid that people will scour the map looking for something to raid as they've already raided everything else. Ark allows transfer of servers so there will always be people visiting looking to raid. 

The PvP is awkward and clunky. It is nice to see the different builds people make. You can go all in on melee and one hit people with clubs. Most people focus movement speed so it just a bunch of midgets running around trying to bola one another. Bow and arrows have some of the worst hit registration I've seen in a game to date. You watch the arrows stack up in the body but zero actual hits and damage. A lot of times you end up fighting someone with God tier armor and your primitive weapons will do practically nothing. Most of the dino PvP is flyers which is mostly who can pick each other off the tame first. Unless you are fighting a managarmr which completely breaks PvP shooting a freeze breath instantly killing any other tame. Land dino PvP is rare and usually its only late game dinos unless you are messing around with noobs. Ocean PvP is almost non-existant except for boat PvP which is so glitchy you can just drive into any enemy boat jump and phase through the walls and kill the driver. This only happens on Ragnarok because someone at Wildcard had the bright idea to add a giant whale, aggressive only to rafts. 2 hits it, adds it to every map except Ragnarok, and there is nothing you can do about it. 

The aforementioned paragraphs pertain to regular players being able to screw you, but that doesn't scratch the surface. The game is full of cheaters. If you think you can hide, think again people have an esp that tells them exactly what things are where so just pray you are out of range of those cheater. Aimbot is super common, the tek railgun can shoot through literally anything so cheaters can box themselves in a metal paracer and shoot into someone base without any fear. People will mesh outside the map and build and there is nothing you can do to raid them. I've submitted reports on player meshing with video proof and coordinates, everything so they are dead to rights only to get a response days later saying they'll look into it and nothing happened to them. I think there are supposed to be game admins but as far as I'm concerned they don't exist. It is even worse because they game never wipes and so everything these people accumulate they keep. Ark allows you to transfer servers so they can take their stuff to other servers and trade with anyone. Can you guess what happens? The cheaters and I suppose alpha tribes. but they may as well be synonymous with cheaters, have so much they can sell their goods for real money. There are Facebook groups and Discord servers of these tribes selling tames, structures, ammo, you name it. It incentivises cheaters to protect their position to keep selling.  This game is practically a job to get anywhere, but some people make this their job. Ark has been out for years and they are releasing a new game and still don't have control of Ark.

The only thing I can recommend is the single player. Which unfortunately has a tether between anyone who joins you, Unless you get another pc to host the server. The unofficial servers are usually have boosted rates and have active admins. However, some of the admins are biased and some servers sell you things making them pay to win anyway. PvE may be fun I've never tried it, some people may build where you want and may block off resources. Less stressful than PvP and you also will need to get on regularly to prevent decay. 

Ark is fun building big bases and progressing. Albeit at a very slow rate. All of the hundreds of dinos are interesting and have their own quirks. It is unlike any other game. It is also unlike any other game with its atrocious game design/balance, lack of support, ridiculous grind, and greed."
2830,dinos
2831,It's a great game to play when you hate your life :)
2832,"I have many hours on this game across many platforms and I can still say that it is a great game but it is deteriorating. Between the 50s 100s of hours you put in and losing everything overnight due to meshing, slow admin response, blatant cheating, so called ""solved"" tickets, it is not worth the play."
2833,game
2834,so much hacking and meshing and exploits
2835,"game is full of bugs, meshing, aimbotters, devs wont fix any of it... stay away"
2836,"ARK is truly a game of its generation, but sadly it has suffered badly from exploiting and cheating.

If you want to play PVE and have a fun experience taming and playing with all of the creatures that Ark has to offer, then this is a fantastic game.

Sadly the PVP mechanics create a massive inventive for Real Money Trades, which has created a huge black market which incentivises cheating, exploits and all-manner of hacks. Sadly, the policing strategy from the in-game GMs is very lacking.

Last month, we lost a 2-year-old base to infinite railgun hackers that could float inside of the mesh. The architecture of the character and transfer system means there is no paper-tail for the cheaters.

I truly doubt there will be another game that matches Ark's PVP in terms of its creativity, flexibility, but it is savagely undermined by the RMT market and lack of policing."
2837,dino
2838,"This game on the official servers is currently full of cheaters using speed hacks, aim botting, Meshing and other exploits. Most people pay for all of their boss fights engrams. People sell tames and bases for actual money that have stats so high no new player could ever win a fight against. The Devs barely do anything to police their own servers and protect the players who actually try and play their game legit. Single Player can still be Fun and there are still fun mods but new players should ignore official servers."
2839,"Offical is full of cheaters, meshers, botters, and just full of exploits its not fun and wont be playing until they fix it. I have more hours on Windows/Xbox then I do on Steam Ark and to no surprise its got more botters and cheaters then steam does."
2840,I stopped playing online because of all the cheaters.  Such a shame as this was my favorite game.
2841,"An amazing game... if you play single player. Go online into any server and you'll be greeted with real life trading (selling of base spots/resources/dino lines) and cheaters who are paid real life money to defend alpha tribes, their money making business partners and will just spin bot you with a rail gun or speed hack through your defences and just wipe you.

game with all its bugs and issues 8/10
online moderation/online game player 1/10."
2842,a
2843,"I don't normally do reviews and that but this game is a bloody joke I've played this game on and off for years an the cheating /meshing is just out of hand 

And if your new game ark 2 is gonna be anything like this game I won't even waste my money on it"
2844,cheaters and exploiting. no support
2845,"Having played on the PlayStation servers since release, it has been and will always be full of cheaters.  Have found the PC servers absolutely worse so stopped playing it all together. I do not think that Ark 2 will be any better, Wildcard has not learnt anything over the years."
2846,"This is an amazing game, it's full of depth, it's great fun.  But currently unplayable on official due to cheating.  Essentially if you want to play the game, without having all of your stuff take, you have to cheat.  And Wildcard support will do nothing to help."
2847,Do not play on the official networks if you wanna have to deal with cheaters. Should be well known on the veteran sides but for new players dont expect anything out of the official networks. Go play unoffical for relatively good support. Change something wildcard!
2848,This game is full of exploiting. This game is full of cheaters. This game is unplayable.
2849,Ridiculous amount of exploiting and cheating. Official pvp servers are unplayable.
2850,"Disgusting, full of cheaters, admins are corrupted, big content creators have their own pocket admins, official servs are unplayable, the only way to play is the populars unoffil servers plagued with ""whitelist"", ""vips"" and so on"
2851,Not game.
2852,addictive
2853,unplayable full of cheaters
2854,its really good
2855,Ive played this game for 7 years and its my favorite game. The cheating and exploiting has gotten so bad that the game is unplayable on official servers. You have to result to unofficial run servers because there admin team enforces the code of conduct better than the developers ever will. Great game destroyed by dev neglect.Do not purchase this game.
2856,"i love playing ark, but there are a lot of cheaters and no admins to take care of this issue.
its sad to waste a lot of time of your life on this game  just so some cheater can come  and end it in 1 hour .
there is a lot of maps for the game but there is no place to hide because people use cheat to find you and you base in every location if you love play solo it's impossible to play it.
"
2857,was a great game for the first year but after a few years it seams wildcard abandoned the gamers and and started almost befriending the hackers and cheaters. so a message to wildcard you are a disappointment. its really sad that every single server has a hacker online 24/7 with no risk of being banned but the good players get bans all the time for smaller offences like being toxic and such. I loved this game until the makers abandoned us all
2858,Exploring and cheating destroyed game devs don’t reply for 3 days
2859,"The game is full of Cheaters, official servers are unplayable because of that and the dev support is just closing tickets without doing anything..."
2860,"10k + hrs on ps4, switched to pc and official pvp is unplayable with all the hackers, meshing, and people selling in game items for real money. The DEVS dont care about the community also"
2861,"PVE: it's fine overall, and really the only way to enjoy this.
PVP: this game is literally fully of cheaters and players breaching ToS (likely some of the official moderation team contributing or it's hella coincidental)."
2862,"CHEATERS
Full
"
2863,"This game is so full of hackers, aimbotters, exploiters, cheaters, whatever you can think of, there is someone somewhere doing it in this game, and not on a small scale but very large. The Official servers (only servers I actually enjoy) is unplayable, quite literally, the amount of servers that are being Ddossed is insane. Some weapons and dinosaurs are just completely unbalanced and others are just point dead useless. The amount of real life currency markets out there for this game gives the cheaters incentive to continue cheating. The Devs are actually useless, no joke, there is absolutely no point in playing PvP."
2864,great game
2865,"Do not waste your time playing on official PVP servers ,they are full of cheaters.

On the other hand if you are a cheater then jump right in ,you will love it ....no admins to police the servers and also you can make real life money for your for you real life bank account, way more than what it cost to buy this game on steam.

Support H.O.D !

2866,full of cheaters
2867,full of hackers cheaters
2868,"Full of cheaters and exploiters on offical, reports are ignored game is unplayable"
2869,"Full of cheaters, developers refuse to fix their game. ARK 2 is gonna be a disaster."
2870,Game full of cheaters and bags. i don't recommend it at all
2871,"The game itself is something that I feel has been missing from Prehistoric themed games for a while, with a lot of custom settings and mods to make the game replayable and fresh even after hours of game time. Even without those things, it is a game that is hard to put down and will see you eating away a lot of hours without realising.

It must be said, when playing with mods, be wary that adding more than a few will cause he games loading times to increase drastically sometimes up to 20+ minutes."
2872,Fuck this game
2873,"full of cheaters just ruins the game, a complete waste of my time"
2874,good game
2875,Game is full of exploiters very unoptimized wouldn't recommend
2876,It is incredibly easy to use cheating mechanics in this game and the dev support is terrible
2877,"Full of f uckin Cheaters now and PTW, Devs dont do anything about the game to fix it, always meet with the same reply, "" were looking into it "" when reporting in tickets about cheaters. Not worth your money or specially your time as you get exploited so easy !!!!"
2878,"This game is pretty much just who cheats harder faster. It's riddled with ESP, Aimbotting, Duping, and Real-Money Trading. Honestly I'd say its an amazing game (you can tell because I have 10K+ hours) but when you can lose hundreds of hours to ppl not playing legit its just not worth it."
2879,14k hrs review games full of cheaters . but its not like the devs care/do anything
2880,"The core is the best game ever made. Hands down no other game can addict you and make you feel the satisfaction that comes with this game. But the game is overrun with cheaters, aimbot and duped suits, speedhacked dinos on every server, people making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from out-of-game transactions with no regulation or involvement from the devs. This game is a joke, dont waste your time."
2881,This game is full of cheaters exploiting on the official network it is unplayable and not policed enough!!! aware!.
2882,best game
2883,Perfect game for chill and even pvp actions
2884,Addicting as hell. Don't play unless you have copious amounts of free time. I love this game but its too late for me. Save yourself from the addiction while you still can.
2885,I CAN SAVE MY GAME
2886,gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
2887,Full of cheaters and negligent disregard by admins/developers to even solve it.
2888,Games been broken since release cheaters running wild. is even worse today admins and devs don't give two shits ark 2 is your main focus even though the first is omega broken. good work lol.

2905,"ark (in my opinion) is a very fun game its range of different maps, bosses, raids, etc. Is amazing its fun to just relax with friends. I would highly suggest playing this game."
2906,"Love this game, been here since the beginning."
2907,ark is fun but adding mods makes it way better!
2908,"Can be a grind, but still fun as fuck. If you have some free time to sink in, look up some guides online and get started. Can be very rage inducing, but also just as fun"
2909,"tame dodo

2910,Awesome!!!
2911,"Great game for those who had that childhood love of dinosaurs. I'll admit it lost a bit of that ""dino survival game"" luster when the more alien-like content started to be released, but with mods or Primitive Plus that isn't much of an issue. Game can be a little buggy and the physics can get a little weird but honestly it adds to its charm. Don't have a lot of hours on PC but I've been with the game since early access. (I'm talking before the titanosaur was released. Look it up.) Definitely recommend if your into survival games."

2927,"bad game. It doesn't work when making online games with your friends such as non-dedicated servers. I have wasted my money and now i have to have money in my steam wallet and not my card, also you cannot play with people on xbox if you do not have the microsoft version."

2947,"8/10 a bit buggy and a little grindy but other than that a great game
• Amazing maps to explore
• Build epic bases
• Play in either pvp or pve
• Tame epic dinos
"
2948,"Hard to Learn but with all the tool available now (like youtube) should be too difficult to learn them if you put in the time. I love the game and the Mods make it even better also, with the ability on Transferring your Character and/or you mounts (tame pets) the playability on this game increases 100 fold compare to other games that do not allow it. It is a must play in my opinion."

2957,"Create your flawlessly imperfect beach bob, short stubby legs, arms longer than the rest of your body, and a big bobble head. Spawn into one of many huge maps, start on the beach or spawning area of your choice, and get eaten by a pack of raptors. Re-spawn in a different area, start building your base by punching some trees, picking up rocks and destroying the local environment. Build a thatch shack and get killed in bed whilst you're offline by a T-Rex. After a few dozen hours, you're getting the hang of this, you've got some Dino's, and then lose everything to a Giga finding you. Make some friends with others online, tame said Giga, build a  huge fortress with your tribe with enough room for your army. It's time to take on the boss, aaaand everything's dead.... Ark isn't a game you can relax playing, it can be punishing early on, much like many games in the survival genre. At a low level the game really is more about surviving. As you progress though your experience, you'll become more obsessed with better stats in your creatures,taming newer, stronger dinos, breeding new and stronger versions with the perfect genetic line, and building that mega base that causes the server to lag. Every. Single. Minute. Worth it. The anger from getting a tame killed, being ambushed by Giant Scorpions, or mistakenly hitting [E] key and dismounting off your Pteranadon and falling to your death. You'll re-spawn and keep wanting to get further, the challenge and dopamine reward for getting past that point is what you'll strive for. Take on Land, Air, and Sea, conquer all that ark has to offer and ascend... and that's just PvE. There's still a whole server full of new problems in PvP."

On the other hand there are soooo many bugs. I obviously do not let them stop me."
2996,Fatal Error every ten minutes! Get it together!
2997,"Hey, Listen, you will have to invest a lot of time in this game, of course at first the price of this game will keep you away, but if you buy it, and catch the part of the game, you will love this game more and more, you will not notice how you are already spend every day hr's in this game, you find new friends, get rage from bugs, but the time you spend in this game is worth it, of course it will not be always fun, sometimes you will have rages, but it will worth it, I suggest to buy this game if you have nerves and time to spend :)
+ This game improves your thinking (you start to think creatively, how to build things, etc.)
i love this game, and i suggest u to play this game too :D (maximum u will get rage and break the keyboard or the mouse :)"
2998,This is about a dumb fuck stupid shit excuse for a god damn game if there every was one. What a waste of money and time. The beginner experience has got to be the worst piss poor excuse for a game I've ever seen in my life and I've been playing since the NES was new and cool. Who ever rolled this piece of dung out should never be allowed to make another game as long as they live.

3004,I think this is a great and fun game that i can play for hours but i normally have to play single player because once i have friends join non dedicated maps or i try to play online official servers my 800$ acer laptop gets many lag spikes and sometime will crash the game. i highly recommend using a tower pc. from what ive seen tower pc can handle the game 50 times better
3005,Good
3006,"This game now has DLC in DLC. the Devs still keep making terrible DLC's instead of working on bugs that have yet to be fixed. Somehow has Season Pass inception . With the few DLC's people would want to buy individually are locked behind the Season Pass now. 

At this point i only play this game to remind myself why i hate it."

3025,a good game a bit bugy.
3026,"DO NOT PLAY OFFICIAL, play modded.. Catch dinosaurs like pokemon, make them do the do, get their babies to crush your enemies!
"
3027,"At first youll get killed every 10 minutes. But after 100 hours of constant death, you will start enjoying this game and get super addicted (trust me lol, i probably have over 300 hours on steam+epic games and im continuing to play and havent even killed a single boss...)"
3028,"I like this game, it is fun and has some cool ideas and mechanics. The singleplayer is fun but with friends is better. PvE is nice but in big servers all the land gets taken up in the nice spots, not a huge complaint! I was really excited to play the PvP but was actually really disappointed with that aspect, only part I didn't like. I put several hours each into about 5-6 different PvP servers and generally you just run around punch people alone with ur fists/club/axe. It defeats the whole purpose of the game which is to develop these new materials and dinos, I wish there was a middle ground where people fought but actually built a tribe up somewhat. There is only tribes with no fighting (PvE), or solo running around punching people while children wail over the mic (PvP). There doesn't seem to be anything in between where tribes will form and actually go to war, the closest I have seen to that is one tribe asked another to tear down someones base when the people there went offline so they could build there instead. If you are looking for a tribal or even group PvP this is not the game for you, if you are looking for a unique survival game and have some friends also interested then this is totally for you.

Also if anybody knows servers that ARE like this please let me know, and yes I have tried normal, small tribes, conquest, etc. I am also not shitting PvP it is fun at times to punch everyone and I get people will like it, but this is my opinion on my review."
3029,The game is good on PC but straight trash on console. Do not expect any help from devs or support as they are equally as bad.
3030,"Overall a good game. However, it does require a lot of time and the servers aren't necessarily optimised for bigger bases. but it is still  a lot of fun"
3031,"This game is good when you are playing with friends in pve private servers but then when you think you're good enough to try public pvp servers you join a good tribe that wont troll you but then you join another tribe and build a big base give them good gear and then they betray you and thats why pvp is 0/10 and dont you dare join if you have under 100 hours cuz you will get trolled by some admin abuser or a player that pretends not to have anything but actually has tek gear and will betray you after you sit over 12 hours and grind so that you can build a base and thats why public servers are more trash than sakura

3042,good game
3043,"This is an unhealthy relationship waiting to happen..


Its an amazing survival crafting game with unforgiving and brutal gameplay.  Its main feature of dinosaurs could leave you either happy or down right angry. There are how ever bugs that have been in the game and broken game mechanics since launch that haven't changed.

Pros:
beautiful graphics
nice progressions system
nice amount of things to craft
nice variations of materials to collect and use to craft with
different worlds to transport or teleport to

Cons:
random spawns are not new player friendly. IF you die be for making a base with a bed or bedroll, you could find some where else on the map after dying. Some people like this, I particularly do not.

With procedural or randomly generated dino spawns you could find your self on a spawn or that of your base being near a spawn and not know it. Now imagine if said spawn was 100 levels higher than you. This is not fun then.


OVERALL:
8/10 at its base price of 19.99 its worth the money playing with friends."

Its really fun because you can tame dinos and explore around the world!!! You can also play with your friends and have a great laugh! If you die, you can get your stuff back, witch I find very useful. There is a crafting menu that tells you what you need to collect to make the item, and as you level up, you unlock more items. This game also has GREAT graphics! I would give this game a solid 9.5/10 and would recommend it to ages 7+ (as you can disable the blood) Worth the money!"

3084,"I've had a lot of great times in this game.  Playing with friends on a dedicated server is the way to go.  Playing by yourself you're probably looking at 250+ hours before you fight you first boss.  Unfortunately a lot of that time isn't doing anything fun.  It's grinding or breeding your dinos, which is pretty bland.  Stick to playing with friends and you'll enjoy yourself a ton.  I'm looking forward to ARK 2."
3085,"ARK is an amazing game that is fun to explore, but it tends to be very buggy and laggy. I would definitely recommend buying either ARK or ARK II when it comes out as I expect there will not be as many bugs."

3090,"I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.

But playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend."
3091,It's like if Cosby was in Jurassic Park
3092,"good game
"
3093,"I have been playing this game for years, starting on Xbox. As a game itself, it is very well put together and fun with friends. However, be prepared to have no life when you play official, six man, conquest, etc. They require too much time for a average working person. With that being said, ark in P v E or modded makes a great experience for a chill, but at times thrilling game play."

PS. The bed in ark is very comfy uwu"

3152,"Don't get me wrong, ARK Is an amazing game, however due to the amount of bugs, it is not worth the £15.49 ($18) that it is. Granted, you can get around this with a dedicated server, however most servers cost £8+ ($10) per month. Apart from multiplayer though, i have nearly no issues, and think it is worth it, however please save your money by not buying this game if you plan on playing with your friends, and don't have enough money to throw at the problem."
3153,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

3163,"I'm nowhere near finishing any map on this game, however I can safely say that it's a lot of fun, if you have 2tb worth of disk space. The designs, despite mostly being great, lack accuracy in some places, but the game isn't trying to be accurate so doesn't matter, the lore of the game is interesting, even if I don't know all of it, the game will get a bit grindy in the late game though."

3165,"[h1](Dino's)[/h1] 4/5
Ark is a game that has become a little bloated over time. The number of dinosaurs has grown over the years to the point that I'm not sure it's possible to own a breeding pair of every single one anymore. At least if they aren't cryopod'd.(Ark's version of a Pokeball.)While most dinosaurs have a use of some kind, even if it's.. questionable, a lot of them feel like they are just there to be there. 
[hr][/hr]
[h1](Environment) [/h1]2/5
The environment on Ark offers zero challenge outside of stuff like temperature. If you wear the right clothes or ride, you'll be fine more or less. Instead Ark hinges on making wild dinosaurs and other players the true danger, which again if you wear the right gear, are basically not a threat.
[hr][/hr]
[h1](Building and Crafting) [/h1] 3/5
Building is time consuming but also one of Ark's best features - if you can piece it together correctly. You really just need to experience it for yourself. Crafting on the other hand is resource intensify and will likely have you farming for materials for hours just to finish a single project in the late game. It's a chore.
[hr][/hr]

As far as the online play goes, The community is as toxic as you'd expect and bigger tribes will routinely wipe new groups just to keep their status more often than not. PVE servers don't fare much better, with most of the official servers being pillar locked. Private servers and single player/tethered co-op are your only options.

3180,"[b] Game is Meh when you play alone [/b]
[b] But Night Sky Jelly is Great when you make alone [/b]

[Night Sky Jelly]
Lemongrass butterfly pea tea bag...2 bags 
Water...300ml
Sugar...30g 
Bamboo charcoal powder...1 tsp 
Sheet gelatin 6g

[Night Sky Jelly liquid 2]
Water...300ml 
Sugar...30g 
Sheet gelatin 6g
Blue curacao syrup…a little

[Lemon sauce]
Lemon juice... 1 tablespoon 
Honey... 3 tablespoons

*Lemon sauce is optional. Please enjoy your meal.

Advance preparation
Dissolve bamboo charcoal powder in a small amount of water.

1. Make Night Sky Jelly liquid. Soak the gelatin in cold water for about 1 minute.
2. Put 300ml of water in a small pot and when it boils, turn off the heat and add a lemongrass butterfly pea tea bag to extract the tea leaves. Wait a few minutes for the color to appear.
3. Scoop the tea leaves, put a small amount of bamboo charcoal powder dissolved in sugar and water over the heat, dissolve and mix.
4. Add the softened sheet gelatin and mix until it dissolves, then cool with ice water.
5. Put half the amount of jelly liquid in a container and leave it at room temperature, pour the other half into the mold and cool it in the refrigerator until it hardens.
6. Make Night Sky Jelly liquid 2. Put water and sugar in a small pan and heat to dissolve. Add the softened gelatin sheets and mix until dissolved, then cool with ice water.
7. Pour the blue curacao syrup into the container from Step 5, add 100ml of Night Sky Jelly Liquid 2, pour into the mold, and chill in the refrigerator until it hardens.
8. Pour the remaining Night Sky Jelly into the mold and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours until it hardens.
9. Remove from the mold and apply edible silver foil. Serve with lemon sauce if desired.

It is recommended to add black pigment such as bamboo charcoal powder to add depth to the color.
If the jelly in the first and second layers hardens too much, it will split."

Worth it, very rewarding game, can be a challenge but worth it. Only critique is the building system is very sub par. Compared to valheim or other similar games, its a very frustrating and clunky system. Can still build, youtube videos attest to this, but is difficult to do"

3231,"I got this game for free and I still want my money back.

ARK is a broken, repetitive, horribly unoptimized mess of a game that somehow looks even worse than it plays. The graphics are an absolute eyesore, the UI and controls are embarrassingly bad, the progression is yawn-inducting, and you can forget about any kind of explanation, guidance or even just a general attempt to explain what's going on or how to play. This is, of course, without even mentioning the astonishingly awful technical state the game is in, with so many bugs, glitches and crashes that it often becomes unbearable.

Even if you *do* somehow manage to see beyond all this crap, you'll quickly discover that when it comes to actual gameplay... ARK has practically nothing to offer. The first few hours (and I mean in the single digit) may hold some value as you explore and (very clunkily) engage with the basic game loop (find creature, knockout creature, kill or tame, repeat), but even this wears off very quickly as you discover that there's actually very little to do after that. Within mere hours you'll be at the point where your gear beats any creature, your base is unbreakable, and any resemblance of a challenge is officially gone. Now what? Nothing. That's ARK for you, pretty much. Sorry, were you expecting more? We don't do this here - it requires effort. Meh.

What about PvP, you ask? Goodness gracious. I won't get too far into the details as there are other reviews explaining it better than I ever could, but to summarize: if capitalism came in the form of a really, really bad video game, it would be ARK PvP. Unless you're slaving yourself as part of a big alpha tribe, or give up everything else in your life to grind this trash without stopping, you will not get anywhere. You'll be stomped on, destroyed, and probably even peed on. Unless you're really into being humiliated constantly (a kink is a kink I guess?), I cannot possibly see how any of the people who designed this experience thought it will be enjoyable. You know, the thing that a game is suppose to be: fun. Not a painful chore with zero reward other than more chores and possibly a headache. It's just not fair, was never designed to be fair, and the developers couldn't care less that it's not fair.

There are far, far better survival games out there than this sad excuse of a game, which nullifies any remaining reason to justify buying this crap. Games that put at least some sort of effort into improvement and a better player experience. Games that look better, play better, or offer a better experience in general. Games where the graphics don't make you want to poke your eyes out, or where the gameplay cannot be summed up as ""the shittiest pokemon clone you've ever paid too much for"". Games where there's a proper onboarding experience, with actual thought and consideration put into the UI and the controls, with a better planned end game, and with a tech stack that is more than a bunch of memory leaks taped together. Games that make the player feel respected, not an afterthought to the bottom line.

But not wildcard, no. For a game with over half a decade on the modern gaming market, you'd think that for how commercially successful this game is, they would at least *try* to make a better impression, let alone fix their shit or balance it out. Funny, but no. There is none of that, yet players keep handing over their money regardless of how much they're spat on. Sadly, we are well beyond the days in which consumers would rile up and protest such blatant garbage daring to give itself a price tag. The people buy, and the developers are laughing in our face all the way to the bank. Voting with your wallet is not a thing anymore.

ARK is not just a bad game; it's yet another example for everything that is wrong in today's gaming industry: underwhelming, overpriced, and soulless - all without a single drop of shame, nor, sadly, consequences. A hastily cobbled-together idea, marketed as something it's not, then kept as a bare-minimum disappointing experience with the one purpose of being milked dry to the last drop. There are very few games out there that make one feel like their very intelligence is insulted by playing them, but hey, this nightmare needs to have *something* going on for it, right?

Don't bother. You're better off getting an actual day job. At least there they pay *you* to disappoint you constantly and require your attention for the vast majority of the day, not the other way around."

3240,"The game is glitchy, unplayable trash. I have no problems getting wrecked and killed due to my own incompetence or lack of planning, not due to constant glitching, crap AI pathfinding for your dino's constantly getting caught behind a rock or tree and you have to keep going back to shepherd them into the fold again, which wastes time and aggros stalking carnvores. The building mechanics are absolute trash. Such a good game with so much potential wasted by laziness of the devs who refuse to address of fix even the most basics faults. Will never waste another minute. Conan is far superior."

3262,"I do enjoy this game, but because of its faults, I cannot recommend it to new players. The patience required to sit through Ark for a significant period of time is not worth what you get out of it. Ark is a buggy, poorly optimized mess, and the only way to polish it into a diamond is with hundreds of hours of experience. If you played this on another platform and really want to try mods then go ahead, but if you're completely new to the game I would suggest looking elsewhere. 

P.S. if someone says the -d3d10 launch option looks anything like normal Ark, understand that any opinion they have on anything is immediately invalidated, and you should call the police."

3278,"This is honestly my favourite game. You can play privately and spend hours calmly soaring on your wyvern (or flyer of choice), exploring depths of the ocean and discovering loot crates and ship wrecks.

You can also play on the open servers and become part of a complex community of PvP, negotiation, teamwork, and all the other chaos that comes from living with other humans. There are issues with mega tribes bullying servers  and wiping maps so don't play PvP unless you're okay with the risk of losing everything."

3349,"Minecraft with guns, lasers and dinos, but you cannot modify terrain and rocks explode into pieces and despawn after mining with Fallout 4 building mechanics. I think I missed the point of this game or something. Also, why do you need ""encumbered-on-stock-capacity"" amount of rocks for a tiny cooking station? Also, zoom out when encumbered, the running animation is just slowed down and it looks ridiculous. I wanted to coexist with ancient animals, but instead the game forces me to attack them and eventually do ""boss fights"". Cannot sleep through the night in a sleeping bag. Too much text on screen when hovering over placed structures. Where is the tutorial?"

3353,"Pretty map, awful gameplay loop. My first 5 minutes were pretty intresting, crafting tools and clothes to help survive the night and gather more resources, pants, gloves, shirts, spears, axes, picks etc, and the following 2 hours were the most mindnumblingly boring sh*t experience I have ever had in any game ever that prompted me to uninstall the game and write this review.

If you venture outside the starting beach area, you get destroyed by high level monsters. To fight high level monsters, you need better gear, you unlock better gear using blueprints that you get from leveling up. How do you level up? Bash rocks against one another for 2 hours straight.

So I started bashing and bashing and bashing, hoping to finally level up enough to unlock blueprints for leather armour or iron weapons or something so I could explore, a hope that never came because the first several dozen levels of unlocks are exclusively fucking furniture which I couldn't give less of a fuck about because all I wanted to do was PROGRESS.

All I wanted to do was explore the island, If wanted to play minecraft, I'd boot up minecraft, who's idea was it to put DECORATIONS as early and mid level rewards with ACTUAL progression being after you've already inveted 10 hours into a save file?

Sure, I may still be fighting t-rexes using a stone spear, but at least now I got a... *checks notes* stone fence support?

Yeah that's gonna help me survive when I've barely started and can't even set foot outside due to being oneshot by all the high level dinos that I do no damage to.

What pushed me over the edge was when I thought this would be more fun with a friend (Which isn't much of a ringing endorsement, being boiled alive is more fun with friends) who owned the game off steam, but after fiddling with servers for 20 minutes we couldn't figure out how to play toogether and just gave up.

Avoid this game like the f*cking plague, go play Vrising instead."

ARK: Survival Evolved is a game with tons of possibilities where we'll fall in love with its splendorous aesthetics, its content and its particularly attractive thematic. ARK is fun, and got amazing moments, but it has plenty of bugs,ARK is a nightmare of micro issues, weird performance spikes, bizarre graphical glitches, generally bad A.I. and collision detection that often can spoil the fun.But being a gamer all my life,this game captures something i been looking for, for a long long time,exploring the world,finding rare cool drops, taming and breeding animals, building a land and water base, and a farm and defenses.So i recommend this to all survival/exploration/rpg players you will probably find a lot to love in this game."
3364,great game
3365,good shit
3366,this game is the best game in the world thank you for work in this game iwant say one things ark is the best game
3367,"I got this game, it is extremely fun for both multiplayer and solo. but i had uninstalled it to make room for some other games. Later, when i wanted to reinstall it, i can't. WHY? BECAUSE ITS 125 GB TO FRICKING DOWNLOAD. MY STEAM SAYS ITS GOING TO TAKE 7 HOURS TO DOWNLOAD. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
3368,great game and very fun\hard
3369,wow nice game
3370,"Strangely unintuitive game and not sure if there were glitches or what. Had to google every step on the way. In the beginning I could choose and craft items, but not anymore after I crafted a campfire. I had loads of engram points, I was on level 11 and had the resources but couldn't make any clothes and therefore had to sit by campfire through the night. Also the character can only make little jumps, meaning much of the terrain is not walkable. Glad I got this game for free on sale."
3371,"If you do play - find a nice unofficial server server to play on. Otherwise you get these max lvl players hunting you down and harassing you everytime you log in or they come once a week and clean your bases out with 400+ lvl tames.  Cheating is rampant in this game with aimbots, esp and other things like Duplication."
3372,cant wait for ark 2
3373,"I got this game for free during a promotion a few months ago and I have real mixed feelings about it. The game is excellent to play with friends and taming dinos and building your base is the highlight obviously. The maps are massive and nearly impossible to fully explore without sinking inordinate amounts of time. It's like exploring actual wilderness.  I wish there was a way to skip night time in private server the way valheim does it, if everyone gets into beds, because the night can be truly terrifying even with some levelled dinos. For example, lost a level 210 carnotaurus because I was lost and couldn't see further than torchlight and I was repeatedly ambushed by much lower level raptors. Yes, I also had a couple smaller escorts as well. So it ends up being that you just... wait... all night at the base if you don't have any home improvement projects to work on because leaving the base at night might cost you literally hours of dino taming no matter how well you prepare.

One thing that is absolutely inexcusable is the grossly misrepresented storage needed. They advertise it as a 60 gb game and the file on my computer is WELL OVER 300GB. I have it on two different computers so ARK is consuming nearly 700gb of storage in my life. Even before the DLC, it was around 180 which is egregious but at least there are other games in that ballpark. I have friends with 480/512gb drives that are wholly dedicated to windows and ARK and have barely enough space leftover to not slow down the SSD. If you have a 250, you can forget any DLC right now. I personally used an old hard drive and just tolerate the load times to not eat up the majority of my ssd."

worth the money easily but prob get other people to play it with its a multiplayer game 
"
3379,"Clunky, boring. Plays like a crappy mod for Rust. Get Rust or Valheim or any other game. Maybe Ark 2 will be good. Out of the 250 games I own across various platforms, this is the only one I requested a refund for."

3386,"This game is not really beginner friendly but other than that one of the greatest games I've ever played. It has a lot of content and never gets boring. I also really like that it is not always easy to achive the things you really want, it pushes the motivation to play much further. The graphic isn't even that bad if you have the correct settings.

The only thing I'll have to say that this game has a lot of frustrating bugs that should really be fixed."

3423,Free roam style and growth.  Great for innovation of combining skills.  Only drawback is lots of time wasted on acquiring key tames.
3424,"Fun but glitchy as hell. My dinos keep getting stuck behind rocks and stuff because of awful pathing and I have to go back and look for them, my ""attack this enemy"" whistle command stopped working after the second use of it and refuses to work again, and sometimes, if I'm unlucky and trying to try out a new map on an easy spawn, I'll get immediately spawn killed by some dinosaur that was right next to me after I load up the game. I don't even play online, I just play single player. I feel bad for the people who paid money for this and have to deal with the extra glitches multiplayer gives you."

3449,Nice game
3450,itz gudz
3451,So much fun to play with my 9 year old daughter. Tons of hours played so far and don't plan on stopping anytime soon!
3452,Ark can be both rewarding and disappointing. The ways you can mod it can make the gameplay easier or even more difficult! I love the versatility and complexity. It's difficult at first because you can die pretty often but it's well worth it!
3453,"Wow, if you want to play a game that abuses you ARK is it. I don't think I have done corpse runs like this since EQ1 days and I thought Valheim corpse runs were terrible.  I am pretty sure this game purposefully spawns in more hostile dinosaurs around your corpse as soon as you die. I can literally run around and explore and run into zero hostile dinos and then as soon as I die suddenly I have to fight through a swarm of 20 hostiles to get back to my original corpse. It reminds me of Dying Light in that the game seems to be designed to pile on you and punish you right when you are most vulnerable.

It is graphically a very pretty game but you can tell the base building mechanics are old and janky AF. No grids and poor snap points and very little information in game on what any of the close to 1000 craftables are for. You end up building some REALLY ugly bases in stark contrast with the beautiful environment.

There are several dangerous tiny dinosaurs you will often run into during the early game. One is called a Troodon and this little PoS will literally troll you like a real-life troll on a PvP server. These things are small and fast and do very little damage but they will POISON you, poison in ARK does NOT kill you. It knocks you out and you fall on the ground helpless. Then these Troodons often won't kill you!?!! They will just run around you and every minute or so hit you once to reapply the poison and keep you unconscious for another minute. They will keep doing this OVER and OVER and just keep you helpless forever until a bigger dinosaur comes by and finally puts you out of your misery. There have been several times now where I got knocked out by this and I just sit there helpless for over 10 minutes praying that something else comes by and quickly kills me so I can respawn, meanwhile your corpse decay timer with all your good gear is ticking down. I have literally Alt-Tabbed out of the game watching videos and reading up while waiting to finally be allowed to die. At least the Titanoboas have the consideration to finish you off quickly after their poison knocks you out after 1 or 2 bites.

I initially thought that a 3 hour corpse decay timer was generous. Every time I finally get back to my corpse that decay timer is down to the last 10 to 20 minutes. Every corpse run has taken me almost 3 hours to get back to my body with all the extra dying and fighting against the seemingly random dino spawns that just happen to appear when you die.

Avoid this game unless you like games that punish your face or set the game settings down to easy mode."

3499,ark on console was already good but MAN mods make it wayyyyyyyyyy better
3500,"i definitely recommend this game it is worth all of your money,

to run this game u need a computer with about 500 gb just for this game and all of the dlcs included but its really the best game ive played and most of my time is pve. pve in this game is really cool with taming your dinos and expanding your base on your own paste and then u can enjoy your dinosaurs and killing every dino there is there is not really a big story line in this game but its just a cool experience 

i have recently gotten into pvp for the first real time it can get really frustarating losing all your stuff to so guy named *!!!!!!!!* but the pvp is still something to enjoy i only recomend pvp if you can lose without getting mad and wanting to grind

It's plagued with a lot of really obvious oversights, bugs, and UI issues that sap a lot of fun out of the base game. You can likely mod it into working as intended, but it's unconscionable to have this many issues 5 years after release and after releasing however-many DLC's."

3557,yes.
3558,"Ark provides a game experience that very few others can provide.

I remember my first day spawning on the beach like it was yesterday when in reality it's almost been 5 years. My friend and I decided to check out ""cool dinosaur game"" only to be met with exactly that. We spawned on different sides of the island on accident and had to run a quarter way around the map to meet up. Along the way we were massacred by Raptors, T-Rexs, Gigas, and many of the other giant scaly reptiles that inhabit the world of ark. PVE is amazingly polished and is fun for hours on end. This is an extremely enjoyable game and I highly recommend giving it a try."

3586,"Ark is an absolutely amazing game. I've played it on and off since October 2017 and I have never found a game that could hold a torch to either the base game or its modding community. The Devs are amazing and incredibly open with the ARK players and over the years have turned community made maps into fully implemented free DLC maps which I quite love. Most of my hours were played a few years ago during the modding community's prime with mods like Primal Fear being used on just about every unofficial server. A good chunk of the old mods are a little buggy now because the creators have moved on to new projects or focused on other areas of their lives, (which is completely fine, I don't blame them) but their mods still work for some incredible game play. I watched this game grow from the initial addition of the Ragnarok map to the final chapter of the story and I cannot be happier with how well this glorious game ended up. I am so excited to see how ARK 2 turns out, so much so that I wishlisted it the moment I saw the announcement."

Ark is a game where achievement drives all. The incredible difficulty and punishing losses all serve to contrast the incredible highs of taming that one rare dino. Or killing that boss finally. As someone who churned after a 10 hour first run, i've come back for 275 and loved every one of them. Excited for #2"
3593,"Ark: Survival Developed

Ark is one of those games that came out in early access when it was still a ""new thing""  and kind of set the standard for what ongoing development games could be...if not headed by AAA studio idiots.  The team at Wildcard has consistently delivered content updates and maps new things to build and items to craft...Its what studios should do when they value the customer.  

This is one of the more immersive games I've ever played and I can't recommend it highly enough...If you haven't played ark...Get to it."

Players have to search up out of game on how to do most things, and this takes away from the experience. Servers are laggy and slow at times, if not down.

3600,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

EVERYTIME i pop into ANY menu, the mouse cursor comes up and doesnt leave until i move it making it so i cannot see things or read what other items are other than the one the mouse cursor happens to be on. It gives me more than 4 hotkey buttons but i can only use the 4. 

Not only that but the work I DID do was lost when i logged on last time. i tried to play againand loadmy character and it loaded without any clothes or weapons i made. I dont know if there is a save spot you have to go to or not, but this game is absolute bullcrap and even though I just started playing I will be deleting and uninstalling this game ASAP. 

MAYBE THE GAME DEVS CAN WORK ON CONTROLLER CONTROLS AND FUNCTION?? I have never seen even a game with PARTIAL controller support be so horrendous and stupid with the controller support it DOES have. and there should be NO reason that I shouldnt be able to play full controller support if my friend, who has an xbox, can play it like that.

even without any dlcs, this game takes up as much space as all of my other games combined. I'm not a programmer, but I don't believe that this is normal."

3642,"i love this game because you can try new mods and in the mods you always have something new to do i have 2,400 hours on the game."
3643,"World looks closer to Skyrim graphics than ESO ever got.  The creatures are allowed to roam no other game does that.  It runs hot needs a really good gaming pc and at least 500 gb if you want other games as well.  It's Ark1 there is an Ark2 coming.  I hope they reconsider keeping events for Ark1 I love colorful dinos would hate that to go away.

You can loose your single player world it never saves quite right.  It will just up and vanish one day.  Recommend playing pve multiplayer official or unofficial.  Use Battlemetrics site to see if servers are populated and don't join servers with a bad health rating.  

Pay attention to ping you want the lowest ping possible for you.  Most servers are in germany but still watch your ping.  Lot people quit this game say lag sucks broke but they didn't bother joining servers with lowest ping for them.

People and the devs will hurt your feelings.  Keep a thick hide.  It's not as bad as Rust but it will burn you at times.  Be ready for it."

3671,"Incredibly buggy, grindy (depending on settings), and overall infuriating mess of a game. However, it is one of the most long lasting and entertaining videogames that I have played with friends. While it doesn't have state of the ark game mechanics, or developers that care. It has plenty of content which can keep you occupied for awhile. Far from perfect, but I enjoy playing it. (Viewpoint from a non-dedicated server with 1 friend, never play official)"
3672,Good fun so far
3673,c
3674,"With the sequel coming soon, only buy this game if it's steeply discounted. my friends and I got it during a free promotion. Also it still feels very 'beta survival game' in that it can be quite janky at times. My review would probably change for the positive if we were able to survive to actually tame dinos etc. but this has the curse like many other long-open-developed games of difficulty creep, so if you jump in late into the cycle without a clue of what to do, it's completely impenetrable and impossible to make any progress without half your playtime being spent on google.

RIP our interest died 1 hour in after an omega trex ran into the spawn island where I built a cozy house and immediately spawnkilled us and destroyed structures over and over."

The game is great, its fun, I genuinely like to play the game. One issue, if you're a linux player, its a bit buggy but it still works. The forums said to opt into the nativelinux beta but it isn't as simple as that. Opt into linuxnative beta, go to compatibility and use proton 5.13-6 , if it asks to install battle eye, just click cancel. this so far get the game to be playable. Its a bit laggy but that may be my computer. hope this update helps others. Previously I said that it wouldn't work on linux at all, but after over 5 hours I managed to get it to work. 6/10"

You get the point. This is going to be you experience for the beginning of the game. You'll die of starvation or dehydration if you manage not to make it on the dino's dinner plate, but once you start getting your footing on the game you will get used to it.  The amount of patience you are going to need for the amount of sh!t that is going to happen in this game has to be godly. I suggest playing on NON dedicated servers if you don't have the time (real life time... yeah you're gonna need that on dedicated) to play this game.  I always enjoy it with my sister, whenever we hop into it. I do recommend it, it's not for everyone, but if you love dinos this will be an experience."
3813,good for killing time
3814,good
3815,"I'm a 41 year old Dad that plays this game with my two sons.  Official settings are not a good fit for us.  Fortunately, WC lets me run my own dedicated server with settings that make it more ""fun"" for us.  The fact that this game has dedicated servers makes it great in my book.  I miss the days of running my own MW or BF2 server.  Hopefully they keep this feature for ARK 2.

The game has its share of bugs.  I fell through the map and lost all my gear the other day.  It didnt feel great, but I was able to recover with a few admin commands.  Building can be janky at times, but once you learn how to make things snap the way you want, its not so bad.  The dinos are great, the survival aspects are alright, and combat is fun enough.  This game scratches a lot of different itches.  Mod support is icing on the cake.  

Overall, great game."

Another thing I like about it is the fact that you can join friends and family in servers on the game and actually play together. The thing I dislike about it is the fact that is rough trying to join as a family in servers, you have to be on the same internet and do other things for the server to work. Overall I would recommend this game to other players."

3872,"Like many survival and crafting games, ARK gives you a challenging progression of both tech and taming. There's always plenty to see, do and conquer. Dangers include the elements, dinosaurs and other players. Highlights include loads of dinosaurs and areas to explore. 

Best moments: finding and taming elusive dinosaurs with teammates (personal favorite would be the Quetz) 
Worst moments: loading into a very established server and being unable to get started due to persistent stompage 

Highly recommend: Boot up your own server and set your own challenges. The game has plenty to explore. 
Beware: Poop. IYKYK."

3874,Played this game alot on xbox with over a thousand hours. originally bought it on pc and decided after 1000 hours on xbox id try it on pc as well. Its just as broken on here as it is on there.

Well. Times when it works. its fun. Start of the  game is really fun. Learning, Taming new dinos, getting resources, etc.

3917,"ARK Survival Evolved is a game that re-imagines the survival scene. Taking a prehistoric approach, the game offers a new experience for players as they step into the world of dinosaurs as a lowly human being. 

there are many positive notes about this game which I've listed below:

- Visually, the game is beautiful. the free DLC's each offer unique and vast lands to travel, as do the paid ones. sites high up on mountain ranges and deep into valleys create picturesque views to stop and look at during travels. 
- the graphics are strong. The dinosaurs, plants, rocks and characters are generously detailed to help immerse the player into the new world.

- audio-wise, the game captures the sounds of dinosaurs as we would have expected them to sound when they roamed the earth. Wandering around at night and hearing a piercing screech from an Argentavis can send a shiver down your spine as you sprint for cover. 

- There are challenges you'd expect to find in a real survival situation. Searching for food and water and building a shelter before nightfall are the first few tasks for a new player. doing this while trying to stay alive presents a realistic scenario for the type of setting--video game wise, that is. 

- There's a vast range of options for a player as they step into the ARK. playing single player and attempting to go lone wolf or playing on a server with many others. Creating tribes and making friends.
- For each map you play on, you are able to customize the rules and settings of the game. Taming speed too slow? Slide the bar or enter any number in the box next to the bar labeled ""Taming Speed"" to adjust the companion gaining process. Change how long night or day lasts or create new challenges for yourself as you please. 
- Single players also have a Champaign route they may choose to take. when starting, you'll find there are these giant statues of metal. A green one, a Red and a Blue. These are the obelisks. Taking artifacts to them helps you to create portals to bosses to fight with your army of dino's by your side. There's an easy one, a medium one and a hard one. You can upload your character to the obelisks and once you conquer one map, you can move on with your character from the map you completed to conquer the next one. 

Though the game has many ups, there are a few downs--especially for new players--to overcome. 

- the game doesn't have a tutorial. When you first spawn in, you must learn how to survive on your own or with help from an experienced player. 
- the first few nights and days will be brutal. Since the game doesn't have a system that adjusts the difficulty as you play, you may find yourself dying often early on. Don't get frustrated and quit. This wont last long. As you start to get more materials and weaponry, the game gets easier. Taming Dino's is the best and fastest way to thriving.

- because the game is large ans has a lot of specs it carries, sometimes there will be lag spikes or moments when you freeze. it doesn't happen a lot, but it may. Don't panic, let the game resolve the issue itself. It typically doesn't take long.

I do recommend the game for those who love a good challenge. it's completely open world and creativity is limited only to where you will go. Finding dino's and making them your own, finding ways to overcome difficulty and learning to thrive all comes in this game.

3959,"Not sure what I missed, but without the wiki to help with some things (fiber comes from plants you harvest by hand, and is used in most things) I would be stuck running around and dying all the time.

I like the more severe survivalist pressure this game puts on the player. I LOVE the dinosaurs, lizards, fish, and flyers. I'll certainly enjoy taming and riding a flyer, if possible, my goodness! having a little trouble in the easy areas with creatures of massively higher level and damage potential appear and destroy me in two hits, or smaller creatures pick and poke until I die. I find this game difficult, but I'm enjoying the challenge of 'getting good'."

3992,"Ark has been a game I hold dearly for well over four years. It's full of adventure, suspense, and most importantly, dinosaurs! I feel so honored to be in this community and greatly encourage others to join in! With updates constantly flowing in, and Ark 2 just around the corner, new users will find that there's so much more to this game than just dinosaurs. I truly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to drain hours upon hours of grinding just to have your tames and base wiped. But in my opinion, that's the fun of it! You get to try again, change things to make you stronger than before and get sweet, sweet revenge. In short, there's endless fun in Ark, and always something for everyone."

4006,"185 GB download, I can handle that I guess. I don't need the D:Cs though, so having to download them at the same time as the base game is just lazy/coercive game development. Every year I lose another 10-20GB of storage waiting for this game to work the way I want. Just let me be a happy caveman, not getting mobbed by 10 dinos spawning at once in my back yard all night long. I don't need all the green and red shafts of light, monolith towers and mini guns. That garbage just upsets the vibe.

Thankfully there are mods that bring the game to a less arcade-like feel. I like to use Remove obelisk, Palisade walls, No loot crates, and anything that removes modern and sci-fi paraphernalia and spaces out creature spawns, so its not a crowded neon petting zoo atmosphere."

4014,"Buggy as heck, but a great game. I played it on my xbox a lot before, but i wanted to play online with my friends, and they had the PC version, So i got the PC version. because, even though there's like no difference from the two versions, it's not cross play, idk why. i didn't think i would be able to do this because Ark is such a massive game and i have a MacBook Pro, which aren't known for their gaming capabilities. but when i saw it was MacOS supported, i was very very surprised, and happy. so, when it went on sale, i bought it. then i waited an entire day for it to download. and when it was done, i clicked play and started loading it. it took a while to load but when it finished and showed me the title screen, and immediately crashed. i tried to load it again, but all i saw was a split second of the title screen before it crashed again. now, this happened every time i tried to load the game, you could imagine my frustration. i checked everything about my computer and found that i'm doing absolutely nothing wrong. i have enough storage, i have the system requirements, i have everything it needs. but no, it wouldn't let me play it. turns out that Ark isn't compatible with the latest MacBook system update. you'd think that Wildcard would rush to fix this big of a problem, but they're too busy adding more bugs than content to the game. i'm sure there are others out there with the same problem i have. all this to say, IF WILDCARD SEES THIS REVEW, PLEASE MAKE THE DANG GAME PLAYABLE FOR MACBOOKS!!!"
4015,not fun
4016,bro i legit deleted all my fucking files and it worked but then fucking stupid ass update came and now i cant play my 11 dollar game i bought wit my own money i t was a really good game though do recommend just make sure to have LOTSSSSSSSSSS of storage in your pc.

4028,"☐ No bugs at all
☐ Minor bugs, won't interrupt gameplay
☐ Can get a bit annoying sometimes, but whatever
☐ Game almost gets unplayable, you rage-quit after an hour
☑ ARK: Survival Evolved

In other words, yes, there are ""some"" bugs. But it's still a fun game with an open world full of dinosaurs, if you like survival games I think you'll like this one. Can get a bit boring when you've played for yourself a while so I'd suggest having a friend to play with."

This game is versatile. I have played it a XBox game pass on Steam. I have played solo, with friends and now in a patreon community. I haven't played PVP yet though. There are so many expansions to this game and I am exiting to be able to keep coming back for more content and be in a community that loves this game!"

4050,"Official Servers are trash.  They can hardly keep them up or are laggy af.  Customer service can't provide help to save their lives.  I've had a ticket open for almost 12h now and still no response on why the server has been down for the duration or when it'll be back up.  This happens often.  If you want to play for 1h and be waiting on a server to come back up.  This is your game.  If not.  Save your $ and buy something else.

Edit: 19h the server has been down.  No support responses or anything.  Terrible way to keep a fan base."

4126,"It's quirky, it's over the top, it's imbalanced as hell... but most of all: It's unique. There's just nothing like it and it offers a variety of different approaches for players, be it PVP- or PVE-centered. 

Modding is alive and kicking and with the addition of Fjordur a huge part of DLC-content is available for everyone now, even those who only own the base-game plus FreeLCs.
I recommend getting it on sale and familiarizing yourself with the different options of modding your single-player or server to adjust to your own playstyle/time-investment possible."

4137,"A honest review.
""ARK: Survival Evolved"" is not too bad, yet I cant recommend it.

The Graphics are, mediocre (2014 ""Planetside 2"" Graphics) for the Gear which it needs, to run it.
The music and sounds are ok, nothing special, nothing striking nice made with it, yet The Game works and I have not noticed heavy glitches.
The Gameplay feels fine, as long as a Heavy PC can run it smoothly.

The Problem I have, with It:
1. It needs 200 to 300 Gbs of Drive Space. (there are ingame things that are there but don't make the game better.)

2. starting the Game, is not starting the game. The Menu looks like a ""hobby player made"" server, a good showcase could be seeing, what the player will see ingame (a Trailer), and easy navigation.

4. The Hardware requirements are too high to run smooth.

5. The Models scale doesn't feel right.

6. there is no ""Introduction"" to the game, and how it all works.
A good Introduction to the game would be one, where the players play through it, to learn the basics, when launching the game the first time (skippable and relauncheble).
Not by learning by looking at the keybind Settings menu.
A Bad Intro would be: A tutorial which is just a long Text.

My suggestions: randomly generated map, low system requirements less to download, max ~20GBs, good menu, intro, gameplay, better looking gam, nice music and sound integration.

Thank you for reading."

"
4147,my problem is there is no soulution for the fact people build right on top of random spawn points. every server i join into has a massive base right there. with spoilers and too many little ladders to let me build even a little fire so that i can cook some food. to get far enough away from them i have to run for 30minutes which requires food that i cant make due to not being able to place a fire down. i dont understand why every server is covered head to toe in these bullcrap ladders that go to no where. its literaly the community just being rude to anyone who wants to build near by.

4223,"I really wanted to like this game.

Don't be fooled by the trailers or preview images, the games is such low quality and fairly buggy. 

- It has the worst HUD of any game I've seen out of early access
- There is basically no tutorial, and almost nothing is explained
- Early game you are constantly bombarded by levelling up, with objectively terrible graphics projected annoyingly on the screen and no actual explanation of the levelling or stat system at all
- I don't believe there's any way to check what status effects are applied, except images in the corner of the HUD, these are not explained and provide no tooltip with more info
- Every time you die and respawn, you get the same starting equipment which adds up annoyingly in your inventory if you bother to loot your corpse
- The layout is and unrefined

I could add a whole other review about the character creation; what the fuck? If I had to pick the worst thing about it, I'd wanna know why the put the hair colour selection on a single slider scale. Just...why?

There are obviously good things about it.
- I like the dinosaurs
- The ability to sort your inventory and crafting items into custom folders is fun and helpful

But overall I found the UI just jarringly bad and the whole game felt like it should still be a few years from full release. Astonishing that it's such a popular game given all these problems. Kudos to people who are play despite that, but I doubt I'll be able to overlook the glaringly low-quality visual elements.

The best thing about this game will be the absurd amount of space I'll free up by uninstalling."

4237,"The game is good in concept, but has some of the most tedious, frustrating and buggy issues infesting every single facet of the game. Maybe as a single player experience it could be worth it, but in multiplayer (which is clearly the more popular way to play) unless you have the time to absolutely no life the game, then you get left completely in the dust and the tedium starts to affect you 3x more than those around you. 

Ultimately the game is worth playing for the right person, and no one can argue that taming dinosaurs and cool beasts isn't amazing. The issue comes in for anyone without a decent computer, time to throw at hours and hours of unrewarding/easily lost progress, or those who want a more robust PvE experience.

Don't let my review stop you from trying it out, but pick it up on one of it's very common sales or maybe wait for the 2nd game to come around in the near future."

4254,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

4268,It's an amazing survival game like no other. The down side is that it's heavy for your PC and is very time consuming. If you plan on playing it you better forget about sleeping for a while because you are going to dream about it every day.

Recognizing an addiction problem in someone you know can be harder than it seems. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) defines addiction as a chronic disease that affects the brain’s reward, motivation, and memory functions. Someone with an addiction will crave a substance or other behavioral habits. They’ll often ignore other areas of life to fulfill or support their desires."

4366,"Do not play this game. Not because its bad but for the life of your family and friends. As you start to play you learn things slowly but you begin to get the hang of things at around 100 hours of play but as you tame your first raptor and and low level flyer you begin to become more and more invested into the game. After a long period of time you have a rex a carno,dodic,anky and an argy this is the stage where your girlfriend starts sleeping with her gay best friend chad because you simply refuse to touch that vile whench as she does not a single grain of your vast field of knowledge when it comes to your hobby of locking your self in the closet of your step mothers house and when she makes advances on you attack her with you fake army of prehistoric beings. After a larger period of time where you have beat big ape, wish spider man , and that one guy from skyrim. your family is ready to start a intervention as they begin to decend the steps leading to the basement they smell the bucket of your shit because you are to weak to walk to the bathroom after the thousands of hours of play. With your army of gigas at the ready to lay down there lives to defend your addiction. Your father sees you in disappointment and sees you as the waste of sperm you are and has ptsd caused by your mother of was a hooker in las,vegas who charged him for a dollar and a pack of pokemon cards. knowing there was no way to change what has came upon you they leave in despair and seal the door making you a time capsule for the next generation that will combat you with a stronger will than what they could.

if you are affected by a loved ones addiction or you yourself are trying to quit this game please call 1-800-273-8255 if you are in a place where you think suicide is the only way out. Speak to your friends and family they are there for you- a current ark addict"

4372,awesome
4373,"Honestly, I didn't find this game that fun. It felt wayy to janky for the 33 dollars i had to fork up, for what was kind of a mess.

sorry if this offends you, but i just don't like this game."
4374,uuuu
4375,"Great with friends, fun to explore. Easily in my top games ever"
4376,its the best game you will play and i would have more hours if i didnt have on my xbox

4378,its fun
4379,nice game with horrible bugs cant even use the terminal in extinction bro its been three years since this bug has existed how come devs dont finx it its like they dont want you to play with other players despite being a multiplayer game what even is this also the countless times my dinos disappear after I login again is crazy i swear to god this game is haunted or somthing overall the game is pretty decent but bad review because the devs need to fix it

4390,its way too buggy
4391,Op game i play too much
4392,"Let's start with the awful optimization of the game which is quite discouraging from playing. Survival mixed with dinosaurs which is not the easiest one. As the character develops further, the game starts to get interesting. The higher the character level, the more fun things you can create to make the game easier. At first I wasn't enjoying the game and then I started to get involved. Apart from a few annoying things, the game is good. Try it yourself and see what I mean."
4393,so much better then the xbox one version YOU CAN ACUTALLY TAME DINOS it's amazing and using cheats so much easier to use on pc then console and just everything is better and now i can acutally tame dinos im loving it

P.S. Dunno where I'd be without my trusty club."

4466,"I've played over 3,600 hours of ARK on Xbox and I'm now starting on PC. ARK with mods is amazing! and feels like this is the way ARK was supposed to be played. 

For disabled people like me, this game gives a feeling of exploration, travel and freedom that a lot of people aren't fortunate enough to experience. It's also a great way to meet new people and make some good friends. 
That being said, with the right mods, singleplayer can be quite enjoyable too. 

I highly recommend playing ARK, it gives you a lot of freedom to play how you want."

4505,"This game fucking sucks. Now I'm not gonna get into all of the nitty-gritty details. But all of the creatures' path finding sucks balls, they wouldn't be able to locate my penis slapping them on their face. The game runs worse than an obese man with no bitches. The sky is as bright as my neighbors shining, bald head yet everything else looks like I'm staring into the abyss. The only effort the devs put into the game is to make sure you can't have fun by making it impossible to tame all of the good creatures. And lastly, fuck this game.
Thank you for coming to my ted talk"

4514,i love it
4515,"Too many issues for me to be able to willingly advise anybody to spend any money on this game. I would just wait for Ark 2 to release and hope and pray its not as bad and neglected as this game has been.

   From the beginning of this games life, the developers spent all of their time and resources prioritizing making new dlc instead of fixing all of the problems in the main aspects of the gameplay that exist to this day.
 
   I've sunk numerous hours into this game over the years and have had a good time. That being said, I would never play on public servers, nor would I play alone. Pvp is unplayable, and offline raiding is as toxic as any game with offline raiding and then some. Not only could you log off of a server for a little too long just to come back and see your entire base destroyed, but more than likely you'll see all of your tames that you spent hours upon hours leveling and loving dead.

   I wish that they took a little more care of this game instead of letting greed get into their way."

4519,i like to eat raw meat
4520,I am not very good at playing games but I have been able to play this one with the help of some friends and it is very fun
4521,"Is this game large? Yes
Is this game janky? Yes
Is this game as flawed as a Bethesda game at launch? Yes
But there is no other game that lets you tame and ride dinos while shooting rocket launchers leading a horde of C4 dodos and a flock of murder owls. Get your friends, make a tribe, and go and live the dreams you had as kids."
4522,nice
4523,"You can see that I have almost 800 hours in this game. I have tried to play it time and time again. I just finished a determined effort to get the game to work and enjoy it. It didn't happen. It plays well until it doesn't. Which is entirely too often.

I'm writing this review after my 10th attempt in a week to get a game to complete without bugs cropping up that ruin the experience. Particularly annoying is the ""deleted resource nodes"" bug/feature/""as designed"", who knows? That used to only show up in single player and hosted sessions. Now, it's showing up in the dedicated server.

Several of the bugs that were there on day one keep recurring. They'll fix one. Then break it again in a future update.
 
There are several things that aren't game breaking but are annoying:
- typing into an edit box and pressing enter does not submit by default ... you have to click the accept button
- there's an option to save a character preset. It gets deleted when you delete the settings which you have to do to change your map
- if you don't squint one eye and hold your tongue between your teeth while you delete settings, the settings may or may not get deleted. You just never know until you start up a new game whether you are starting on a new map or starting on the previous one that you just deleted.
- A safe zone should be safe. I don't how many times I've gotten a death message while still on the character creation screen because my character spawned right on top of a one-hit wonder dino.

It's a great game idea. Poor implementation."

4530,"This game is difficult to describe. I've had it for quite a long time, and simply never got around to playing it. As of right now, I started playing it 2 days ago with a friend, and already have 11 hours on it. The amount of content there is to explore is staggering, and as a new person to the game, I am almost certain that this will entertain me for months on end. The random spazzing-out of a dino every so often is always hilarious. I give this game a rating of 8 oranges out of 7 apples."
4531,best game ever
4532,"Spent countless hours playing Ark with a handful of my friends. However due to my own personal preferences I avoid solo play so with that I am unable to add much in regards to solo content. 

If it weren’t for the server hiccups I’d say this game is damn near perfect for me but the frequent ‘disconnects’ while trying to join a new server/load mods has a tendency to really grind my gears. Though once it has finished its initial loading the issue is no longer present and it’s all GG from there. 😎"
4533,ilove you ARK: Survival Evolved
4534,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4535,dinosaur
4536,amazing game
4537,"Okay. Pretty great. I like the alternate time period trope here. The best part is you can mod it, unlike the console versions. What I don't like about it is the fact vsync is not enabled automatically by default when playing the game. In fact, THERE IS NO V-SYNC OPTION AT ALL. In order to enable it, you have to do so via console command by typing this in the console: r.vsync 1. Shoutout to steam user axenation who posted this solution via reply to OP in an old thread. Please devs put an option for enabling vsync into the game. Very important that it not be left out. Also, a much easier way from another user (DemitriX) is to do this:

Goto
Steam\steamapps\common\ARK\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
Open up Gameusersettings with notepad
ctrl + F and search ""bUseVSync=""

change
bUseVSync=False
to
bUseVSync=True


If you use console command above, you will most likely have to retype it every time you launch the game, this way you run it always with vsync when starting.

So make sure to read this review over and even past it in google docs or as a text file on your PC so you can easily look back to it when you forget how to enable it via command or within the files. 

Anyway, highly recommend this game to anyone who loves dinosaurs, first person shooters, survival games, and games that take place in an alternate time period!"

Let's go back to Indiana
Circa 1983
Just four boys in the basement chillin'
Playin' D&D
There was Lucas, there was Willy Will
And Dustin, there was a Mike
But one night, Will goes missing while he’s ridin' on his bike
Yikes!
That's when they met me, Elev
I had no hair on my head
I had been so close to dead
Courtesy of Dr. Brenner who's huntin' me twenty-four sev
Joyce was hanging Christmas lights in the web
Started hearing something Willy had said
This could be a message from the beyond
What happened to Barb?
She’s just gone in the Upside Down
Hopper's on top of the case
While I'm throwing vans into space
I'm lying down in a tank
Trying my best to find Willy and Dustin's got pudding for days
Demogorgon's getting all in my way
Blast him to pieces just like a grenade
Will's now at home, coughin' slugs in the sink
What happened to me? I'm in the Upside Down

4573,"What can I say?

I have a love/hate relationship with Ark. I've spent years of my life with this game, dating all the way back to the early days of early access.
The game is still buggy, laggy, unstable and totally unrealistic, but that is the charm...
I really mean it, you can expect to always have a laugh, surprise or heck even a set of jump scares here and there just because of the ""bugs"" in this game.
Imagine yourself waking up on a beach, not knowing where the f*** you are or why you're there, all you know is that that implant in your arm is itchy as hell, that turtle is definitely floating ABOVE the sea UPSIDE DOWN, aaaaaand that's an Alpha Raptor coming to kill you...

(In all seriousness, I love this game)"
4574,Gooood
4575,I would not pay for this...
4576,Amazing!
4577,it is an amazing and immersive game. the graphics and game mechanics are insane. and the full mod support is fun to change and experiment with. the multiplayer is fun and there are lots of choice like pve pvp modded. the game has lots of settings so you can experiment and find how you want to play by changing rates. the setting pretty much let you change anything you want. 11/10

It's definitely a game I've had a lot of fun with, but can be extremely frustrating with enemy types that can knock you out within seconds regardless of level or armor and some terrible hit boxes/bad hit recognition on moving enemies, among dozens of other small annoyances in gameplay."

-glitches
-optimization
-building glitches
-annoying creatures
-glitch glitches
-wack pvp

I will never stop playing this game"
4606,bad game
4607,Yes
4608,"It's a fun game....when it's not crashing every 5 minutes.

The game itself is fun, it has plenty of adventure, base building, combat, monster-taming, PVP, and co-op. Sadly it's just not worth all the bugs that the devs have ignored.

TL;DR they keep releasing DLC for Ark, yet they stopped updating the software because they are building the sequel.....Ark 2. This game is pretty much broken.

Don't buy it unless it's on sale or if you have a lot of money and patience to burn. :)"
4609,A game that gives you headaches... but at the same time makes you addicted. Also try playing with mods
4610,good

4633,Great Game
4634,wsdawda
4635,I have played over 1k hours on this game and I have to say its worth it. Play this game solo or with friends. I highly suggest to play with friends for an enhanced experience and fun times along with your best buds. I had so many memories already playing with my friends that I will never forget. The customization you can do to a server or solo mode is very unique and can provide you with the challenge you want. I highly recommend to add this to your game library and become epic in the ARK
4636,fun game to play with friends highly recommend
4637,Y E S
4638,its just gooder
4639,this game fucking rocks
4640,epic game multiplayer sucks
4641,Its good its just buggy.
4642,Its a big sandbox type atmosphere where you can do anything you want and build anything you want on whatever map you want. Just get a friend to host a server and its a good time...
4643,Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... I have a 8th gen i9 16GB Graphics card 64GB ram 1TB SSD drive and its still lagging.
4644,lots of fun memories with this game but why for the love of everything in the world is it so big I have horrible internet it would actually take me like 2 days to install it
4645,aaa
4646,Best game ever
4647,Clunky but Chunky
4648,thereznosour is scary
4649,Ark is such a good game with endless amount of things to do it is a really creative based game and I love how you are able to customize your entire playing experience.
4650,good
4651,amazing game
4652,Very good but hard to get all the settings right when making your own server.

4657,"I have over a 1000 hours on Gamepass, but I found out about the S+ mod and it changed the game for me. Get it on Steam, and get to taming giant battle toads."

4671,i.d.k
4672,played alot more on ps4 and ps5 but the pc version is way better and lets face it if you like jurrasic park and think you got the balls to live in a world of dinos then join a server and wait to be put down your thatch house then see a t-rex come out the darkness and leave with a slight turd in your pants i miss the days where i knew nothing in ark those are the best days so treasure them
4673,This game is great i love it theres no reason to not like it 10/10

4677,This game was one of my first survival games and it made me addicted to this genre. The grafic is terrific and the gameplay is very enjoyable at least if you have a private server and adjust the times a little bit. I played it EVP coop with friends. The first time flying on a pteranodon was magic <3 It brought me a lot of fun in a whole lot of gaming hours.

4686,"800+ hours on steam and 5000 on console and the game is meh... Buggy, frustrating, constantly annoying, beautiful, engaging, addictive and outright sadistic all at the same time. At times its almost feels like it was deighned at its very core to be as unpredictable and broken as phiscally possible whilst still have the same addiction rate as most street remedies.
I love and hate this game in equal measure. Thank you ark, good bye ark."
4687,"So this review is not really me judging the game and more of the team that work on the game. Now don't get me wrong i love the game the pvp and milestones in the game are great but the developers are absolutely ♥♥♥♥. We have bugs that were around years ago that have not been patched joining servers is scuffed and meshing is real but even then i have just scratched the surface of what these ♥♥♥♥ ""developers"" haven't done. This game is a cash grab they keep releasing DLC's even when there game has too many bugs adding more DLC's just add's so much more bugs and game breaking mechanics its really disappointing that such a good game can get extinguish by developers that only care about the money but there is one bug that gets under my skin when i have to reload my gun multiple times just to shoot once just fix this ♥♥♥♥ no more DLC's just fix it."
4688,"Quite fun and engaging, as well as unique."

4690,"If I could take back the 80 hours I have played on this stupid game, I would in a heartbeat
I didn't like it starting out, and still don't
you think its going to be fun because dino funny
and dino is funny
but people not funny, people mean, and people are stupid, and people are the only thing that make the game playable, but people like blowing stuff up and making me angry.
spending a day working on a base, getting materials, and dinosaurs, only to go to sleep and for it to all be gone because someone blew it all up, took your loot, and killed your dinosaurs makes me wish this game didn't exist.

3/10, dino is still funny tho"
4691,Just got mesh.....lose 3 month of play         thx  wildcard for ur greattttttttttt game......
4692,very good but there is no servers that have alot of people in

4705,"Wouldn't recommend buying this in 2022, since the developers abandoned original game long long way ago. All we get in form of fixes / updates is NEW DLC. Devs changed the price of the game, making it [10!!!] times expensive, their money and time go to developing MAPS. YEARS!!! Long bugs, that ruins the game, various exploits, cheats, spawn issues, broken map parts, abusive mob mechanics, dupes, this list continue for hours. Devs don't work on this anymore. They promised not to abandon ARK: SOTF and failed miserably, making the game PAID, a PAID battle royal with no updates since 2016. How do you like that?"

My best memories will forever be in my brain. so many adventures so many friends and so many DEATHS ... not to count the ones I gave to my best girl... ""the lets see what happens if"" deaths...

4751,"the game is great although i would not recommend playing on a cheap computer. although if you do it still runs decent, it just will have some major lag spikes here and there, as i play on a $200 computer and i still get them very rarely after the initial startup of a game and unless i load in a cave or a massive over spawn of dinos the game runs fairly smoothly"

4761,"This game is approved of master George Pig aka Peppa pig's Brother. This game has the best boss battles i have ever seen and my favourite boss would be the Dodo Bird. The Dodo Bird is the final boss of the game and he emerges from the darkness of space to get revenge on you the player for torturing its kind for decades. The games story is also marvellous and its all based on torturing dodo birds then to fighting weak bosses, all to summon THE ALMIGHTY DODO BIRD aka Steve."

4795,yes
4796,"Addictive almost too addictive, especially on public servers. It can be compared to modded Minecraft of Space engineers but instead of ships and mods, dinos. Even after 137 hours I still barley know about 60% of the dinos in the game. For beginners I heavily recommend Ragnarok or the island in private multiplayer. Public multiplayer is comparable to Rust but with dinosaurs and please don't play on a server with dino transfers."
4797,yooooo
4798,I became slave everytime I join a pvp server
4799,"I would avoid this mess of a game. It is not optimized in any way. The graphics are meh at best. The game has huge frame rate drops, is laggy, and runs terribly compared to other games like conan or seven days to die. There is a lot of stuff to see but getting around and actually exploring is a terrible experience. This game is just a mess and is not looking like its getting any better.  Also buyer beware this game takes hundreds of gigs of hard drive space to install. Yes if you don't install all the dlc maps the game install file is smaller but right now with all dlc maps installed I am at almost 360 gigs of hard drive space being used for this one game, and it doesn't even run well. As contrast conan exiles takes 120 gigs of hard drive space and seven days to die only takes 37 gigs of hard drive space. So just be forwarned."

4808,AA
4809,good
4810,dino.
4811,It has some good mechanics but its just to frustraring for most people. There are too many bugs and if you play on a PvP server you will probably achieve close to nothing. Singleplayer is ok and if you want your own good server you have to pay for it. If you buy this game be prepared for a lot of farming and getting your butt kicked. It sounds like I wouldn't like it but for me all these problems are not that bad. I can have my fun if I want to and the hidden story/lore is actually very good. Just give it a try when its for sale and figure out if you like it or not.

4822,"It is packed to the brim with content. For me this is in the top 3 survival games. I recommend this game to everyone, every gamer needs to have this much fun!"
4823,half a thousand hours I will never get back
4824,"yes
"
4825,"echt super cool want er zijn weinig frouwe
"
4826,"wow,  I just realised I've player over 2K hours on this game. Enough, I'd imagine to have a reasonable opinion of the game.
I've played on The Island, Ragnarock, The Centre, Valguero, Crystal Isles and currently on Fjordir. Crystal Isles has been my favourite so far just due to variety of biomes and dinos.
I mostly love the building aspect of the game (although not adverse to a bit of breeding and caving :P). There's such a wide range of mods providing an ample selection of building types that can often be mixed together for incredible results. You can also play without any mods which obviously limits what type of buildings you have.
There are some lovely maps out there with breathtaking landscapes encouraging the avid builder to want to place down foundations and build a base. I'm personally a huge fan of building over/near waterfalls and always want to see a floating Ark through my kitchen window.
Its a brutal game when you're starting out, especially alone.. much better with friends. Everything is against you - so whilst you stand there trying to figure out what to do - you're getting hungry/cold and those flesh eating dinos are wandering one step closer to you. The cries and chaos of nearby veg eaters can often be the best sign that danger is close. So pay attention to everything if you wanna survive longer.
The biggest advice I can give is - do not give up! keep punching those trees and making tools/clothes/huts.. which will eventually turn into castles with dinos you can ride and fine equipment. 
This game really requires you put the time in to reap rewards and game satisfaction. If you're not a grinder, likely this game aint for you, but hugely satisfying if you have the time and patience.
The cons - mainly the game optimisation. It's really tough on your machine. Mine is built for gaming (graphics/memory) but I know people who struggle to run this, often with disconnects. I can't really be specific about this 'cause i'm not really into specs, I just have witnessed it being an issue when I had a lesser machine or for other people I play with.
Looking forward to seeing Ark2!

4845,Amazing game. Would Recommend especial since it be came free.
4846,very cool and fun game
4847,"ARK has a huge place in my heart ♡ and for a loooong time now. 

When you find great people to play with, it becomes a completely different game ^^ I recommend it be played with friends to be able to progress in a meaningful and fulfilling way. 

Otherwise, you'll be rage quitting in no time :-&

It's rough being alone. But, that's also why there's plenty of dinosaurs to befriend :>

I recommend this game if you adore the thought of getting emotionally attached to your dinosaurs; just to have them ripped away from you because the world decided to glitch :')

We veteran ARK players know how unforgiving it can be to survive on these crazy awesome maps.

BUT... the reward of working hard for or stealing the things you want, is enough immersion for me.

Sink your teeth into savage territory, friends ;-)"
4848,Very fun. Plenty to do! Never a dull moment.

4861,"Wake up on beach. 

See Dodo. 

Tame Dodo. 

Dodo gets eaten by raptor. 

You get eaten by raptor. 

You grind for a bit and then tame the raptor"
4862,"My only complaint is the south zones seem more like a between easy and medium than just easy. Rexes wander around there as do carnos, a crap ton of raptors, theris, etc. You die quite a few times before really getting a decent base set up, and even once you do, if you havent GRINDED like crazy for metal to make spike walls or a strong house, big predators like carnos will knock it down somewhat easy depending on their level. Not to mention the alpha carno that decided it was a good idea to come along and most of my tames were killed and it took down multiple spike walls in a few hits. Moral of the story is, just make sure you grind and level up fast so you can get decent defenses, and im not against the idea of using console commands to spawn in a good tame to cover your arse until you have good defenses, whether the tame helps you grind or protects your base. Other than the complaints about the aggressive predators spawning a bit too much on the island for it to be easy, this game is quite addicting and i do recommend it, just expect a challenge and to have your favorite tames killed."
4863,"Shit will consume you, but I like ramming pteras into peoples base. I also enjoying making people mad, which is very easy with this game."
4864,it fun
4865,.
4866,"I got the base game on a free promotion and only played single player so far, but from my little experience it is a good game and will be great to play alone or with friends. I'm personally not that into the PvP aspects of the game myself though I did buy the rest of the game based on the time I've played the base game.

4910,So  much nostalgia playing this game.
4911,One of my new favorite games.
4912,I kind of like it.
4913,"This game is fun dont get me wrong, the survival aspect of the game is actually pretty decent. There's a few things in my mind that makes me frustrated and outright bored, (REMEMBER THIS IS ENTIRELY MY OPINION AND DOESN'T APPLY FOR EVERYONE):

Let's start off with one of the obvious flaws that I find annoying is the enemies themselves that cancels your plans ALOT. Wanna go mining up on the mountains? ""Oh hell nah"" send those FAT raptors towards you running faster than Usain Bolt himself, and good luck retrieving your items after because they will be guarding it(I know it's not intentional game design).

Second of all is the CLUTTER of USELESS & UGLY skins that each take up 1 INVENTORY SLOT!!! Like what???? Why should skins take up inventory slots? It just makes inventory management super cluttery, makes no sense.

The building aspect of the game is EXTREMELY poor, the amount of what I would call ""barrier jumping"" tricks you have to do in order to even make something look decent JUST because the ground is just a little bit uneven just makes my creative mind cry. Why cant we place foundations on top of each other? Why can't we make the foundations float? Why can't we clip foundation inside the ground? I know that this game wanna bring some realism to it but come on, it's not a sandbox game without floating/clipping building mechanics.


Decen't game, just the key elements that just makes me not recommend the game."
4914,"I have played this game since beta and it has a deeper connection to me than just a game and i was really disapointed when tek tier came out, i love the idea of cryo pods and trackers, but other than that it just kind of ruined the game for me, i would like to see metal as top tier or maybe even another material other than metal as top tier, but with small advancements into technology such as cryo pods and trackers, i love the more survival empire that you game build not the tek empire, thank you to who all took time to read this and i hope you feel the same way i do"
4915,too many bugs
4916,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH dinos
4917,"dinosaur tame sim

4918,This game has lot's of dinos I'll have you know. I never would have guessed. Me and my friends played this game for hours withougt end and were suprised that there was a dipaladonculus featrued in a Ali-A YoutubeVideo. I may have gotten cancer from this game but it's still enjoyable 170 hours later and in the hospital. (All a joke other than the fact it was fun)
4919,"Highly addictive, Hardcore Survival Grindfest! 

One minute I was starting to play and the next Steam says I've played 100 hours.

4925,"Its a very nice game, but it has SO much more potential then it has right now. The graphics should be updated, so you could run it on higher, more beautiful settings. The fps could also be a bit higher, with some better optimations. Multiplayer on a host world is pure PAIN, ark would be SO much more fun, if they fixed the border around the host, so your friends wouldnt be teleporting to you constantly. But overall, its a very good game, just wished they fixed some of the problems, anounced above"

"
4927,pretty good a little bit boring
4928,"so buggy but an awsome game, ageless and can be played for hours forgetting about time and even more fun w friends. is kinda complicated to know on what settings to play but gameplay makes up for it"

4956,"The game is amazing and wonderful and I haven't even defeated the first boss. However, the controls and settings should be adjusted for new players especially on single player. That is a personal opinion however and others may disagree which is totally fine. This game can be played either hyper challenging or it can be a relaxing dino taming sim. Your choice! Love it but need a guide on settings screen and how to get things from hard to easy or vice versa"

4963,"I already play Ark on the PS4, and playing it on PC only makes it even better!  I love spending my gameplay building bases with complex/intricate design, as well as exploring through the world (to find more spots for additional bases).  I have also always had a passion for dinosaurs since really young, watching Jurassic Park on repeat, so the fact that you can tame and have dinosaurs assist you in adventuring/building/farming, etc. is amazing!  If you have a powerful enough computer, with the graphics all maxed out on EPIC it's pretty satisfying.  This go around, we're also jumping into additional DLC content, including Genesis 2 which has a jetpack (awesome!!!) with all the engrams from previous maps included.  I don't really mess with PvP so I can't speak towards that too much, but playing on a private server with a group of friends is definitely worthwhile."
4964,very good <l>
4965,".
"
4966,"AMAZING graphics, animals, details. The maps and terrain is insane and amazing! Lots of different places, coves, forests, jungles, swamps and you name it! So So SO much fun! It's totally worth the money. You can play on a server, single player, or play with friends. And one of the best things, you get to tame DINOS!"
4967,good
4968,haha funny number
4969,"tame dodo, attatched to dodo, dodo dies, revenge."
4970,"ARK is compelling because of its difficulty. I would call it the ""dark souls"" of survival games. ARK knows no mercy. One wrong move can result in massive losses and set backs.  But therein lies the challenge and its draw."
4971,"Its a really fun game! I mean im just a beginner so I just started but so far the gameplay is amazing. The graphics are very good even with a mid range laptop. It can be quite hard to understand at first but with watching a few tutorials, you can easily  figure it out. Over all 5/5"

5008,"This game has some nice depth and potential, however this is heavily marred by very bad controller support and very bad menu and interface design. Navigating and working in and around menus and cross-hair options is awkward and clunky at best, especially when you're trying to build and place non-snap-able objects with clear sight-lines and precision or try to master the general workflow of motions. In fact, No Man's Sky does this best with their 'maneuverable camera orbit' option for object-placements and the Ark devs should pay very close attention to that if they're going to be staying in the 'dev open-world survival' game at all so that they can learn from it.

Even the creative mode and console commands system is extremely awkward and poorly implemented. This must seriously be one of the worst and most awkwardly designed games (that also has such depth and potential to be great, I mean) that I've ever seen. Because there's just no good sense of work-flow to be found when trying to develop a groove with the game's mechanics. I spent so much time recently trying to ""correct"" the game when it bugged out on me or simply refuted my intentions that I can't even enjoy what I've managed to build out of it anymore.

And forget about doing anything on the fly with tamed dinos in any surprise enemy AI (solo) situations with any skill and grace. The erratically spazzy cross-hair highlight system is more than likely to trip you up and cost you a tamed dino or your own character's life in such situations. Meanwhile, enemy melee AI has perfect aim and never misses. Oh, were you trying to ride your suddenly spazzed flying mount to get away from an enemy ambush of all perfect attacks? Well, because of the erratically appearing and disappearing cross-hair options you have to perfectly spam the ride button -- just don't overspam since that will just dismount you again right into the loving arms (or more appropriately the toothy maws) of your enemies!

...Of course this game requires a high learning curve to master, is ultimately designed for PVPing mega-tribes, and has much tweaking options for private settings -- I am well aware of and fully accept all of that. What I cannot accept is all the inherently bad interface designs that go along with it. When, patiently try as you might, session after session, the 'work' aspect STILL exceeds the 'fun', then you know you've got a horribly interfaced game. (Maybe M+KB is better but I refuse to play exclusively that way and already have to combine in some KBM anyway in order to try and find the best rhythm of play for me.)

P.S. I have many more hours offline and other campaigns both online and offline in this on another account, and have read some of the wiki, so I know how to play this game fairly well already.

P.S.S. Devs need to pay close attention to two very important and much better designed (imo) games and those are 'No Man's Sky' and '7 Days to Die'. They are of course not perfect in every sense, but they do all my complaints here far better justice. And any minor grievances can easily be worked around in order to achieve what the goal of the game should always be once the learning curve has been satisfied for the most part: and that is to have fun."
5009,people are toxic and will wipe out everything you've built just to be jerks. Servers are laggy and Cheating is allowed by developers so don't waste your time or money.
5010,"Honestly one of, if not, my favorite games. It is absolutely fantastic in terms of survival, between taming and fending off dinosaurs and other creatures, there is many play-styles that you can choose. There is over 200 creatures some tameable and some not, some fantasy and others real. There is countless fantastic mods to choose from, all of them enhancing your playing experience."

5032,"This game is very good by itself, but with the mods in the workshop its even better, i really recommend this game if you like dinosaurs, building, and exploring."
5033,"A game -- is a game. Supposed to be for entertainment.   Using it for political pushes and agendas is not what they should be about.  Ark was always a game with potential but lacking bug fixes, optimization, and game play balance against cheats and megas.  Agendas and political views... really just not called for in my opinion."
5034,"this is a really fun game where you tame dinos
"
5035,this game is peak. I rate it 9/11
5036,im very strict on my mods and i cant even barely play the game without mods. Fix it... Please?
5037,good gamee
5038,games broken and wont open lol
5039,Where is the ark?
5040,This game is huge and the private servers can be fun.  Highly addictive.  A little bit educational when it comes to learning all of the dinosaur names.  Much more involved of an multiplayer online game than some.

5052,awsome game
5053,"funny como a merda, ns absolutamente nada do game mas sei q recomendo e com amigos q sem amigos tb ns como funfa, está aqui a minha dica de como jogar:
1- arranja um escravo
2- faz esse escravo viciar no game
3- ele vai saber jogar o game
4- n faças nada q ele faz tudo por ti
5- ajuda a coletar fiber ou madeira para ele n pensar q é um escravo
espero q essas dicas tenham ajudado e um bom jogo para todos os jogadores q leram esse comentario :)

I wish they would fix this DUPPING stuff and make it not able to happen, cause if not idk how long i will be playing it. It's getting ridiculous man seriously"

5076,Baja
5077,game is shit
5078,Me like dino :)
5079,Dino sick
5080,The game is full of so many bugs it's actually insane. The amount of time wasted due to bugs is fucking mind blowing.
5081,you either be dino friend or dino food. also people need to chill out and go outside playing this game online I swear
5082,I have played this game far more on Xbox but it is still very good and one of my overall favorite games to play.
5083,"Ignoring the issues this game has, it is really good. Open world with dinosaurs, no monetization or very little, steam workshop, good selection of maps to start out with, guns feel nice albeit a low amount of them, and plenty of creatures. Oh yeah, this game looks like Crysis 1...kind'a. 

However, this game has a mess of problems that can't be ignored. Let's start small, shall we? The building is a bit jank, sometimes things will just spaz out when trying to be placed making it feel inconsistent, sometimes why something can't be placed makes no sense, then there is other times where it can be placed and it just falls apart. 

Next issue! This game on occasion will give blueprints that you can't literally use or make because of how many slots of 1 item it might need due to quantity. Just today had an occasion like that with an assault rifle needing so much metal and resources it wouldn't fit into the fabricator...Or other occasions where trying to find the right resource is not existant or remotely possible.

Next on the list is, stuttering. This game stutters, almost all of the frickin time. Whenever loading into a new zone from texture pop in (which is so bad turning around deloads textures then takes a solid 20 seconds to reload them in). Sometimes stuttering would be so bad you'd have to wait a minute before you can play again then it'll kick right back up. 

Up next is optimization...Oh boy where do I begin...This game at menu, the frickin menu, was runnin at 30fps. While in game with occasional dips below 10fps at around a steady 60 - 80 fps (which doesn't last long at all, maybe for a solid 5 minutes at most depending where you are) with consistent 40 - 55 fps or lower. That's damn near unplayable and doesn't not feel fun to play or deal with, especially during boss fights or high intensity encounters with say a giga or a high lvled rex, when you just get froze screened and wind up dying. 

Yet another issue is a map issue/map in general, The Center. Buggy as all can be, did co op on it and water makes your buddy teleport to the host unless host is in water too or better yet moving to a different zone in same water column makes your buddy teleport to you. Tethering on The Center was so bad at times my co op buddy could only move 10ft away from my relative position before simply just being teleported back to me, like he's a dog on a leash. Other times even mid-air he would get teleported below me and usually over water.  Going into caves was chore especially, because I would crash then have to get server up again and then try to survive whatever onslaught of creatures nibbling at my shins or yet there would be so many spawned in at once, it was impossible to move because of loading everything in. Had one occasion where it was literal hundreds of piranhas mixed with other hostile creatures that came after me in the water. 

Even more issues concerning, caving. Can't do it. Would crash for me when loading into zone or one occasion today, so bad  that I could not reload up the server, tried everything I could. That is when I said ""I'm done with this game.""

My GPU is my only bottleneck as I have a 1060 TI with 6 gb of data/ram. The minimum requirements is a 680 with 2 gb...If your game can not at 60 fps or higher with recommended specs or tuned properly minimum specs, then it is not optimized well enough. Before you say my computer is not strong enough, my PC can run Crysis 3 on damn near max settings and not have any stuttering, crashing or freezing issues in all parts of the game. A Crysis game running better (granted it is more linear nor is is open world, but semi-open world in most cases in later half of it), than a Unreal Engine 4 game...Riddle me that. 

So in conclusion, I do not recommend this game. Far too many issues to be even considered polished, too many issues to be considered fun, too many issues with optmization which made it hard to enjoy this game."
5084,Giga sends me into anaphylactic shock 10/10 would recommend

5086,i love spending 3 hours looking for a giga just to find a level 35 and then repeating for the next 4 days

5092,Play time has been an error. Awesome game cant wait till Ark 2 comes out so i can see how trash that's going to be. I wanna hear Vin Diesel's sexing speaking voice also. Add a fast and furious DLC to ark 2

There's worse ways to escape... worse addictions.
If you need to escape life while, stick with video games.
You can do worse than ARK for all it's flaws."

5101,"Fun game for hardcore survival game players.  In the early game, you will be constantly dying on the beach until you aren't it's really all there is to it.  Make sure you have a good graphics card before playing, it does not run well without one but otherwise this is a very fun game for dino lovers and sci-fi fans alike"
5102,"fun game, i can sit down and play for hours. always something else you can do, make a new base, get more dinos, go find new animals, caves to defeat, got multiple maps to play on and is always a adventure."

Since a while all the whistle commands don't work anymore, i lost at least 7 high tier animals because of this. 
Don't touch the game, it makes you mad, like completely. 
Getting kicked out of the server multiple times a day was completely normal, bugging into the underground happens a lot, bed respawn is bugged as hell. 
I have so many hours in this game and while i enjoyed it a lot back in the days, i am done. 
There are legit no decent server, player base is pretty much dead, without mods is the game literally unplayable."

5138,"Game overall review
- Good, it's a lot of fun but people just don't give it a chance cause of how time consuming it is.

Community
- Most of it's toxic, but there are some really nice communities if you look hard enough. Please don't trust random people you find on Ark, they will likely be chill for the first few days but then they will steal all your stuff and leave the tribe with no trace, this is known to the community as insiding. I recommend inviting existing friends to avoid being insided.

Modding
- Lots of awesome mods, anywhere from playing straight up tower defense to minigames like capture the artifact.

How time consuming is this?
- If you are playing PVP, it's very time consuming if you want to survive, otherwise it's just however long you play. But in general, this game is very time consuming.

How demanding is this game?
VERY. I have an RTX 3070, R5 3600, 16GB of 3200MHz DDR4 yet it's still a laggy mess on some maps using low settings. (Fjordur mainly) However, if you have a bad PC, you can still play this game with the use of apps like GeForce Now.

When should I buy this game?
- Buy it when it's on sale and you have watched many videos of this game to know what you are jumping into because you are absolutely not refunding it because of how time consuming it is.

Learning curve?
- The learning curve is not too big for the basics of the game but even as somebody with over a thousand hours I still learn new stuff about the game everyday.

How much is there to do?
- Too much to comprehend.

How buggy is this game?
- You'll run into many bugs in your playthrough because Wild Card would rather work on a second game than fix their existing game.

It's a survival game, do whatever you want. I don't know what else to add here other than GAME IS FUN."
5139,Good game and you should play it now because then you can get ready for the next ark 2 with Vin Diesel and then i hope that they will do a fast and furious event that could be fun

5154,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

5186,"Despite it saying I only have 11 hours in this game at the time of this review, I actually have over 400 hours. I used to play this game on Epic(They gave it out for free) using a scuffed 3rd party app for mods. Definitely much better switching to Steam.

That being said, without mods, this game is pretty bad. If you buy it, I highly advise you to at least search up and download some of the essential mods like S+. While this game isn't horrible without mods and is still pretty fun, it can get annoying and hard to play. With mods, this game is one of my favorites of all time."
5187,yes

10/10 good game"
5190,"The UI took a long time to get used to, as it's not intuitive to one who's played MANY other PC games and multiplayer Online games, however, once past that hurdle the survival aspect, along with building and the many dinosaurs to kill and tame, more than make up for the trouble."
5191,"As someone with about 1000 hours put into ark, I would recommend this game but if your someone that's inexperienced with video games, you might not have the best time. This game can be very unforgiving at times and very nice to you at others. If you get this game, you might absolutely love this game, like me, or have a horrible time. It's up to you if you want to get this game but personally with my experience I would recommend it."

5221,"Pretty good game overall, it's really easy to get yourself lost in a little universe of your own. It's lots of fun to run around the ARKs and tame different dinosaurs, not to mention the lore scattered around the game in the form of explorer notes. And if your experience in ARK ever gets boring, there's a plethora of mods to chose from and make your experience in ARK just that bit more interesting."

5255,"Beautiful game.  Open world survival.  No quests.  Build, tame, battle bosses, explore and find notes.  That's pretty much it.  Seems like there should be nothing to do?  But there's SO MUCH.  I play single player with a bunch of mods because I love the building aspect."

"
5302,"Meh. It's a pretty bland survival crafting experience. Cool maps, cool concept, but I just couldn't get into it. Taming a bunch of dinos and watching them all die to something 40 levels lower sure didn't help my drive to play either.

Plus the sheer amount of space the game takes up on a hard drive. I've seen bigger and much better looking games take up less, so idk what the devs were doing to cause so much file bloat.

Overall 2/10 game singleplayer. Couldn't even be bothered to play multi. Definitely won't be buying the DLC or Ark 2, let alone likely ever playing Ark 1 again.

At least I can say I finally played it I guess."

On PS4 alone, I've sunk about a thousand or more hours into this game. Got it on PC because I hate myself. Easily the most grueling and insane game I've ever played, to a greater extent if you play ANY of the DLC maps. Tames can take an extremely long time, and raising dinosaurs from birth is for the absolute sadistic. The saving grace for this game is the fact that unofficial servers exist.


11/10."

5326,just can't get enough of this game

Secondly, when I click ""download"" to each one, it opens the game.  STOP OPENING THE GAME IF I NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT FIRST.
Thirdly, cannot play crossplatform with xbox apparently MUST use gamepass and microshite xbox service... And somehow the game is NOT FREE on microshite's Xbox game pass store.  WHY IS IT FREE HERE AND NOT THERE?
Server search screen crashed 5 times.  Couldnt find my friend's Xbox server, despite saying it was crossplatform enabled.

The multiplayer setup is so complicated that by the time I realized it wasn't going to work, I already lost the opportunity to return the game. It's a great game, but the multiplayer is just so wonky that the only options that make sense are to play on a server that's already full of people, or pay for your own private server. There's literally no easy way to just play with a second person."
5334,super fun with friends sadly i have friends
5335,dinos = good game
5336,Very fun literally addicting as shit however be prepared to rage bc this game can also be frustrating as hell
5337,"Been playing this game for years on console and moving to PC has been an absolute blast. Although it can get rough at times, the feeling of accomplishment and progressing when really doing anything in this game feels really good. Playing with even a small group of friends really make this game so much more fun than the core gameplay loop, with all the screwing around and growing as a tribe. Although something that has always been an issue in my opinion is the late game. There really isn't much end game content, and the content that does exist is just so boring and monotonous. Basically breed for days on end until you can defeat the bosses, which the reward is there, but the journey is not worth it. When the end game loop is not fun, it's hard to keep a full set of friends online playing at the same time due to how boring it gets at times. Mods can somewhat fix this issue of lack of end game content, but that's not the vanilla experience of the game that some people like and isn't even made by the developers. Although, for all the garbage this game throws at you whenever it feels like it due to years of unfixed issues and lazy development, this game has a certain charm to it that probably won't be replicated by another game for a while."
5338,The game is realy fun when you play PVE with your friends but also PVP can be alot of fun because you can have multiple people in your tripe and you guys share the same goal.
5339,"Good game, bad devs"
5340,Don't get me started on ark this is one the game I spend almost a year or two on it and it could be too addictive. The gameplay on each turn gives you an idea of what to do in your bored time...recommend online playstyle! You will witness it with your own eyes when your into prehistoric animals and dinos.
5341,i hate this game
5342,epic
5343,You can make someone who has injected their muscles with petrolium jelly.

Also i went on a 15 minute break turned off my pc got back on ark and lost all my 4 hour proces. Would not recommend to anyone its 100% better to wait for ark 2."
5345,this game is shit and boring
5346,"Ark is a very good game. Even though I received the game for free, I would still buy it if i had to. You can beat up dinosaurs and eat them. No other words need to be said."

Survival is more on the Survive wild dinos and extreme heat and cold situations then a food and drink survival, while those aspects are still represented and tweaks to your servers can adjust this to more extreme levels ( including hardcore modes) , by mid game the survival definitely goes towards the big Dino's like rex's . Lots of content and hundreds of hours of gameplay."

5403,"very nice
"
5404,"It's difficult for me to recommend this game. Having about 1,500 hours, I have enjoyed this game as far as it will take me. I like every aspect of it, except the boss battles. Boss fights just aren't my thing.
First I will go into the cons.
Every map seems to follow a very particular... Meta, if you can call it that with a couple exceptions.
1. Typically you want to tame:
anky for metal
doed for stone
therizino for wood
pteranodon for travel.
Almost every game I started REQUIRED these actions. Otherwise I was going to be grinding endlessly for a stupidly low amount of resources for high resource crafts. It's just not efficient, and after repeating this dozens of times, it gets very tiring.
2. Building is an issue. Not one bit of it is enjoyable. Getting the resources, finding a perfect base spot, and building are all frustrating due to the many scuffed bugs that happen during building in particular. Most of the time I dread this, in fact.
3. The absolute necessity that is meta. If you wish to do well, in single player or pvp, you must do specific things. Tame specific dinos, build in inaccessible areas, and breed for hundreds of hours. The game feels very stale, especially for those who are not masochists like those who unironically play on official servers.
4. Most buggy and glitchy game I've ever played. I can't even get into words how frustrating it is losing your character and/or your dinos to a mesh glitch.

Pros:
1. Once you've worked yourself up from a measly little grub on the beach, boy do you feel powerful. The game feels extremely rewarding for pushing past your frustrations and annoyances. Nothing can stand in your way, though when building up, it is very much possible to lose every little thing you worked for. Creates a sense of danger every moment you play the game, which is nice for those seeking a thrill.
2. Highly customizable settings are this game's best attribute. It's truly amazing how you can either play a relaxing save or constantly dangerous and thrilling gameplay. It's all up to you.

Not much else I can say besides, play the game if you're a masochist :)"

5438,"Where to begin...

ARK Survival Evolved is unlike anything you have or will have ever played. A sandbox survival experience in every sense.

From it's initial reach of simply surviving an island overrun with dinosaurs looking to eat you at every turn, to taming them and building your army, as you rise through the ranks of overcoming your survival limitations, in both character progression, and knowledge, to engage with an overarching story that take you from a primitive level of thatch hut living to commanding the skies in tek tier, being able to build as far as your imagination takes you, and using just that to create your own stories, across a range of play modes suited to your play style, in a competitive MMO where the race to be ahead of the competition, and fearing throughout will always be at the forefront, learning new ways to play the game, whether it be just simple in-game mechanics, or full blown game changing mods... and after 7 years running, can still feel as fresh as when you first played it, creates an offering you will never experience elsewhere.

ARK is love. ARK is life."
5439,"Very buggy
20 fps
Died a lot
11/10"
5440,no
5441,very gaming game
5442,"I love this game, but only in singleplayer or cooperative servers. PVP servers take all of the fun out of it for me. Overall an excellent game, very difficult at first. You will die a lot. It has a story but the game isnt focused around it very much."
5443,dino
5444,great game
5445,it gud
5446,fun
5447,"Yes, but only if you have tweaked the world rules. The concept is solid, the core gameplay is fun, if somewhat staightforward, and while I have my own personal gripes with how the creatures scale to each other and the player, (like seriously, how does a 10 tonne triceratops lose to a 2 tonne carnotaurus, why does a 7 tonne parasaurolophus have no defences, why is the giga so enormous) the only real issue with the game is the grind. Resources are heavy, you can only carry so many, and you need loads of them for anything. Taming and breeding creatures can be agonisingly slow, and working at night is suicidal due to minimal visibility. If you are interested in the game, I can only reccomend making night time as short as possible, making taming and breeding speed as fast as possible, and making weight increase a bit faster.

Oh and good god, the graphics settings are broken. Gloves don't render in when you spawn, so you have to unequip and re-equip them, I have yet to find graphics settings that don't leave everything looking kind of pixellated, and the only way I've found to stop the game being stretched and distorted in fullscreen is to go into windowed mode, then back into fullscreen. It doesn't save either, you have to do it again whenever you log in.

Other than that, pretty damn good."
5448,
5449,good
5450,"The only positive I have to say about this game is that no matter what PC you have, it will run like hot garbage."
5451,...
5452,"Do you enjoy dying for stupid reasons?  How about potentially game breaking bugs?  Or waiting hours on end for a virtual animal to wake up so you can ride it.  Well if you answered yes to any of these questions then I believe ARK is for you!

The playerbase is toxic and will destroy all your hard work in a matter of a few hours!  But there are good sides to the game too right?  Yeah, I just cant think of any while writing this review.  And that is why, I am going to give this game a 9/10.  I cant put it down.  Even when I think I am done, I always come back to it.  It's fun with friends I guess.  Idk.  I can feel myself slowly slipping into madness. Been up for 32 hours.  Sleep deprivation is fun right?"
5453,"fun game i like playing wtih dinosaurs and stuff with the dinosaurs
"
5454,"I bought the game today, no playtime 
Character isn’t even created, no bobs only alpha tribes that own their server can recruit me,  if you log off I will popcorn your kit and immediately steal your personal vault and fridge, will use all eggs for crafted recipes even though I have no crafting skill, if I die once no matter what happens I will immediately inside and look for another tribe, I tame 50 dodos a day and constantly breed them, no mutations allowed only pure bloods if I find mutated dinosaurs I will empty the fridge and fill it with my tamed dodos, have a webcam mic and constantly scream, and am eating 24/7, if I find anything that isn’t prim I will popcorn it, real men fight in prim no weapons allowed,  I’m an Amish pacifist, we will not raid anyone or put up any defenses, I will immediately demo them, I am very generous so I talk shit in global and tell people to pull up to raid us for free tames, constantly blasting My Little Pony in the background, I don’t care what situation we are in, I will log off and go play Roblox with my 8 year girlfriend, Ark isn’t worth my relationship, I only pump food and water so my character will never be hungry or thirsty, who needs melee weight or health anyways, I will never farm it’s too much work, and if your babies need imprinted I will leave them out, I will whistle attack my target and send all our tames into a tp and popcorn any form of element as I dislike the way it looks.

5464,"[b][i]ARK: Survival Evolved[/i][/b] has made about [b]$300 million USD[/b] in earnings as of 2020, yet the devs are just as lazy as they've always been. 

The game still runs like absolute trash [b][i]SEVEN YEARS[/i][/b] later since early access release, even on a beefy pc. The game is also so buggy and clunky that you feel like you're still playing the alpha build. Impressive graphics doesn't equal a good game.

5503,"I have over 500 hours in this game on PS4, compared to a lot of ARK players I'm still a noob, so if you aren't ready to turn this into a full time job, don't even bother thinking about getting this game. I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7.

First I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got destroyed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and guard towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Of course once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore, and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.

Pro tip, don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.

1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completely blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.

2.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.)

3.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)

4.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.

5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hundreds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turrets either, refer to 1.)

6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where your base was. You don't get to save any of your gear, you don't get to save any of your dinos, you don't even get to fight back, it's all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.

7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on ""their"" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn't tell them your in game name, but your steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also, if you piss them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to. If you run into anyone named ""123"" and a private profile, BEWARE!

8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes on top. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino is gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.

9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD!

10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't bother, you won't.

Look, I'm tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don't PvP. No PvP skill is required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it, not like you'd have a chance even if you were.

EDIT:
I never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.

Firstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob, especially when I've played the game solo and as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the alpha tribe because I realized just how bad the game panders to them. Here are some more reasons why I will never recommend this game to anyone that I found from my time with the alphas.

1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.

2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things."

5516,Its fun
5517,"A terribly designed, unfun game meant for 10-year-olds. I have no idea how this... awful game is popular. Because it's the only one with dinosaurs I guess? The UI is abysmal, the gameplay loop is dull and punishing for no reward, and everything is hostile. It's basically an extremely polished example of what I'd expect to see if 10-year-olds were AAA game developers. As if to underscore the point, the game makes a HUGE point of having everything poop--constantly--and with great audible fan-fare. Ark might only surpass Subnautica in its level of utter lack of explanation. No tutorial, no guide, no anything. Button mappings don't even follow customary genre guidelines, as if to just make it even more needlessly annoying. This ""game"" is a horrible mess from top to bottom, and I'm not even complaining about the performance (which is... fine... I guess). It's not fun, not interesting, grindy as hell, and needlessly punishing. Just to do what... ride a dinosaur? Whoopdee-do. Oh, and how do 10-year-olds make friends with dinos? By literally beating them unconscious and sharing lunch with them. Yup. Makes sense. Avoid this game, unless you're 10 and grinding for 60+ hours being killed by unseen things constantly makes you excited. Or you just want to literally beat dinosaurs unconscious with a club over and over again. I got this game for free and it still isn't worth it."
5518,"dinosaur slavery, neat!"
5519,"The games very tough but if you like hard fun games with lots of grinding like me this is an amazing game
I have been playing for a long time on ps4 and just recently got it on PC and although the controls area a lot messier i'm still loving the game."
5520,
5521,"After playing solo for 30 hours and having a solid base, lots of dinos, and a lot of fun, a cheater shoves (teleports) his boat into mine and starts spamming tek and teleporting into my base to destroy everything. Its already painful enough to lose your stuff against regular people but losing it all because of a cheater without any effort is just heartbreaking and I don't think I'll ever play this game again knowing that all of your hard grind work can just be destroyed by some cheater.

His name was Bob...."

5580,"Worst gaming experience i've had ever, bad performance, horrible UI, lack of game design, boring gameplay, and so on. Most positive reviews of the game are memes or plain jokes. 

Even if you got this game for free, you were scammed."
5581,E
5582,"Truly horrible server issues, such as completely losing your character out of the blue, and having to create a new one, which means you lose all your stuff and your tamed dinosaurs. Even in dedicated servers. 

Honestly fed up with all the troubleshooting, forum browser etc to try and fix issue after issue. Today we spent about 4 hours total setting up to play. To once we were done, my character being gone. We didn't get to play or do anything with this free time, it's not the first time, certainly it won't be the last and support is useless. If I could I would get a refund at this point and scrub ark from memory."

5584,"Was starting to lose hope in video games with the abundance of microtransactions and repetitive mechanics amongst other games. This game has blows me out of the water so far and I'm still in the early portions of the game 62 hours in. There's a plethora of mechanics that synergize  with one another incredibly well. There's no pay for any in game advantage, and, I haven't even experienced the pvp component of the game as well. 10/10 would recommend."

- great base building
- super cool dinos

- huge map with both easy and difficult zones

cons:
- quite hard if world options aren't changed 
- losing everything in dangerous zones can quickly get nerve racking
- pretty bad visuals but not so much fps
- 140 GB, how ??

the game clearly isn't perfect but once you get used to it you are going to spend countless hours upgrading your base, leveling up, taming dinos and exploring new biomes.

I was trying to build the fence to keep out spawning dinosaurs out of my garden/yard which for some unknown reason kept wandering and stomping all over my stuff*As if on purpose*. The last straw was trying to find a cure for swamp fever, which was caused a down ward spiral to losing 3 good dino’s.  Why the character does not have the ability to pull off leeches by hand is beyond me. I hope they fix this crap on the one they are working on."

5626,This game is a masterpiece. The worlds are beautiful and the dinosaurs are amazing. One thing i recommend is when starting out to never touch pvp servers its absolutely awful do pve first or a solo world to understand the game to its fullest than go to pvp if you want to suffer. most players go pvp first and its the worst mistake they have ever made. Go pve and you will you have the best time of your life also Dlcs are worth it if they are on sale.
5627,I see people making funny reviews and getting awards. I do want them too but I can't think of anything hilarious. sadge.

No matter your choice you are sure to enjoy discovering the world around you…. except for the ocean because f*ck the ocean there is nothing there for you but fear and death. Especially if your GPU can’t handle the high graphics settings as you are sure to encounter nothing but low rez, poly nightmare fuel. The only downside to ark other than the ocean is it’s lack of replayability unless you want to buy dlc content which is sadly is like the main game and is just a one and done.

Join another random server and spawn in 30000 ingame days late. Even worse ingame performance. Weird text rendered over every single player made object. Horrendous pop-in and terrible graphics with textures on high looks like an impressionist painting, but not with composition or style. Whole server is filled with giant player bases. Start dying immediately from hunger, no tutorials on how to do anything ingame. Scavenge for some berries and wood, damage myself maybe by gathering the berries? Eat 20 berries to try to regain health. Item acquired, human feces. Character instantly keels over dead. Game locks up and won't let me respawn.
And that's the story of how I uninstalled this garbage pile. Can't believe people pay hundreds in base game+dlc for this joke."

5748,"Highly recommended this game as it has a lot of content.
You will have to get around a couple of minor visual bugs such as lighting.

Something I will say is you need the Immersive Taming mod, and if you are playing with a group ECOs mods, with structures plus.
Then youll find a youtube video stating the Ark: Balance patch and the settings tweak for single player DO THAT.

Side note.
Mods should be created to revamp the game so its updated to the most recent survival type.

I enjoy The Forest Building structures idea, where you carry the logs. Have to have a cart to push rocks, logs, sticks etc. this would hype the SURVIVAL.

I also enjoy SCUM how the inventory space is set as backpack and clothing space.
""GRID"" and for sits and giggles maybe adding infection and medication.

Now just imagine the gameplay if we had to do more as the character to start, not instantly tame and then be able to mass harvest.
The dinos should be set as ""TOOLS"" NOT storage holders.
Creating holders for the dinos would! make the game better.
Yeah I know its never gonna happen but a modder could see my post and be like WOW that would be sick!"

5785,"I recommend this game especially if you got it for free like me. It's far from a perfect game but it does a lot of things right. However there's so many things that bother me in this game.
Don't get this game if you plan on playing on your own. Playing with a friend or make a new friend is a much better experience!!!!!

+ So many hours worth of content
- A large portion of it is just doing chores like feeding your dinosaurs or grinding materials.
+ This game has great progression, not overwhelming whatsoever
- This game is painfully difficult to start on depending where you spawn. You can't really fight back against anything significant and any dino can ruin you.
+ The dinosaurs are cool and often have a lot of useful abilities.
- The AI of the dinosaurs is pretty awful
+ You can make bases the way you want
- There's pillars everywhere claiming territory where you want to build, this is very annoying.
+ PVE community is a good community.
- I keep glitching through the floor when I log out and get drowned by someone so they can steal my stuff.
- This game demands you to get on a very frequent basis, otherwise you'll be punished heavily
- THE SERVERS ARE SO BAD
- Raising some dinosaurs is so tedious, it's not fun and takes up so much time.
- In PVE people can troll you and go offline and there's nothing you can do against it.

I got this game for free and I bought all maps too, I don't regret spending money on this game nor do I regret playing this game but it is a little too time demanding. This game becomes a full time job."

5838,"ARK is a busted, ugly, broken ass game, but there's a reason people enjoy it so much, the developers have clearly cashed in on a niche that hasn't been explored in this way before and there's a lot to enjoy, I just wish that one day they could optimize their damn file-sizes. Also research into the behaviors of these animals could do the game some good, rather than just random spawns of animals and basic ""see food enemy, eat"" AI, with as long as this game has been out, there are a lot of aspects that could have been given love and attention. Regardless, this is a decent little dino survival game, it just needs more attention in places that matter, it's fun and all to have all these giant maps with cool dinosaurs, but it's for naught if the rest of the game isn't polished and fleshed out."

5853,"Play if you like dinos, space magic, and dying

5854,"The premise of this game is something I've wanted in a video game since I was child. However, there are a number of really obvious base level issues with this game that the devs never bothered to fix which severely hold it back. So much wasted potential with this game. I got the base game when it went free and bought the DLC pass for $20USD and definitely regret my purchase. 

The first issue is obvious when you try to download the game. I bought the DLC pass and went to download all the game + the DLC listed on the store page. The files are apparently not compressed. The game takes 432.6GB on my harddrive without any additional mods being added. You should also expect frequent downloads to the game ranging from less than a GB to 10s of GB. 

Second, the animal animations are hardly existent. My first encounters with animals showed me that them attacking basically consist of them running into you and a hitbox on the front of their head doing tick damage every few tenths of a second rather than them actually animating attacks. The walking animation are obviously clumsy and look like something from an alpha build of a game with animals getting stuck on terrain features, walking up impossible cliffsides, and sometimes randomly flying into the air. Also, beware of flying Kaprosuchus, my first game I was ""ambushed"" by it and it literally jumped 50+m into the air with my in its mouth. 

The game is filled with bugs past just the animals. In multiplayer servers, you will frequently encounter players that are under the map. Even in single-player, these bugs can be frustrating. Multiples times I've just been walking along and die randomly to weird collision meshes on the maps.

Animal AI is also a joke. Animals will pick fights seemingly without any regard to the winability of the battle (you routinely see small animals pick fights with apex predators and get predictably destroyed.) You'll also see things like herbivores you get a bit too close to chasing you relentlessly across the map. Once combat starts, the animals essentially just sprint at you doing tick damage for you hitting their hit boxes and don't stop. Most animals are reduced to killing machines that fight anything within their detection range. 

After you get a grasp on that, you'll see that the leveling system is a lot of grinding. ARK becomes a chore simulator as you work to feed yourself, your dinosaurs, and level up. The system they have in place isn't fun nor rewarding. After playing, my friends and I largely felt like it was a waste of time. 

Next comes issues with crafting, one of the core features of this game. The crafting menus are terribly designed, with obvious category issues like ""wooden stairs"" not being listed under ""wooden structures.""  The UI is very clunky, after you finally level up and unlock many of the craftable things, you pretty much have to use a search function and remember the name (if you don't, it could take up to multiple minutes to find a specific item.) Building also has a bunch of weird quirks that at times made me laugh at the absurdity of it. The distinction between what is craftable by your person, and what you need some sort of crafting station for seem completely arbitrary. The placement of structures onto the ground is not great and often leads to buildings look pretty bad without putting a lot of effort into it. The most I laughed while playing this game came when I was trying to build a bridge. I knocked out support pillars and one of the 2 sides connecting it to land and nothing happened, but after rebuilding them, demolishing a single floating pillar left alongside the bridge made the entire thing collapse. 

I'll also mention that one of the things listed as DLC (Primitive+) is completely broken and unusable. I have attempted to play this, but it pushes load times way up to 20+ minutes. Chances are it will crash quickly if it does manage to load. When I looked on the forums, the community acted like people asking about this were idiots for expecting something listed on the official Steam page to work. It's not supported at all by the devs.

Lastly, the community is extremely toxic. This is easily one of the most toxic player communities I've encountered. The way servers are set up seem to promote griefing so that it forces out randoms and their slot of the sever can be taken by friends of the griefers. I would recommend avoided any public server, unless getting repeatedly killed when you start by players with high level gear over and over and over is your idea of a fun time. Anytime you mention problems on forums, fanboys basically act like your an idiot for expecting basic issues to be fixed by the dev. Practically any forum thread I've seen with some criticism or legitimate concerns about the game has them getting insulted for posting.

From playing the game, it's obvious the devs released this into early access and just keep piling new things on the game to encourage people to buy new DLC rather address the core issues with the game, and it's really disappointing."
5855,allways been a fan give it a try
5856,great game 4 survival game nerds ( totally not me) or dinosaur  chads.
5857,"Ark definitely has some flaws, but it's a great game nonetheless. I picked it up a couple months ago (at review time) when it was free, but it's definitely worth $30. There are also plenty of free DLC maps to download and play (they take up a lot of space because of their size though, so be ready for that).  I would recommend turning down the difficulty settings, especially for a first run, because this game is hard on its defaults. To summarize it, it's good fun in singleplayer, and great fun in multiplayer.

okay that's all the serious you can get out of me in one day"

5903,"~250gb to install a game is not even slightly reasonable. I don't care how expansive or amazing you think your world is, it's not worth that space on my hard drive, let alone the time it takes to download. (I don't know what the compressed download size is, and I'm not freeing up a quarter of a terabyte to check right now. My point still stands that it's ridiculous.)

If you disable all DLC, it's ~180gb. This is still not acceptable.

The game itself is quite a lot of fun if you have people to play with, but as someone with fairly slow rural internet, I will never download this game again."

5909,"The loop of taming, exploring, and crafting is really satisfying. There's a ton of content, none of it is perfect, so it's a big space with lots of little structures and shapes to fill in. If you like survival crafts or dinosaurs, this one should be on your list.

Officials and PVP can be somewhat toxic, especially for new players. I'd recommend finding a streamer on twitch/youtube you like who has an unofficial server they host for the community."

5920,"highly recommend this game been playing for years and love it even now 
"
5921,yupp
5922,"This game can be grindy at times, and it can be a bit overwhelming and boring at the same time, but playing it with friends really helps, and there are some truly awesome mods for this game so it gets a massive thumbs up from me. A lot of fun!"
5923,game very good but has a good amount of bugs like getting stuck under the map and dinos getting stuck and crashes bc of mods but overall very good game I got the game free btw
5924,very fun
5925,Good Game

5927,long time downlode da game game in fese
5928,"I love this game! i got it a week ago and already have over 40 hrs on it. It is really fun, but if you get to level 38 and tame a Pteranodon, remember to land before you exit the game or it kicks you out of your saddle, and depending on how high up you were, you might die."
5929,bad
5930,It's a good game.
5931,"Not only it takes half of your computers space, it also heats up your pc like it's a miner. 
Players are either absolute newbies or 3k+ hour veterans.
90% of the base locations are under the map.
A ton of fun 10/10 would bang again. Can't wait for Ark 2"
5932,"Punching dinos in the face to befriend them. Just like in real life I beat up a gecko trying to sell me car insurance then I fed it some nearly spoiled meat, then upon awakening (apparently forgetting I was the one who beat him half to death due to some irreversible brain damage), we become best friends forever…  until he gets brutally murdered and harvested by another player during a raid. Gill your memory will live on. 10/10 would play again!"
5933,greatest game of all time
5934,Almost 12 000 hours on Epic as well best game of it's type.
5935,"I don't know what the frick is wrong with this game. One day everything works just fine an the other day is a complete sh!tshow.. Suddenly I have 7 FPS or cant even join the non-dedicated server of my friend, while another friend has no problems at all. It ist really fun to play..  IF IT WORKS
Don't buy it, if you want a stable game.. fr, I hope they fixed this shit in Ark 2..."
5936,"Good premise, flawed execution. buggy, unbalanced and weird logic. fun game to play with friends, but it needs a lot of fixes."
5937,I both hate and love this game
5938,"Creative mode is autism on steroids

There is No reason to make it so hard for single players. Single players are the relaxed casual people who are the majority funding this mess. 

Well I advise you the player, to not buy this expecting to build creating with creative mode with any ease unless you like to put your junk into a blender over and over and set it on OMG WHY. 

You have to use Game engine bugs just to build areas in the air using hatches fences and other dark magic in single player where no one gives a **** offline. 

You have no real sorting feature unless you want to sort 500+ things manually into a bloody folder or seek outdated mods that are sorting things based by what the mod creator desired as Sorted.


Long story short
The game is beautiful and great, but the creative mode is breaking your ass in the aspect of surviving into a devolved spectrum of caveman games. There are constant ""You have no foundation messages"" or This area is too high. 

A real Jank god builder mode. Wait for the reviews on ark 2 maybe the devs will give a fu** by then

But seeing as they tried to screw us over with Gatcha wwII planes and tanks in a dated Pirate Island sequel  

Don't hold your breath expecting not to drown in their Get rich gatcha.."

5941,"I want to start this off by saying that I am on the fence about recommending this game. The game is pretty, fun, entertaining, great for people who like dinosaurs/fantasy creatures, and those who like modding games. However, the game is very badly optimized (as I am sure many have said before me). This can cause the game to run badly on lower end pcs. For example, my old desktop pc that I purchased in 2015 struggled to run this game from 2016 to 2019 (I upgraded to a new pc in 2019 but we will get to that later). Single player was okay to run, however, I wanted to play with friends on a server. It could take me 30 minutes to 4 hours to get into the server. I could also crash at any moment in the game, anywhere. Yet, I still played the game all the time because I loved it. That's part of the reason I'm so torn about this review. I love the game when it can be played how it is meant to be played, but the optimization, occasional game breaking bugs, and huge download stray me away from a positive review. Currently on my new pc, I have no troubles running the game. I still love the game, even if I haven't played it in a while. 

TLDR: The game is hard to run on low-end pcs but for those who have higher-end pcs, it's a fun game with plenty to do. I mean, look at my hours."
5942,Dinosaur
5943,Good game.
5944,im a little addicted to it
5945,good game
5946,A great survival game.

"
5951,Awechum
5952,Fun to play with friends.
5953,this game is a really enjoyable game and id say the most addicting games out there {in a good way} but there are some down sides like loading onto some servers can be  troubleing but that might just be my pc. overall a solid 9.5 out of ten a well made game for pc players like myself that like survival/openworld games like this one id say that this game is my favorite just because the challenge :}
5954,"Live, survive, tame dino, die, repeat.
Totally recommend it!"
5955,"This is a pretty good crafting/survival game. I like to play this on my own and see what I can build, like Minecraft, but better!"
5956,Great game
5957,"In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.

The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.

This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.

This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.

The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.

The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.

Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.

I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.

Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.

Enjoy"
5958,I watched a total of like 24 hours worth of videos on this game and I still have no idea how to progress.
5959,Honestly ist a preety fun game with mods

Just knowing I can fuck on demand... Whenever I want... She’s still blowing me in fact and she has big boobs! well, what can I say? Just a regular day for me. I can’t imagine how jealous you must be."
5984,very fun with friends.
5985,Fix your original game before making a 2nd that'll be just as fucked up because you're incompetent.
5986,Ark is a amazing game for people who want to have a good time and have fun and it's very addicting
5987,"This game is excellent! It is the perfect balance of exploration, action, building, and everything else. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. If you have friends that also have 'ARK' then this games fun doubles instantly! It can be a little buggy at times but if you can get over that then the game is nothing but a masterpiece! If you do end up gettin' it, then I wish you the best of luck and the funnest and most memorable moments. Good luck future survivors!"
5988,good af
5989,id say this is one of the best games on earth although it takes up an insane amout of memory

6035,"A very fun and captivating game, requires a lot of time and research to explore everything there is"
6036,"started the game, made a world, made my character, made him look weird as hell, died and quit the game.

Gud game"
6037,yes
6038,very gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooodie
6039,"This is a fun game for people who like adventures, sci-fi, and dinos."
6040,T-rex innit
6041,i have fun a lot in this game but i don't think that they work a lot on it
6042,"The only thing polished are the turds. You will need to add mods to make it acceptable.

Lots of google searching required. Very weak guidance on subtle gameplay mechanics. You will die and lose progress for dumb reasons constantly. Menus are a compromise between controller and keyboard; best of neither world, average of both. Once you get past these things and grasp all the ins and outs, the game can occasionally shine.

Beautiful worlds, although the coloration of the creatures is downright absurd sometimes.
Fairly good setting for graphics, brightness control is via command line. Not the most fun but what's a survival game without survival challenges, right?

Movement is poor. Physically, you are more like a ball than a biped. You will ramp off cliffs for no reason and die from fall damage instead of sliding down. Go s-l-o-w-l-y. Recommend attempting parkor constantly because it WILL be a survival skill. I've been chomped plenty after failing to escape by tying to jump over/past obstacles that are knee high.

Okay that's all. Go have fun. Best with a friend."
6043,I have played since it was a beta on console. On PC though you can use mods which makes the experience play more like a video game vs. like another aspect of your life.
6044,ooga booga dino :)
6045,fun
6046,It's a really fun game game to play as there is so many different things to do it's almost endless nevermind the fact that there's dinosaurs. I will say it is a pretty grindy game but is really fun and even better when u have friends to play it with. Would really recommend!
6047,survival among dino's ... nuff said
6048,Big dino killed me
6049,"literally no point starting this game, you'll spawn maybe do a note run, make a shit base, then some high level will come destroy your shit base while your asleep, graphics remind me of world of warcraft back in 2006, the game has its unique things, but if you want a survival game that has a halfway decent community play Rust"
6050,"a hard and fun game really good
"
6051,"i love that game, becouse denosaurs were my childhood hobby"
6052,"I always come running back to ark. I have never played PVPVE servers but single player in this game is fun, grindy, and has millions of possibilities. I also have yet to fight any of the bosses but 10 out of 10 recommend this game to anyone into survival and anyone who wants some pet dinos."
6053,"I own this game on PC, Playstation, Xbox, Switch, iPhone and Steam Deck.  So it's ok I guess."
6054,"This game is so dogshit but it's the dogshit you'll keep playing.
It's so buggy but it's funny buggy. It's so ugly but funny ugly. It will also kill your pc :)

Aberration and Extinction are the best maps.

Otter is life and so is Kevin the goat."
6055,Fricken Awesome Game!!!
6056,good
6057,Men
6058,dinos :)
6059,"I hate having 400 gb of extra storage
I hate having time to do things i enjoy
I hate Games that have 0 bugs
I hate devs that do nothing whe someone gets hacked/loses their character 


this game is perfect for me"
6060,so fun but its lage
6061,Great game!
6062,"I love this game.  There is so much to do. You can play PvE for casual mode where you can build up epic and unique bases and decorate it. There are plenty of dinosaurs and pets to tame.  Many dinosaurs have some sort of purpose to help you advance in the game like helping you obtain materials faster.  In PVE mode you can play at your own pace with out worrying about your base being destroyed. If PvP is your thing, they got that to. In fact, the biggest Ark community are pvpers. In PvP mode you build bases to defend and you raid others.  Dinos also help you with these things too.  Its extremely immersive. The maps are beautiful with many different terrains and ecosystems. There is literally something for everyone in this game.  I'd recommend this game to everyone."
6063,"I got this game when it was free, I knew I couldn't play it because my ROG pc died a few weeks ago. So I rented at GeForce Now (Cloud gaming. If your pc sucks like mine, give it a try, but Nvidia is not the only one, make sure you check out their compatible games) and discovered one amazing game.

Not always easy to figure out if you are like me and do not look at tutorials or walktroughs but when you discover something new you're super glad about it.

You're going to die a lot at first (Probably), but the amazing graphics and polyvalent gameplay are gonna make you continue. HUGE inventory (So far I added and added and never went out of space), lots of nice little crafts and interactions with the dinosaures. The only thing I would say is bad is the way you tame them. But it's ok, makes it easier in a sense.

Not scary but can be nerve tensing at some moments. It's a survival so yeah, you're going to have crafting, fishing, hunting and building. If I am completely honest it's not standing out from the general mechanic, but the fact that it is dinos.. And not just always normal dinos as well... I mean... ;)"
6064,Dinosaurs go Rawrrr
6065,"JUST AMAZING
"
6066,"super fun

6078,very good i like it but rust better
6079,awdawdawd
6080,The is is great and all but it's a Buggy mess.
6081,"Great game for masochists, in case life isn't already hard enough. Plenty of things to explore, then promptly get killed by due to your own unknown negligence-- It can be a bit grindy at times, but the configuration is plenty adjustable to whatever level of difficulty works best for you~ Altogether a great game, albeit with some rough edges, but highly recommended if you have the patience for it."
6082,"I went to the server, I was framed and held captive for 2 hours"
6083,hgf
6084,yeah
6085,dinosaurs cool
6086,is gud
6087,"Ark, a game of the best! The best of the best. Be the on on-top in a game, that is base on a time back, where the fit of the fit survive! Although there are some modern stuff, idk how that got there?"
6088,GOOD GAME
6089,"ARK: Survival Evolved is an unfinished game with a lot of bugs and glitches that can ruin a day's/ week's worth of work in an instant. The 7 year old child who designed the server list should be fired as I've seen better ""server list management"" 15 years ago, when I didn't need 30 minutes to find the server I'm searching for...when the unfinished game decides to eventually search for servers that is."
6090,this game is so good
6091,just bye this game dont think
6092,It's a good game. Fun to play with friends and solo.
6093,this is shit with hacks
6094,"Step 1: punch some trees to get ressources, barely survive the first few minutes/hours
Step 2: tame your first dinos, be excited
Step 3: expand your empire with your friends, start to breed and get bigger dinos
Step 4: disregard real life for a week or two
Step 5: Have more ressources, tames, than you can ever spend
Step 6: One shot all bosses
Step 7: Fly around in TEK, with Lasers and stuff to annihilate the area where you first died
Step 8: revenge is best served in TEK

Game is still a bit yanky here and there but alot of fun with friends, even official servers have serveable harvesting rates etc. Some Fjordur tames feel like cheating but its the end of Ark anyway. Really hyped for Ark 2! 
Be aware, once you are hooked you are hooked!"
6095,We want to play with  friends not be teleported evrey second or if we go in a cave!!!

6100,This game provides hours of entertainment and many different ways to progress through the game i would definitely recommend this game.
6101,GREAT GAME!!!!!!
6102,"This is a very great game in my experience , its quite challenging and exciting , there are so many things to do and the maps are great one of the games that i have surely enjoyed, however if u are going to play this its hard for low end pc's its laggy i would play this when i get a better spec computer in the meantime i will play this on mobile version."
6103,Currently my top game
6104,"This game is probably the glitchiest of all of my favorites, but it is still one of my favorites. Dinosaurs + Sandbox was probably the last thing I'd ever imagine a game being, but Ark fulfills that strange category beautifully. There are plenty of mods and server edits you can make to personalize your experience as well. I adore Ark. ♥"
6105,pls give me points plz
6106,very fun game :)
6107,"honestly on my console i have over 4k hours and ive been playing pc ark for a bit and it is great.

6129,Good Game
6130,"Fun idea. Terrible game. Horrible development.

Dozens of day-0 QoL issues, never fixed. Devs absolutely have no respect for your time or your hands. Mod community has saved this game. Devs left and joined the Rust studio to make Atlas. Every system implemented has glaring problems and bugs: design, implementation, QA - all are abhorrent. Amateur crap-fest.

This says it all: https://www.thegamer.com/ark-survival-evolved-buggy-bad-addictive-game/
Specifically: ""There's has been a constant flow of new maps, new dinosaurs, new DLC packs to buy, and even more on the way, but the game has never been polished in a way that shows a respect for players and their dedication to the game."""
6131,Got foundation wiped by a pig on PVE incredible

6149,"I really liked this game, i love the dinosaurs and being able to tame them, its a really fun to explore the map and fly around on a dino, building is also really fun because i just love building these big houses and being safe in them. Its cool how you can get tons of dinos and make an army of raptors or any dinosaur. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes dinosaurs and survival games, thank you."

6188,"I got this for free with a deal they were doing, and I regretted it. I will admit, I have not gotten to the late game, but why should I when doing something as simple as building a 2 x 2 home a F*cking
grind. The graphics are clearly an attempt at a AAA game, and normally I would skip the graphics, as they are not important to the enjoyment of the game... Most of the time, Flickering lights, horrible bloom that blinds you every two seconds. I cannot really encapsulate my utter disappointment, and I really hope that the new game is going to be even a fraction better."
6189,i say good but must have mega pc to play without sounding like a fighter jet
6190,"get over the early deaths and glitches and you will have a gaming experience like no other.  build whatever your heart and mind can create, tame and mate just about any dinosaur you could want as a pet.  explore several worlds and realms with different creatures, caves, and bosses to overcome, build a tribe and join a community and make new friends.   Its worth a shot if you can handle a few bugs and by a few i do mean a lot."
6191,Is fun to play with ur friends
6192,"This game is horrible in the worst way possible. It lures you into a good game that requires a lot of time and once you put in that time and effort, the game break in one of A MILLION different ways. 

Hours of work will disappear because the game decides not to save when you upload things to a new server or an invisible rex in the middle of the ocean killing all your dinos while you just sit there wondering why you ever decided to give this POS another try.

Concept is great, and when it works its a very empty open-world game with not much to do but exist and survive, but i like that. The problem is IT NEVER WORKS. The moment you think ""That freak glitch could never happen again"", some ENTIRELY different freak glitch manages to destroy hours of work.

It feels like a gut punch. And that horrible feeling of being robbed IS ABSOLUTELY NOT made up for by the game play. The gameplay is LITERALLY just making stuff and having stuff and trying keep that stuff by playing well. When that is taken from you through no fault of your own the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE is completely gone.

TL;DR The game is broken and it will make you very angry and sad more often than happy or entertained. DO NOT BUY."

6204,"Game Pros
• Open World
• Weapons ranging from spears, to rocket launchers, and turrets
• Weather System
• Multiplayer
• Crafting system
• Consistent updates
• Day/Night Cycle
• Ton of skills to master
• Base building
• Grouping/Spawning System
• PvP/PvE
• You can tame/ride dinosaurs
• Steam workshop
• Selfie/Orbit Cam so you can look at yourself
• You can host Servers and have access to console commads
• 3rd person (Can be accessed on servers that have it enabled)

Game Cons
• Requires a very decent PC to achieve stable FPS
• Dinosaurs hover on certain terrain (Very minor)
• Dinosaurs need pathfinding work
• Chance of spawning on a hostile dinosaur, killing you upon spawn
• WARNING: Hackers
• Developers released DLC before the game was anywhere closed to finished
• Terrible optomization for full priced game. Especially if you buy it knowing you have an outdated graphics card.
• Developers provide little or no customer support

Relateable Games
• Rust
• The Forest

Conclusion
ARK is an amazing game, But rememeber that the game is still in ALPHA STAGES. It still has a ways to go before it finished, but it is headed in the right direction. It gets your heart pumping when you have a lot to lose, and you got a giant dinosaur chasing you down through a forest.

Score
65/100

6205,I enjoy the explore and adventure at your own pace without pressure or a linear guidance mechanic.

6207,"I have played over hundreds of games in my time existing in this world. Not one game compares to this one. Whether you want to spend your days farming to wake up to a map and a lot of red words, or spend your nights looking at numbers on a egg so that you can have someone else wake up to a map, I can say with 100% confidence that this is by far the absolute most toxic game i have ever played. people can and will spend days and hours on this game and you have the power to take it all away while they're sleeping and it is honestly an amazing feeling. until it happens to you. And when it does, when you wake up to to the map and more red words than you knew could be shown on one screen you realize that this really is the biggest waste of time and the biggest waste of space that you can have on your pc/cconsole"

6229,"Het is een survival game. Hou er rekening mee dat je in het begin vaak dood gaat.

De meeste dino's kunnen getemd en bereden worden. Dit is wel level gebonden.
Je kan met een beetje fantasie de mooiste gebouwen bouwen.

De tech tree is ook level gebonden. Dus verwacht niet dat je meteen alles kan maken.

Je kan dit spel alleen spelen. Maar als je een leuke server tegen komt of zelf creëert, kan het ook een heel sociaal spel zijn.

Al met al vind ik dit een geweldig spel. Maar dat is te zien aan het aantal uur dat ik er al in heb zitten."

6300,"This game is great, you will get lost in the beautiful map designs and the evident hard work these devs into this game. Modding is easy as almost all are available through the workshop. Almost if not all of the game settings can be adjusted before playing.

However... a warning must be noted. This game is just as brutal as it is fun. When playing this game you must be prepared and welcome death as it can and will come to you quickly and often. It doesn't matter if just spawned on the ""easy"" spawns or have progressed to mid/late game on a map. One false move, misstep and you die. This game can be fun and you will lose yourself and sense of time in it. But this game can also be brutal and does not care for your feelings and will drop you into the game as immersive as possible, lost and confused.

Oh, I also recommend playing either with friends or by yourself. Just stay away from the official servers. Everyone on the is already well established and sweaty and will not hesitate to kill you on site."

6357,"For solo Survival PVE, it's an awesome way to go. There's enough challenging combat with the Dino's, Insects and other things thrown at you regardless if you at sea, land or air. If you like to build bases its nice because only the wildlife will threaten your buildings. Scenery is so close to real.  I played Rust for sometime I keep busier in  Ark But again I wasn't into PVP."
6358,
6359,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a quick building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy
When he is jumping over the river, he cannot be targeted by any ground attacking units. The Log and Earthquake will fail to damage a Hog Rider while he is jumping. Air troops can still attack him though, and the Inferno Tower and Inferno Dragon will continue to ramp up their damage.
When countering Hog Riders, obviously use buildings. But be wary as it the offender would usually play around it with cards such as Earthquake. Air swarms such as Minion Horde can help due to the Hog's usual support tools not countering them.
On the offender's side, a powerful move is to accompany him with an Earthquake, obilerating almost every building, and also grounded swarms. To a lesser extent, Lightning could also be used, retaining the same point of almost destroying every building while also crippling troops such as the Wizard or the Hunter.
The Log could also be an effective first play as a cycle, but it only kills swarms and sometimes a non-center-placed Tombstone.
The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the defender will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, the offender should use a spell like Arrows to render the defender poetically defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.
A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.
A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage.
A Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower. Use another card to counter the Hog Rider if it is necessary.
His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. However, the Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though they are vulnerable to spells. Swarm cards like Skeleton Army, Goblin Gang, and Minion Horde can also very easily counter him.
Use this to your advantage by placing a bulky swarm dealer in front of the Hog Rider (eg. Ice Golem, Valkyrie) so that the Hog Rider can transport it to the tower faster and also get protection from swarms.
Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.
The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up small spell.
Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value."

It's a game where you have no clue what you're doing so you find out what you're doing, which kinda drives me a bit nuts, but once you find your own objectives to do the game quickly becomes a fun adventure. I'm someone who doesn't like to have allot of online help and explore games myself, but there are plenty of ways to make this game easier with online tutorials, and I'm not saying it's hard, but you can make things hard or easy for yourself by doing them in a variety of ways.

Fun with friends.
Fun on your own.
Fun to get away.
Fun to have Pets and ride them.
Fun to Breed them, too a point.... That gets a bit odd.

Melee Combat could be far more developed to give the game a variety of extra fun with fighting animals."

quite regularly. I have played this game in many ways, some more enjoyable, and some less enjoyable (looking at you, official servers).

And ive got to say, despite all of the major issues regarding bugs, performance, grinding, cheating etc.
This is still to me, one of the best games ive ever gotten my hands on.

Everything captured me, the maps, outstanding lore and its characters, its graphics, the outstanding music, the interesting mechanics, it all just fit together perfectly and there is no game quite like ark.
"
6394,it fun
6395,I liked it beacuse haha dino go rawr
6396,Dino good
6397,it is so fun and has so much potential with mods
6398,its alright runs a bit shit doe
6399,there is big monkeys and deformed people
6400,"150GB of shit. Not worth it even for free. Worst survival game I have ever played.

-Game is on max settings and looks like absolute garbage. 
-game refused to spawn on my selected region, restarted to fix issue
-every Dinosaur is clipping through the environment and has the most braindead AI I have ever seen. 
-Took me 2 hours to put a box down and have basic clothes and items.
-Some Dodo infected me with Covid, so now I have to listen to COUGH.mp3 every 15 seconds.

6408,Absolute blast if you have a server with your friends. Got a little modpack on our server to make it like the OG Crystal Isles before it was made an official map and it is so fun. We have hella crystal wyverns all over the base.

I got the game when it was free on steam and I would say at that point it's a 100% worth. But, if taming dinos and have your sh*t wrecked by other dinos isn't your thing, then this game might not be for you."

6465,Good graphics well made crafting a bit confusing at the start but ull get used to it though i must say its very anoying to get a good area at the beginig with all the hostiles. the creatures are usefull mods are easy for people to use on servers and u can basicly do anything to the settings on the  servers if ur server making things alows it

6474,"One of the worst game I have ever played, and I got this game for free. It is the first game in years that made me so mad, not ""Dark-Souls keep-dying"" kind of mad, but ""can you please stop having issue"" kind of mad. First of all, I need to say that it is worst in terms of technical aspect, not game content. I wouldn't know about the game content because I didn't even get to enjoy the game content yet. 

This game just has terrible amount of technical issues, and the UI and UX are so outdated that I doubt this game is a modern game. It is hard to host a dedicated server, and non-dedicated server has so many issues. I can't even join my friend's non-dedicated server on second day, for which I managed to join on first day and played for like about an hour. When I clicked and accepted my friend's invitation, it didn't even say anything that says I failed to join, just nothing, no error message or whatsoever. Sometimes when I launch the game I get BSOD too. The server list is just so outdated, you can't even type a DNS name or IP address to connect to a dedicated server? What year is it? 2000?

I spent more time troubleshooting various issues than I actually get to play the game."
6475,"good

I highly disagree with my friend Jedi420 as he doesn't really have enough ""experience"" within Ark to really offer an unbiased opinion of the game.  

I'll go with what I like about Ark Survival and leave the rest up to each of you

!. Ark allows crafting and building
2. Ark allows you to tame and breed
3. Ark allows you to customize just about everything
4. Ark is addicting

Other than those things I'll say this much every year during holidays the devs usually do pretty sweet giveaways like what they do during Xmas with Santa claws and who doesn't like getting free things that you can further customize with?

So Jedi420 must not like all of the amazing features to this game, I guess he likes bland games that don't give the player anything. All jokes to the side though Jedi and I are still friends but Ark survival is a great game with a very long standing history amongst gamers from all corners of the world.

Give it a try what have you got to lose? You're already reading my review so that right there shows that you have great interest in a hidden gem like Ark Survival evolved."

6511,"I honestly got this game because of all the hype and reviews. I thought it was going to be really good, but man does the gameplay feel dated to me. I'm sure to the people who have been playing this game for years understand the structure of this game forwards and backwards, but I just couldn't get down with this game. It feels so old compared to other games I have played in this genre. I guess the only thing it has going for it really are the dinosaurs and yay if you're into that."
6512,A game that is what it says it is open world sand box with dinos. do whatever you want. but be prepared cause everyone else has been waiting for you to show up on a pvp server with like why's everyone killing me on a pup serfer... :P

6531,ok
6532,good game
6533,"I'm actually shocked at the good reviews. The final boss makes your dinos randomly disappear in the cave. They just get deleted. For no reason. There's so many bugs and glitches. Also if you die in the final boss room (because it glitches out your dinos) the rest of them also disappear forever. Honestly the game has so many flaws, it's no wonder it was free for awhile. Glad I didn't spend any money on this awful game. It's not even worth $10.
Edit* It's one of those games where it isn't fun and you're always angry but you keep playing anyways."

6543,I'm going to pjuke

why does the game have to eat my storage like a fat man at an all you can eat buffet?
I may never know because im not downloading it again."

6547,yes

6549,"This game is spectacular. From watching people play to playing the game myself, I'll never be able to get enough of it. Its unbelievably expansive with all the amazing maps and adventures, you can create amazing bonds with all your tames, you can design AWESOME bases and you can get completely rapped up in all the Rpg of the game weather its grinding levels for you or your loyal dino. I highly recommend this game and really hope you didnt get bored of this essay and leave half way through. Bye my fellow gamers"
6550,"[h1]This is my review after 61 hours of game play:[/h1]

A. [i]Survival game with a harsh learning curve. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.[/i]

B. [i]There are options the player can choose to make the game easy to extremely difficult.[/i]

C. [i]Graphics are nice but somewhat dated.  But still it's beautiful and playable.[/i]

D. [i]Speaking from experience, as a beginner, it is very intimidating. [/i]

E. [i]I found that it's best played with others on PVE and/or PVP servers.  Choose your server wisely or start your own.[/i]

F.  [i]There is an active player base.[/i]

G. [i]Player base has declined over the years,  but, there are still a few partially working mods that a player can choose to use on Steam to help soften the learning curve.[/i]

H. [i]Each dino has a different use.[/i]

[u]BOTTOM LINE:[/u]

[b]There are a lot of content maps to choose from, so it should keep a player challenged to survive, adventure, harvest, craft, build, trap, kill  and tame wild pets/mounts to do a lot of their dirty work and/or mate to have better pets for many many many hours.

Enjoy[/b]"
6551,dino big
6552,.
6553,I have played Ark on console since it came out and had no idea it was THIS MUCH BETTER ON PC. like really. Made me fall in love with the game all over again. this is a top tier building/surviving game.
6554,The new Map is absolute garbage. The entire map is ruined by the stupid birds that pick up every body within a 5 mile radius of you.

It can definitely be frustrating at times but really fun other times. Not a big fan of public servers, or PvP servers as its just not my play style but single player and hosting non-dedicated servers for you and your friends to play is very fun!"

Well, I kinda still did that.  But darn if I didn't have a great time doing it.  

Huge world maps, love how leveling up unlocks new things to create, and it wasn't too long before I was running around the world from the back of an Argentavis with a horde of raptors at my beck and call.  

My only complaint would be that one time I spawned into a brand new map pretty much on top of a level 43 Sarco and ate the dust within 8 seconds, but to be fair I chose to spawn randomly on the map.  Love the holiday colors on dinos.

It can be a bit chaotic at times and I would recommend playing with friends, the game can be challenging at times, and it can be enjoyable to play the game with other people you know. I'd recommend also playing on PVE servers rather than PVP, because I feel the game itself is better appreciated without player versus player conflicts."

It's very fun, but holy shit. That gets tiring."

6609,shootergame.exe will eat all your time. play modded or go home. giga go chomp.
6610,"After playing Ark for 1005 hours, I was honestly. There is no words to describe how developed it was. The models were created, the coding was done, and the animations are just. Ark Survival Evolved is one of the games of all time."
6611,very good me like dino
6612,"I really love this game a LOT. there's so much stuff to do in the game and a big open world with all kinds of places to explore in whatever map you're in, though it's hard for my PC to be able to run properly without lowering the graphics because its much too high quality for my crappy PC to handle. 

The only problem i have with this game is the absurd amount of Gigabytes the game has and the relentless updates that are also absurdly huge that take up EVEN MORE space on my computer.

If your PC is able to handle the constant updates the game has and how much storage it all takes up on your computer then be my guest and download the game at the risk of the neverending space it uses up in your PC."
6613,I haven't played this game long but me and my older brother Conner like to play it with our friends. I 100% recommend this game to people that love adventures and dinosaurs! Also heard about ark 2 that shall be interesting.
6614,pog
6615,Its only fun if you play with friends but if u play alone its really boring
6616,It's super complicated
6617,I love pummelling and pulverising dodos
6618,Dinos
6619,it took me a while to figuere out how to play but once u get the hang of it its fun and its 3times better with more people. and theres mods for example if u want to be a creature theres play as a dino. i realy reccomend if ur into survival games
6620,I spent to much of my life on it
6621,practicly every thing about this game I like I like the survival I like the dinosuars and I like how the guns work

6623,do not expect the bugs to be fixed. i just had to restart. AGAIN
6624,this game is so good you should buy it :D
6625,It's just an amazing experience with friends. I have had many laughs and many different days where this is the only thing i played. I love this game and highly recommend it to anybody who shares a love for dinos and fantasy.
6626,"I sunk a decent amount of time into this with my friend one summer and to be honest I don't think it was worth it. The game might have changed since then but I felt like we were barely able to make any progress after all the time we spent and it really made things feel like a waste. I don't recommend, especially for 30 dollars."

6630,"I am a 41 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

6634,very bepik
6635,"Guys! I found how to move! you push w to go forward, a to go left, s to go backwards, and d to move left. This made the game quite a bit better because it allowed me to look at different rocks on the beach, but then! I learned how to look around! I moved my mouse and it moved my camera. this let me look at trees and even more rocks. the only downside is you can't look down and push backwards to go into the sky, which limits your freedom. However, once I moved over to a tree to look at it, Get this! I clicked and I punched the tree! I finally got some wood and this made the game harder because I started to move slower, and I picked up rocks to by pushing every button on my laptop and it worked out. This game is really hard and maybe even harder than dark souls, but not nearly as hard as some of the other games I played, like celeste. The graphics in this game kinda look like polygons which reminds me about geometry class in highschool, and I didn't like that class much, but at least my teacher was nice. The polygons also remind me of a diferent game named geometry dash, which was the easiest game I ever played. Also I just discovered that you can push a button to open some kinda inventory, and this is where my wood and rocks go. In conclusion: This game is alright."
6636,"Much fun, you randomly poop everywhere. 10/10"
6637,fun
6638,"it good game
"
6639,"i have more than 6 hours on xbox, this game is gonna make you consider killing yourself and give you nightmares beyond belief, you're gonna be sitting there wishing you never bothered with installing this game .

anyways i 100% recommend this game 10/10"
6640,"I love this game, and its because I fell in love with it long before the server transfers. In its hayday the game was amazing and fun, but with the introduction of server transfers with tames and kits its become nothing more than people taking overpowered duplicated dinos and breaking smaller tribes and starting players bases. This game is not friendly at all to new players and I dont suggest you buy or play unless you know someone with an established tribe already that is willing to welcome you in."
6641,"I am a 40 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started Ark Survival and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching black women twerk on Tiktok. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, chose a server, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

6655,I have enjoyed play thiis game just in Solo mode
6656,Its good. Played a lot on xbox and now gonna play a lot on pc before ark 2 comes out
6657,fun with friends
6658,"I for one am an ark Veteran, in the Console version (Xbox), and what i have experienced there is utterly mind blowing as far as the overall visuals and the game play.  In playing it on PC has had its bouts of challenges as most games do... I haven't perused the gallery of mods yet here on steam but that will very soon change!  Character control has been interesting to say the least as i am so used to use the controller from the console to using the keyboard's asdf keys.

To Studio wildcard, Whenever Ark 2 Drops in a later timeframe  how easy would it be to add 1st person to it? do u think there might be a mod for it or will you have to hardcode it?"
6659,it was coo

6661,"Incredibly stressful but in an addicting fashion. Be aware, this game is VERY unfair and buggy. You will lose dinos you like in bs situations and some dinos (Thylacoleo and Wyverns in particular) can bypass invincibility cheats. Even so, the game looks beautiful and is fun enough to keep me coming back"
6662,Very very good game. Exstra fun with friends
6663,You can collect own POOP 10//10
6664,"Great game highly enjoy playing it extremely fun with friends and alone,survival aspect is good though can be bothersome at times, sometimes it can be laggy especially on lower end PC's but overall if your a dinosaur fan you should 100% play this game."
6665,sd
6666,this game is extremely buggy but its fun
6667,Dinosaurs Go poop
6668,I already like the concept of dinosaurs and mythical creatures.Also great graphics and customization.I hate that i sometimes have many problems with playing with friends but there's probably a fix so overall a pretty good game
6669,"There is not much i can say about Ark, You either love it or hate is. I for one love this game! Is has everything you could ever want in a survival game except one thing. The ability to level out the terrain."

6698,"I am a 98 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 78 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

But you can also beat them with a club so 8/10"

6707,"This game led to me having no life. If you would also like to have no life get this game

Love,
Some guy on the internet with 1100 hours played"
6708,"I mean Ark is good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A goofy ahh nonstick pan
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- A social security number
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have messed these up before and this is the step that made my dad leave. And why did he leave? I ran out of milk.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the heck are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your goofy ahh mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done."

6725,fun
6726,"Great game. Wish ark developers hired a team that actually took meshing and aimbotting / esp seriously.. The best way is to have a reward for players who turn in with proven footage or evidence of a mesher, aimbotte, or clear ESP user-- I understand it must cost too much money for this to happen- so fingers crossed for ark 2 with a fresh code- save this game for its glorious"
6727,its a nightmare you loses all ur stuff every 5 seconds but lots of fun 8/10

6745,"Never one for writing reviews on games, but Ark is one I have played for quite a while, both here on Steam and on other platforms. 
Pros - 
Fun to run around and tame dinos and build things
Time management can be a thing
Great game to play with friends

Cons - 
Glitchy at times
Crashes a bit on certain maps
Pain in the behind to get into your severs at times

If you can take the good with the bad, it's a good game for you."
6746,"Are you a masochist and don't have anything new to torture yourself with?
Don't worry, the devs of Ark Survival Evolved got you covered!
With constant server lags and endless deaths from things you can't even imagine, to falling of your dinos into the molten pits of lava just for lols.
There are many new and creative ways you can speed up that gastric ulcer growth with just a few hours spent in endless glitching worlds designed just for you!
And why suffer alone when you can take your friends with you!
Ark: Survival Evolved -where no one suffers alone!"
6747,Very pog
6748,Endless fun!
6749,if you love getting FUCKED by dinosaurs play this game
6750,crashes constantly and hurts my bumbum

6752,"I like this game a lot, I would recomend it to anyone who likes survival games, the visuals of it are so nice and bright, the dinosaurs look awesome, being able to tame them, and having such a good way to have this crafting system, each time you progress in order to get stronger items such as better weapons, better armor, and the boss fights, awesome game over all."

6754,fun
6755,great survival and challenging
6756,"Its a very fun game if your playing with friends, if not it can get boring easily. Its not a easy game to play and is very challenging with a lot of skill involved play styles."
6757,too difficult of a game even on easy settings. i was playing a game had a full set of clothes wasnt dieased or anything all of a sudden i died because i was too cold by the time i was able to get to my stuff i died and i had no time or way to craft a campfire or stay warm. 0/10

6807,"First of all, Ark is a good game. Its fun, and has a ton of cool features. Taking everything into account, this is one of the best survival games I have played. Sadly, there are some things that take away from it.
1) PvE gets boring, and you eventually switch over to PvP servers. All the good PvP servers have tribes of people who have poured hours and hours into this game, and as a new player, you have NO CHANCE. Ark has never done server wipes, and most likely never will
2) It takes up around 150 GB pf storage, but you will probably need around 250-300 or so.
Overall, this is a great game, sometimes it can be hard not to be killed by dinos, but thats just my problem! Looking forward to Ark 2!"
6808,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a game, or a load/unload screen simulator.  I have 70 minutes in the game, maybe 10 of which are actually playing it; the rest are spent on an almost entirely black load screen of doom, with no progress bar.

Yes, it's on a SSD, though it's almost completely idle during load.  No, I'm not using mods.  CPU, a 5700X, is pegged at 180% (1 core being constantly used = 100%) while on the load screen.  I think you'd probably have more fun mining Bitcoin."
6809,"Very enjoyable, amazing concept, with multiple launch options for high-end/low-end computers"
6810,"Having now go to a reasonable level with my first character I can make progress. The early stages are frustrating but stick with it and explore, just be careful in water as if you die i there its a bugger to get your stuff back"
6811,Bug free
6812,"Honestly, a better game than I expected, it isn't just a game about dinosaurs, there are whole other parts to the game to explore as well.  If you are starting this game I suggest you not search a lot up, as the part of this game you will look most fondly upon is the beginning."
6813,Its fun and nice but it was really hard in the beginning and dont play if you get sad a lot.
6814,"gotta cath them all!

and go dungeon hunting.
and get nice loot.
and defeat bosses."

6822,really good game if you specially play with friends its so fun to troll them by knocking them out and feed them to a random alpha dino
6823,super
6824,This is the my favorite game I have and is more then worth getting. Each map/DLC has thier own perks and challenges. The only downside is figuring out a couple optional late game machanics.
6825,"Good game, don't play on official server."
6826,To be honest Ark is a really fun game If you got a good pc/laptop

6845,"Игра говно потому что:
1. на уровне графики Эпик у меня все хуже чем на минималках.
2. на пк который должен изи тянуть высокие, на них у меня 30-50 фпс
3. не пучкает на сервера, кикает из игры или в главное меню
4. постоянно пишет что кто то уже играет за меня на сервере или просто не пускает по другой причине
Вывод: ИГРА ГОВНА!"

6899,If you like dinosaurs and survival then yes
6900,Dinos go brrrrr (i reccomend even if you have a weak pc)
6901,ITS THE ONLY GAME I CAN PLAY FOREVER
6902,"Although the game is a bit hard on my computer, I enjoy the solo play very much. I only use a few mods to help make the game even more enjoyable but I am so very happy about all the new maps that keep being added in. Great game for everyone!"
6903,Developers should learn compression and overpriced
6904,fun
6905,"Shit clunky game, 40 hours into this shit and still no GF"

6915,yuh
6916,E is what i think EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
6917,yommy dino eat them
6918,Great game. It is different from most other survival games.
6919,Fun game to play with friends
6920,gud :)
6921,Why do Microraptors exist?
6922,"Wake up, Punch Tree, Tame Chad Dino, Ascend."
6923,"The game is very solid, and after you add on mods it get´s even better"
6924,"Just play it, and then you will know why"
6925,its shit
6926,I liked everything 10/10
6927,dinosaurs
6928,Gud
6929,you would think i would realize i am addicted to this game
6930,
6931,If u want a game to fuck you while trying to find a retarder kangaroo then yes i recommend
6932,Good Game. Dinosaur big. Very fun.
6933,"Like many games Ark is best played with friends, but has grate solo play too. Many are put off by being eaten by dino's a lot when they first start. Reality is you just need to work out how to deal with them, tame them, and use them.

The building mechanics and levelling work well and with a little practice you'll be building fortresses for you and your dino's so they can safely breed."
6934,GOOD
6935,"I was trying to join a tribe when I had one, and everything I achieved just wasn't mine it was no one's, (dino, structures, etc.) and well those hours were for nothing. I was in a tribe alone, trying to join another and from all to nothing."
6936,"What a Fantastic Game!!! If u love to tame dinosaurs and have them get merked 3 days later after waiting for ur 2 hour tame, go ahead and buy this game. HAVE FUN !!!!!!"
6937,dinosaur
6938,If you love to crash after playing the game for 10 minutes then this is your type of game!
6939,"hard to start out if you havent played before or dont have someone to show you the ropes. but once you get started, there is a lot of content to get through and crafting is very immersive"
6940,it's enjoyable
6941,polecam tą grę ponieważ jest fajna i trzeba mieć strategie na bossy a więc polecam
6942,its realy fun and i love this game because theres so many dino's
6943,"Other than the MASSIVE space requirement, this game is amayzun. its got something for everyone, super addicting, and loads of fun with friends OR solo. would not recommend doing official servers though, ull have a terrible time. find some friends on unofficial servers or play alone, so much to do, so much to learn and see. ive played for over 3 years and still find out new features or tips all the time. this is the king of allllll games"
6944,"I wouldn't recommend this steaming pile of shit even it was free. Unless you really like shitty mechanics, poorly optimized games and spending hours trying to travel 100 feet because they just spam mobs that hunt you down and kill you regardless of what you do. You either need cheats or enough people to overcome the insurmountable obstacles. It could have been a great game and i was really looking forward to Ark 2, but at this point I'd have rather just saved my time and burned my money instead"
6945,"90% of the time youre on the beach with 5 rapters in ur ass, but if u can make it past that situation its a fun game"
6946,fun
6947,dinosor go roor
6948,Took down a T-Rex with an army of extinct Dodo Birds.  10/10 would definitely kill prehistoric predators with tiny birds again.
6949,suck ya mum
6950,no way 2 win cringe
6951,A lot of fun with friends
6952,"Good
"
6953,This game pisses me off so much
6954,"I love sandbox games and this has quickly moved to the top of being my favorite!  The initial gathering is very, very easy allowing you to get decent gear early on in the game.  
Once you start taming dinos, it becomes even more interesting!!  Especially if you have others helping you.  I had some initial issues early on, dying quite a bit.  Once I was helped to get a better dino, things got even easier (again).  
I haven't fought any bosses yet.  That's on the horizon.  Currently just having fun building, taming and constructing things.  
If you like those kinds of games, this is a great one.  I'll return and update my review once I get further into the game."
6955,yes buy
6956,vary addictive fun times

"
6960,"I love this game nice dinosaurs nice people 
"
6961,gud
6962,its fun but you need to have the right pc for mods and for good grapics
6963,Strangely addicting
6964,"Its a play at your own pace game. Major time sink if you want to advance. But can easily be played slow and randomly. Would highly suggest starting on Rag, or Vaguara if you want plenty of High level dinos to tame. The island dino levels are horrable!!!"
6965,Very fun game for playing with friends and by yourself
6966,"GAME CONSTANTLY CRASHES FOR ME. After wiping my PC and messing with everything under the sun, I think the fix was adjusting the power setting on my rtx 3060. I don't know why that has worked so far but it has."
6967,"Survival, dinosaurs, pve and pvp content. Easy to get lost in doing things and almost always a great time. Maybe not so much on public servers though."
6968,so annoying to play
6969,gud shite no lie
6970,"10 out of 10 i played probably 500+ hours on ps4
 to good game"
6971,i like dinos
6972,Yes I recommend to everyone I have ever met... Ark is life!
6973,yes
6974,super fun can be hard when going solo but with friends its a real good time
6975,"Servers >:3
This game is poorly optimized, would love to play it but it times out and/or disconnects constantly and when you try to log back in it says you ARE logged in..."
6976,nice
6977,.
6978,will make u want to end it all :) reccomend
6979,its gud
6980,I highly recomend this game on all maps as it is an open world(in every sense of the word) game and has every sort of creature in it acting in a free will way with other creatures. The maps are very expansive and entirely gorgeous if you have a good computer with plenty of resources.
6981,PVP is useless in this game you grind for hours and hours until you log off and your work gets destroyed in 5 seconds.
6982,cool
6983,good
6984,This game is the best
6985,yes
6986,"The servers lag so much that it's hard to play, everyone builds big square towers surrounded by gates that are really ugly and take up so much space that it's hard to find a pretty place to settle, and nothing really makes sense. There are some notes scattered around that talk about dinosaurs but no real story, and sparkly dinosaurs randomly appear and eat your whole base."
6987,lol
6988,sucks
6989,dinosaur
6990,game
6991,nothing
6992,I love this game!
6993,"This is an action packed game of survival where mods can make the game more intense, or more calm. I'm having trouble with the DOX mod so that is not great, but otherwise an amazing game all around.
"
6994,good
6995,good game
6996,"Pretty Great Game, kinda buggy tho, still would recommend"
6997,"dino sex, very fun, but many bugs and lags."

7003,I fuckin love dinosaurs
7004,good
7005,Ham
7006,"In PVP everyone will wipe your base. Days worth of work gone when you login. But occasionally you win and people with high level fantasy creatures accidentally both die at the same time to your turrets and your BOB (Newb) tribe rushes out to destroy their bed and they have their Blood Stalker, Reaper King, Mana, and Para on passive and you wipe months of their work instead. 10/10 would lose it all over and over again just to take from someone else."
7007,cool dino game make brain go brr
7008,theres black people

10/10 would recommed"
7015,it is a great game it is not that good for pvp but amazing for pve. a other thing is that it is very hard to create a server and play with your friends.but the last thing is that it dose not have a lot of defferent cross platforme consoles like you can play with a friend that has a ps4 and you have a pc or Xbox

7039,"[h1] After playing for a period of time (maybe 5~7 days), the game often appears LowLevelFatalError and cannot continue to play.
Reinstalling the game solved the problem, but the slow game installation (disk size of 125G) resulted in a poor gaming experience for me. If you guys can fix this or provide a quick way to install it, I'll change my rating. thanks.

7040,good game
7041,"Immersive, fun survival game with tameable dinosaurs; what's not to enjoy?"
7042,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDD
7043,.
7044,this game is genuine fucking ass its so good tho
7045,I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO PLAY IF U INTREST IN DINO OR EXTINCT ANIMALS || THE BEST I PLAYED IN MY WHOLE LIFE IS ARK ONLY BECOZ OF MODS AND MORE MAPS ||
7046,kalo
7047,Wouldnt play if you want to crash everytime you want to be quick with anything or go to servers where everyone cheats.
7048,Yes
7049,game ight
7050,ui is complicated af
7051,"The whole idea of the game is good, a survival game where you gather resources to craft things to gather resources better, but with the added dinosaur that you tame and breed to fight for you, but it has some deep flaws that make me not recommend it:
- While the communication is generally good, some things are specially terrible, like how you can't bring some dinos to a boss, and you'll only know about it once you're teleported to the boss without these dinos;
- About the non-dedicated session, it's terrible to play with friends if you don't have a dedicated server, because even though the tether distance is configurable, since the caves and bosses are in a separate ""instance"" from the rest of the world, whenever the host enters one of them everyone else gets instantly teleported there;
- The whole game also feels deeply unfair to me, even though you can configure how grindy the game is with the sliders before starting the game, some things you can only be fixed with mods, like how the thieving wild dinos can steal and eat a whole stack of meat from you at once, or how many dinos can take you off your mount without any real way to prevent that other than avoid them, or how you need a very RNG-based recipe to create a better quality piece of equipment;

I did have some fun playing this game, but all these issues (and a few minor ones I didn't mention) were really detrimental to my experience, and the simple fact that I bought this game to play with friends and the tethering alone gave us a lot of trouble, I can't recommend it."

7070,This is the best game ive ever played I love how its open world and the fact that you can get free mod makes the game eaisyer and more fun. There are many maps and bosses to fight with all the dinos to find fight and tame to help you explore the ark.

I don't want to be a karen, it's just a gripe I have with the game, other than that, I highly recommend it, it's very fun and mostly accurate. I just love petting the lystorsauruses, the bright colours, and the environment of the game!

7123,Great survival game. Be prepared to invest alot of time for a single run. alot
7124,Great Game
7125,"I enjoyed this game for what it's worth and I'd honestly play it again, but this game is a 400 gb memory and resource processing vampire, ergo I couldn't play this game if I wanted to. At the very least i ask that the Devs at least try to optimise their first game before working on a second. Why does a game like this need a sequel in the first place when you have 11 ""DLC"" packs? and this last point is a personal gripe but the game has strayed from simple prehistoric survival to sci fi shoot-em-up. Wildcard if you want people's patronage please at the very least make sure your game isn't limited to running on supercomputers.

TLDR: game is 400 gb, doesn't run on modern gaming PCs, is making an unnecessary sequel, and cares little about QoL patches."
7126,"Would recommend 10/10.  Rage - Yes. Fun - Yes. Laughs - Yes - Sadness - Yes. Do I continue to play - Yes! 

Give it a try you won't regret it. A great survival game!"

7133,i love this game i played it a lot on xbox and ps4 so i have around 1300 hours and i still wake up when i have no work and play like its my job lol
7134,"Shit fucking game dogshit devs, doesnt let me join my friends server, keep getting lost connection to host fucking shit devs"
7135,Can be a little glitchy at times but the game play his great especially for playing with friends. Its kinda like playing skyrim and sims. My words don't do it justice but I highly recommend.
7136,Really good game. Except being addictive...
7137,Playing with friends is a BLAST!
7138,"Dinosaurs man
"
7139,Dinos vs Other dinos..oh yeah and ppl too...also you can pick up ppl with dinos
7140,Solid game better with friends
7141,yes
7142,yes
7143,
7144,"I like the concept. But this thing is a sloppy resource hog. I would like this more if the graphics were made a bit more simple. I'm running it on a quad core with a 1060 with 4 gigs of video ram, and while I'm not pretending that's top end, it should be enough to run a game smooth on medium graphics. And their management around expansion is a mess. I'm hoping when they make the second game, they bring in some people to truly organise how it functions, because it feels like the whole thing is held together with duct tape."
7145,good game
7146,"Brilliant game, loads to do, craft, explore. Awesome bosses and you get to tame and ride dinos..... come on.  Just get it."
7147,"Fun game, a bit challenging at times, but that's ok.  Breeding / capturing dinosaurs, is lots of fun, and there's lots of challenges to surviving the ARK."
7148,dinosaur
7149,"The Worst, but still good game I played in my life"
7150,"Pros
-Survival
-Dinos
-Dinos
-Dinos

Cons
-Dead dinos ;(

Review: I regert not buying this game sooner, but I did get it for free from steam by waiting a couple of years. This game is pretty fun hands down. Survival is a byotch at first. Learning the ropes will lead to your death so many times. But its worth it. Once you evolve and learn taming tricks, your gold. The fun soon begins and man, I could only imagine how fun this would be on a private server with friends.

Tips: Raptors suck, garbage tames. Your first *carnivore* should be a baryonyx, found near swampy areas. 1-2 of these guys will be pretty strong until you get some of the later game tames (keep them after, they are great for mid game under water play). And EVERY resource is important, dont dump any of it. If your low on space, build more storage.

"
7151,"Literally Best Survival-Open World-Dinosaurs game to ever exist, Highly recommend it, cant wait for the ARK 2"
7152,"fun game all and all to bad how expensive it is to get plus dlc expenses. Not cheap but fun all and all, the servers are very dead from what i have seen but sometimes they are popular."

7175,Lots of fun with open world and Dinosaurs and other creatures!
7176,.
7177,"I got this FREE, so it comes as no surprise, it was not worth the price, A Week after installing, there was a update, which broke the Linux install, so I have to use the Windows Version, and it is a buggy mess, Also, after a few days I bought the DLC, but sad now I did, and STEAM has NO Time for REFUNDS, due to failures of it Software Developers it works for, they will demand money for old crap, I Hate Steam ... I Played some more, it still sucks, like when, sailing on your raft, sharks just explode when you drive past, fly up into sky in a tangled mess, which you can cut up for food, as it floats ..  Or sailing into a building, in online games, if you go to a map running more than 1000 days I have  found, software cannot redraw fast enough, I regularly find myself inside another players ""MANSION"" and stuck, this software is old & Creaky .. I continue to play as Private Hosted Server, Mods have made it work better, without morons who smash stuff, because they can .."
7178,"Good, but the devs won't ever optimize it"
7179,Save your selves
7180,very fun with friends
7181,funni
7182,made big dino eat new players :)
7183,Over 300 hours into the game and I have only half explored 2 islands. there is so much to see and so much to do. The graphics and soundtrack are amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone. It has something for all play styles!
7184,W game
7185,blalalalabla chuchachcahchchcahchcahch ehkakakak
7186,good game
7187,"Huge time-sink but always something to do. It's a game I've come back to time and time again. We run our own server too so there's none of the lag, land grabbing and general griefing of Official servers. Started on xbox and continued on pc. Building, combat, DINO combat. caves, crafting, bosses. It has everything."
7188,"Where to start, first let me say that even though I have purchased all the expansions for Ark, both times I have gotten the base game were when it was free, once when it was Free on EGS to see if I even liked the game, the other when the base game was free on steam a few weeks ago. Though I have purchased the base game as a gift for multiple people in the past 3 years base game and both battle passes. Ark truly is one of the best survival games I have played, and though most of my experience is playing via my private cluster with slightly higher than normal rates (its Evo Event all the time) I also see the appeal of playing on the official servers. The modding community is one of the best, and the fact is some times no matter how long you play the game you still get jumped by a kapro after you think everything is cleared out and it makes you jump in your seat a little. Every play through is different, because the world itself is alive."
7189,Wyvern Died. Got another one. Got it stuck in a tree. Good times. 10/10
7190,"Got to level 76, died, died again, and again, tried to revert save and ended up losing everything. 500+ metal and 20 tamed dinos just gone. Cool game tho"
7191,good
7192,"It's a terrible, annoing, and ruthless game... but its realy fun and nobody knows why. i have 1k hours on xbox and i can say its outstaningly terribly the best."
7193,amazing game for me and my son who loves dinosaurs.  Great game for us to bond over and get excited about.
7194,good and fun
7195,"Played on Playstation, and on PC. Have gone back to it time and again. Enjoying the community aspect of the game. Love my dino's."
7196,very fun and able to play a long time in one sitting
7197,Good Game.
7198,Very Nice Very Beautiful
7199,I've played a bit.
7200,this game so sexy
7201,"best
"
7202,dinosaurs are kinda cute
7203,"Good game but if on ultrawide, be prepared to do the math for your FOV. 32:9 is borked basically as UE4 uses horizontal width for aspect not vertical so its a crammed miserable experience. Mileage may vary but FOV of around 123 will solve 32:9 issues MOSTLY. Otherwise GREAT times ahead."
7204,fun but ur gonna be at 2fps
7205,"Update size is ridiculous, for a 50mb patch you will need to install 30gb. Poorly optimized game which requires so much time to update that you barely have any time to play. You also get really bad performance with bad frames, and the lighting in this game is trash. Overrall a really fun game on the inside but extremely bad on the outside."
7206,Good
7207,Vewyr fun
7208,shit
7209,shit game
7210,Minimum system requirements: Another SSD. 300 or something gigs for all dlc
7211,"It is like Valheim, Rust, The forest etc with dinos.  Excellent mods, easy navigation etc."
7212,funi dinos very good game
7213,"VERY NICE, KING IN THE CASTLE"
7214,Just love it. (PVE)
7215,fun:)

7219,"It's a great game, it may not be as active as it used to be but it's great as a single player or multi player. I prefer playing it on console personally for single player but pc multi player seems to be a lot better. I have over 100 hours on my console and I have a decent amount on my other steam account, overall there is a lot of content to explore and still things to do after many hours of playing."
7220,i have started playing and everytime i start to do good and make progress i either loose the world or i die with alot of things and endup not being able to find my body because the beam of light will not show up

In my case, I often get to do the building designs while my friends do the fighting, and that is just the way I like it.

7274,Great fun if you find yourself a good crew and good servers
7275,"Received the game for free quite recently. Was looking forward to it as I enjoy similar types of survival games.
The game was however an instant let down. 
Graphics are not the most beautiful ones but it was expected as it is an older game at this point.
Runs quite smooth and otherwise OK.
The menu UI and especially crafting system simply killed the mood for this game instantly.
It has potential to be great, but this will require a complete overhaul on the UI and crafting system."

I recommend playing in a tribe because a lot of things you need to do just become a lot simpler and quicker. You can play solo though if you have the patience for it.

7299,"This game can be very addicting where hours can turn into days very quick. The game is fun, but only if you can find the right server to play on, I wouldn't necessarily play this game singleplayer or without friends. The taming mechanics and base building is what makes this game so unique where everything works so well dynamically together, except when it doesn't because the devs give 0 shits about the game's state to the extent where certain maps have unfinished areas leading to mesh holes which is whole rabbit hole in of itself, but I digress. All in all its fun xd"

7305,If you like to waste countless hours playing this game and taking days if not weeks to tame out a group dinos and then have some troll or alpha tribe wipe it all away and start you from square one wasting all the time you put into it then this  game is for you. Jokes aside its a great game easily a 4.5/5 game but it needs to be re-balanced across the board OR have tame timers DRASTICALLY REDUCED even after they already have I think they could use a further reduction. For the dino breeders looking for perfection its a huge time sink for little reward trying to Min/Max dino breeds becuase of tamed levels going into pointless stats like speed and hunger oxygen and mutigens have such a rare chance that it will waste more hours breeding then the taming. Great game but very rough around the edges still even after years in development.

7315,"I've played this game multiplayer with my friend for some time now in steam and epic, i had played a bit of single player as well but mostly multiplayer. and we nearly played together nearly for 720 Hours in epic and 100 in steam.


i remembered  the first day we spawned in the island easy location beside a river in a 5x PVE spanish server.
my friend's character, Grandpa Rick, died in the time it takes me to make my character ,Rose, by a Raptor.

when i spawned i find myself scratching my hand with a weird thing inside my flesh ewwww. first i gathered stone and punched some trees to gather important stuff as my friend said i would need to make stuff. as i was gathering berry i saw a 
black crocodile (Sarco) i knew crocodile are dangers but damn they run fast. here it goes my first death about 5 min after i started game. we joined together to make a base we started making or house with wood. of course im not a builder my friend is i am a man of doing the job. if it is with me i will make a cube and call it home, but my friend makes gorgeous house out of wood. we started taming dinos. then we made a raft and we called it a day.
day 2 was a great day we went north with raft from east side of map it took us about 1 day of game day. we went to mountain to tame argantavis. i got a great white argantavis decided to name her Snow(it was the time GOT movie) and we got another male one he was yellowish color like noon called him noon.

after that some one called for Help an alpha Carno and alpha raptor attacked their base. it was a call to arms all players in server gathered to go help them. we didn't know how power full an alpha carno is, but we went when we arrived we were the first Host to come for help. we started with Raptor and placing our defenses. we nearly got Raptor we were there duck till dawn. if only she was not a deadly beast. i died and my friend killed her. it was in that time the next Host arrived to help 3 people together we were 6 people we got  the alpha Carno and called it the best day ever.

after that we went to a PvP server(oh S#IT u know how it is going to be) in pvp we made our base with stone in east near swamp. we tamed lots of things, but we got our first Rex. and then we saw a GIGA ,damn beast, we tamed GiGA with some tricks and made him trap on some stone so he couldn't move after he got to sleep my friend went to bring food for him but the torpor went down like CRAZY i was near sea i killed a jelly fish and got him like 1000 poisen XD. we tamed him and went to our base, suddenly 2 players came with DRAGONS(wyvern) wtf was that we both didn't knew about wyvern we had no defense a they laughed and killed every thing we had. we went to another server and again some players attacked our base. we had defenses but they had the upper hand we ran to crystal map.

now start good parts- in pvp we were in love with crystalmap. we saw wyvern and ran our as$es away(we didn't know crystal wyverns are passive) we made a base in far north east side of map in an frozen island with extra defensiveness and we got ourselves lots of wyverns. one day i saw a base in east side of map on floating islands (name of tribe nobody) 3 turret tower 50 in each (one of towers were empty) i wore my ghily suit found a bush and began spying on them for 3 real hours in first day. i had their dinos counted lots of gigas, Rexes wyverns... i stood there for 1 more real week there and began writing when they are online on a paper a had their schedule of when they get online i counted 3 people . we started to make plan. we had details of every tree every rock. we decided to attack them on Monday 2am. when we woke up to start the attack the server were offline due to update. but we had plan B we should start the attack in 7am that day. 

the time came we moved our X plant, 5 turet, quetzal and 2 extra wyverns. first i shot the gigas so they followed me, i trew them off the clif. easy pz lemon squeezy. we started to plant the X plants and turets. we shoot the wyverns they came, they died. we managed to find a way near them without their turet tower attacking us(poor planing from them) we made an entrance inside their base some aggressive dinos where there killed them easly. we went upstairs they were 4 players i counted wrong but they were sleep we handcufed them and looted them GOOOD. after a wrong C4 planing turet towers now began to shoot us we tried to stop them with Rock elemental but did't work so we returned happly. we laied low for a while. it was from 7am to 11:30 am. after some day we went there every thing was gone. they went somewhere else.

we decided to go to Ragnarok when a hacker got us out of no where with extra fast griffin. it was like griffin was flying in creative that fast. they imprisoned us. but i was smart they were hacker, i can eat s#it. i ate my s#it so i got unconscious after i woke up i was out of prison (when u drop it moves a little bit) i freed my friend we began typing /suicide. he went west i went east. the hackers again got him he said they got on top of my head like they knew my location. i saw them coming for me but i went to another map(Crystal) my frind got himself suicide again a ran somehow. we came to our base and gone offline. tomorrow they destroyed our base again how did they find us? 


In conclusion; this game is a lot of fun playing PvE is alot more fun we are now playing pve. single player is a little Boring if u ask me ). But if you have friends willing to play it with you, this game is truly magical, and no other game in it's class can compare to level of drama and storytelling it provides.

I hope this review has encouraged you to buy this game, or at least, brought you some entertainment.

Thank you for coming to my ZEDtalk"

I've never gotten sick of playing be it on a solo server or on online servers. The story line is also pretty cool if you care to play through it the way it's meant to be played through lol, but no matter whether you just like the survival aspect or ""story mode"", this is a wonderful game."
7345,"买了很久很久都还没开始玩的游戏！
虽然不是第一次玩生存类游戏，但是还是被这个游戏的内容给惊喜了。
喜欢里面的氛围，还有许多不同类型的恐龙。

有时在不知道的情况下回被恐龙偷袭，然后卡在石头边。
结果就GG了。
然后建了帆船去对面岛拿一些非常基本的资源箱也会被恐龙搞死好几次。
结果帆船建了一架又一架。
现在在游戏里已经有差不多10架帆船。
有点囧。

整体体验还是不错。"

7348,"This game changed my life, i was homeless before this and i was debating on stealing food.It was horrible ,but then i found this game and it changed everything.For example my girlfriend came back for me and my dad got the milk.Overall a perfect game.(this was joke(or was it))"
7349,"You are dropped on a desert island, naked with no direction and no idea how you got there. only if you are lucky enough to survive and thrive, will you find an actual story that you happen to be a few hundred years late for.

I've played for 771 hours... obviously i like it. I only play single player, and want to beat every map single player, and it is a punishingly difficult game until you are established and in being so difficult, it is that much more rewarding when you finally succeed!  I would recommend changing some server settings to make things less grindy in single player (hatch/mature speed, resource respawn time/distance, day/night cycle) but only once you have surpassed those hurtles and they become less hurtle and more hindrance.

If you play on a server, you will likely be given end-game dinos and become OP quickly, but to me that takes the fun out of earning it yourself.

yes... there are bugs. this game is almost known more for its bugs than for its dinosaurs, and yes it is greedy (379 gig download and you will need more than 8 gig ram to play)... but if you are looking for a truly difficult single player survival series that is incredibly rewarding when you do finally succeed, then play Ark."

No ingame tutorial to teach you even basic commands. I played 2.4hrs, got stunlock killed by some glowing jellyfish, respawned to 'your freezing take massive DoT and die 50 times before sunrise' oh and those jellyfish dont move so you cant get your shit back.... HAHA did you go over there congrats you just discovered one of the many MANY places to get stuck in the terrain geometry!!! no theres no unstuck command. Wait to die or kill yourself then come back and carefully loot your corpse or else get stuck again!!!!
 TL:DR
Go play conan exiles. Even before the next major patch its 10x more refined and a better character generator"

7376,"This game is such a great concept... but the execution is maybe the worst survival game i have ever had the misfortune of wasting time on.

The game was free when I got it and honestly with how unfinished it feels I cant believe this game ever made it out of Alpha let alone so many downloads.

Pro's 
Dino riding can feel fun.
The game is aesthetically very beautiful at times.
Pooping randomly is still funny.
If you liked dino's as a kid this game feels oddly nostalgic.


Con's
Feels like an awful port that was meant for a console, all of the controls are set to horrid circle menu's and all of the button configurations are so bad the only thing they got right was quite literally WASD and space for jump.
Every single aspect of the building feels awful, from crafting in your inventory to putting the buildings down. Between the awful snap system that is at best so poor it makes Fallout 4 seem advanced... right down to the awful way you need to place random wall foundations that make everything you build look awful.. the whole system needs scrapping.
The Dino's AI, the AI for the dino's is really tragic.. from wanting to be so close they are trying to crawl into your chars mesh and preventing you from moving, down to randomly doing things you specifically said not to leading to the Dino's demise again a rework is needed.
Fortitude as a stat is so imbalanced your char is always loosing health from being to hot or cold, regardless of how much of your hard earned experience you waste in this stat.
Paper items, the speed your armour and other items degrade through use is so fast it feels like your wearing paper or trying to break a rock with a brittle stick, so expect to waste to much of your resources and time on fixing stuff.. its simply anti-fun.
Every biome seems to have an anti-fun Dino's who's only task/ability is to knock you off the dino that your riding and for more anit-fun! they normally have some kind of stun/pin to keep you off and down until you die leading to full equipment loss + the dino you were on dieing.

I could keep going but I think I have made the point here, this game has the potential to be magnificent if your willing to invest an insane amount of time finding mods to make it even remotely playable. 
The entire game feels like it wasn't played by the Dev team or they mistook the word “hard” for the word “annoying”, between basic stuff like building just being beyond frustrating, or you loosing all your equipment because randomly 1 of the dinos you attacked was level 100 among the level 6 ones you were fighting before.. the whole game just feels bad and like it was made to annoy players rather than give satisfying game play.

My Boyfriend loves dino's so im stuck playing this but honestly it feels like more of a let down than it should as you can see with a bit more dev time, or a bit more care into the gameplay this game could have been so good but its garbage.

I was playing with my friend who had more than 1000 hours on this game, I always liked this game from videos I've seen on youtube, but when we actually got to play the game we couldn't stop dying it was not fun and  was unnerving. When we had a start and built a base i understood that you should always farm in this game.  The game is very buggy, the dinosaurs are programmed very badly and the gameplay is not intriguing. When i played this game i was feeling sleepy. I got this game for free so i guess its fine but i definitely do not recommend buying this game. The game doesn't tell you what to do or how to do it, for new players this game is uncoordinated and makes you rage-quit at your third death."

7463,"I have this game on PS4 and PC and I love it. It can be hard to get started, but once you get yourself a few tools and a weapon the game gets really fun and there's so many things you can do. I love building homes and taming the animals. You can ride the animals you tame and use them for various tasks to make life easier. You can grow crops and breed animals and many, many more things and that is just on single player. You can play the multiplayer and build and battle with other players. I haven't tried that yet, but if you're into multiplayer games this would be really fun as well. It's an open world game with multiple maps to explore and each map has it's won unique animals and landscapes. Lots of replay ability."
7464,"The game is actually very fun, but that's not why this review is going to be a bit negative.

I sincerely DON'T recommend this game for it's over-engorged file size. You will literally need to uninstall 90% of your library if you want to even run this game with only two of the maps installed. Trying to install more maps than ""The Center"" and ""Scorched Earth"" will end up having the file size amount to an abominable 300+ gigs. You will have to install and run CompactGUI to compress the file size, but this will be futile as the developers keep updating the game with more uncompressed files to bloat the game's size even more.

COMPILE YOUR S**T, STUDIO WILDCARD. This is inexcusable. But as I was saying in the first paragraph, this game is actually very fun, just run it at your own risk."

7482,it's an alright game to be honest. Especially since I got it when it was free. i'd wait until a sale to buy this though. I kinda got stuck at a part since i didnt know what to do. Another bad thing is that it takes up like 100 gb.

This game is a total killer for ANY computer. 
Optimization does not exist, bugs and crashes can bring blue screen to your machine. 
I just wonder HOW the hell it is possible to create such unoptimised game on Unreal Engine?!

But the saddest thing in all of this mess is community, which can so easily bring it on, because it is what it is. Thats why game developers don't have to do their best to make games working."

7562,"Great game overall would recommend this game who generally likes dinosaurs and survival games mixed into one. Great graphics and game play make for some epic boss fight. Some amazing raids that will have your heart racing and the whole gang cheering. The One down side to this game i have to say is you must have some good hardware to run it. The game isn't only gpu hungry it eats your system for breakfast, Lunch and Dinner forget dessert... but over all amazing game."

7577,"Still after years, the game is still incredibly buggy. Between having items/tames fall through the mesh, to having players aimboting and killing you from outside the bandaries of map or even under the map. The bugs that are fixed are usually only bugs that unintentionally help the player such as stacking taming buffs to reduce the time it takes to raise/tame creatures which take hours. The developers way of keeping players around was to release new dlc instead of fixing the game. 
Everything in this game takes hours to accomplish so if you truly intend on playing official servers, be  prepared to spend hours doing something and have it all destroyed while offline.
Its currently free which is the only reason to think about playing the game. But more often then not you will find your unable to build or tame anything on a pve server due to metal foundations covering entire maps, and on all pvp servers you will likely log in one day to find your entire base flattened, raided, and all your tames killed or stolen simply because the top player on server got bored and went around wiping everyone because they can. Added with the fact that server transferring is easy and you've got maps being owned by one group of players with max level tames and bases everywhere. Servers are /70 yet you'll find a group of 8 maps being owned and patrolled by a single group of players. If you dont like having all your time and effort destroyed while being offline don't play this game. 
If you try to play pve to not have your stuff broken, good luck. The maps are covered entirely with metal foundations that you cant destroy and you cant build near them. All pve maps are extremely laggy and you will find it difficult to even move around without lagging constantly due to the people that were there ""first"" having massive bases that cant even be loaded in on one screen. And even if you can get past these issues and are able to build on a pve server, the community is extremely toxic. Be prepared to put all your tames in cryopods because if you dont, you will log in to find your tames got picked up by someone and dropped in a hostile place to get your tames killed.
Playing solo the game can be fun simply because you won't lose your stuff, however this is a heavily focused multiplayer game.
Overall the game is fun, but you should only try it if its free. This is a game that many will likely play, have a little fun in, and then rapidly uninstall due to offline raiding, bugs, or the realization that this game is a massive timesink with developers that don't care about their playerbase."

I have been trying for 2 days to log into the game and actually play it, but everytime I do this I am notified in a very strange way that I need to download MORE of Ark . So I download, try to play, and I am told the same thing over and over. I have downloaded 5 times now. I am wondering when I will actually get to play the game.

Furthermore, I find it is a heinous practice to sell a game that you can't actually use unless you purchase more aspects or downloads without prior informing the buyer. For that, this game gets a down vote."

7667,"Learning curve is more like climb a very tall skyscraper straight up. I'm not gonna YouTube or Google how to play the game, there should have been a basic tutorial on literally basics with the game, I know the keyboard controls but I have no idea how the heck to use a simple campfire, it acts as a storage, WHAT?? How do you cook?? There's literally no explanation and the menu that ""explains"" stuff but doesn't explain how to do them!! Give me some small goals/objectives to start SURVIVING but with but NOPE. Good luck figuring out stuff. You're like a baby in this game with knowledge how to survive but somehow it's impossible to figure out how things actually work. Resources, taming, building, stats, controls etc. good luck learning all of them. I don't have the time to play the game if it fails to even teach it's weird mechanics to begin with.

You're better off to watch others to play the game rather than watch numbers of tutorial before you even get to actually START playing the game. That's just the BEGINNING! Am I stupid? Probably, I won't deny it but you can't get anywhere without starting small, it's throwing you right to PHD when you're just in Primary!!!"

7670,"My friends required we play with mods and so do most servers. And at this point everyone just wants ""quality of life"" mods that ruin the sense of progression or they want ""mods meant for veterans"" that make the game so unplayably hard that you can't learn how to play it. And as with most online games, people are not friendly to new players.

Also, the game doesn't look nearly as good as it should for how absolute garbage it runs. My computer could fry and egg and it's sporting a 3080 and 32gb of ram. And that's vanilla; don't even get me started on how it runs with my friends' mods.

Some people say the Windows version works better through Proton than the Linux native port ever did, but some people also say it doesn't work at all for them, and it also takes up way more harddrive space and runs slower. I can absolutely NOT recommend anyone buy this game or support a game dev company that behaves this way."

7713,Fun survival game with dinosaurs. The story is a slow burn but satisfying.
7714,"Just when you think you're good, you go and do something stupid and get eaten by a griffin or a dragon. Makes your heart drop and your stomach ache but you get determined to do better the next time. You think you've played for about an hour and 7 hrs later you're fixing the placement of your building.
Do I recommend this game? absolutely."

7719,yes
7720,I now own this game for all of my systems with all DLC. 100% recommend for any player who loves open world mmo's and anyone who likes the freedom to do what they want in a game!
7721,"Building can be kind of a pain so i highly recommend using the S Plus and Platforms Plus mods along with the game. Doing a server can be a bit tricky at times, but other than that, pretty solid game all around."

7747,fun
7748,"I got this game for free from a special event and while I had fun for a bit, the amount of space it takes up is atrocious and they really need to learn how to compress things. I also just got bored of playing it and I uninstalled it due to these two reasons. It also has a lot of bugs and doesn't run very well. The franchise has potential but right now it's a bloated buggy mess. Spend your money on something else."
7749,"got it free, want a refund. hot garbage now i see why they gave it away."
7750,"As this game has been out for quite some time and I only recently picked it up during the ""free"" event. I'm pretty late to the game here. 

That being said, being as late as I am to the game, i was surprised to still see so many bugs and glitches in the game. As a new player, they're a bit distracting, but I'm still able to enjoy the game. How can you not like Minecraft meets Pokemon on Hard Mode, with Dinosaurs?

I'm certainly glad this game was given away for free, otherwise I would have never picked it up on my own. Which is a shame, because it's actually quite a good game with a lot of playability and re-playability. I will most certainly be picking up ARK 2 when it comes out now as a result. 

I only wish I got into the game sooner."

7771,"Great game if you have someone to patiently teach you wtf is going on. Def requires a tutorial to like character level 10 to really teach solo new players how to play. Put it on the main menu so people dont have to look for it. Also another gripe I have is that when you are playing a PvE server people will build their bases and then cover in game miles with ladders and floors to make it so you cant build anywhere near their bases. so for example, on ragnarok, lets say you can fit 100 castle sized bases on the beaches around the map with a good mile or two in between each base so plenty of breathing room. But the problem is there is only 50 castle sized bases and all the extra space that you could build a base in has fucking LADDERS AND SHIT from other peoples bases so no one can build even remotely close. And good luck building inland all the flat easy to build on spots are fucking taken plus the area surrounding them because of, you guessed it, buildables from that group of people. Thats really my only gripe. I didnt want to pay 15 bucks a month just so my friends and I can have enough space on flat land to build a house and a place to keep dinos smh"

This game is so buggy so dont bother"""
7785,5/10 fun with a small group of buddies if you dont want to take it to seriously. The largest issue that the game has is that they built a great pve game and a great pvp game then slapped them both together keeping the worst aspects of both. If you like really good pvp survival rust has ark beat. if you want a chill pve experience try out some of the carebear pve only ark servers this is the only place i was able to enjoy the game. the game no longer being in early access is also a complete joke it seems they just want to add more content instead of doing any optimizations or bug fixes. lots of game to enjoy but please do not pay full price for this game
7786,"Very good, very good..."

7796,it takes space...
7797,"If you enjoy crafting supplies and breeding animals/dinos and exploring different lands and finding lost notes and treasures this game is for you. you can make this game as easy or as hard as you like so if there are parts you struggle with you can easily change the settings to make the harder bits easier 
e.g. dont like the night time? you can extend the day cycle and shorten the night cycle - so its always daytime. not very good at keeping your character alive? you can make it so you dont keep needing food or water. there is also a creative mode you can go absolutly wild - no strings attached. there are also input commands you can use like in the console version - admit its easier to input commands on console but its not that hard to get used too. also a great way to learn about dinos - apart from 'The land before time'"
7798,This game is doing to me what Skyrim did many years ago. I only hope that this marriage can withstand it.
7799,good
7800,Decided that I would play for only a few hours...maybe a day or two...

7803,This game is so amazing in a private world with friends. The pvp isn't amazing but the modding possibilities are insane and make the game extremely fun. 10/10 would recommend to others who like dinosaurs/jurrasic park/world or rust even.

If i had know this when going into the game i would not have bought and invested so much time... i would have just stayed on Eve Online.  If you go into this game expect the servers to be wonkey at best while this company focuses on the new ARK and other avenues instead of making this game run smoothly.

https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/ark/563579?playerCount=24H as an example.

Wildcard also has a knack of shutting down the servers for ""upgrades"" during events and the servers crap out during event with no recourse"

When does the fun start?

Trying to survive in this game is a chore. Trying to find the resources needed when in a pinch without being mauled by dinos all the time is a worse chore. There's no clear indication of what exactly is needed to stay in one piece. There's no clear guide. Most of the time I'm randomly grasping around myself in foliage hoping to find the things I need.
Maybe after another 10 hours this will make sense somehow?"

7876,"No cause its full of languages without packs and no rules. and really really really bad behavior from minorities (kids) that are not even allowed to play this game. This goes really far its actually full of lil kids who ruin this game big time. This is not something you want your own kids playing. Or even yourself. I cannot describe why there aint no moderation on the servers that kick people or a better reporting system. Cannot trust the creator of this game either...Wouldnt recommend ark2 this game is very unoptimized, broken, buggy, mesh MESS, everything is buggy as hell.

Good place for internet bullies that have nothing in life to rule so they can be mean to all the other means and no one cares. This place is really bad for youth to be in .

Also consider that of all players 50% quits before they made it through the game for 1 day (statistics show this) and that only 1,5 person really play this game out of the 10. Go look at the achievements and see for yourself how many people actually play this game or even tamed a dino or discovered like 75% of the map, a very very very low percentage did.

Extreme racism, facism, lot of chinese/russian propaganda etc etc"

In addition to this the struggles to survive kept it realistic like starvation, dehydration, hypothermia, and more.

7941,"Although very fun, and a game you can get lost in and spend a whole day playing, it's end-game mechanics are insanely grindy and unfun and offer very little in the way of reward. You can spend dozens of hours first looking for a max/ near max level dino (rex, etc.) for bosses and then find one only for its highest stats to be oxygen and food :) Once you find a high-level AND good stats, you'll spend WEEKS at minimum breeding the wild tame, hoping for good mutations. These RNG mechanics make the game extremely infuriating at times. And for raising the dino, you need to return every 45 minutes just to come up to the baby and press E. If not done, there was no point to raising the dino as it becomes very underpowered.

In addition, the game is VERY, VERY badly unoptimized, causing even the best of PCs to fall their knees in terms of FPS and stutters. JUST to load into the game, it takes around 3 minutes (having mods increases this by a considerable amount.) I'm running an i7-7th gen and a 1060 6GB and I barely get 60FPS on medium settings, 1080p (I get around 30 when at base with my tamed dinos.)

And the glitches. Oh the glitches. Many encounters and multiple-hour long tames can be ruined due to glitches and stupid annoyances (Shadowmane keeps resetting tame progress; insects can come out of nowhere, attack u and ruin taming effectiveness on an ongoing tame; frequent no-reg when shooting a dino, and many more.) This makes it such that the most effective way to tame a dino is through exploits and structure traps.

All this isn't even taking into account PVP gameplay (I spent all my hours on PVE servers,) where game mechanics are exploited to their very limit. Players hiding loot in underground dinos, bases being made in unreachable areas, and extreme dino power unbalancing are just scratching the surface when it comes to PVP issues.

To defeat just one alpha boss (imagine all the bosses), you need to play the game like a full-time job, except there is very little skill involved, making actions in the game very unfulfilling. If you want to sink hours into a game and absolutely lose yourself, ARK is an alluring option to newcomers but is ultimately not worth your time or effort as a player."

7989,"It's not fun at all for me. The controls are all wonky and everything seems... it feels like I have to do too much to do so little. The controls are not intuitive for me. Like most games have what I would call a learning period. That is, you need to take a few minutes to get the feel. This game felt like nearly an hour in and it was still so foreign and clunky. If I had paid anything for it, I would have been disappointed, but since it was free? I will just throw it in the hidden list and forget about it. Is it possible that the free version is somehow inferior? I wouldn't have thought so, but who knows?"
7990,Best Game!! Been catching Sacro for 2 hours and 0 male.
7991,very nice
7992,get your coding fixed every update i got to fresh install and spend days getting game to work!
7993,"Ark has always been my favorite game at all times. there are no game like ark besides ark. I'm just here to thank the developers that thank you all made such a game and keep it updated for people like me to enjoy ourselves with our free time. TBH I am a little afraid, im afraid that one day ark will stop updating and dying out. I can't forget about the times when ark first come out and everyone just exploring the unknown world like it's so real. The caves, the ocean. All those feelings were printed in my mind. I believe there are many many people had the same feeling about ark. Once again, thank you ark team!!!!"

7995,Don't buy this shitty game. It barely works and has tones of bugs. It doesn't even let me delete it half the time.
7996,i'm already addicted

8006,ok i pull up

8008,fun game
8009,"Downloaded Ark during the peak of its popularity and had some fun with friends. Always felt the game was super jank and barely worked. Played it until our groups camp got raided and destroyed and everyone quit. Game is so far below par quality I haven't touched it since. Download and re-install it from time to time to see it patches and updates have improved anything and they don't. Everything about it feels cheap and half built, I can't wrap my head around how they are justifying making an Ark 2"

8059,RAWR
8060,good
8061,it's fun. specially when the weird  bugs and/or  hitboxes decideto screw you over. totally worth picking it up. hope it goes into an open beta soon.
8062,one of the best games
8063,it took about 8 hours to download and install it lol
8064,"love it
"
8065,"do you hate yourself and everything you stand for? Me too and that is exactly why you should download ark! Just tamed that level 180 rex that you've been wanting for the past 2 months? Well too bad! It's dead now because of the 34 stegosaurus' that were surrounding it's feet and decided to agro right AFTER you tamed it.
You can cry all you want, you won't get it back or anything close to it for another 20 hours. 

For that reason this game gets a KYS/10."

I still remember the amount of hacking and toxicity on official. Best way to play the game is with your own server with a couple of close buddies.

8149,worst game ever. disregard the 1000 hours which should be more but steam has some weird glitch that forgets gaming play time...it took real long to know that it sucks...I'm still playing just to make sure.
8150,"I've been playing this game off and on since early Early Access. It's been really cool seeing the evolution of a game about... well... Evolution (kind of). My wife and I now run our own servers, and mostly use it to scratch a building itch, or to see what's new in the DLCs, but we still have the same fun with it (maybe without the part where we didn't have a clue how to do anything) that we did at the beginning."
8151,Just a fun game thats been made even better with  the great mods you can add
8152,"pp

8153,Good

8155,the epic graphics in this game are sick

8158,Its a good game for both pve and pvp and ther so many mods you can choose :)
8159,Cool
8160,Purchase. Load. Actually bluescreen. 10/10.
8161,the best game i have ever played
8162,i have hiv bc of this game .
8163,loved the detail of eveything and how hard it was with some of the tames makes you need to play for awhile to get good so i like it
8164,Good enough. Can be buggy but it's just fun. Losing your tames is sad but it's a skill issue.
8165,greatr
8166,GOOD GAME :{:)
8167,Probably the best game ever made
8168,it's pretty fun but the non-dedicated servers suck
8169,"Fun game you will go through losses so if u cant handle that this game might not be for u
"
8170,not many player anymore
8171,epic
8172,WEED
8173,It's the only game with dinosaurs and fantasy creatures accompanied by one of the most finicky building systems in any game.
8174,its not working like ican play only the lost island map
8175,cool
8176,dinosaur
8177,storage go bye bye
8178,really fun
8179,"It's ok. However, when you decide to pick up a game and play it, there is opportunity cost to consider. There are a lot of things competing for our entertainment time. There are a lot of other things that I'd rather do than to play Ark."
8180,dinosaur
8181,"Recommend only non-official servers or single player where you can mod the heck out of it. Th official vanilla game is insufferable, there are so many inconveniences, so many limitations that don't make any sense and so much unfairness on official servers that it's nothing but frustrating. Some, of course, enjoy that, but having almost 4k hours on my Ark timer half on official, half on non-official, I would NEVER go back to official. Not if you paid me.
The game overall is great, I love the idea, the audiovisuals, the content, it took me several years to fully exhaust every single thing that there is in this game and by the time I had, there was something new out :D
"
8182,"There's some broken aspects to the PVP of this game, like not being able to build near others bases (meaning players will build objects all over the map so you can't build anywhere). The other big issue is transferring between servers. I want to play on a fresh server, so I join an arkpocalypse map and then immediately get met by someones max level dino of death that constantly kills me. Another example is when I want revenge on a tribe, so I kick their butts just to be met by more dinos from other servers. No matter how many times I destroy their bases they have other bases stationed throughout different servers so it's pointless to fight them and I can't find their main bases because I have no idea what server their stuff is coming from."
8183,IS GOOD GAME
8184,bulky man
8185,"I spawned in punched some trees, and dinosaurs, died countless times, made a base, tamed my first pteranodon that died 5 mins later and put in me a state of despair for a few days. Went back after recovering from the loss of my beloved pteranodon, tamed multiple dinos without getting emotionally attached this time, and killed the pack of raptors that had been terrorising my land only to be ambushed by a trex a few days later that wiped out all my dinosaurs. 10/10 despair simulator would recommend."
8186,dont touch me there thats my no no square
8187,"gud game, you will prob like if u like rust"
8188,"its fun
"
8189,This game is awsome
8190,games mid
8191,"I tried playing this multiple times with 2 different people, one who put hundreds of hours into the game and another who was just as new as I was. Both times I felt the janky building mechanics, unfair combat system, and the terrible user interface, I played 6 hours total between the 2 people (on different versions of the game). The whole inventory and crafting system is poorly designed. All most these games need to do is copy Minecrafts systems and add their own flare to it. In survival games it is mandatory to have this aspect well made. 

The game is WAY too difficult in the very beginning of the game. You die over and over again with no clear direction where you are supposed to go or what you are supposed to do. This is simply not fun to me and more frustrating than anything, and I am a Souls vet... 

To put the icing on the shit cake they want 300GB to put this game plus all the maps on your PC, Call of Duty Warzone which is notorious for having a over-bloated file size is only 175GB and this game does not have the right to be this size. Valheim whitch is one of my favorite survival games is only half a gig...

This game is simply ""not fun"" in my opinion. I would be willing to play this with a group of friends (as with most games) but I could not stand to play this by myself. It is free now so if you want to give it a shot then go for it."
8192,no cap mid game
8193,good game
8194,"Had the game since the early years on my Xbox, and now I own it for PC, and OMG! I have lost how many hours I have spend on it. So yahh! Is that good. Who doesn't like DINOS?! hehehe Building your dream home and having DINOS as PET... Let's F GOOO... ^__^"
8195,Look this game is great fun but it is LONG i have 16 hours on it and the end has got further away than when i started and it is for this reason that i feel i will unfortunately probably never beat the game unless you are fine with leaving a game unfinished and there dragging down your total achievement percentage then i would not recommend this game
8196,"yes, very good"
8197,Hard to run but it is very fun with mods
8198,Survive and Thrive!

My girlfriend and I have made so many amazing moments and memories playing this game together. She captures the dinosaurs and hunt. I will breed the dino and build anythings. We always fight together and have so much fun!

If you're good at survival games or are looking for a game to play with a family member or friend, I'll highly recommend this game!

I'm playing PVE with my girlfriend on a undedicated server but in my opinion, the servers seem depressing because the server will have the bug that make my girlfriend can't join in so I need to restart the game and invite her again."
8210,rawr
8211,"GOOD GAME,"
8212,good game. been playing for years on xbox and got it on my pc when it was free so i could play without insane lag spikes. sucks that i dont get my dlc back.

8222,Best game ive played in a while very brutal though so prepared to be heart broken or frustrated.

8224,i love getting raped by big dinosaur
8225,i like punching dodos
8226,"This game is not friendly. It is buggy, jank, old, but boy... with a good set of mods like better dinos and s+ etc plus a server with some great folk... wow you can have some fun. Before there was Valheim there was Ark.

Eyeballs? beware there can be some zany if you crank things too high... this game is NOT well optimized over the years. Clipping, odd flicker from artifacting... etc. No white flashing etc tho. This is not a full eyeball review.

Here is looking at Ark 2?"
8227,fun
8228,good. way too many bugs

8232,its fun
8233,i both love and hate this game so much
8234,its good
8235,CrossPlay is specific to brand like xbox to microsoft can play together while epic and steam can only play together kinda sad but money talks and thats big corp
8236,nice game
8237,"I love the game, but unfortunately, because of their published stance on political issues that I don't agree with, I have uninstalled the game and will no longer support the developers. To bad the developers couldn't stick with making totally cool games and remaining neutral or at least not being so in your face about their views. I feel as strongly about my views as they do and thus it leaves me no choice but to uninstall the game and remove my support. They just lost customers that would have loved to continue supporting the game..."
8238,"This game is fun in its own way, Mainly the single player mode is fun and easy to finish. Same as other games this game also have PvP servers that everyone should try. But they need to fix the game to increase the  performance. I hope ARK 2 give more better performance then its predecessor."

8253,nice
8254,"I tried ARK a few years ago but I couldn't get into it. I was recently looking for a new survival game and eventually decided to try Ark again and I have to say its a really great game. 
Don't just run off into the forest when spawning, level up, unlock some engrams and get yourself some easy tames to get started. I recommend maybe a Parasaur to help you farm a bit and a Raptor or 2 as some bodyguards/rides then snag yourself a Pterosaur and take to the skies, just keep an eye on that stamina, 
Also a top tip, 2 low level Raptors are no match for an alpha Allo, I learned that the hard way and we all ended up his dinner :)

There's lots of free Dlc's also, so far only tried the original Island map and the Ragnorok Dlc but they are really good.
Highly recommended game, I just wish I'd got into it sooner.

8256,Amazing game to play with friends.
8257,"Fun game, easy to get hooked"
8258,verry funnnnnn
8259,This is my favorite dinosaur game!
8260, i have over 4 thousand hours of this game on my xbox and its 10x better on pc so that speaks for its self
8261,good
8262,Best Survival Game Ever!
8263,"I do love taming dinosaurs, exploring the environments, and building bases.
But the game is riddled with bugs that have been there for years and the devs doing little to nothing about it.
If the devs would have worked to fix the bugs i'd give a big thumbs up, but since it's been over 5 years and i still can't equip the item-skin ""nerdy glasses""  without my underlying helmet still being there, the water still is very broken in multiplayer, several of the maps have creatures randomly hovering in the middle of the air or being stuck in a random rock, the ichtyosauruses still beach themselves and die randomly, i can't really reccomend this game.

If the devs focused on fixing what's already there instead of releasing new DLC every once in a while, that would certainly be preferred. And for chrissake, making the game a bit smaller wouldn't hurt either. With the near 400-gig space needed for the basegame + all the DLCs, this one game is taking a huge chunk out of my computerspace.

If there was another game, just like ark but with less bugs, likely i'd move over to that game instantly."
8264,yep
8265,cool game crashes sometimes dodo go boom nice mod dino level 9999999 turkey will kill you rex will eat you dont mess with the worms

And you got PVE were you can chill and play the game with friends or alone. Even the servers can be good depends how popular and how far the server days are. And the modded Servers can be very fun, you can have fun with just few mods or like 100 of mods."
8343,It has some trouble with crashing and starting at times but other then that it's a very cool game! Very fun with friends.

8351,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there’s fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

8368,i finished boizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
8369,"Spent hours downloading the game. Finally finish it up. Friends noticed there is developer sponsored mods so we go and get those since clearly the game dev should be making it easy to play their games with those mods. Then spend an hour after that trying to get into my friends game. Nothing in the multiplayer menu indicating I'm loading in. After 10 minutes i get a timed out message. We talk to our friend who has played it before, says its totally normal. You just have to wait for half-an hour without indication that your actually loading in before you an load in. And if you do the normal thing of clicking ""ok"" and trying to relog. it blocks you out from getting in without closing the game. For all the good i heard from this game, I can't believe the developers fucked up that bad on basic multiplayer infrastructure. Instead of trying to build a new game, how about you fix this crap so its possible to even play it."
8370,"This game is very fun with friends and is just as much fun playing solo. Especially with the variety of maps, animals, and the different experiences you get by playing. I wouldn't say it's completely worth all the money but it does open up a lot of stuff to do. It is all worth it when playing the free dlc though because when you unlock the dlc it gives you so much extra content for years to come."
8371,"good game
"
8372,Monke
8373,i have really enjoyed playing this game. only 2 things that i don't like. every official server i tried are old and when you try to build people have pilons everywhere preventing u. the other is if u run a dedicated server ur friends can only go so far from u. so it leads the exploration limiting. but if u or a friend have there own server to run or rent a private server or just play single player by urslf than the game is one of my favorite survival games out there.

8406,"the game is fairly detailed, the dino's are fairly accurate.
the only downside is it hard to know what to do after you tame the dinos. you dont realize you have to go into caves to progress. as well as the predator dino's dont really eat one another which in my opinon is un realistic. the food chain should be there where every predator has a scale and goes after one another to make it more realisitic."

8413,"Honestly, it's just buggy. The novelty of the dinos is fun enough to push you through a bit but honestly nothing feels polished about this game. Lots of bugs, jittery behaviors and just random strange things happen like being sent through the floor or into space. Game has inconsistent game design with random difficulty spikes for the games objectives and caves. This game with all the expansions will also consume well over 200 gb of data. 

From a technical perspective, this game really just isn't there. It feels like a student project that got out of hand and they just had to keep going because of demand for new features rather than fixing the foundation of the game.

8440,"UI/HUD mindlessly slapped onto the screen just that ""something"" is there. No tutorial that explains basic gameplay and functions (had to look up in the options for important keys). Terrible User Experience. The basic idea seems nice, I like the progression system, taming seems fun too. Game has lots of potential.
UI & early gameplay feels like out of an early access game.  Guess there is a reason why there are no images of the UI and HUD in the screenshots....

Playing this is very frustrating in the beginning and gameplay feels rough and unpolished. Will update review once I play more. Right now I really can't recommend it. Don't understand the many positive reviews at all

8445,DODO :D
8446,wow such a cool game
8447,"My experience has been wasted within this concept.  I have 126 hours into just the first map in single-player and 9 different characters.  In that amount of time I learned how to circumvent the software but I did not learn how to play the game, in that amount of time.  Supposedly there is suppose to be some point to the software, but I haven't figured out what that is.  So what have I been doing for my 100+ hours?  I learned how to build a building.  

I learned how to use admin commands to bypass the taming convention by simply hitting TAB and typing: cheat summontamed trike_character_bp_c and then hit enter and a trike of various age will appear. Whoops!  Going to need a saddle: Hit TAB and type: cheat gfi trikesaddle 1 0 0 ,  Going to need some food: Hit TAB and type: cheat gfi kibble_base_special 100 0 0 - if this software had had structure - I probably wouldn't have learned that.  That will save you a helluva lot of time in this game because the Trike is the  number one dinosaur for exploration because if you put points into ""Oxygen"" your Trike can swim underwater or just on the surface, really well - if you want to go fast the Trike is one of the few dinosaurs whose movement speed can be increased considerably - a Trike in the short-term - is an amphibious - all-terrain tank

I used two mods with my game - Auto Engrams and Pre-made Structures and once I found it I began using ""Creative Mode"" to quicken the game - instant crafting without the need for ingredients.  Just double-click the item you want and you'll get between 20 to 100+ in an instant.  And that's fine that opens up a whole new aspect of this software.  But I still don't know how to play the game. and I can still only carry just so much - which limits that ability.

If you are going to use mods from the Steam Workshop be advised that to remove any mod that you ""subscribe to"" from your game.  It must be done from inside the workshop and not the game, manually.  So how do you do that?  Inside the game there will be a window that list available mods that you can activate.  Write down the name of each mod you want rid of, on a note pad.  Exit the game.  Open up Steam and open the Workshop.  Enter each name into the 'search' bar and then unsubscribe to that mod and it will remove it from the game.  

So is there a reason why you might want to keep your mods down to a short list?  Within this window there will be two sections for the mods - the first window just holds the mods and the second window contains those that are active.  However, let's say we have 20 mods in the first window that are inactive and we have two mods that are in the second window that are active.

Exit the game and then re-enter.  Make it all the way back to the mod window and click on ""Single Player"" button and an error message will appear to tell you that the ""loading screen"" is installing 20 mods to the game.  You'll have to wait until that's done.  The game is going to do this every time, you try to enter the actual game - it is an extra 10 minute in loading time for you to play this game - so you really want to keep your list down to only those ""mods"" you actually use.  This game doesn't remember that you have already loaded and installed these mods between sessions.

Little things add up, eventually.  I'm really starting to hate these types of games.  If you a wild hair up your bum and think you might want to increase the level cap of your game and your thinking of looking for videos on YouTube - been there - done that - broke game.  There are two videos one is by a girl who will explain how to raise the level by 250 and then there is Havoc and he will tell you how to increase your level cap to 500.  But to do this you have to be willing to add some information from an out-sourced-document from Google to the game.ini file from within the actual game.  When you do it make a directory and place a copy of the game.ini inside of it for safe measures - because your going to screw this up.  

Go ahead and make the changes by copying and pasting the various paragraphs from the google document.  Although there is one name for the file there is actually two files.  The one by the girl has three paragraphs and Havoc's has five paragraphs.  Now save the file and re-engage with the game.  I was told through these videos that I would get about 418 levels as oppose to the 105 levels I now have and that I could do something similar for my tamed dinosaurs.  Seems worth while -- why wait?

You've heard of ""Pandora's Box"" right?  I got the 418 levels for my character as a existing character and a new character - my dinosaurs didn't get shit.  It made other changes to my game which neither videos mentioned.  That little bar at the top of the Inventory window that denote your XP, it no longer has the animation that would suggest that XP levels, are increasing.  For my character I lost the ability to interact with the game.  While you can still pick things up using the ""E"" key.  You can't defend yourself - found that out the hard way - the hot-bar items don't work any longer.  Well, that's real helpful.  The animation for swinging an ax is missing - since I made the change.

To fix what I had done.  I had to do more than replacing copy of the original file in the proper directory.  I had to delete every thing in the ""Save"" directory: Config, LocalProfiles, and SaveArkLocal.  Before I made this change to my game.ini file I had just revealed all the Island map.  What a pain that was.  After the change I was force to delete the character who had done all that work and now I'm going to have to re-do that.  It took me 3 days, to do that.  Now I don't want to do any thing on this map.

I still don't know how to play this game.  Clearly, you can understand why I can't recommend this game to you.  To do that I would have to know what I'm doing and as you can clearly see, I haven't a clue."

8452,"got r*ped by a therizino, still fun tho
"
8453,This is an amazing game and I do not regret buying it.
8454,"Many glitches but i still love it, personally i think it gets a bad reputation because of that, devs work hard to make the glitches go away. 6 Years ago when i discovered this game by a youtuber were the best times of my life."
8455,"Nice game, a friend of mine had a server and asked me to play on it
i rate it 10/10
Died like 200 times but oh well xd"

8465,"I have over 1100 hours of this on the PlayStation and only recently moved onto PC but have never lost interest in this game. Something about the great game loop and the excitement of fighting and taming majestic beasts is just alluring to me. I've only had the game since it was free but the game play of PC Ark just put more fuel on the fire that is my love for this game. I first played Ark in early 2016 when i got my PS4 and i just played with my mates and had a good time, I still have fun playing Ark even though most of my friends have moved on. I look forward to the numerous hours I am undoubtedly going to have over the next few years."

8494,ark 2
8495,make bigger rafts and make it so people do not get dragged on non dedicated server
8496,Dinosaurs :)
8497,"Tl;dr - Do not

The UI is a MESS, things don't look like clickable labels, but absolutely are. Sliders for server settings not only don't work in whole numbers, they also don't give you any kind of idea of scale! There's no VSync option, thanks for that...(You need to manually edit a configuration file to enable it, have fun) and the default settings for non-dedicated servers make other players just teleport back to host if they go too far away, like.... WHAT? Everything just kind of piles up into this huge orchestra of annoying garbage that drags you down and slows down the learning experience, which in turns leaves you extremely vulnerable because YOU'RE IN YOUR MENU LIKE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK IS AN ENGRAM????????? So you just keep getting destroyed by random beasts that have decided you look delicious! I can easily see so much potential here, but I can't honestly figure out why people like it, after just this little taste of the game..."

8509,"Breeding. This is my topic. The game has sort of realistic Dinos which i am happy to have unlike Jurrasic park but, one problem about the games realism, breeding. The game is totally trying to have a realistic feel so i thought to make the game better upon release of Ark Survival Evolved 2 there should be realistic breeding. not just standing. Imagine if someone wanted to become a dog breeder or something around that area, they would first need to prepare for the actual breeding part. So if you add realistic breeding it could help irl breeders understand what they are doing. Also, i'm not a breeder nor do i know any breeders. But its just a suggestion. -Not a weirdo just a supporter of realistic intentions."
8510,"Its a good game. Wasted hours of my life I'll never get back, but man was it worth it."
8511,good
8512,"nice game. but this game get a lot of time to play

8515,better than rust
8516,THE MODS WILD ARK ARE INSANE ARK IS WORTH THE WAIT
8517,"It was very fun and cool, provided some serious entertainment! Only complaint is the game is massive, and after recently uninstalling, the GB space require has almost fully doubled, and due to me not having the best computer (I play on a work laptop aha-), I don't have space whatsoever to reinstall. Other than that, it's an amazingly fun game! From the stuff I've seen in DLCs, the maps are WONDERFUL! If you're a dinosaur or survival game fan, you should totally check it out! ^^"

8540,"Ever since I was a wee lad, I noticed my penis was a bit large. I thought it was normal, untill my mom bathed me with my brother and I saw his little wee wee compared to mine, I couldn't help but point at it and mock it. A few months later when I started kindergarden, the teacher inspected our cocks for the monthly cock inspection, and noticed my large cock. I was very young but I could still see he was very envyous of my humongous cock, knowing he will never be as big, he called my mom and told her a doctor should see my penis. The doctor said he had never seen such an amazing specimen of a dong, that was the first moment I saw pride in my mom's eyes. I cherish these memories, as the cock inspection was the pinnacle of any month for me, seeing all the other pathetic little weiners. I loved watching the other kids take quick glances of my cock in fear and shame. Few years later when I was about 11 years old, my penis has started to become a burden for me. Having a 24 inch cock in 6th grade is no joke, I had to come up with creative ideas of where to hide the magnificent beast. Usually I hid it inside the right leg of my pants, kids always thought it was weird how my right leg was so ""muscular"" compared to my other, which meant I had to workout only my left leg in order to not arouse suspicion. I remember I went home depressed one day, crying to god on why he cursed me with such a shaft. I was tearing my pants with anger, when I started to feel a tingly sensation in my penis. I started rubbing it, and suddenly it GREW EVEN LONGER, I was devestated because I thought it was already too large, but the feeling I had when I was rubbing, it was too good to stop. I started holding it with both my hands and stroking it, but it was not enough, I could not satisfy my monster with mere hands, so I began using my feet too. The feeling was incredible, god was on my side again. As I was rubbing it faster and faster, I thought of my science teacher. My cock was throbbing, my nipples erect, my eyes wide and open. I was on my bed at the time, and I felt my Johnson about to erupt with tremendous force, I didn't know what to do so I hid under the bed, and then I came. It was like 4th of july. At first the stream was steady, of white cream in about 1 liter per second, then it was chaos. My penis was going up and down dancing with explosions of cum (Only later that day I found out my grandpa died at that moment of a heart attack because the sounds reminded him of bastogne when he was fighting the Germans). After a few second I realized I might drown because my juice covered the whole floor about two inch deep, I quickly slid across pools of cum gasping for air, I stood up and finally, my cum gun started to relax. My mom came into the room shocked and disgusted, she yelled at me that I must see a doctor and get my manhood shortend or even removed. The day after my grandfather's funeral, I came to the doctor's office, and told him my story. After a lengthy cock inspection, he said that I have a rare condition, which makes my cock grow exponentially with each year, width and length. He calculated that my cock would weigh 200 kg when I turn 30, which is about the maximum weight my spine can support, beyond that and it would fracture and I'll die. I asked him if I could remove it, but he said no because I would die of blood loss. He also said I need to do blood transfusions everyday to feed my absolute unit of a schloong the blood it needs. Needless to say, I was devestated, my once blessing, became a curse, again. One day when I was 16, I was in my math class when I heard a terrible noise, it reminded me of the first time I was beating my meat, but it turns out it was just a gunshot. Kids all around me were shouting that there was a school shooter. I immediately got up and ran to the door, carrying my pack with my hands. Suddenly I heard shots very close to my ears, and saw dead bodies on the ground, so I ran into the closest door which was the janitor's room, closed the door and hid under the table making as little noise as possible. Little did I know, my crush was under the same table, hiding there in fear, when she saw me she almost screamed, but I put both my hand over her mouth and told her to be quiet. I heard the shooter opening the door slowly and looking for me. I was completely silent, but then I noticed my crush's incredible bajongas, and I felt my cock starting to throb and expand. She seemed to notice, and I could see that she was impressed with my goofy goober. Her facial expression made my ding dong enlarge even more and I could feel my pants starting to tear apart. My shclong abong seemed to send electro-magnetic waves all over the room because the light above us started to flicker with every throb of my cock. The shooter noticed that and walked to our table. I knew I had to do something quickly or me, my crush, and my beaver basher would all die. Then it hit me, and I knew what I had to do. I looked over to my crush, and I started playing with her milkers. At first she was trying to resist, but then she figured out what I was trying to do and played along. My cock grew more and more, and when I felt it about to burst out of my pants. I got up and looked straight at the shooter. He hesitated for a single moment, which cost him his life. My pants exploded as my sexcalibur shot out a single hardened white cum shaped like a 7.62 mm sniper bullet right into the shooter's head. I was about to celebrate but then I noticed the smell of smoke in the air, turns out my massive shot not only the shooter, but also a gas pipe that was in the vicinity. Fire was all around us, as I held my crush close, I knew there was no way both of us would get out of here, so there was only one option. ""Get in!"" I said. ""What?"" She asked. ""Get in! There is no time!"" I said and pointed to my foreskin. She climbed inside the pocket between my foreskin and my cock. And I started running, breathing smoke and caughing, kicking doors and running through hallways, longing for fresh air. Finally I got out of the school, and I saw everyone looking at me and my dong. I slowly walked to the benches, and sat down to breath. Then I saw my crush's mother, and she asked me where her daughter is. I got up, and said ""I know where she is!"". I pulled my foreskin and there she was. I expected to hear claps and cheers, but when I didn't, I looked at my crush and saw she was dead. Turns out she suffocated inside my yogurt hose. The police arrested me, and here I am, with my massive schlong and 15 years in prison. If your penis is small, do not despair, for at least you did not have to go through what I did. Farewell."

8571,"You start the game and go yep, this is a fun little diddy ... Then run into bugs and go this game is rubbish. And then you find yourself almost 6000 hours in scooping dino poop to put into poop bugs that will give you fertiliser, that you will use on your crop plots in order to get veggies. Veggies you will use for food and food. Then after feeding your dinos (if not all of them are frozen after 10 years), you go and attend other things, like getting petrol for electricity or getting materials for building stuff. Look game is awesome. No way about it. I do not like reliance on sci-fi, i preferred it as a dino game. But other people love it, I just play Island map even though i do enjoy comforts other maps provide :).  Have a go, you will not be sorry. Do note Ark 2 is coming out soon."

8621,very hard but very fun
8622,"good game for single player mode, dont play multiplayer official servers are full of alpha shops players who sell bosses and if you try to do boss on your own good luck.Multiplayer servers of official are not trustworthy, it can go down/crash and all your months or years of grinding on a character is gone. we need to lvl up every single character with lvl cap of bosses if it is lost all is gone. think twice before playing this game as multiplayer survival game.
I have a 30+ years gaming experience from all type of games and this game is good for single player mode. I cant recommend it for multiplayer good luck!




On official servers pve , server goes down every 30min when on dont buy if you want to play on official servers. buy only if you are going to play on unofficial owned srvers or singleplayer"

8663,skooty killed all my dinos
8664,you can tame lots of animals
8665,good game the graphics mwah
8666,"Lots of variation with the free maps, and tons of fun to play. There is almost nothing wrong with the game other than a few minor bugs. However, never ever use cheats in the middle of a play through, it takes away all excitement and wonder ."
8667,Raid is bad.I put people that raid in cages and make them dance before i rape them.
8668,Good game. Fun game. the terror birds and the piranhas can go fuck themselves though
8669,very good
8670,"i like this game, very interesting with lots of different maps and dinosaurs. The graphics and fun is well worth the money!"
8671,It's awesome. That's all.
8672,"I have tried quite literally everything to get this to run on a RTX 3090 AND IT STILL RUNS LIKE DOG SHIT, optimize your game for once
"
8673,Best game
8674,Dinosaur go brrrr
8675,so good
8676,but servers and mod xcome laggin
8677,"Great survival game, No normal tigers but dinos. There is alot of issues like the meshing in the game but i find it fun and try to go around it, There's also some nice lore to find and complete the puzzles. Graphics are good as well as the grinding and fighting."
8678,Just good
8679,"awesome game,especially when u encounter no life kids who trap u in a cage and feed u drugs.+rep
"
8680,Fun
8681,ark
8682,"Overall disappointed. I do believe the game itself is playful and enjoyable. However, as a 10k hours PVP ark player,  I have seen too many inequalities in official pvp, especially the dev's behaviour in which legit farmers get tribe banned without any warning due to a mesh built that was not pre-acknowledged and thought as a livable rathole in Fjordur. Whereas, others publicly use sub-accounts for aimbots and ESP but are still sustainable even when evidence is provided."

you cant sex dinos :("

8694,I love survival games like this and the added bonus that you can tame and ride dinosaurs to help with the gathering and stuff? love it
8695,simply greatness awesomeness powerfulness
8696,"ARK has come a long way from when I started playing in 2015 with early access and now it's enormous both in success and features. The MODs are what bring many personal touches to my server and I appreciate all the efforts by every single modder. Good alone but best when played with friends, solid recommend."
8697,"not that fun, too complicted"
8698,i played on console before before i play on pc so i ave about 1-3k hours but switch to console and still love the game and plan on starting to play it again but on pc because it's a great game.

8705,koks
8706,"cool luh game
"
8707,Yes
8708,"Its a fun sandbox type style game with a story behind it. I very much enjoy playing this game co-op. The dinos could use updates as well as the graphics. I wish you could move time along a little faster especially in the beginning when you can't do much at night at least for me. I like to build up first. The special events are nice but I wish there was a bit of guidance on how to use some of the items collected. I personally would like some guidance with collecting items more so the explorer notes. It would be nice too if it was marked on the map for future references when looking for them so you know what areas you have covered. Overall, I think it is a solid game to play."
8709,Fk yeah!
8710,"Game is meh, look at this instead.

8721,"I'm so unbelievably done with this game. It used to be great, I loved flying around on magical griffins and stomping down entire forests on giant dinosaurs. But then one day the game just decided to stop working. I don't know why. I tried everything to fix it, and it still crashes every time. I've spent almost 4 hours trying to get it to work, and it still crashed. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. I can tell it's a beautifully made game with mods to make it even more fun, but it doesn't work for me. If anyone has any advice on how to get it to work again, I'd love to hear it."

8740,Have spent around 10000 hours on this game over multiple accounts and platforms. While there are countless amounts of bugs and issues this is a pioneer game and one of a kind. No matter how many breaks i take i always come back. Thanks a lot studio wildcard.
8741,"For the love of God, don't get attached to anything you tame, because it's just about to get killed in a new and exciting way right around the next corner."

8754,dino dookie
8755,ITs LIke MiNecRAft!!!
8756,I think this game is very addicting and great. The only thing is that the joining through steam is very glitchy because some days it works and others it doesn't.
8757,"Fun game for an old lady!  I play on a PvE server, nice group, very helpful! Pvp is way too out there crazy for me, other tribes raiding, putting you in a lock box, stealin' your tames, yep, not for me.  Hubby's cousin swears by it though, lol!  So I would certainly recommend for most ages, and don't be mad or rage when you get eaten, or your tame dies, or when things go bad, try to expect that as it is a survival game!  If I can get better, everyone else can too!!  I love you Ark <3"
8758,funnnn
8759,Got GangBanged by a T-Rex
8760,Very good survival game
8761,This game right here is the ultimate time consumer You can start playing at 10 P.M. Friday and then look up and turns out it is 7 a.m. tuesday the day before you are to wed your beloved sweetheart but she hasn't heard from you all weekend thinking that you've backed out of the wedding she has called all your friends and family explain how awful of a person you are.... Would you rather explain to them you were riding Dinosaurs Bareback all weekend or let them know that your entire consciousness was consumed by this game
8762,noice
8763,good game
8764,i just love exploring and taming new dinos and creating dino armys
8765,ark

8773,nice game
8774,"I've had this game for years now and I still love it. Sure the massive game files take up a TON of computer space, and while the graphics and files can make the game lag a lot. There are sources we can use to help edit files to make the experience more enjoyable and lag free. Besides those issues it is fun if you can manage a group of friends to play together or get yourself into a nice server with nice people."
8775,"This is the greasiest game ive ever seen. I recommend to all those who have interest with communicating with people above the age 30 with 3 kids, xbox mics, and music u can barely make out the lyrics of in the background. (warning: playing this game can make you spontaneously gain 50 pounds)"

8809,"As Someone who has played this game when it first released on PS4, watched videos and lets plays even before that.. To See how far ARK has come as a game is amazing. I probably have well over 1000-2000 Hours in total... The Game itself is a survival game set in a future where Humanity has fled Earth because of many Lore reasons. And created ""ARKs"" As a way to survive. These ARKs were land masses floating in space around Earth, Which held the rest of Humanity on them. It was also home to many creatures, Extinct animals and Dinosaurs. I wont go over the entire story here.. but Basically Rockwell was a big meanie who was looking for a power to defeat the Titans  who had taken over the planet, but another survivor Helena, also was looking for that power. And in the End Rockwell finds and uses the power to become even more powerful which sets him on a dangerous life changing path. Eventually he gets onto the Colony Ship. You team up with Helena to take him down and in doing so Destorys both him, Helena and the infected part of the ship.. This then Leads into ARK 2.

The game itself has seen better days. Optimization is Abysmal on some maps, Especially Gen 2.. But The Main game, which includes The Island, Center, Ragnorok, Valguero, Crystal Isles, The Lost Island and Fjordur. Is Amazing.. You now have access to most if not all of the DLC Engrams and creatures. And they are planning on adding one more creature known as the Carcharodontosaurus. Over the years they have updated, Patched and fixed a ton of things.. But they also have added a ton of bugs and issues like the optimization for some maps. There are still some bugs that have been in the game since the initial Early Access Release.. Some are pretty funny like how some dead dinosaur corpses just become Eldritch Beasts. But there are some where whole days of progress can be wiped out... 

When this game is working.. It is an experience that can truly not be replicated. Yes there are other survival games like Rust or even The Isle.. But the act of completing a whole map in this game, ascending and progressing to the next.. bringing friends along the way.. defeating whole tribes and becoming alphas or even forming an alliance and taking on these bosses.. Its.. Amazing.. Obviously there are bitter memories as well.. Loss of progress because of bugs, Glitches and probably a hundred other possibilities.. Starting over from scratch.. You will have these memories if you play this game.. You will also have Fond memories too. Ones of your First Tame, Triumph and first Home built.. Your first true loss of your fav dino.. 

The developers have tried to fix everything.. But many will say they didn't try hard enough.. And that is probably true. They deserve criticism for that, Especially when they are making an experience for the next generation. Our feedback will be used as long as we keep providing it.. All these mistakes in development.. Will be used as a example for them to look back on.. as a way for them to Do. It. Right.. ATLAS is a kind of example too. It shows how much they progressed in development..

I Recommend this game fully.. You WILL have a hard time at first.. You WILL probably get frustrated over some bugs(both Physically and also technically lol), You WILL contemplate how much time you want to put in this game that has such a huge grind.. But once you get into it.. Once you found your footing, Watched your first few videos on how to tame a creature, how to efficiently progress.. You will laugh at those first few moments you had.. You will enjoy sipping on your Mixed Berry juice recipe you made, while laying down in your Metal Fortress. And you will look toward the future.. wanting more and you might download a few mods to play around with.. 

The Sheer amount of Dopamine/Accomplishment this game will make you feel greatly outweighs the negatives..  I could sit here and type for hours.. and hours on how much this game is good.. and bad. But the best thing I can tell you is once you have sat here for hours/days possibly weeks/months playing this game.. You will understand what I mean. The Community this game has is also amazing, The Sponsered Mod Program, The ARKitects, The PVP Wars and Alpha/Mega Tribe Wars.. Its amazing.. So many things.. SOO much history is in this game. I Just hope you and many others can be a part of it. 

If you want a more detailed video on the Development on ARK and the history of it up until Fjordur.. I actually Recommend a video I made quite recently. It misses a few things as there was so much to go over.. but It goes over the Game wayy better than I can here.. To anyone reading this I Hope you have a wonderful day..    -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsrRDPcK-Ao"

8821,with mods this game is so good but if you just play it in vanilla it is still going to be a blast but start with pve and then do a tad bit of pvp because pvp could ruin the expirence if you start to early
8822,"crashes constantly, difficult to play with friends and not polished"
8823,"Fun game, but the bugs that make local multiplayer occasionally unplayable that have been in the game for YEARS, with ZERO fixes, make it nearly impossible for me to recommend this game to anyone. Along with how poorly optimized the lighting is, you have to turn your gamma up at night to see anything at all, then you have to turn it down before the sun comes up otherwise you'll get flash-banged in real life through your damn monitor.

7/10 on fun
2/10 on dev's fixing bugs
4/10 on lighting
0/10 on customer support

In total I'd give this game a 10/10, but only when you're drunk with friends.
If you're sober, this game is a solid 4/10."

8836,"the best game i have 311 hour on it and i only started a bit ago
"
8837,game soooooo gooood
8838,"Whilst I was sceptical at first this game has me hooked. It combines survival and crafting with the hunting and taming creatures that I have never experienced in another game. Throw in the cool factor of dinosaurs (and lots of different types) it is on to a winner.
Be warned however it can be challenging and at times down right frustrating but for every low there is an equal or greater high with each new kill or tame.
Grab it on sale and prepare yourself for an experience like no other."
8839,simply said the best game ever!

8866,"Pokemon but with dinosaurs? how could it go wrong?

 Wildcard entertainment is how.  All their programmers are raptors. they can only hunt and peck, and SKREE is their only verbal option.  It is evident from the unique to ark level of bugs as well as the incredible inefficiency of PC resource usage that keeps ark hard to run even in 2022.  Thank goodness Vin Diesel has joined the team for Ark 2, that will fix everything I am sure.

I still play it but nobody should have to go through what I have."

8946,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. That being said, I have only been able to really enjoy the game on private servers with heavily modified settings. The game in its vanilla form is one of the greatest time pits of all time and is almost unplayable by people with lives/jobs. The game also suffers from an insane number of bugs and glitches that have been present and unfixed for so long that the work-arounds have became the long standing meta. Rent a server and play with your friends and you will have a blast, just make sure to do regular backups of game data."
8947,This game was great with tons of fun. I really enjoyed the variety of creatures and the exploration. I would really recommend getting this when it's on sale. (which happens a lot.)
8948,"Good game, Gets a bit too much hate"
8949,"This game is great! It competes with RUST, but in my opinion this game is more entertaining, it has some bugs there and there, but it's a big game! You will need a heavy-duty or custom-made pc to be able to handle this game! (I've played longer than 3 hours, Its around the 3 months mark)"

8954,"Fun with mods, specifically the immersive taming mod so you don't have to knock out dinos and force feed them while unconscious to tame...such a strange mechanic.
Otherwise, definitely fun with friends!"

8962,"Steep learning curve but fun. 

Although I cant recommend this game as I was banned for throwing my dinosaurs out inside someones ""base"" (no walls, just an area) and was reported by the veteran player who's area I was in. I was PERMANENTLY banned from ALL online servers for doing so. First and only offence, after just a few weeks of purchasing the game.How is this fair? I appealed the ban multiple times and was rejected... Would love someone from Wildcard with half an ounce of rationality to look at my case please."

8974,"Ark is all in all a good game with many great features. The survival aspect is cruel and unforgiving (which i think is a good thing), the overall gameplay feels robust with a few hickups here and there but most of these can be fixed with mods or by tweaking settings which i think is my favorit part of the game! The developers allowing you to customize allmost every aspect of the game with the provided settings menu before launching a your game is awesome! And if there is one aspect of the game that bothers you that you can't seem to get rid of thorugh the provided settings then there are quiet the handfull of mods out there that may/will improve of fix issues. 

I think the game shines the most in singleplayer or with a couple friends messing about, taming dinos and fighting bosses together. And don't make me talk about the DLCs, most of the are great but genesis 1&2 are not that great.

All in all if you are a sucker for survival games and dinosaurs then this game has no superiors, pick it up as soon as you can!"

Do yourself a favor, turn on ""Allow flyer speed leveling"" the Argentavis is way too slow without a few points into speed, hardest part of the game is messing with the world settings until getting to a comfortable level"

9061,yes
9062,"Well holy shit is this game fun.

The maps official and modded are awesome to explore and play with. 

Dinosaurs are fun to run away from, fight and tame for all of the modded and official.

The bosses are certainly quite challenging and tough to go against.


However, here's a few basic things to know and learn. 

1. Stay the fuck away from ANY official PvP or PvE server if you have any interest in keeping your sanity intact.
Plenty of russian, chinese hackers, zerg clans and mesh cheaters galore. These servers will constantly crash and are so laggy, it'll throw you back into the stone age. Not to mention progress is rolled back often so that 7 hours spent on farming resources
or you looted a dungeon and got some super cool loot? Nope, fuck you. It's gone mother fucker and good luck trying to find something like it again.

2. Buy this game ONLY if you have a high end PC, at least a 2080TI if you want decent frames because the performance/optimization is absolutely terrible.

3. Play either single player, private servers with friends you trust completely or unofficial servers with active admins who don't abuse their powers.

4. Do not play with the basic rates for the game unless you really want this game to become a micro managing job all day long.
How long do you think taming a dino can take? 
A: A couple minutes? 
B: A few hours?
C: A couple days?
D: A week?
E: A month?

Answer: Every answer except A. 

Taming dinosaurs takes forever and you have to guard it the ENTIRE time unless you want to redo it all over again. If 
ANYTHING hurts a knocked out dino that's being tamed, you're fucked. If it wakes up mid tame, you're fucked. If you didn't bring enough tranq darts or arrows or you didn't bring enough kibble or food, you're fucked. So you have to wait and watch 
over it the entire time and not be AFK once. Does that sound fun? Oh, let's not forget players can steal your knocked out 
dino you're trying to tame if you're not quick enough.

The same goes for hatching eggs and raising baby dinos until they become an adult. While you deal with less threats, they
still take a long time so that means you're micro managing them.

If you play the game with trusted friends, with boosted rates so taming, hatching and raising dinos are fast, you will be 
playing the game and having fun, not mommy simulator.

If you ever played Rust, the survival PvP game and thought the grind was bad and how the game turned into a chore/job? Ark 
achieves that and far worse on standard rates.


Most of the modded maps on the workshop are incomplete and some are dead with development being canceled.
Tons of new creature mods, new weapons or armor mods out there. TONS and tons of QOL and building mods for all types 
of themes.

Do be wary that mods have a strong impact on your performance, be it from taking longer to load or by lower fps. Don't go 
crazy with installing 30-100+ mods on a map unless you want a slideshow. Your best bet is 5-15 mods that are small in size. Big mods that are 1-2GB's big takes much longer to load so do try to stay away from them even if you have an SSD. 

With no mods on the Island map with an SSD, I can load the map within 3 seconds which turns to 20+ seconds when I add 5-7 small 50MB to 250MB mods.

With the game on a regular HDD and no mods, it'll take anywhere from 7 minutes to 15 minutes. With light mods or big mods installed, that can take at least 30 to 60 minutes long.
"
9063,its addictive
9064,BBBBBBBBB
9065,10/10 + mods
9066,I love this game. Not a fan of pvp but solo playthroughs and private sessions with friends are some of the most fun you can have. This game is a great concept and still an amazing product even if it's a little scuffed. There are many glitches that are hilarious like the ragdoll physics that make dead bodies look possessed and annoying ones like projectile invalids where your shots don't register even if they use up ammo. All in all I would recommend this to anyone who can look past the glitches and bugs.

9132,Wild card has ruined this game more than ever first they raid bases and I thought it was a legit raid until It came clear to me that they just left a door open that was locked noticed it was damaged and they straight up were to lazy to break into the top floor door that they just opened the door with whatever admin tools they can use on that game I am sorry but these types of people do not deserve your money or your time also I would like to point that that they give away free mounts that u can enjoy then just take it away from you so if anyone likes to read these reviews its what I have experenced already at 200 hours of game play WildCard does not want you to have fun and they just wipe when u start to get good they are just a bunch of egotisitcal devs that are going to do the samething in Ark2 but worse Wild Card is not proper and only pros can enjoy the game that they choose who to like dont play it not worth it.
9133,"FUN GAME? JUST NEEDS TO BE BETTER OPTIMIZED

9150,"Bought this game to play singeplayer, just to find the game is absolutely BROKEN in singleplayer with game killing bugs that have existed for YEARS without being fixed. The biggest of all being that resources, the single most important thing in the entire game, will completely break and never respawn in singleplayer. Eventually leading to an entire map with no resources left. And the developers absolutely refuse to fix it many many years later. (Been an issue since 2017 it seems.)

Update: Game is even worse than I'd imagined when I first made this review. Given how singleplayer was completely broken, I spent a few days setting up a personal server to play on, only to find out thats completely broken too, with construction being completely broken/bugged on servers. (But not singleplayer.) I wouldn't wish this TRASH on my worst enemy.

Incompetant developers, terrible company, broken game."
9151,i like
9152,Yeah it's alright I guess
9153,Its a pretty good game however it takes up a massive amount of disk space on the computer like 125 Gb worth of space thats even more than payday 2 dont download this game unless you have the space for it.

9157,"Pretty good game when it actually runs well, is horribly optimised and the devs seem to have no intrest in fixing it but either way its still afun game to play with friends or by yourself.

9158,very good game
9159,I enjoyed playing it. its a fantastic game. i recommend this game a 100%
9160,amazing
9161,so far only played 4 hours of this game but i enjoy it really its good to play with a group of people its one of those games that you will play for a couple thousand hours and get tired of it already its a time consuming game but worth the money if u play it for a couple thousand hours but still worth it love the game already
9162,its 196gb
9163,Save yourself
9164,im just here so i wont get fined
9165,I bought Ark: Survival evolved for 60 dollars just as it's peaking out of early access and now i have to buy Ark 2 or be left behind?
9166,"epic, you will lose control"
9167,good game
9168,I still like Ark. Not with big groups! It's pvp is crap in my opinion. But alone or with some friends it is still a lot of fun
9169,yes
9170,great game love it so much fun great to play with friends
9171,so god dam good
9172,"Got this game for free during a sale, and i have to say, it really hasn't dissapointed me, at all... 
It's an amazing game with a great progression system, and if that's not enough, there's heaps of free mods, dlc's, maps and more.

There's also hundred's of free multiplayer servers hosted by the dev's.
Allowing you to hunt, fight, build, destroy, or collaborate with hundreds of players.

Highly recommend, worth every cent.
If for some reason i wasn't able to get it for free, i would have most likely bought it later on."
9173,DINOS :)
9174,This game is one of the best games ever
9175,"I am a 56 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
9176,awesome game
9177,fun

9197,the trex said he would touch me in my sleep. What do I do
9198,"Buggy.  Typically for me, it crashes about five times during startup.  Usually once it makes it through startup, it goes for several hours without crashing.  But yesterday, it crashed over a dozen times in a row during startup.  Enough.  I've had it.

Incredibly grindy and unforgiving.  It takes forever to gather the resources you need to do anything.  VERY high learning curve.  Make the slightest mistake, and you die a horrible quick death, losing all the gear you painfully collected.  For a brief time you can return  to your death and recover your items, but if the dinosaur(s) that killed you are still around, forget it.  Basically impossible to play without researching everything on the WIKI.  (What does it take to tame this dinosaur?  etc. ad nauseum) 

The building mechanics are terribly quirky, making it very hard to do what you want.  You only have about 30 seconds to change your mind if you placed something wrong.  After that, fixing things means flushing your hard earned resources down the toilet.""Creative mode"" lets you get building materials for free, but that seems like cheating.  There is something wrong with a building system when the only workable approach is to bypass its requirements entirely.  The Structures Plus mod was supposed to fix that by allowing you to pick up things even after the 30 second countdown (among a lot of other improvements to ARKS's silly build system), but crazily they decided to de-implement that!!!  What are they thinking?  Is ARK's weird design philosophy catching?  I was trying to switch to the Super Structures mod (which is basically a fork off the Structures Plus mod before they disabled late pick up), but that's when I ran into ARK crashing over a dozen times during startup.  All but about three of those were before even getting to the part where I tell it to load my Island in single user mode with that mod selected.

There is great potential here.  Sad.  Their focus is now on ARK 2, so don't expect them to ever bother fixing the bugs.  Instead they will generate a whole new set of bugs to never bother fixing.  I got this free, presumably as a promotion to get you hooked into buying ARK 2 when it is ready.  Fat chance I'll waste my money on a developer with such a buggy product with such needlessly difficult mechanics.  (They do have an impressive set of sliders and check boxes to let you modify the difficulty, but I don't get the chance to experiment with them when it crashes on startup so often.)"
9199,Awesome game great graphics and much more. Mods in workshop are over the next level and i very well say that this game is worth it 5 stars
9200,Love this game
9201,"This game has been near, and dear to my heart ever since its alpha release. Though its a bit buggy, and getting raided gives me literal aneurysms, I love it."
9202,good
9203,dino's go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
9204,wda
9205,"Even though I got this game for free, it cost too much."
9206,"I have played this game on xbox when it first came out, some of the updates I don't agree with but I like it overrall. This game might take dedication and time but the pay off is worth it. You get to use some of the common animals in the world, expand, and soon tame things of your interest like a gigantosaurus or a megatherium for the boss fight. This game might be filled with toxic or cheaters but don't let it get in the way of ultimate fun!
"
9207,Ate my own faeces cuz am hungry and died :(
9208,Game go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
9209,"Plan on dying.  ALOT.  However once you learn the ropes it is one of the best games out there for multiplayer PVP and PVE.  If PVE is too toxic (it can be) switch to PVE and chat ...people will be friendly and happy to help you out.  Don;t waste time on single player unless it is to practice something you learned on a youtube video. (to succeed in this game you will also be watching A LOT of youtube vids)

You'll waste a substantial portion of your life on this game....don't say I didn't warn you."
9210,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 13 now.

9245,i mean great game and all but trying to tame a argy gave me stage 4 testicular cancer ;(((((((((
9246,"third favorite game, played on xbox for much time with average 15 fps and constant 5 minute+ lag spikes and still thought it was great.

I havent even touched multiplayer yet."
9247,nice game
9248,"this game doesnt feel complete yet lol. The main menu ui almost gave me an aneurysm and the servers page was aids. I could be in the beginner zone trying to build a base and a level 55 dinosaur kills me in one hit.....To me it feels like if they powered down the dinosaurs in the beginner areas I'd have more fun because that was my main gripe, other than that the game was ok. Also the fact that the ""good"" maps are dlc says a lot about this game. Also its not worth 129 gb of space, only get when free.

Ha ha Ark survival evolved? more like ark survival extinct lol roasted

9267,"Overhyped! I got this product during the free period and it felt like a slap in the face. The render distance is laughable and the game just feels like lower quality rust with dinosaurs. (Not to mention the ungodly amount of glitches/bugs/missing optimizations.) Dinosaur system is alright but after you do it for a bit the game becomes grating and doesn't feel like you're grinding for much. It isn't horrible, and while there are indeed neat aspects of the game I couldn't recommend ever spending money on this game or even getting it for free."

9269,Nice game
9270,good

Crafted a couple of things, died repeatedly, and got tired. People actually pay for this shit? Take this thing off my account before I jump off a bridge."

9300,"I love ark. and parents, this game is NOT gory or inappropriate at all!!! the only real concern about your children or yourself is the actual players itself, the community isn't the most appropriate and kind to players that are young, new, old, or just any play someone is found upon is going to be harassed very quickly. But do not fear, because there is an option to mute others in settings! I cannot remember it at the moment, but if this happens to you or you wanna be safe in advanced, take a look in settings with your parent or any guardian you have and ask them for help on some settings you don't know the meaning of. And if it unknown in your house, you can simply ask someone online with no life like me and ask them for some help."

----- Comments -----
there were plenty of moments of fun, most unfortunetly I had to play in a custom server to play with a community due to the toxic nature of people. Things never went how u expected and just because ur base was made secure doesnt mean a wild creature wont still slip in. Great with friends, otherwise this will be a very slow game."
9370,As a survival game this game easily can take away hours of your time and rarely gets boring
9371,"Ark... a game where you wake up on a beach just to die immediately to some stray raptor from the trees behind. This will then proceed to happen 10 times over until you finally manage to get away while it's eating your old corpse.

Many would think that's frustrating and annoying but to be honest, I love it. The difficulty you have at the beginning of this game just adds to the reward and sense of achievement when you finally get through something.

Taming dinosaurs, renaming them and growing your small army is just such a fantastic feeling."
9372,awesome game very addicting
9373,"gooddd
"
9374,"Its pretty good but Its not really my kind of game.
If you like realistic survival games, then you should give it a try tho."
9375,"Pretty crafty, pretty dinosaury... I like this!"
9376,Hold alot of memories in ths game and i thank wildcard for the crazy journey !!! played the game wayback in the day so im glad they made the game free!!!
9377,amazing game the graphics are fanatical
9378,So far i am enyoing this game
9379,It's more like an addiction than anything. Am I going to keep playing? Yes. Is it horribly optimized and buggy as all fuck? Also yes.
9380,Grindosaurus Rex.
9381,dinosaurs there
9382,"In a word, tedious.

I get that some people like dying and having to collect stuff to make clothes and weapons to survive while they get their stuff, over and over and over. But around the time I found myself making my 100th stone axe I decided there are more interesting games out there. If you're a masochist this game is for you.

Edit: This became quite a fun game after I learned how to bypass the lack of save functionality by copying the world files."
9383,Very good
9384,"Like to kill Dinos, Don''t Like Dinos that kills me."
9385,good
9386," A lot of fun to play with a large group of friends with potential pvp etc , also playing solo is also a lot of fun for me for put in the grind to get better to finish the story etc . With modded it is a new experience and a give a immersive playtime to enjoy yourselfs"
9387,"GAANDU GAME BAHUT LAG HOTI 
"
9388,if you like having suicidal thoughts then ark is the game for you
9389,"The game has a good concept and has much potential. But if you play it for just 5 five minutes, you already find more bugs, than in all other games together. If it was a new game, I would be totally fine. But it's out for nearly five years now. The developers add more and more mostly unnecessary content, instead of fixing their game to make it enjoyable. But the reality is, that it's nearly unplayable for someone who has already played any good games. Moreover the gamefiles are so big, that I had to install it on a seperate harddrive. I would not recommend to buy it, unless you like to play flatout 3. If you get it for free, convince yourself and play the game after installing it for 2 hours."

9414,"Minecrafted Dark Souls, good."
9415,its aight
9416,"ARK started out as a game that showed promise, despite the bugs and performance issues. Dinosaurs and guns? Count me in!
However, as time went on, it became apparent that the developers (or maybe investors) didn't care to take input from the community regarding the future of ARK.
The game used to be a fairly simple, easy to learn survival game, with dinosaurs and basic weaponry. Then next thing we knew, there are fantasy creatures, paywall animals, and dinosaurs that shoot lasers. So many ridiculous features now exist in ARK that blindsided us.

After 4 years of giving ARK a break, I decided to give it a go, and see if anything's improved. I'd say that it's only gotten worse. I was overwhelmed with the sheer amount of creatures with unpredictable behaviors that infest the map. I finally managed to escape the chaos of the island on a neat raft boat I built. However, even when I thought I was safe, some gargantuan fish came out of nowhere and destroyed [b]HOURS[/b] of work and frustration. The final straw that broke the camel's back was seeing that the developers (or maybe their investors) have now decided to bring politics to Steam. [b][u]I play games to escape politics and other nonsense.[/u][/b]

In summary, if you enjoy playing games that introduce an unhealthy amount of stress and require a vast amount of your time for the grind, then ARK is for you, otherwise, I [u]DO NOT[/u] recommend ARK.

Oh yeah... if you do end of getting ARK, expect to lose 150+ Gigabytes of space if you plan on using any of the DLC. The developers didn't bother with file compression."
9417,"I love this game 
It's amazing and I love dinosaurs
Very good for time spending with friends"

9428,"This is my favorite game of all time. I initially played the game on console and fell in love with it so when I bought a PC I immediately bought it. However, even though it is my favorite game and would play it whenever, the game is FULL of bugs that make it almost impossible to sit down and play for an extended period of time. Sometimes the bugs are so bad you can't even make it into a game..."

9439,"I can only recommend this game to those who are a bit of a masochist .  There will be days when it will work beautifully and you will love it....There will be others where you will get so fed up with crashing, bad updates, broken physics, and the endless amount of verifying 430GB worth of game that you'd rather slam your **** in a cupboard door."

9441,"Sure buddy let's all just pretend you aren't gonna play this after seeing the trailer. Honestly, it exists in a somewhat awkward space where PvE servers are bloated and stultified and PvP servers have level 3000 gryphons from other servers that will bend you over and blow your back out. It's a very, very fun game, but I don't think I ever have or ever will play it for more than two months consecutively. That seems to be the timeline of either boredom (PvE) or disaster (PvP).

[spoiler]this game is a crash course in militant buddhism. you will find detachment from your material possessions when they come for them in the night.[/spoiler]"
9442,It has Dinosaurs.

9448,"I highly recommended playing this game, BUT a warning for people who has crappy computers or laptop, it won't really, run for you guys or just lag a lot and its can cook you'r GPU or you'r PC because how much it consume it. But if i was you, i would buy this game and play it, i already have 150 hrs on it and i am finally able to play it completely now because i got a lot better PC for this. So buy it and enjoy yourself!! i know i am."

9455,honestly this game is poor
9456,"Well the graphics are absolutely terrible if you want to run it on a bigger scale than the silly default windowed crap it opens up in.  I put all graphics on ""epic"" and i emphasize the quotes.   Garbage.  i can't even look at this game without vomiting in my mouth a little bit.   Wish I could get my money back, but yep, they got me.  fooled me into thinking this was a modern game with modern graphics.  Psh!  yeah if you want to run it on a tiny laptop.     Good grief.   I feel like I've been had."

9470,"If you want my opinion on some of the dlcs scroll to the bottom of this review

Overview-
Ark is a sandbox-survival game, a game where the world wants to kill you but you have the freedom to make your own choices and do what you want. With a wide array of game mechanics, maps, and creatures, you have an insane amount of things that you can do and obstacles you can overcome.

Graphics-
The graphics are really good and help you feel immersed into the world. Not much else to say here.

Gameplay- 
The gameplay in Ark can simultaneously be the most engaging and most boring part of the game. On one hand, Ark can get very grindy and boring(especially without the right tools) and can take hours of your time for a project. On the other hand, the gameplay can get very engaging when hunting down creatures to tame or kill, or getting hunted by creatures. Most of the time, your gameplay will be in a middle ground when doing things such as exploring, building, or crafting. Earlygame is generally much more fast paced with danger lurking around every corner, and as you progress the gameplay slows down and gives you more control.

Audio-
The audio in Ark is my favorite part about it, with many ambient noises and soundtracks that play during events or combat. The Ark soundtracks capture the feel of each place you go, and generally stick to a theme in each map. The noises help make the maps feel alive, and most also indicate certain events going on around you

Other things-
-Singleplayer is customizable; play on a pace you like
-Play with friends on official and private servers
-Official pvp servers are basically anarchy and should be avoided (offline raid protection is an exception)
-Bosses that give you an endgame to work towards
-Lore that tells a story about the arks through notes
-Plenty of events that boost rates and add small fun features

DLCs- What I recommend
Scorched Earth- If you like challenges get this one
Aberration- A beautiful but deadly map. I recommend for anybody but be prepared to die.
Extinction- I Recommend for PVE enthusiasts
Genesis- A faster more action filled map. If you get bored of grinding normally this is the map for you
Ragnarok- The island but better. Get it if you have the space"

9482,"This game is one of the most enjoyable games I've played so far. My dad bought me it as a gift so both of us could play together and I've had a blast. My favorite part of the game overall has to be the dinosaurs and building. While the building does get annoying I've always enjoyed running around with my dinosaurs. I wish we had more interactions available for tamed dinos like petting, or even them interacting with other tamed dinos. But with how tricky things like that can be to code I'm fine with them being left out. Overall the game does have a few minor annoyances but nothing that will make you no longer want to play the game. Very excited for Ark 2!"
9483,"Can't join friend's server, but I guess Vin Diesel should distract me from the terribly handled game"

9518,"literally not deciding to fix any bugs AND releasing ark 2 already. i know that when ark 2 comes out its not gonna be worth it due to the bugs we already have. hitting something and no damage, mach 2 players, it's all horrible. i've played this game for over a month worth of time on xbox and the bugs i used to see back then still exist. fix ur game wildcard. only good with mods."
9519,dinosaurs

9524,I just love this game. Aspecially with mods
9525,"is gud, many dinosauer, yees"
9526,dinosaur i lick
9527,"The only game where you're expected to grind resources endlessly and inbreed your dinosaurs a ridiculous amount of times only to lose them to the easiest version of the bosses, then do it again. 

Seriously. I've only spent about 5 hours actually playing. The rest has been afk'ing waiting for my rex mutations. 
Super fun to play with friends, but this game is super grindy so if it's not your thing dont bother. It's super easy to get stuck in the ""mid-game"" phase because you either dont have strong enough dinos, don't have enough resources to craft certain items, or you don't know where to go next. The game doesn't tell you where to go or how to do anything, so don't be ashamed to look up a guide on how to progress or how to breed dinos. 

Lastly, I only recommend playing on official (default) settings if you're on a server because the timers for breeding, imprinting, baby growth, etc keep going once you log out and in some cases it can take a week to accomplish certain tasks. Look up good singleplayer settings or decent rates for smaller tribes if you play a private server. Don't be afraid to adjust the settings to your liking. If you dont have a ton of time to play, consider faster breeding, gather, and taming rates."

9572,"Just an absolute blast of a title to play. From the base building to player advancement to environmental interactions, it's all done exceptionally well. There are a plethora of settings and adjustments you can make before launching a game or a server so that no playthrough is ever the same. The ability to transfer characters from map to map is also a nice touch, although I don't use it much because I enjoy the move from 1 to 105...which is really quite short and grind free. A lot of jump scares, and ""Oh S*@#"" moments....at least until you get your pump action shotgun...then all bets are off."
9573,Best ope world survival game

i like how u can have your own animals to ride and fight with against other animals or players on your server or lan"
9612,"I want to recommend this game but the developers recently engaged in politics that has no tie to this game, it may have only been a community manager that engaged in this activity but its studio wildcards job to correct this person/mistake and none has been corrected so far. therefore I will not support this game any further."
9613,This game is awesome definatly worth grind an time. But its shitty on servers bc servers are usually toxic to new players even if they are good

9624,The game is very fun with it's own storyline. It have lots of creatures from prehistoric times! I taught me a lot about dinosaurs maybe it can teach you too! :)

9636,"So ill try to keep this as short as possible as I don't want to waste anybody's time... I am a 49 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories. P.S. He loves the dinosaurs haha

9640,a
9641,it fun
9642,"I can see why this game was so cheap. It's just honestly not a very good game. Even after you adjust difficulty, it does nothing for the poor quality of clipping, and the fact that dinosaurs can jump on everything better than you the player can. As soon as you start doing well, the game will throw you a giant dinosaur that will come in and kill everything and destroy everything forcing you to restart time and time again. That says nothing for the fact that connecting to a non-dedicated server is extremely difficult. My wife and I spent a few hours playing just fine together, but then out of no where she could no longer connect to the server so we couldn't play together. I am of the philosophy of ""I've spent $11 on dumber shit"" but for this, save your money. Spend it somewhere else.

EDIT: I do believe that Ark deserves for me to say this at least. I -want- to love this game."

9664,"Although since playing from 2016 on the xbox one. This game has gone a long way of improvement to this day in 2022. Servers are way more stable at pings over 75ms. Graphically it was not that great but holds on to be on console over 60fps. Now on pc I appreciate the low demanding graphics where any card can run 1080p 60fps without a problem  with gpu's since the 2017+. 

Huge improvements in dedicated servers- They have become more as non dedicated with multi harvest, tame, way easier to gain xp.  

The biggest thing I hate about this game is hitting npcs with melee causes them to flinch backwards, never got fixed. This is why range weapons are favored.

Edit: I only play pve, pvp is a looped on a never ending rebuild simulator."
9665,"I really loev this game, espically for young aspiring programmers, this game allows you to venture into programming, while equipping you with some basics skills you might need as you develop you're own mods eventually and edit batch files of the game"
9666,"Good game, ok as single player, very fun with friends"
9667,goog
9668,is fun with mods and without :D
9669,"Awesome concept. Awful execution. Still very addictive, lots of content. Wouldn't recommend playing on laptop or any PC under 1500 bucks because optimization sucks"
9670,hi :)
9671,hehe dino go grawrr
9672,"Dinosour
"
9673,"guns are fun, best weapon."
9674,"Ark is a game that is both amazing and terrible at times but ultimately I believe it's a game worth trying because there is no game like it out there. The game is rich in content, the world and most of the lore are riveting, the dinosaurs are interesting and fascinating and some maps are downright aesthetically breathtaking. The sense of wonder, adventure and the challenge in the early stages of the game are fantastic in my opinion. The game however, has serious and frustrating flaws like its quadrillions of bugs and glitches, terrible and unbalanced multiplayer experience on official servers and performance issues that frankly feel more like a feature than a flaw at this point. I recommend playing this game non-competitively (PvE), with friends and on boosted, modded unofficial servers unless you're willing to devote your life to this game as the grinding and the ease of dying and losing all your stuff can be deal-breakers. Overall though, it's a game that you should give a try and if you love dinosaurs and survival games, perhaps a must-try."
9675,"The best game ive ever played
"
9676,ARK. The best and worst heartbreak youll ever have. Imagine staying up for weeks straight and having your blood sweat and tears offline wiped by some kid. Ark will push you and your friends to the limits while allowing you to tame some dank animals and dinos. 1000/10.
9677,It's full of toxic griefers and idiots and butt lords and toxic warlords so would totally not recomend for noobs
9678,Ark is Ark But Ark Is Good

9685,"Absolutely ""Cracked"" it makes me want to skin dinos and eat them. Gave me a concussion"
9686,Awesome game
9687,"I'm posting this as a negative review not because I think its a bad game, but because I consider it a game not for everyone.  This game is extremely hardcore and reveals how masochistic you have to be to even get past the 4 hour mark.  Each map is HUGE.  And to fill it up there are creatures that are out to kill you in every way possible.  When you died, should you chose to respawn, you lose everything on your person and have to find your corpse to retrieve them.  Every step you make, you will be getting pushed back even harder.  Have shit luck, well sorry man, hope that Alpha that just spawned next to you has a great meal.
All together this game is an experiance.  It will both infuriate you and humble you.  Take breaks least your blood pressure shoots up."

9689,not sea of thieves
9690,I LIKE THIS GAME
9691,"WHY THIS SHIT IS 120 GB WTF BRO I CAN GET BETTER GAME WITH LESS THAN 40 GB, I SHIT ON THIS GAME"
9692,gmc
9693,"This game has been always enjoyable for me. I enjoy the extra building mods, rp mods for decore and even building on bathrooms and kitchens. I enjoy the spure of excitement I get when Raptors or random enemies show up and I have to fight to the death like battles, Taming random species and gardening. The only fallback is how much GB it takes and it can be rather slow/lag alot."
9694,gg
9695,"All is well in single player but for folks like myself that know nothing about working with code, it is not a good game to play with friends. Despite all the online tutorials present for server set up and use, my lack of coding background disables me from understanding them properly and from having the ability to fill in the gaps where the directions do not suffice for someone like myself, in my limited knowledge. 

Depending on others for such things is also not in my scope. 

Being unable to play with my friends detracts from the amazing graphics and the neat survival system otherwise. What few games I play, are played with others. If you are tech savvy or fine with single player, this game will be good for you. 

"
9696,good

9704,its fun has lots to do and is very expansive when using mods
9705,Didn't play enough to be able to tell :/
9706,18+ only
9707,"Ark has its fair share of bugs and glitches, and an abundance of stability problems, but beyond the rust and wear of the game sits a real pearl to enjoy and indeed a deep story and lore if you care to search out all the notes and pieces scattered about in the wilds. 

The game certainly does not hold your hand, you learn as you go while you try to survive the bitter harshness of the cruel and unforgiving environments that deteriorate your health, stamina, hunger, and thirst, amdist the dangers of real predators around every corner. Weather you play it hard core on an official server and spend the next four weeks hatching an egg, guarding, raising, and growing your new dino, or an unofficial server modded for ease of enjoyment and fun among like minded friends, Ark has something for just about everyone. Do you enjoy gathering and building? Ark has that too, not a fan of fighting and slogging through the harsh wilds? Build, craft, and help your team by staying at base and making sure the process of creation and crafting continues moving so your tribe always has an edge to fall back on.

Suspect you'll be raided on an PvP server? Find a secret place to build a back up base with materials, dinos, and more to defend your namesakes and keepsakes! With Ark 2 on the Horizon there is no better time than to learn what Ark is about by getting the game while it is still hot. Find those servers online, join up, make friends, and survive the Ark! Survive the simulation and learn the truth behind it all. You are the survivor!"
9708,"This game is not all that great if you are not PvPing. The interface is clunky, gameplay is mediocre. 4/10."

9710,The game is good i beat up a dino and then his buddies jumped me.
9711,"good

9712,"I would not recommend this game for people who actually have or want a social life. Everything takes way too long to do, and if you aren't constantly getting on to check on things then it all will decay and you lose everything. If you love dinosaurs and you have no life (and lots of patience!) this game might be for you."

ALL SAME! and no only me, every others in game players have same issue.
That lag and delay respond in game just FKing waste time and get NO FUN AT ALL.

If u pay this , just like pay for a RUBBISH in your computer....

9748,"Spawn in all of the ""easy"" areas and get immediately killed by level 10+ dinosaurs who instantly agro me, great game"
9749,I really enjoy playing this game with my husband and oldest son. sometimes my sons friends even join us. We have a server  so we get to play and build. it is really a fantastic co-op!
9750,daddy
9751,bugged garbage
9752,"I am brand new at playing video games.  I am 62 an learning to be a gamer.  This has been a wonderful game for exploring, survival, taming an all the things you need to do to survive.  The graphics are beautiful.  I like that there are different maps you can go to.  I personally prefer Caballus an Scorched Earth.   We have had a lot of fun with working with each other an my grandson has taught me many things.  I play with me daughter in another state an my 8 year old grandson on a private server.   I really do give this game a great big thumbs up."

9762,Bad
9763,"Funny but lil ragy game :D
"
9764,so many dino that we can tame and mod that make the game more fun
9765,"its a good game but its really big and i mean REALLY big, there is a decent amount of content but they don't compress any of the files whatsoever so it requires 225 gigabytes with all the dlc, and on-top of the ridiculous download size you need a decent computer, and ON-TOP of all that, its very difficult to have ""fun"" in this game, requires lots of grinding, a youtuber named welyn cracked the code and has released like 3 ark videos or something, i would just watch those instead of buying the game because that is not what your experience would be like, but thats just my opinion and its still a good game, do whatever the fuck you want, im not stopping you."
9766,"Doesnt matter how much you might want to try it, after so long of early access it's still barerly playable. Gave three hours with friends to test it recently. None of Us like current state of it, and there is no longer hope for improvment. Servers are laggy (even at 40 ping monsters jump around), combat weird and kinda one of worst i've ever played. Hoped at least basebuilding will be more fun - it is not. Glad to test it on free weeked (06.2022), so no money wasted. Strongly not recommenting it."
9767,very good game
9768,"so I've played this game basically since it came out, if your looking for a multiplayer PVP experience this game is not it they ruined PVP since they made server transfers a thing, but if your looking to start a server and play with your firends in a private server the game is still really good and engaging to play."
9769,"this game is absolutely shit and will take ur life. 
recommend it :)"
9770,My favorite game I have over 1000 hours on the Xbox of this game but this version is way better 10/10 game (excluding all of arks wonderful glitches and bugs)
9771,69
9772,"Best played with a group but still tons of replay value solo, with something for every style of player."

9782,Best game of all time.
9783,"Survive the Elements! Die at every turn! This game is meh, seriously meh. Hard to get going, even at level 30 there is not much to do besides build a house and sit in it. You are always too hot or too cold, no matter what you wear. It's just too much grinding, not enough dino riding. Also, some maps are awful even if you spawn at an easy point. Getting killed when starting a new map is absolute fun, I cannot describe how fun it is...."

9812,"Very nice game survival is hard, things always want to kill you no matter what.
My best friend is a bird! There are many maps but i like best :
The island, Lost island, Ragnarok, Fjordur

It can take some time to go from a almost nude stranded man on the beach
to the ass kicking jungle warrior. The caves are fun and rewarding to explore.
But can also be very dangerous preparation is key.

In the end you will have a very loving family of dinos sadly i got them killed in the boss fight."

9833,"This game seems to think that scattered notes is the way to tell a storyline. Yeah, that's not going to cut it for me."
9834,"This game is an awesome game.  No clear plan no clear details on how to play or win anything for that matter but fun regardless.  There are tons of help with mods and youtube videos.  Playing on the ""official servers S*CK!""  *ssH*ts have littered the entire map with buildings and columns which prevent a new player from building a fire or any kind of shelter.  So start your own it's easier that way.  The one MAJOR complaint i have about this game is that they have started ark 2 and can't even fix the thousands and millions of glitches in ark 1.  The glitches are make the game intolerable to play.  I am soooooo glad I didn't pay for this game I would DEMAND my money back!!!!!"

9877,"Pretty fun survival game in single-player but really shines with friends. In my opinion, ARK can be a pretty grindy game but one thing I love is that this can be easily overcome by altering pretty much any stat in the game. One thing I never enjoyed though was the official and non-official public servers as they are very unfriendly to new players and can be pretty toxic in general, which is why I stuck to mostly just single-player and hosting a server for me and a few friends. But, overall I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fun open-world survival game as the dinosaur theme is very fun and with numerous DLC there is no shortage of new adventures, if you have the option please play with friends as to me this makes the game way more fun!"
9878,"fun!

9920,"Pros:
-Cool Dinos, which you can tame and ride
-Great multiplayer, if you're into that
-Graphics are good, if you can run it

Cons:
-Dinos take forever to tame. And it really sucks to spend hours taming a dinosaur only to have it die on the way back to bas for whatever reason.
-You're basically forced into multiplayer, if you want to have fun. A singleplayer world can be good, but you're missing out on half the fun that is the chaos of other people, and it gets old. Play alone on a multiplayer server, and people will constantly bully you whenever you try to achieve anything.
-Poorly optimized, last time I checked.

Generally, I find this game to be a streamer game. It's for people who have the time and wilingness to talk to strangers, make tribes, spend hours taming Dinosaurs, and have a great computer. This does not apply to most people, and so if you're in the category of most people, the game is very varied, but generally I find the lows a lot more frequent than the highs"

9947,Great game. Beautiful and fun!
9948,"Absolutely incredible game!  Opened my eyes to the survival genre!  The game is highly addictive - ""oh I just need to get some more hide."" The mod community is a definite plus but this game comes full of amazing features with just the base game.  I am seriously impressed and plan to keep playing until ARK 2 comes out!"
9949,"It's a very fun survival game but it is challenging, it's definitely better with friends"
9950,.
9951,good way to kill time....alot of time
9952,"While there have always been issues with the game, Ark is a good game. If you love dinos and survival/building then this is a game to ad to your collection. Lots of variable free maps to enjoy and the paid expansions are fun and challenging. Be prepared to wait for the download as this is a large undertaking, but your patience will be rewarded. If your start the game and are determined to play on your own with no outside help, the trial and error curve is steep. Get dinos, build your castle, and have fun. And steer clear of those stupid birds! lol"
9953,good for pve
9954,"Ark is an amazing game, that Wildcard has shown they got lucky with. What I mean by that is they are lucky, not good developers. They are lucky the good parts of the game are SOOO good, the non stop issues that have plagued this game since Beta players still over look 7 years later. I have played since day 1 across multiple platforms, 7,000+ hours. Wildcard has shown they are not only incompetent developers, but also lazy and insulting to their player base.


Ark 2 has been announced and from what I've seen and can tell from the community, most of the player base has lost all anticipation and excitement. From what they've released, they are going to a 3rd person only souls like melee combat, and mostly gutting anything that made Ark 1 the gem that it is. BUT let's not forget they are adding in Vin Diesel, which NO ONE WANTS OR CARES ABOUT. He's literally a horrible actor. This just further shows how Wildcard doesn't even understand what players enjoy about Ark and how lucky Wildcard got with this game. 

Official server review - how the game was made to be played

The Bad 
---------
Bugs linger for years - check
Meshing issues, for years - check
Losing characters and anything associated to those characters - check
Abusive official game GMs and poor customer support - check
Servers as stable as a unicyclist balancing plates on their head - check
Non region locked servers that get over ran by Eastern cheaters - check
Developers rely heavily on the modding community
PVP and PVE are not balanced independently, which causes issues for each
 
The Good
----------
Sandbox - you make your own fun / adventure
Awesome dino armies
Both first and third person
MMO - Community and player interaction (on official servers)
Basic yet solid combat
Offers both PVE and PVP

======================================================================

Unofficial servers 
-------------------
Strip away most of the bad list above, but you also lose a few of the good points.

The Bad 
---------
Bugs linger for years 
Meshing issues, for years
Losing characters and anything associated to those characters - you can at least not lose everything on unoffical with good admins or single player/local/etc
Abusive official game GMs and poor customer support - still possible depending on the server
You either have to rent a server, play single player, or have a spare PC to host a server
Hosting cluster servers can be expensive 
You are at the mercy of the server owner to pay their bill and can be turned off at any point
You lose the MMO aspect you get with official servers (why I ONLY play official)
 
The Good
----------
Sandbox - you make your own fun / adventure
Awesome dino armies
Both first and third person
MMO - Community and player interaction (on official servers) - sadly, this aspect of the game goes away
Basic yet solid combat
Offers both PVE and PVP
Customized rates and balancing to make it more life friendly
Mods - who doesn't love mods?! (A lot of these mods are what Tek SHOULD have been, not what they gave us that ruined the game)"
9955,Man wtf is this game i literally had to install cheats to survive
9956,"battleye keeps kicking me out of games
keeps saying the client isn't responding"
9957,Great game. Wish they'd fix the bugs that have been reported for years.
9958,good game
9959,"lots of fun, even better with friends. dinosaurs are both scary and awesome, add that with some fellow idiots and it makes for a 3 hour blast."
9960,its good
9961,this game is one of the if not the best game i have ever played. Recommend it to everyone who likes a grind/adventure game.
9962,kinda ass when i get raped by 3 gigas at the same time.
9963,to get good u need to know what to do when you start
9964,yesggs
9965,W
9966,fun lots of things you cando
9967,Such a nice game
9968,rawr
9969,where horror tag for this game
9970,yes
9971,"Great concepts horrible implementation. ARK feels untested, unrefined, and unpolished despite the overwhelming amount of content. The diversity of creatures and beautiful maps make this game seem complete but don't be fooled.

This game has been out for years and the amount of game breaking bugs is astronomical and actual game mechanics are clunky at best. 

The list of issues I've had trying to play this game is extensive and I don't think I've ever complained about a game so much while playing so I'll stick to what I believe are the biggest issues.

1. Collisions:  What can't you get stuck on and glitch into? I'm constantly getting stuck between dinos, rocks, trees, and sometimes there's nothing you can do but let yourself die (or cheat) because I can't move while standing on a solid surface? Not to mention how when you walk among the dinos you have tamed that their animations can move you around and block your path. 
These collision mechanics are so poorly done that the smallest dinosaur can completely stop all momentum from the biggest dinos in the game but hey let's add cold snaps and heat waves because we want to be realistic... ???

Next, when I play a game I want to be able to play the game. Filling my time with boring chores like transferring and sorting inventory is absurdly lazy development. Small area linked inventories is a very easy fix for this and helps qol and just makes sense. Moving one stack of heavy resources at a time (like metal) from my dino to the chest right next to it is ludicrous. 
The heat waves and coldsnaps fall into this category for me as well because they keep me from playing the game. I understand they were added to increase difficulty but me leaving my character afk in my base so I don't drop dead is not that hard but is very boring. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about night time as there is no way to skip it without cheating (like most other survival games) and it's so dark early game that you're better off AFK in your base until the sun comes up even though you don't really have enough to fill your nights.
I understand trying to implement realism in a game but I also want to play the game and a lot of things in ""reality"" don't make for a fun game in my opinion. I'd love to see devs be a little more creative in how they extend game length and difficulty instead of the chores that just waste time and make the game grindy. 

As far as bugs, I don't even know where to start. Things disappear and reappear in my inventory with regular frequency, Dino's blink in and out of existence, sometimes my character will drop through the world, you will tell a Dino to stop moving and it will still walk to wherever it pleases before stopping, UE4-ShooterGame bug, etc.

I really want to like this game but it's definitely not worth buying and especially not at full price. Wait for ARK 2 to see if the game actually has some polish on it so you don't rip your hair out just trying to get basic mechanics working."
9972,"Ark doesn't care about your system specs really... Game will run poorly, and you'll like it. 

Aside from that reoccurring complaint, game fun."
9973,guod fun game
9974,"Its a very fun game, i do warn thk that it is is frustrating in the begining!"
9975,i went on a killing spree
9976,"THE BEST OF THE GAMES

9977,Riding Dinos is fun ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
9978,This Game is Good
9979,"if you're looking to kill time, 4 hours will go by in a blink"
9980,"This is a game that I recommand playing with some friends.
This game is an open world survival game with dino's and prehistoric animals.
I love the base game, but with the huge amount of mods makes it even better.
While you level up you can unlock certain skills to make items with that help you survive in this world.
Try to tame some dino's or prehistoric animals to make your life eassier.
Try to survive the harsh world where you (and your friends) try to become the top of the foodchain.

only downside is that there are no npc's in the game that could rival you.But for that you have mods."
9981,"Dino didnt like me, I died."
9982,Ark evolved is so great. The stat system and the large amount of ways you can play the game overall makes the experience worth it. Don't shit you're self In my damn house though
9983,Good
9984,E
9985,rawr
9986,"Although I enjoy this game, as evidenced by my playtime, I don't recommend purchasing it. The developers refuse to keep their noses out of politics. Additionally, with the DLC it takes 200+ GB of storage to install."
9987,.
9988,quite fun
9989,i love the game and the only thing that holds me back from getting everything bought is that my PC can't handle it
9990,game doesnt let me connect to friends
9991,Really Good Game.
9992,ye
9993,this game is amazingly fun and challenging if anyone is looking for a fun and challenging game i recommend this game.

10005,"It ate my disk space with this new update. I was enjoying it beforehand and could have it alongside my other games just fine, and now, I can't even have it on my computer. I have to ask, if places like scorched earth are separate, why is it mandatory that I have to download that too? At the very least, I'd like to just play the island without the other files being installed. I feel like I wasted my money to only be able to experience it for a couple days."
10006,dino cool and epic
10007,g
10008,Great game I sent like first hour punching all the dinos figuring out which ones would let me beat them to death

10013,I love the poop sound
10014,game fun hehe
10015,
10016,"Very fun, but quite buggy."
10017,I love losing all my items whilst also being chased by the biggest creature and the most powerful creature in the entire game while I get all my armour destroyed.
10018,Amazing game if they just fix some bugs
10019,"The game has bug, graphical glitches and a bunch of other issues, but I love dinosaurs :)"
10020,"Played since early alpha. Game has come a long way. Still some corkie things that can happen, but I have never enjoyed another survival craft game as much as this. There is just so much to do in this game"
10021,bueno
10022,there's dino's that throw shit at you
10023,"Fun game, many aspects, creative, lots of potential, customize and make your own gameplay, a bit buggy and laggy as well as hard if your a beginner."
10024,fun game but not for those apposed to grinding
10025,yes
10026,xdejut
10027,"Garanteed fun, especially if you play with a group of friends!
A whole bunch of dinosaurus to discover and capture, lots crafting and exploration.
The beginning can be harsh, cause wild carnivorous dinos can easily kill you, but little by little you can craft fortifications, secure an area and then expand, giving you a great feeling of progress and improvement."
10028,Better with friends.
10029,"I used to play Ark on my Xbox a few years ago. I decided to download it on pc and play it again for nostalgia. I can say Ark is the same amazing, fun, entertaining game i have ever played."
10030,it crashes every fucking time
10031,Ham burger
10032,cant join friends 90% of the time
10033,Great game all around. It has amazing resource gathering systems and so many dinosaurs it will take you many hours if you want to find them all. Haven't got the expansions but I will say the base games is worth at least trying.
10034,Best game I have ever played
10035,"Good game
"
10036,make a dodo army
10037,"Wonderful idea but poorly optimized. I've played almost a thousand hours over several years and I noticed no descent optimizations. Developer kept creating new things without fixing problems to have good foundations. It is extremely frustrating.
Hopefully ARK 2 will be better. Just skip ARK 1 if you have not bought it."
10038,"shit game 
"
10039,terrible game
10040,"i think its a amazing game, i love everything about it. don't get me wrong it has its bad parts like hit marker areas or glitching on to a dino where the body box of you and dino cross pass. but bar that which is minor in a massive game like this, its great. loads to do lots to explore. you have the joys of playing pvp or at your own pace in pve"
10041,wfwfwfw
10042,"dinosaur
"
10043,qdsa
10044,FDD
10045,"Ark is by far one of the best games i have ever played but there is a lot of existing issues.Ark has a terrible slow download and i am not talking about your home internet connection.Ark takes 4 or more ours downloading fully no matter your internet speed.Ark also takes up to an hour just to verify,at some point it told me it was going to take 999 years.
The game reaches 400 gig in total of storage space with all DLC installed leaving the base game at 125.I have realized that the new maps range from 40 to 60 gig where the old one's are 6 to 12 gigabytes.Which means the maps should be much larger, and they are not they are smaller and take up to almost 4 time's more storage(bad optimization).Hosting or joining servers are ridiculous it take's forever, sometime's it is because of mods but you will have to have over 10 and it disconnects you frequently causing you to restart the game or click the join multiple times.Ark 2 is releasing and i am very excited but i really hope they fix these issue's."
10046,ALL
10047,"Way too glitvhy
"
10048,"Although it is a little buggy, it's still a very good game. We play it nonstop since we've got it. The bugs are something that can be easily overlooked unless it's something you worked hard on. For example, we had four raptors and three tribesmen all go up against an alpha carnitor and every single one of us died. That was rough, but we still play."
10049,Still game is boring I don't recomend this game
10050,good game
10051,"I got dehydrated and started dying so I went to get water
Then I got chased into the water by a raptor that could somehow swim and got killed
This game sucks everything kills you even doing things to stay alive can kill you 0/10 game is racist and made by Nazis"
10052,pee pee poopoo ha ha!
10053,it is a good game
10054,too grindy
10055,Great game on PC
10056,"good....... But Scary

10078,"Unfortunately, due to mixed reviews from friends and other trusted sources and my own dislike of MMOs, I’ve never actually personally played ARK. I’ve watched some (older) LPs but I’m afraid not enough to give a review on anything but the graphics.

I can say I think that the game is gorgeous. It very much caters to my preferred Aesthetic style. What gameplay I’ve seen does not look to be my cup of tea however, but without playing it myself I can’t say if it’s actually fun or not beyond “it doesn’t look like a thing I would personally enjoy”.

I hope you’re able to find someone who has actually played it."

It's not clear what you should do first, playing multiplayer if you log out your body become a vulnerable target, no night time skip, etc. Essentially either you have 12 hours a day to enjoy this game or 2 hours a day and have miserable time."
10113,I want to kill myself every second I play this game.I am so bad and die on easy every 2.5 seconds.I have spent way too much time grinding and I am sick of it
10114,"Honestly on my main, I have over 4 thousand hours and regret none of it. But if a new player is trying to get in, now is not the time because devs are still focused on keeping the game fun but they are devoting a lot of attention into getting ark 2 coming in 2023"

10149,"Ark is the kind of game you were excited to get as a kid. You load it up on your 2GB RAM computer and 50GB and launched it with no understanding on how much trouble your in, and how in a few seconds loving computer you grew up with was working and the next few minutes was un-repairable because of the explosion of launching a Island map.
All worth it in the end because this game has allowed me to mess around with friends and allows me to have a better experience playing and messing around than other games sand box and PvP / PvE games.

8.5 / 10 because it broke my old PC."

10187,very fun
10188,"if you like survival games this has to be the hardest I've played, also the most fun. you WILL die. a lot. Take that number your thinking, and multiply it by infinity. the best way to enjoy this game is to team up with some friends and rent your own server and adopt the YouTuber Syntac's settings. (i like to call them i work for a living settings.) it will still take almost forever to beat this game. but you will have a ton of fun on the way there.

To be honest, i mostly play this game on the PS4, but the PC version brings so much more to the table with the modding community. I am constantly amazed by all the hard work and amazing dedication of this community; especially with creating patch mods for features long time players have been begging for."

10201,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Ukrainian men French kissing canines on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

10211,"Why recommend ARK? Because it's one of a kind. Like many games, it has bugs. However the bugs are outweighed by the gameplay.
It is badly optimized, but not unplayable. I can run this on a rig as bad as a 1 GB dedicated GPU, and FX-6300 (a CPU from 2013).
A short summary of the game: you are stranded on an unknown place, without knowing anything of your origin. You find a glowing crystal lodged into your left wrist that allows you to store and craft. The wildlife is filled with dinosaurs to your surprise, so you must gather resources in order to protect yourself/yourselves, and maybe even tame said wildlife.
It's up to you to decide who is your enemy, and who isn't.
With that being said, ARK II will release soon, and many veterans and new players who just got a taste of ARK excitedly wait for it - myself included. It will run better, and hopefully have even more majestic creatures and environments.

10212,"Don't buy this garbage, ARK 2 or Anything from Studio Wildcard...theyre just a bunch of commie leftists with that disease known as Liberalism.  It's a Cancer on Humanity and it's spread into every aspect of their games and company.  Avoid it like a leftist with genital herpes."

10221,
10222,The Original cost of the game would be worth it for how much playtime there is in this game. you can spend weeks playing this game and create endless things. definetly reccommend
10223,"This game has so much potential for exploration with mods, it is a highly advanced game for its time with real is physics and mechanics. It will take time to start getting to the fun things but it is well worth the money."

10235,This game is soooo much fun from building to getting jump scared to joining into a tribe and socializing this game has it.  Sure its glitchy at times and certain aspects arent fully worked out but I have loved this game since beta.  Whether you want to play in first person or third you can choose.  Dont get me wrong the game is unforgiving but so rewarding.  Make sure youre well prepared before venturing off and exploring.
10236,"good game but a lot of bugs
"
10237,the best game ever
10238,"The game is great, I like to play on single player because it let's you take your time, pvp is fun but public severs aren't the best for pvp."
10239,"I spawned in, got spawn camped on the beach by a deformed black guy running at mach 6, disconnected."
10240,they need to add new things its the same old stuff all the time
10241,"Awesome game, worth a look at the very least I'm sure you will be happy you did."
10242,"Literally one of the worst games in the history. 
Poorly optimized, unnecessarily big which similar games look better and take 30 Gigabytes of space instead of bloody 160!!! But I wouldn't have posted this review if the game could actually allow me to join my friends lobbies. What is the purpose of 160 gigabytes of a game if it doesn't even work?!"
10243,Good game
10244,T
10245,"Its a very fun game even when playing solo, but with friends its much more fun i recommend it to everyone."
10246,"VERY GOOD GAME

But in all seriousness this game is fantastic, with so many creatures and details I never knew about. This is a dinosaur lover's dream come true. Sure this game requires a lot of grind but its very worth it. And there is so many maps! Although in my opinion get this game when its on sale, because it's a really good deal, plus I know you can wait! Please get this game whoever's reading this!"
10247,"Great game for all the players who love to be force fed POLITICS especially about abortion because we love murder :D I feel real proud of all the hours I've spent on this game :D Who needs to, idk, know about dinos when we can get lectured about Wildcard sama's baby killing fetish. Definitely worth buying so we can fund more :D 

Sincerely, a player who apparently needs to hear your murder propaganda! :D Have fun with your future sales lol xoxo"
10248,SOOooo....... FUNNnnn.....

10261,very epik
10262,it's sick
10263,"This really is a fun yet annoying game but that's what makes it a unique experience and extremely fun to play! I would definitely get this game, because even though I received it for free, I have bought it on my Xbox and while I would recommend the PC version as it allows for the installation of mods, it is still an amazing experience that not many games of this genre can offer! I would also like to point out that this game (while still extremely fun in single player because of things like dodos and glitches) is much more fun if you play with friends! 

Note- Even though the game is rated PEGI 16 I do not think that it should be that way because in single-player there is little to no violence and you can turn off any gore in the settings."
10264,Just an all around amazing game with dinosaurs.

10344,"PvE:
If you are looking for a survival PvE experience with tons of creatures and places to discover even without buying the dlc's and you are not spoiled by questlines leading you step by step through the story and can set your own goals and try to uncover the story then i highly recommend this game

PvE2:
If you are looking for a RP game with many great RP communities ranging from game of thrones RP servers and medieval settings without any dinosaurs or any similar type of RP i recommend this to you.

PvP:
If you are looking for a survival sandbox PvP experience i would also recommend it to you but be aware that there will be frustration and there will be enemies that you cannot defeat in terms of their group size or that they just simply cheat. But on many unofficial servers PvP is more balanced and monitored so no cheating is happening.

PvP2:
There are permadeath servers where most of the sweaty big tribes wont bother with and you have much more relaxed people there because nobody wants to risk their boss engrams and character level with raiding your base if you know how to build (that can take a long time)

TLDR:

I recommend this game if you can set your own goals and find your own playstyle may it be PvE Official, a private Server with your friends, PvP Unofficial or anything in between but you will learn a ton of new things about this game when ever you play it. I have 5000 Hours and still learn new things because they suddenly add something to a old dino or a mechanic literally nobody uses that i just didnt knew about because i dont look everything up in the wiki.

PS: Yea there can be bugs, yes the building and other mechanics can sometimes be frustrating, but overall and if you give the game a chance and not give up right away, set your own goals and find your path, you will be getting your money's worth out."

It's not that the concept is bad, I really love the idea of surviving in this strange unknown primitive half-tech world, but before diving in I seriously recommend new players to read up on what you have to do early on or else you'll end up trying to figure out what is what for the first week of your play through which is a huge waste of time. I don't understand why anyone would play this (except maybe survival game multiplayer fanatics and dino lovers]. I guess maybe it's not the game for me.

The game itself is insanely buggy (sh*t terrain, scuffed af AIs, +1000 more) and the official servers are insanely laggy (expect a 15 sec lag spike/roll back every 5-10 mins); so all my ""hard work"" from getting the stuff was actually trying to survive these elements. I can't even imagine myself going through all these sh*ts again just to get back the stuff that I had and would still have if wasn't for stupid sh*t like this. So here instead, I will just drop a review to warn the others and gtfo of this game. I got this game for free btw and I still think it's not good, the devs should really work on fixing the game instead of adding more contents.

10403,"games ass. been playing since release on xbox so its hard to let go of a game that was the base for so many great and funny memories. its gone to shit since then, and the playerbase is dropping rapidly. if youre new, play solo or with friends on a private server. old timers, find a new hobby, lol (yes, im aware that i am a hypocrite)"
10404,awsome bad graphics tho
10405,the best game ever
10406,good
10407,diplo army
10408,"So buggy, had to re download many times.
"
10409,I like the maps of this game. Very well crafted. It's a great game to play with your friends.
10410,"Can yall Fix this game, and reduce the darned size before you keep working on a sequel?"
10411,"Best survival game out there. Better than Minecraft. Dinosaurs, action, adventure, fighting, taming, leveling up, grinding, so many options, ans theres a goal to this game and keeps you going unlike Minecraft. My favorite."
10412,so good
10413,"The perfect survival game. Some mechanics are aging, but for a 5ish year old game that's totally okay. If youre gonna play, play on unofficial or solo player since the official maps havent been wiped since the release of the game so everyones capped out dinos and built to the point of being impossible to raid."
10414,"This isn't a game. Games are meant to be played for fun. This game isn't fun, and you don't play it, it plays you. Sure there are parts that are great. The graphics are amazing, the mechanics are all there, flying the birds around is fun. The problem is that its not fun. the map is huge!, but you can't explore it because every single creature even down to sweat bees and ants are OP and will kill you in 3 hits or less. Its a true grind that will leave you angry, unsatisfied, and regretful about yet another after-work evening wasted trying to back to your gear from your last death, before you die from the elements, starvation, dehydration, or dinos.  Spawn at the coast, jump in water get killed by pirhana, respawn, explore woods, get killed by raptor, spawn, build base, get bird, fly around exploring, get knocked off bird, die, respawn, mad dash to bird, die, respawn, bird death notification, mad dash to last death, get killed, lose first death location beacon, respawn start all over."

10417,"You will work really hard, and lose it all, but its fun :)"
10418,THE BEST GAME
10419,"The graphics and dinos, they took the time to make a real world game that is a pleasure to play but also challenging and sometimes rage quit but in a good way."
10420,dinosaur go rawr
10421,siuu
10422,great survival game
10423,"This game would be so awesome IF IT WORKED.
If you ARE willing to deal with problem after problem not to mention ridiculous file size... buy this when it's 70% off. It's NOT worth the regular price. Also just FYI, the last time I had to delete this trainwreck of a game off my PC because I'd run out of ideas on how to get it to run (inc uninstall/reinstall), it was 430GB."
10424,"basically, dino cool... best game. this game will make you cry, you will lose all of your dinos, you will die, but you will keep playing for SOME FUCKING REASEN!!...... 100/10 would recemend!"

10434,"so cool, cool game. i love it. play it guys because this game is good."
10435,love the game but there is always glitches hard to like a game that 90 % of the time if acts up i had this game on epic and it did the same thing that it just stopped working over time and on PS4 where i could play on genesis without crashes ever 2 minutes

10481,eat robot dinosaur live forever
10482,"well not my kinda game i like games that dont have ther files corrupted every 2 hour i cant see what it costs to make items in solo or when playing multiplayer also
its about as grindy as runescape and fall damage is ridiculous you die if you fall like 1m/3.28foot if you join a pvp server  your base is probably going to be destroyed by some one with a rex or giga i played a pvp server for 2 days all i got was 7 stone foundations down before building walls and a roof i put down a furness and a smithy i meet some guy i join his tribe more people join i get a gun a naked dude attacks me so i shot him i comes back 20 seconds lator and punches me again i run away and relode my gun but then he pulls out a gun and 1 shots me and my otter i just build a new gun as i hade some iron the second guy in my tribe gets a sacoro and a level 114 raptor then i and the second dude get our axes and break down the door of a small hut inside ther is a bed with a dude in metal armor we kill him he has a lot of good lot but on our way back next to our base is a dude riding a level 156 rex the kills our dinos thrn the comes after us the other dude in our tribe dies but i hide on a cliff next to some ones base i and the raptor are safe we go back to base and guess what like 2 minuts lator he is back and destroys our base and kills everyone and our dinos then he just hangs around the area for like an hour i exit the game i come back tomarrow i demolish the destroyed base and build a raft base i place 2 foundations before being attcked by a dude on a frog and kills me he comes back like 20 mins lator and destryes my storage boxes and kills me then every night he comes and kills me destoyes my roof and storage for the next like around 10 in game days in a row but that was the island map other maps players seems nicer to naked people in huts but also almost never meet anyone because maps so big
at least in solo i can increase xp and resours gain because everything is level caped and i mean literally everything and there is this system where if you go in a server you can travel to another server but some mapes have explorer notes that give a shit tone of xp so kinda have to get notes ther then travel to another before playing on a map without the notes also why is the game 100-300gb (this review is 486 words or 2,290 characters long the creatures look really cool tho
"
10483,you can eat other poeoples feces! this is madness!
10484,very fun and interesting
10485,slay amusing monsters kill epic beast bosses gathering loot to rival even the greatest of weapon collections explore truly vast worlds to the highest mountains to the deepest depths of oceans to the high heavens to conquer even the stars themselves can be explored tameing these beast is so uniqe every single one leaves a impression building true marvels of structures to leave the beast of the land and mongrels alike in aww at the complexity of such feats and for humans to go from stone tools and dirt to the high heavens themselves is disgusting in its own right its fine in its own way would recommend availing into this game it is amusing

10536,Really enjoying this game. Full of content and lots of things to do! Can't wait to see what more is to come!
10537,"Going to start to say this game has allot of glaring annoying stupid bugs, glitches, crap netcode and more things that pull this game into the absalute pooper sometimes, with deaths that are annoying due to bugs and poor meshing or lag into a lava pool and dead. Dont get me wrong idc if i die but dieing to a problem out of your control due to a bug and it will happen allot can set you back quite a bit of time. If you cant deal with bugs this really is not a game for you. 

Outside of that this game is absalutly amazing. There are allot of systems to this game that can let people from all walk play it PvE carebears and your hardcore sweatlord PvPer to the solo loner in the corner. This game is great CO-OP and in a public server full of nerds. If you like Dinos, Breeding, RAIDing, Bossfights, Exploration and more what you waiting for?!?!? 


Or just wait for Ark 2 x)"
10538,"While the game definitely has some jank, inconsistent bugs, and is occasionally obtuse, taming dinosaurs is a fun twist to the endless survival-crafting onslaught.

I really don't like the weird futurism stuff, though."

10567,"I really like this game, I do recommend playing with a friend(s). Its easier to have someone go with you when exploring/ grabbing material-- in case you die somewhere and need them to come get you (I've died and lost not only my belongings but my flying dinosaur as well on multiple occasions and re-spawning away from my items and relocating them can be a pain) and having a friend come help get your flying dinosaur (if your in a tribe together) and or grab your things for you and come get you is a big relief. I enjoy the game play, I like the struggle of the real environmental game play/ Surviving the cold, heat and needing particular things to survive. 10/10 recommend even though I scream and yell when I die."

Second time i spawned a cute little dino ran up to me then his cute 2 little siblings joined, then the 3 cute little dino siblings proceeded to turn me in to dinner.

10/10 would die to dino's again"

it should be easier for beginners to get in the game tho i had a hard time getting in beacuse the menu is super unfriendly and it literally throws you in which is kinda the point but hard for new players"

10618,"I love the game but the original game developers are a bunch of silly people. Play the game on vanilla settings, no mods, and you'll understand how silly the game mechanics are, especially the building aspect of the game. The game truly shines within the mod community."
10619,Fun game!
10620,"you can like go on dinosaurs and stuf like that. vinn isn't in this one yet, but you can imagine he is and the game gets better. too bad you need a nasa computer for it to run well tho."
10621,"updated the game, kept crashing after. realised it wasnt worth it, went outside, found friends, found love. i had a house, a wife, kids and a job. went back on steam, realised i hadnt played ark in a while, the issue was fixed. then it all spiraled down. I started playing more, and more, and more until my wife divorced me, took the kids i got fired because i couldnt show up at work, friends left me. ark took everything from me."
10622,"Ark: Survival Evolved is definitely a must-have game. The early game is a bit difficult at times but you can adjust the settings (I always adjust taming and hatching speed) to your preference in single-player and building your character is the most hilarious and enjoyable experience. The graphics in the game are adjustable and on High or Epic are extraordinary, the dinosaurs and landscapes look real and the developers really put a lot of thought and time into the little things, such as how the grass sways in the wind or the pattern of the scaling on different dinosaurs. The prehistoric and mythical creatures look very real and have very realistic movements, sounds, and looks. The AI is OUTSTANDING! The animals react to situations as they would in real life. They are found in their corresponding habitats and can be seen battling and hunting out in the wild. On top of all this, nearly EVERY single creature is tamable and the larger ones are ride-able. You can name and level up every single creature and even command them with different whistles! It is absolutely incredible. The building mechanics are a bit difficult so I recommend using Structures Plus (or S+) to help make it easier, but once you get the hang of it you can build some pretty amazing bases and structures. I personally prefer to play single-player because your bases, creatures, and characters can be taken or destroyed while you are offline. With single-player, you can create servers yourself that sync to your single-player data for only your friends to join or for only you to see and play. Overall, the game is absolutely amazing and I would HIGHLY recommend playing it."

10692,The game is a bit hard in the beginning if you don't know how to play but gets super fun the more you play! I really like it.
10693,"Отличная игра. Слышал много плохих отзывов и поэтому не покупал. Когда получил базовую игру бесплатно, начал играть и был удивлен - игра очень классная. Даже купил все остальные DLC (тем более сейчас скидки). Похоже разработчики доделали игру и нет каких-либо значительных глюков. Ни разу не вылетала за 200+ часов игры. Иногда (было только два раза) зверье застревает в текстурах, но не проваливается под карту и со временем вылазит на поверхность. Рекомендую всем кто любит ""выживалки""."

10700,"Awesome game, keeps you coming back for more. Few lags issues but other than that it is good."
10701,its epic
10702,"Hello everyone, I recently went all the same into this game, although I bought it happy for a long time. But it is not important.

The first screen greets us with loud music and a not entirely clear interface. Probably, if you sit and look at the guides, you can find a lot of useful things in a bunch of settings, but this is time and perseverance.
It takes a lot of time to figure out the game and start developing. I would like to see the function of an adviser who will tell you about the benefits of buildings, developments, etc. Because at first you build a straw house, and in technology a wooden house has long passed. Well, the same goes for hunting and taming dinosaurs. Another minus is that on the server you cannot get far from the host. This is very felt when one runs for meat, and the other builds a base.

(I'm still a rookie in the game)"

950 Hours - Grinding 
25 Hours - Taming
10 Hours - Enjoying the game 
10 Hours - Breeding
5 Hours - Raiding Kids

Nah but overall its a great game, even if it can get a bit grindy, if you want to have more fun just play Unoffical servers."

10775,yes very pro game
10776,fun game on pc and xbox
10777,"i shit myself live on camera in 2008 on chaturbate and i got 6 viewers allround good time, thumbs up from me"
10778,"Got it when it was for free and tbh, it's good, but I would not recommend this game if you want to keep your sanity intact and anger at bay. If you need a reason why just look at any negative review for this game and they pretty much all say the same thing."
10779,"Worst game ever made - is what you might think in your first few hours of playing this game. clunky UI, TERRIBLE dino AI and above all the lag and roll backs on official servers. Not to mention the scum bag ""alphas (no lives)"" who scatter builds all over the map to prevent new players from progressing. Basically impossible to progress on official. I once grinded for 2 weeks straight with a friend only to have the server rolled back to right before we built our base. 100+ hours of hard work reduced to NOTHING. I hate this game so much but the concept is so good. The freedom and open world and the huge variety of dinos and items. There is so much to do in this game you can never get enough. Play on unofficial and its a whole different experience. Amazing graphics, amazing concept but GARBAGE game. You would think that it was made by a group of artists instead of programmers."
10780,If u don't play this game u are gei
10781,"fast dino
"
10782,"God aweful game. Tired it when it was free and oh boy, people actually paid for this $h1t? The game is a beta at best and should be still in alpha. How they can be calling this a finished game AND are making a 2nd is beyond me. Its a buggy mess, must have one of the most boring gaming loops and takes a ton of memory and harware to run a game that looks like total A$$.

I have not been so unimpressed with a game in such a long time i feel bad for my previous negative reviews. Can only guess this is catered to dinosaur fans and school children. If you are an adult and play this game, please go get a full brain scan done at your local G.P asap.

If i could give this 0/10 i would. God speed. You'll need it."
10783,"Someone told me everything is hard in ark. This statement was correct. You starve 300x faster than in real life and not eating or drinking will break your legs, VERY realistic. If you are looking for a realistic game you should totally FOR SURE buy this game. People have been saying that there are dinosaurs in this game, but I've simply not seen any. Since there is no dinosaurs or anything that doesn't exist today, this game is very realistic. If you want to play a realistic life simulator get this game :D"

10811,"The fact that this game is free is such a treat! We had a great time. We enter the game with no prior knowledge of the game, no tips, no beginner's guide, no tutorials, nothing. It was amazing to slowly learn the features that this game has to offer, and it was amazing in the end. So much to do, so much to discover, so many dinosaurs to learn about. At first, it may seem complicated, but you'll get used to it. This game is difficult yet really rewarding."

Now i got it free and steam sale going on so i got expacs 1/2 off. i feel bad for waiting so long to get this gem but was tied up with life and involved with other games, better late than never. If you like survival games, good scenery, dinos, mods, or settings that can be set from hard to creative, then this game is for you!"

10824,one of the few games that combines the aspects of survival and dinosaur taming into one game perfectly.
10825,get new hawk quick for when u get raped in caves
10826,"This game sucks. You will 5 hours downloading it just for a big snake to sit inside of a rock and kill you over and over again. Eventually you just finally give up and let your countless hours of work sit there until it despawns. If your try to play on a public server you will be faced with the entire map being covered in player placed pillars that prevent you from building the required items to break said pillars. This game has some potential but not much. If you really really like the idea of dinosaurs then maybe this game is for you if you are okay playing it alone. Otherwise, stay far far away from this unfortunate game."
10827,fun
10828,dino g
10829,Constant LAG on my server is pretty pathetic. Seems like the game should be free since it feels like an alpha or beta build. Lag time is over 5 sec at a time and happens every 5 minutes or so. Cant believe I spent money on this. And I'm NOT PAYING for some LAG 3rd party service. Only two or three players on at a time. Fix your servers before offering more DLC content. That's like buying great speakers for a car that doesn't run. Seems like its all about greed and profits instead of helping players have a great experience.
10830,dino go brr
10831,favorite game hands down
10832,rust but with dinosaurs
10833,"I just discovered this game a day ago. ARK is right up my ally. I'm really enjoying myself in this beautifully massive immersive world. Make sure you have all your responsibilities done, because you will easily lose track of time in this game. I would highly suggest this game to anyone."

10840,"its a very action and adventurest game
"
10841,"This game is everything it seems it would be, can get laggy at times but still fun non the less"
10842,"Poggers game besides the game absolutely hating you, this review deserves a award am i right?"
10843,"ARK is a game with many dinosaurs in it; running on Oculus Rift, anyone who plays on PC can see dinosaurs in the distance and are shown a distant glimpse of a giant bird swooping towards them. This isn't something that I'm familiar with in other games. Where else do you run into a giant dinosaur flying through the sky?

Leaning in, it's hard not to see that ARK is a game that I can't just put aside. I can't see it as just another spin-off, or another shooter with a wild sea. That ship I ran into? It was stealing boats, to try and find a way to get home.

Many have already discovered ways to tame sea monsters in ARK, but stealing a boat at sea? That's on another level."
10844,Good Game got it for free :)

10852,Porque la gente usa teck en este juego!!!
10853,"I recommend the game highly with a warning also. I hate this game immensely.  BUT, it makes you love it that much more. it has a bunch of small problems that its had since the beta day. With a few thousand hours played on console and here and there on steam i will say the PC version is better. Its very addicting and frustrating at the same time. No matter how much it angers me i wont stop playing."

10869,good
10870,"This game is pretty brutal as far as survival games go. It's very easy for one decision to ruin a lot of progress, so it really makes you think carefully about how you play. I feel like this game really scratches an itch for me, because it genuinely presents me with a challenge, but it's still tons of fun and isn't straight-up frustrating if you always play carefully. It's not perfect, and there are some bugs that can be really annoying at times, but this game has so much to offer that the bugs don't really make too drastic of an impact."

I'm told there is a huge pvp section to the game but I play pve so there are things I don't really use in it. But just building a base and collecting the dinos is plenty fun for me."
10886,amazing game easy to run
10887,"
All the Official server are crowded, and you will have a hard time finding a place to build anywhere. Make your own server if you plan to play with people."
10888,yes.

10893,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

10908,"A lot to do and set up, i thoroughly enjoyed it. if you dont like how a system works, you can always edit the modifiers for the game to make it either easier to achieve or obsolete, and if you do like a hardcore game, you can make things more difficult. One of my all time favorites"
10909,"Honestly, this game should be called early access. It is completely full of bugs and oversights. Network optimization is so horrible you will regularly teleport around with mere 100 ping. Hitboxes are so awful on dinosaurs. There can litteraly be 10 arrows sticking out of dodos head as it sits their oblivious to you point blank shooting him. Due to this the only reasonable way to tame many dinos is to use bolas/traps and play fortnite as you trap them in stone, so they cant move while you shoot them. Example there is 7 stats on a dinosaur. Useful= Health, melee, stamina,and weight. Practically useless= Oxygen and food. Useless= speed. The Base speed stat on a dino does nothing at all. If you only have a couple hours to play this game a day, you cannot play online due to absolutely awful long time it takes to tame and raise dinosaurs. Yes because I want to spend a litteral hour of my life watching a dinosaur sleep while I ""tame"" it from knocking it unconscious and force feeding it. 

You should only play this games with friends on a modded server that helps fix a lot of this, or official if you have no life and enjoy suffering while watching paint dry."

10911,"the baseline game is a timesink and a half and the new player experience is ROUGH, but it's actually a pretty fun and deep game once you get past those initial frustrations and change some settings. the dinos are all pretty cool and unique with their various uses, and it's punishing enough to really make you feel like a weak little human living in a crazy dino world. it's also got a decent amount of content as far as maps go, and some of them are VERY pretty and fun to explore."

10922,"I bought the game on its beginning. I saw it evolving since 2016 and enjoyed every DLC the devs released. The most enjoyable thing in ARK is the fact you can't end the game. I mean, there is a end but even beating the last boss you didn't discovered every functionality of the game. I recommend the game because if you like survival games this one can easily become your favorite :)"

10942,"[b]I ONLY PLAY PVE. I ONLY LIKE PLAYING PVE IN GAMES LIKE THIS (Rust, Unturned, etc). THIS IS A REVIEW IS ONLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE THAT WILL ONLY PLAY THE PVE ASPECT OF THIS GAME (COOP OR SOLO).[/b]
TL/DR at the end.

I understand that this game has a huge fanbase and it's very successful, but I personally think it's much more due to the uniqueness of the game than the actual value of it. I don't have hundreds of hours and I've never beaten the game (more on that later). 
The way I see it, the three main appeals of this game are: 1) Taming Dinos 2) Exploration and 3) Survival. I'd like to individually look into them so that it's hopefully clear why I do not recommend the game based on my experience in these 3 categories.
[h1]Taming Dinosaurs[/h1]
SUPER COOL! Being able to have pet dinos is AWESOME! However, taming dinosaurs sucks and once you have them, it's honestly pretty one-dimensional. For the taming, it comes down to one of two methods: stand around and feed it stuff (possibly go fetch stuff to feed it), or shoot it until it goes to sleep (tranquilizer arrows, darts, and bullets). The feeding is obviously boring, because you literally just sit there. Some dinosaurs even need you to feed them corpses, but the ""drop corpse"" prompt literally covers the ""feed to creature"" prompt at most angles which makes it infuriating. As for the sleep taming, it's fun at first, until you realize you have to start building traps or abusing the game's AI to get them stuck between trees. Building traps is kind of fun (it's not a traditional ""craft me"", but actually using structures to get it in a mini-house). Unfortunately, you very quickly realize there's one design that is very simple, inexpensive, and effective, AND IT SHOULD BE USED on almost everything. Once the animal is asleep, you have to babysit it for SOMETIMES A REAL-LIFE HALF HOUR, manually feeding it narcotics every few minutes. Unless you're willing to grind for annoying kibble recipes that you can ONLY FIND ON THE WIKI. More on that in my rant about Exploring the World.
Great, you tamed a dinosaur. Their AI sucks ass. Your flying creatures will fly in circles AROUND you instead of coming to you when summoned, but when following you hover just above ground level (perfect for getting attacked or eaten by sea creatures). Any non-boss creature's attack AI boils down to ""run straight at target and keep attacking"". The game has a cool set of commands you can issue your dinosaurs with a surprisingly intuitive UI, but they have a tendency to literally ignore your commands. Has resulted in many deaths for me and my creatures. Very unfun and annoying. Even when they are listening, they generally suck at that, too. They'll happily run into lava/pits, push their friends to their deaths, or take obscure paths to get to a destination right in front of them. ""Ah yes, a 3-wide player-made ramp in front of me that leads right onto the raft? No thank you, I'll head UNDER the raft and start drowning myself instead :)"" 
All of these things individually don't ruin the game, but each one individually just feels so sour, so when there are so many of them happening back to back (sometimes reverting hours of progress) it's just... not fun. That's it. And why play a game if it's actively unfun?

[h1]Exploring the World[/h1]
Let me start by saying, the maps are HUGE and they are COOL. Many very diverse biomes, landscapes, and terrains. But it really bites the game in the ass, BAD. The BASE GAME is [b]ALMOST 300 GB.[/b] Even that aside, the maps are generally TOO big and navigation with the wiki is a MUST. I tried to play blind for the first 20 hours, but a lot of the features of this game are simply locked behind the wiki. It's really f*cking stupid. Remember how I talked about things taking to long to tame? Well you can make something called Kibble, which helps a lot! How do you get the recipe for that though? You don't. You just don't. [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/tbawdl/where_to_find_kibble_recipes_in_game/]Here is a reddit thread full of players talking about how recipes for Kibble, with a majority of them writing it off as impossible. OP and his GF have played 40 hours EACH and never seen it either. [/url] Is it actually possible? I don't care. For something so fundamental to the game, to have it locked behind the wiki is disappointingly stupid. Back to the maps though, it's very sad to see YouTubers with thousands of hours talking about how they still use the wiki for navigation and cave coordinates (and then coordinates of where to get special items WITHIN those caves). Shit, I didn't even KNOW there were HUGE underwater cave systems until I started watching ARK YouTubers. Why? There are no good indicators of such within the game, and no good navigation tools within the game. Map, compass, GPS (WHICH ONLY SHOWS XY COORDINATES). You can make markers on the map and see yourself if the admin has enabled it. If you're hosting, your friends can always see your nametag from across the map, but you can't see them unless they're VERY close. It just sucks that a game that gives you a suit that lets you fly and punch through rocks can't even give you more than ""here are your X and Y coords, go get 'em tiger!""
Again, [b]it sucks that you are forced into using the wiki.[/b] Maybe ARK needs a tutorial, but games like Don't Starve, Terraria, and Minecraft have no real tutorials yet seem to be doing pretty well for themselves. I personally unlock engrams (this game's equivalent of level-locked recipes) much faster than I have use for them. 2k extra engram points atm because I haven't bothered spending them on stuff I know I can't even craft or make use for. Again, ARK isn't awful, I just wouldn't recommend it.

[h1]The Survival of ARK: Survival Evolved[/h1]
This review is getting too long. Rapidfire time.
Combat and bosses come down to just, ""pile on all your dinosaurs, have them essentially W+M1 the boss while you buff them occasionally!!"" Maybe you can shoot the boss, but your damage is so negligible compared to what your dinos will be doing it's honestly a waste of time.
The building is is surprisingly disappointing and honestly pretty shoddy. I'm not convinced fences really work, even after watching tutorials. Think to yourself, if someone is looking up tutorials on how to PLACE FENCES in a game AND MULTIPLE TUTORIALS EXIST,  that should say a lot about how bad it is. Pillars clip through floors/ceilings, so they can't be used much for cool builds. Trying to build on a raft? If you don't want your foundations built at shoulder lever, your only option is abusing a glitch with pillars so that your floors don't stick far above the raft. You can't even construct your own bridges, which sucks with how many rivers/bodies of water there are. Especially because water creatures are so annoying. A lot of them are pretty easy to kill/avoid, but I digress. Let me build my bridges :(
This game is REALLY grindy. You can get dinos that autoharvest or greatly assist in harvesting (at the time of this, I have Therizinosaur, Mosochops, Giant Beaver, Ankylosaurus, and Triceratops). Even big ARK YouTubers like pterafier increase drop rates, which is just disheartening to see.
//end rapidfire 

[h1]Conclusion/TLDR[/h1]
I didn't point out many positives of this game, but there certainly were plenty. It's just that as I'm playing, and whenever I close the game, it's very rarely with a good taste. The bad parts are just so much more memorable than the good parts; there are way more ""well this sucks"" moments than ""woah, this is awesome"" moments. I'm writing this because 4/4 of the friends I've played with also didn't like this game, but we couldn't find a negative review that honestly encapsulated how we felt (so many ""wouldn't recommend, 3k hours, 1k since review, hahahaha I'm so funny"").
Its an okay game, and it's certainly not [i]awful[/i]. I just don't recommend playing it."

10983,"This game had lot of potential on paper but it failed to deliver on so many fields.
Game is badly optimized it crashed multiple times while my friend and i tried exploring cave formations and both of us have pretty good rigs, playing on private server is TERRIBLE as players get rubberbanded to a host moment anyone touches water or reaches certain distance. Difficulty scale is ridiculous and deceptive, level of animals does not mean jack, material requirement for some technology is ridiculously high...taming dinosaurs can take you couple of IRL hours on default settings???!! Certain commands are not even very well explained...i had to look through guides to figure out how to rotate objects/dinos i wanted to paint, because game is that bad at explaining its own damn mechanics.
Every time you try to install a damn DLC it opens game itself...WHY?
I played my fair share of indie games with devs being inexperienced...but this game takes a GODDAMN cake in being badly developed department.
General verdict is...do not bother paying for this garbage and if sequel follows same formula as this dumpster fire...i would probably avoid it in wide berth as well... Vin Diesel or not."

Yesterday while hopping on a small pvp server, our base got destroyed and all our dinos got killed by a mek, we weren't even there to defend ourselves against a mek and even if we were there we would've been shredded by that lvl 313 mek. I guess some people who already have godly loot compared to me and probably better dinos just wanna attack for blatant damn fun. Me and my friend so much good dinos, so much good loot, but I bet that tek guy on that mek had better but is merciless. I'm now probably going to make my own server and just play duo with my friend so shit like this doesn't happen while we're gone.

11077,.
11078,worst game ever never recommend this game... if you start playing it others players won't let you build up anything and they do have Dragons lvl 500 which can kill you by 1 shot ! you have other kind of players who comes only to destroy everything you build also by 1 shot  using a dragon...
11079,Very Nice game and graphics but many things can be done to improve the game

11092,runs better then xbox
11093,"It's easy to get very involved in this game. Gathering, crafting, taming dinosaurs, watching your eating and drinking needs. It's easy to start playing, but hard to put down."
11094,dinos. they're dinos. who the hell doesnt want dino buddies!?!?!?
11095,see playtime
11096,Liked everything about the game base building caves dinosaurs what more could you ask for plus pve and pvp

11101,arek
11102,"there are some points where a bit more reality would be nice, for instance, in game, honey rots.  i am pleased that i don't have to install potential spybattleyeware to do single player, always good, will see if it works on linux later.

otoh, the server filters are a bag of dog doodoo.  got 'show password protected' unchecked?  don't matter, you get a bunch of password protected servers, you have to toggle the options fresh EVERY time... pretty nice single player game, but the great big pile of terrible mods you got to download, just to find out you chose a password protected server, 40 gigs!!! cause you forgot to flip EVERY server filter option, and even if you do, a lot of stuff you don't want is gonna show anyway.  if you want to do multiplayer, prepare for endless annoyance... maybe find someone willing to edit their mod list, otherwise, junk to trip over everywhere."

11111,its fuuunnnnn
11112,I am hooked!
11113,good
11114,"For this game i really like the system and amount of possibilities to do in building and taming making it unique and its fun while it lasted. What i absolute hate is not just bugs but foundational the systems in joining as well as how ####ing long they are for just patches like when i tried joining a friend it took an hour with no progress and the joining itself is stupid and almost lazy. Creators of this game instead of simply fixing and patching this #### fix the system and both rewrite and prioritise problems in a games fundamental of joining, hell even the tether system in multiplayer melts my mind of fun making it tolarable to play, im so lucky this was free which by the way it should've been. I want to love this game and i did have fun taming and building with my friend and it could've been fun if the sent of this plague was nearby its like you guys are just putting cheap and the wrong tape over a broken water pipe."
11115,"haven't actually played the game, having issues connecting to my friends server because of workshop content not working. I am sad"

11127,"I love the game, I recommend it"
11128,"Buggy game,
Dated Graphics,
Balance is trash,
Online play is garbage,
They milked the shit out of this and spewed out even more garbage for people to waste their money on.

Oh and as of recently they went woke.

I don't even give a shit about abortions or not,  but bringing politics into the game is a hard NO from me.   Uninstalled, pulling Ark 2 from my list.

We come here to game, not be immersed into the shit we already have to deal with IRL."
11129,.
11130,"if you have the spare 150gb its worth it cause funny dinosaur
"
11131,Dinosaurs are cool
11132,"Great game, makes me rage"
11133,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
"
11134,fun
11135,minecraft but with dinos
11136,Glad for grab this game for free
11137,really good game to play with friends!!!! Ive been really enjoying it lately
11138,RLLY FUCKING GOOD
11139,Game very fun with friends and mods
11140,boring
11141,The best game i ever played!
11142,game sucks it wont even let me play
11143,"its super realistic and i recommend that you play multi-player if possible because it makes you more comfterble unless you have a mean friend.
"
11144,W game
11145,A game that expects you to play it like a full time job. Great if you're into that kind of thing. I'm not.
11146,oswald cobblepot
11147,nigg
11148,nice
11149,shit game XD
11150,"Every 10 seconds you die, but besides being on the death screen for most of the game its fun."
11151,If you love to spend endless hours grinding for what may be lost in a 2 minute trip to the woods then Ark is definitely for you.
11152,kinda dead but fun with friends if you can find a server
11153,"Mid, buggy and annoying company"
11154,I really like dinosaurs
11155,It'll kill your productiviy
11156,dino good
11157,"very good, dinos. women, mods, more women. breeding, and, you guessed it, women!"
11158,"I love dinosaurs, i love open world games and consistently changing algorithms."
11159,I LOVE ZIS GAME
11160,"Ark was a fun and great game, one of my all-time favorites. Will be giving this creator, Wildcard, a thumbs down for bringing politics to the Steam Community on June 24, 2022. Woke = NO ARK2 for me."
11161,yes
11162,ark: survival evolved cured my cancer
11163,FUN
11164,"Post politics on a VIDEO GAME, cya."
11165,Fun but has a lot of Black screen loading glitches
11166,its a little laggy
11167,punch dodo in head
11168,yes
11169,"If you like games such as Rust then you'll likely enjoy playing this game. However the reason why I don't recommend this game is due to the massive hungry data space requirements. The game is always updating which is great due to an active developer, but when it takes nearly half a terabyte of space is something to take a step back and say no thank you. Furthermore character creation is very limited and feels heavily outdated to the early 2000's MMOs. It's a great game, but not enough for me to be able to continue playing. There are a lot of bugs in this game involving the AI and 3D models. AI sends a Dino down only to clip into or through a mountain face or building. You'll die a lot in this game, but keep your progress as you continue on improving. It's a great concept which I do enjoy. The player base is both non toxic and toxic pending on the server you join. Overall, get this game if you have the time. It takes a lot of time to download and install, but if you don't have the hardware just avoid!"
11170,its fun but hard but fun but takes a long time
11171,great survival game
11172,Jason Statham
11173,"Don't buy, they literally just released a wholeass update log just to talk about the Roe V Wade decision. I don't care which way you sway, keep your retarded dogcrap opinions to yourself. Video game studios should not force their opinions and beliefs down the throats of people literally playing to get away from all the bs of the world. They are trying to extort money from you to get you to donate to foundations that support the murder of children purely for convenience. Lets show developers and companies that we want their identity politics and pandering out of our faces, just how we did with Top Gun Maverick Vs Lightyear flop."
11174,"Ark was a fun and great game, one of my all-time favorites.  Will be giving this creator, Wildcard, a thumbs down for bringing politics to the Steam Community on June 24, 2022.  Woke = NO ARK2 for me."
11175,play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11176,DED
11177,fun. that is all.
11178,"ark is a buggy, unbalanced piece of shit game. if I could spit on any game, it would be this."

11189,I really enjoy the amazing scenery and well done coding of this game. The dinosaurs are really cool and so are the maps. Overall I'd recommend anyone who can play the game to play it because you won't regret it!
11190,very good geam play or i will gr
11191,sauce
11192,This game went on sale for free so I got it not knowing the actual price was 8 hours of my time downloading a game that I might play like 3 times
11193,Good game
11194,iuyrui
11195,Fun but difficult
11196,Love this game. Well worth the cost.
11197,Mids Are very fun with friends best game
11198,haha dino
11199,great survival game but it does have a lot of bugs and insane lag at times but thats to be expected in a game like this
11200,"Its an alright game, but if I were to have never played it and looked at the reviews before hand I never would have played it in the first place. Not only are the condensed files shit, I have to deal with the broken server trying to log in which makes me have to restart my entire computer because it crashes my steam and game, along with having to deal with issues said in game of the most annoying of all rubberbanding over and over by using a pteradon or argey."
11201,garbage and has so many bugs
11202,if u wanna become a woman and want to physically rip your penis off before surgery play this game.
11203,"boring as hell past the first 10 hours, and makes my computer want to explode if I decide to even slightly try to make the game not be on the lowest possible graphics"
11204,"sorta shit
"
11205,I lyk dinosawyers
11206,x
11207,"because it has dinosaurs


and it has fun mechanics"
11208,this game is super fun you just need a lot of patince and a lot of memory
11209,"God it's so buggy, but I can't get enough!!"
11210,"dope

11211,it is a bit of bugs but it is a good game
11212,good
11213,goated game
11214,"Awful experience when you die, amazing when you are alive"
11215,"Best RPG sandbox game out there. I haven't played much online so I can't speak about that, but even playing solo while it is a challenge, is an incredible experience and the community maps and content is awesome. would recommend with a solid 9.5/10 because it can be a real bitch sometimes to get certain tames."
11216,I would recommend this game if u have freinds an NO JOB NO LIVE
11217,best game ive ever played 10/10
11218,nice
11219,Wildcard is a bad company
11220,mhm
11221,dinosaurs
11222,my friend fed me funny looking chocolate cake and now my tummy and booty hole hurts :(
11223,"Since the developers have made the choice to publicly bring (american) politics into their news and discussion section, trying to promote their own view on those issues, and obviously wishing for us to take their side, I have made MY choice to downvote their otherwise pretty enjoyable product.

I am playing video games, to forget that crazy shit which is out there, in the real world, not for becoming ""educated"" about one-sided viewpoints from a fucking video game producer...

Enjoy my downvote, babykiller promoters."
11224,cool and fun game with friends but a bit of a bummer that you have to pay for dlcs a
11225,funny sometimes
11226,i like the dinosaur sex
11227,"The game is pretty good. A few mechanics could use some polishing but overall a good concept that plays pretty well. A nice twist on the survival genre.
The problem is the developers dont know how to separate politics from video games. People come to play your game to escape from their daily lives, not have more political crap thrown in their face by the devs. For that reason stay away from this game and anything they make. History shows if you mix politics in that your company will suffer from it, which in turn means their products will suffer.
You are here to make a video game not talk about your political opinions. Learn to separate the two before its too late"
11228,yes
11229,"The games optimization is quite an issue, but otherwise I just love it. From the first time I saw it on youtube, I just instantly knew I wanted to get the game. It's one of those feelings where you can't really find a specific reason, but you just like something.

Dinosaurs: check
Building: check
Open world: kind of
Taming cool dinosaurs: check
Mods that make the game even more challenging: check
Endless: check

Overall, I game I would definitely suggest if you love the collecting and taming aspects of games!"
11230,its good
11231,"This is a great game and I loved the experiance. There is some grinding, but other that that is is amazing."
11232,yes
11233,"pretty solid game, good with friends, needs optimization. Very frustrating

Make the file size smaller"
11234,"While I'm not as experienced in this game as much as some people, and I've had some of the best memories with Ark, but I'm happy to say it'll always have a special place in my heart because of old friends like Dan & Makk."
11235,you wake up go make club and bonk raptor
11236,....
11237,raw
11238,did not get it for free

11245,Ark is a pog game concept that is half decently executed which leads to a semi shitty gaming experience but somehow still a bunch of fun!
11246,"'mazin game on god and you should get it whenever you can if you see this because:

11324,Got raided by a guy with 5 gigas on the first day -_- used a friend 30 minutes later and wiped the guy (would play again)
11325,Is nice
11326,"So bad. First off, to even access half of the servers/maps, you need to buy the battlepass. Level 1 new player dropped into an ""easy"" low level server to play for the first time. Immediately killed by a level 150 dinosaur before I could even control my character. This happened 3 times in a row. WHY TF IS THERE A LEVEL 150 DINOSAUR IN AN EASY SERVER CAMPING THE SPAWN POINTS?! Night time is too dark to see or navigate anything. The sun kills you. You need to eat, but if you fight anything to get meat, you die because everything I saw is level 50+ in the EASY LOW LEVEL AREA. One of the worst new player experiences I've ever had. Glad I didn't have to pay for this, but even as a free game, I'll probably never launch it again. Frustration level = 9.5/10"
11327,fe
11328,good
11329,"Game is so janky it's an accomplishment to get anything done. For me, those tiny accomplishments don't outweigh the majority of frustrating game play that I feel I have little control over. General movement being perplexing difficult, getting stuck on pretty much everything, resource grinding and crafting ranges from simple to rather extreme requirements, and then there's combat where if you don't just use a ranged weapon to whittle enemies down till they die in an exploitative manner then it's better to just give up and start over from scratch over trying to fight while getting stun locked until you die. 
I want to like this game and enjoy it with my friends. I've spent hours researching on the wikis and trying different strats. But I'm bashing my head against a wall here and it's not an enjoyable experience. I can't recommend this game currently, it's got potential but it's also got a long way to go."

11374,great game
11375,What i liked about this product is the fact you have an option to play solo or on a online server it is a prehistorical game with multiple prehistoric + mythical animals such as dinos wyverns and really old species of animals along with how to craft multiple things so you can survive [though may be a while till you get there] ^^ regadless of that the community of it is not half bad i mean people can still annoy you but at least you get to have a laugh on online servers please let me know what you think of this ^^ very well done game recomend it for people who are not afraid of some action
11376,you sit for a quick 30min game and get up after 6 hours
11377,so many mistakes that occurred within the development team to the point where it is actually unbelievable. deleting this game off the steam store page would have saved a lot more time than making it free.

11414,"It's pretty fun, just not 370gb of fun."
11415,"This game has it all. You want singleplayer for a more quiet, but still tense and fun experience? Ark's got you. Want action packed PvP modes where you have to strategise and work together to achieve what you want?Ark's got you. And once you've exhausted the hundreds of hours of different maps, each with their own special flair or challenge? You can easily mod it, to add so many more hours of fun. definitly worth the money."
11416,I love this game. I have a ton more hours in it than what it says i do currently. However I wish it was more realistic where you could dodge and climb things.
11417,good game
11418,"a waste of money.
ark takes up a lot of storage space. playing alone is fine but the multiplayer servers are very laggy. and to rub salt to my wound epic gave it out for free."

11425,"GIVE THIS GAME A SHOT! Great ""next/current"" gen survival game! Has a lot of great promise but a rather steep learning curve if playing alone (similar to Don't Starve), but has a ton of potential for being the next great survival game. Lots of solo and community driven gameplay elements and a pretty immersive world to be in. Not the most ""realistic"" survival game in existence but it does take a more grounded approach to movement and fatigue (i.e. If you are swimming to long and you run out of stamina you may actually drown just like in real life).

Biggest issues are that it does take a pretty meaty rig to take full advantage of the graphics (seems like a modified Crytek engine) on the highest settings. This game is JUST in early access so I expect to see some of the animations, bugs, and slight clipping issues get resolved over time. I only have about 5 hours with this game so my review is based on initial impression and overall potential the game has"
11426,"Super fun game if you are looking for pve dino game(I never got into the online side of the game so I cant say how that affects it) as will most games it is a far better experience with friends but ive had plenty fun on my own, one thing is be prepared for a real grind if you want to go anywhere in the game, you can tweak different settings on your own world to help with this if you want but this is not a game to be played for only an hour a day"
11427,"Steven Armstrong is coming for me
"
11428,"Very hard to learn, and extremely time consuming and difficult to master. There's a lot of online resources to help you, but you still need to have a lot of time on your hands, a good amount of before hand experience with survival games, and a shit-ton of patience to really get the full experience of Ark. This game is very fun once you get into it, but without friends and just starting out can make the learning curve unbearably tedious and monotonous to climb. If you have a friend who's willing to host a private dedicated server, I feel that's really the best experience from Ark you can get in my opinion."
11429,wow so much dino
11430,d
11431,it is fun
11432,i like hearing my boyfriend talk about it cool dinosaurs and stuff
11433,This game is pretty fun. Although it is quite frustrating and sometimes bugs out. Other wise if they did a big patch for the bugs the game would be pretty good

11443,"I want to like this game but the UI is SO bad.  Also there is NO optimization.  no quick stack, you get over encumbered at a drop of a hat, you starve to death in one day, you dehydrate in one day.  There is a deadly animal around literally EVERY corner.  The building placement  mechanics are junk... list goes on and on and on.

If you love to grind with terrible mechanics for building, crafting, and navigating menus this is the game for you."

11458,"I got this game free on on steam recently and I had been wanting to check it out. (No compensation was given for my review) I really liked the play but love building things in games. So in order to use the admin tools I created my own locally hosted server. This took a very good amount of time to get it to work correctly so that I could add other admins. However, once I got it all set up it is easy to manage and tweak to my hearts content. This makes me happy. I love a game that I can alter to my own expectations and that I can play with my family and friends. The dinosaur themed open world sandbox style game I never knew I always wanted. Thanks ARK Development team!"
11459,"Tons of fun, especially with friends and mods. While there are some minor glitches, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the game. It's guns and dinos, what more do you need?"

11504,"The developer, Studio Wildcard, has made a big deal about supporting baby murder, and donating money that you spent purchasing their game, to abortion providers. 
Personally, I'm sick of company's and businesses playing politics, and if it weren't for the fact I received this as a gift, I'd be pissed that they donated my money to this cause.
Until the company gets its nose out of politics and stops giving money they received for the game to doctors and organizations that kill babies for profit, their game is getting a big ole NO from me."
11505,dont
11506,"Good idea, bad implementation. Bugs not fixed. Your time spent in this game resolves into nothing other than appreciate things that you work hard for in real life.

Dinosaurs kill you when you just spawn into the game, and you have to re-spawn at least 5-8 times to finally find a safer place to develop. When you die, you lost all the items and you can find your dead body and still able to re-collect them, except the danger was still around your dead body. Not to mention when there's a glitch that makes your dead body flew away in mid air and you have no ways to ever get it back.

I sincerely do not want the developer released ARK2 when bugs aren't fixed. Very irresponsible."
11507,"This game big suck. It suck your life, your soul, your time, and happiness. It suck everything but not your pp"
11508,its cool i guess

I do miss the days of when it wasn't as Scifi as it is now and the worst thing you had to worry about was a raptor trying to kill you when you respawned.  However I still strongly recommend this game to anyone who sees this. 8/10

I've never left a review for a game before but holy shit. why. there is no tutorial in the game at all from what i found, other players will always result in pvp at some point and that's not why i got this game. you're left to look up how to pick up a rock because you're allowed to punch for wood and thatch but boulders are just off limits for some reason. you are not allowed to know anything in the game or about it. you have to memorize survivor note locations and go on a run to find them all in order to get experience to level up. unplayable at night because of how dark it is. arbitrary ""easy"" and ""hard"" zones to spawn in because guess what, now they don't have the resources you want or the dinosaurs you need. might as well just kys at that point and spawn somewhere else with nothing then take however many useless dinos you might have tamed at that point. default stats for tamed dinos are also rigged against you with wild dinos (in advanced settings I think) having a ""higher"" (or default) level of health and damage. meaning you would need either about five raptors to kill just one or a single raptor roughly 5 times higher in level. constant dying from external dangers but the need for water and food is practically non existent, eliminating the entire ""survival"" aspect of the game. it plays more like minecraft in the sense that it really isn't about survival, just progressing with the materials you can find around you and exploring but this game has it impossible to farm or even find those in certain locations of the map. because of the dangers of higher level predators the trek to go to the correct environment is going to be even longer. piranhas are just annoyingly annoying for no reason. if it had skill trees, for example seven days to die, you could improve the armor you make or maybe let it last longer, create it for less resources, etc. but no. always the same level of thing no matter what. never any better, just get the next set of engrams for armor. but also they might provide a different level of insulation or varying degree of physical protection so not always inherently better. you can never, ever, no matter what, ever learn anything about this game from playing this game. everyhting you could need or want to know is online in encyclopedias and not a trace of it is in game in any shape or form. you won't know a certain predator has a boost from eating bugs, or harvests specific resources better than others until it happens. then it's a question of what other dinosaurs might harvest this good? does this one suck and the only one i know that harvests wood or is it ""top of the food chain"" in that sense? you can't inspect them to learn. there's a magnifying glass that does god knows what, identifies materials or something. i don't know because I've never had access to some of the materials required to make it.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                        TLDR: it's a terrible game that does not even fit in the survival genre. feels like it could so massively benefit from having skill trees or a system that rewards you for performing certain activities like farming, crafting, fighting, taming. etc. but just doesn't for some reason. you have to look up too many answers because why would you even think about randomly hitting this button looking at this thing. it's a 10 second tutorial that you could sweep through in a breeze but still doesn't have. horrible default settings stacking the odds of a dino fight winning in your favor at five to one, not in your favor. locks the more accessible, nicer items to craft behind high amounts of material only certain dinosaurs can harvest in the amounts that would make them more easily attainable."

11570,Dinosaurs are awesome my favorite is the dragon thanks.
11571,Do you think I want to hear about your politics. Deleting this off my steam ASAP

11573,lol gud game
11574,"why is this game like 150 gigabytes, oh well, it has dinosaurs. Who needs empty storage when you can ride dinosaurs in a 3d game that turns my potato computer into a pizza oven, after all?"
11575,I cant recommend it to my friends cuz I dont have any. I cant believe Steam is bullying me this hard
11576,yes
11577,fun game
11578,"This game is good, i i would like a ability were with a new tek thing were you could make a dinosaur yourself it would start out as a egg and grow like any bred dino but you can change its look its height width but nothing to bad because if you cause the width to be to long it could cross so basically just like a character customization for dinos."
11579,all of my friends love ark it is not busted ass shit i promise i swear it is incredible
11580,Yes
11581,funny big dinosaur rapes your base and rapes your tames
11582,Personally I'd say the right server can make or break this game. Join a few Ark groups on fb and ask around to see what servers people are running and get yourself onto one of those for the best experience. I only have 300 odd hours on steam at the time of writing this but I have 2500 hours on console and it's a game I keep coming back to time and time again. If it's on sale then snap it up!

11621,"I got this game for free and I still feel ripped off. The game looks terrible. Not just graphically, but the dinosaur animations are awful as are the player animations. It has the worst UI out of any game I've ever played to date, and unfortunately even the gameplay is not enough to save it from all of these flaws (considering the gameplay is just as terrible as the graphics). Anyone who says that this game is good simply wasted their 2 hours of refund time trying to figure out how to play and are in denial, trying to justify their stupid use of money."

11629,very good graphics and in general very fun game to play and progress in but in exchange you do need to have good computer parts to run this game
11630,"Amazing game to play with friends or on your own. I've had it since release and there are not many survival games with level of depth that also measure up in fun vs frustration. It is very possible to have a minimal frustrations experience with this game & still measure out to hard core survivalist. Lots of Maps to explore (some of the best ones are actually the free ones!), caves to dive, Dinos to tame, bases to build & a endless level of freedom to put the cherry on top. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone in need of a special gaming experience.

-this is not a paid advertisement but it could be, looking @ you Wildcard"

11649,DINOSAUR
11650,I played this game back when it first released with a bunch of friends and it was a blast. And then i comeback into it in 2022 and its still a blast. Def a great game you can get lost in and spend some much time in exploring the different maps and new animals etc. I preferred this game to anyone that hasn't played it before because it def a experience to be had. Good solo or with friends.

11672,epic adventure game
11673,"Got the game for free, played only The Island on Single Player. Since it was free, I can't complain too much.
Overall is a nice experience: the level-up system is well balanced (you can reach Stone engrams in the first few hours of game and the grinding don't become boring quickly), the graphics are nice, the gameplay is kinda immersive and you get the ropes quickly.
Yes there are bugs like 
- your raft being stuck after you just spend 4 hours grinding the resources for a mobile home. BUT you can put dinos on your mobile home
- you put fur shoes and fur gloves and literally burn to death (even though you're in the edge of a SNOW MOUNTAIN)
- you die burnt/frozen even though you're GOD (console is full of fun commands)

Would recommend but not at full price

"
11674,"yes, very yes."
11675,"I played this game on many platforms because its one of my favorites. Playing this game on PC trumps all to me. It is so much fun with my friends. plus mods are great.

NOW as a game, if your into what the tags suggest then try it out. If your a new player watch some game-play first or you might find yourself being overwhelmed not knowing what to do. There are plenty of tutorials on the internet if you ever get stuck. I highly recommend learning how to use the mobile apps Dododex or SA Companion. It will calculate what you need to tame a Dino depending on its level and the servers stats (only vanilla creatures).

I strongly suggest you purchase this game because dinosaurs are sick. And riding dinosaurs is even sicker."
11676,have not played much but overall looks like a good game
11677,"While it may take some getting used to if you haven't played similar games like Rust or The Forest, Ark offers a wealth of exciting and unique content. Overall, a solid recommendation."
11678,"Usually i wouldnt go for old games but since it was free, i decided to try it out and  man it was worth it!"
11679,Well as long as you play single its fun. If you play PVE its also fun. PVP is excercise in futility.
11680,very good game!!!!!!!!

11686,"I've enjoyed over 1000 hours on this game, but sadly this game studio has decided it wants to support the murder of babies. I can't bring myself support this company anymore. The only thing I regret is that I didn't know this information sooner. If I knew that the money I was spending would be going to support something so evil I would have never spent a penny on this. Such a shame."
11687,"At least I got it on sale. Overrated, international collection of bugs"
11688,"I love this game, but it is terrible. It removes worlds, deletes characters, is a terrible multiplayer hosting nightmare, and it kills me to set any server up because It's system STINKS."
11689,If you are looking for a fun survival game then ARK is perfect for you. It is a fun game that has an exotic turn on the survival experience.

Additionally, instead of fixing their crappy bug-festival, they push several DLCs and decide they're going to toss this one away and make a new one. But hey, Ark 2 will have Vin Diesel!

The company is horribly managed and horribly out of touch with their audience. Insensitive and irrelevant political statements in the activity feed. For some reason the company finds it necessary to push statements on pride and abortion, even though they make a game about taming dinosaurs. 

Stay away. They don't care about you, they don't care about alienating their audience, and they just want your money."

"
11793,"     This game gives me a harder time to express my feelings about it, because there are some things that I don't like but a bunch more that I do!

     So lets get past the things I didn't like; grind. This game is all about grind, and dinosaurs which you will eventually tame take a very long time to pacify. Obtaining resources are made easier after some skills so it isn't awful in that regard but it gets harder when you progress Balance? The weapon system is really strange, as there are all sorts of factors and I remember finding a crossbow that was better than a whole assault rifle because of the stats it spawned with. This is because some blueprints you find have better stats, which is funny in some cases, but also quite annoying if you just figured it out after grinding a gun.

What I do like: SO MANY DINOSAURS. They are really cool, and I found it really fun to try out all the species. I'm sure there are plenty I haven't even seen, and they are not the easiest thing to fight if you are unprepared. Another thing I like: base building! This allows you to build an idea that you're dinosaurs are safe.

Overall, in terms of the game, I say you would have to fall into a niche category of dinosaur fan and survival game fan to fully enjoy this game. It is harder to have fun by yourself, and can get stale if you don't bring someone along. If you are thinking about buying this game, I would say wait for a sale or getting a good deal."

11825,I Love It
11826,This Game will bring you mental anguish and pain. Please don't play this game if you have any self dignity as this game will crush it and blow away the ashes. I got this game for free and was eager to play it but don't let it fool you steam is tryna get people to buy more game by destroying their minds to not allow them to think when it comes to buying games.
11827,"very cool

11828,Pretty Fun Game if you like grinding.
11829,this game is amazing espically when playing with playing fun mods like pugnacia and playing with friends can be a pain but can be fun
11830,I did very unholy things to a dead corpse
11831,I Still hate this game
11832,good
11833,I like the challenges seen in survival games like this. I dislike the lack of balance in certain areas; especially with a level based game like this. Example of my dislike would be a Parasaur being able to detect my sleeping character while I am offline. I think Parasuars should only detect aggressive threats. Otherwise it is fairly simple to stay beneath the radar and have fun
11834,"amazing game with amazing workshop mods
"
11835,great game really enjoy the versatility with all the mods
11836,Ark... nothing else be said other than it's a time sink.

11845,"I've put what I consider to be a lot of time into Ark, it is decently well made, has a lot of bugs, but fun to play with friends on a private server. I never considered writing a review as it would be much of the same as the other players, extremely grindy and time consuming, borderline life consuming. 

My reason for finally writing a review is to show my disappointment in wildcard studio for getting involved in political points. I don't care if you are for or against anything, but as a game company, you should not be trying to use your leverage on your players as a way to change the government in any country. Leave that to the actual citizens who vote rather than players who might have no clue on the situation."
11846,"This game just hits different negl, been playing since 2018. However just found out bosses and artifacts exist, that discovery made this game much better. Cheers to the creators"

11864,good.
11865,Its a very cool game but has lots of updates and takes up a lot of memory. A little expensive and will have some bugs but the game itself is really fun. I would say its worth it.
11866,I have wasted so much of my life on this game. Thru xbox and steam i have well over 10k hours. If you are in need of a game to waste time in this is the game to do it. With all the new maps since its launch this is a fun game. Sure it has its downsides and is a headach.
11867,can ride on big black lizards

11875,"Me and several friends and family members picked it up while it was free. We were all excited to try it out. Until Wild Card decided to go political on the Wade vs Woe supreme court decision. Removed this game from my account. I play for entertainment, not to enable you, or anyone else, to be a political platform. I am so sick of the political BS that is permeating the entertainment industry. I am very glad that I did not give you any of my money. Any Wild Card games is a no go for me now :("

11883,"You wake up on a beach with a crystal in your wrist and a pair of shorts. Then you get bombed by what you assume are seagulls til a giant turtle waddles past you with a white, clawed Big Bird in the treeline. Collect a herd of parasaurs, they all die, cry about it, tame more. Become obsessed with the game til your mother learns to stop trying to peel teenage you off it. Involve your friends and impress them with how quickly you can come up with half-decent names for your toothy children.

I had over 700hrs on Xbox. Beyond that, I had been following the game since it was still in beta. It's been absolutely beautiful to watch its growth and progress. I was fairly certain those early days, it was an indie game. Now? If you told me it was AAA or something, I wouldn't be able to argue. However, it's not entirely optimized, it will rain inside sometimes, you will think the difficulty is low enough and then lower it further just to be able to walk a few steps off the beach. The worst by far is how all the storyline Arks are paywalled as DLC."

11889,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

11953,"The game, like the devs is filled with toxic behavior. 

Stay out of politics when you don't understand what you are talking about WildCard, especially those involving the murder of babies. Murdering an unborn child does not infringe on American liberties,however abortion does infringe on the child's right to live. With today's oversexualized culture and easy access to contraceptives every woman has the ability and the right to choose whether to stay abstinent or conduct safe sex in the most effective manner they see fit. Birth control is practically a rite of passage at this point. Becoming pregnant and facing the reality of your choices does not and should not give the mother the option to end the unborn child's right to live and decide their own future.

11963,"I have spent hundreds of hours on this game on mobile, a few hours on desktop, and while it's a quirky, glitchy game, it's oddly hooking. ARK is fun in both single-player and multiplayer, and even more fun to just mess with. I quite appreciate the modability and community around the desktop version of ARK. 

While plain ARK does not have much story to it, the expansions bring more to it, and I imagine that ARK 2 and beyond will bring a lot more story to the game."

11965,GOOD
11966,"If you want to play this game for the PVE aspect it is, without a doubt, a tremendous experience. 
If you want to play this game for the PVP aspect it is, without a doubt, the worst, most hellacious, most incredibly vile, despicable, unbelievably horrid, astoundingly atrocious, disparagingly hideous, unthinkably unbalanced, severely broken, absurdly idiotic, indelibly repulsive, ineradicably misshapen, depreciatingly grim, utterly hopeless piece of garbage that you will ever have the misfortune of spending your time playing.
Stay the heck away from this game. It isn't worth a second of your time, not even a thought in your brain. You are better off doing anything else with your life. And I do mean anything. 
If you don't believe me, just wait. You will. 
The developers do not care about this game, they do not give two shits about cheating. Everyone who plays this game has modified their ini. No one is banned for it. Even streamers like Revpvp have an ini running when they play this game, without any repercussions. 
Not to mention that the game is so poorly designed that the texture, called mesh by those who play it, can often be glitched into, affording players a way to build an unraidable base that can't even be seen. Or, often as not, allowing them to raid your base through said mesh without you being able to do them a lick of damage. 
Want to watch weeks of hard work disappear to cheaters in a single instant? 
Want to see dinosaurs you've raised and bred die to enemies that you can't damage?
Would you like to have a dinosaur latch onto your head and force you to turn off your generators and open your base you've toiled for months to build so the attackers don't even have to be shot by your turrets that you farmed bullets for for months?
There is no balance to the bullshit, no recompense for your trouble. 
Save yourself all the heartache and stress and anger and frustration and just walk the eff away from this steaming hot pile of useless garbage that is this game. And don't look back. 

It won't be any better the next time around.

11986,"Despite how intriguing and cool this game COULD be, the developers lack of support and care for a lot of mechanics in this game make it a huge turn off compared to other glitchy yet fun building survival/craft games ie: The Forest, 7 days, Unturned, or even its sister game PixelArk. For a game that was released 7 years ago and little to no actual fixes to the building mechanics, survival mechanics, and crafting mechanics. This game is severely underdeveloped and poorly cared for by its developer team. Despite it having a decent sized player base because its a one of a kind game, I'm sure the developers think they can get away with being lazy and not putting in what needs to be done while they work on a new game, using a big name like Vin Diesel to support their soon-to-be cash grab. 2/10 for a game that could be an amazing experience with a lot of opportunity. Thankfully I got this for free but will not be paying for the sequel."

However I'm deeply disappointed in Wildcard bringing politics into the game.  There is simply no excuse other than trying to buy ""woke"" credit with this virtue signaling.  

My daughter and I are going to skip Ark2 and any of the DLC for the original due to this behavior.  We don't support companies like Wildcard who can't keep their political views out of everything they touch."

Pros:
-Graphically, looks nice
-A lot of things to do

Cons:
-Crafting recipes are WAY too expensive
-Dino's are way too difficult. I play with settings that basically make me as overpowered as I can be without god mode, and I still come nowhere near killing some of the alpha dinos, let alone the bosses unless I wanna spend hours taming and training an army of dinos.
-Tamed dinos are a PAIN to travel with. They get stuck on EVERYTHING and if you don't realise it fast enough, they're just gone. No teleporting them close to you if they get too far away, just gone.
-Inventory management sucks, as far as weight limits go.
-The ui is a maze of things placed in unintuitive ""folders"" that make no sense
-Everything wants to kill you, and they will. All at once. . . . .in about 5 seconds
-The quickest multiplayer option is a non-dedicated, locally hosted server, except that you are ""tethered"" to other players and they can't get more than about 500 meters away from you without hitting an invisible wall and being dragged towards you. While setting up a dedicated server fixes the tethering, be ready to either dish out cash to have one hosted for you, or spend hours upon hours downloading the files from steamcmd (I'm not kidding. I left it to download for about 8 hours before I finally gave up and canceled it,and I have no idea how close it was to being finished.)

Even if there were mods that fixed everything I listed (and everything I didn't) this game still wouldn't deserve a positive review as at it's core, it is a broken, buggy, unbalanced mess. Save yourself the anger and wasted time, play a game that's fun instead."

12027,"It's quite the challenge and I do like a challenge. The only things I do not like is the building mode.  I need to destroy something instead of being able to just move it.  The land is not flat and sometimes, the perfect spot for shelter wasn't perfect after all which means I need to destroy parts of the building to rebuild it. I can't put crates inside, they need to be outside, Placing objects can be difficult at times, for instance, I needed to stand outside my shelter just to place the bed inside the shelter. But hey, survival isn't easy right? lol. The little things will not stop me from playing."
12028,very nice
12029,ENJOYABLE TO PLAY
12030,"Ark is a great game with dinosaur taming, primitive stuff, guns and sci-fi stuff. lots of cool dinos and fantasy creatures. there is a sequel imminent (at the time of this review) hopefully its as good as this one."
12031,Great game when you finally can play it.
12032,I named my dino Terry. And screaming at him to back up from danger gives me great joy.

12034,its newbie friendly and its fun during all stages of the game
12035,"NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY. Official servers are Post Simulator 22. 
Spent the entire weekend hopping on official servers and didn't find one where some jerk had put up posts all along the starting area so no new bases could be made. 
Started a private/solo session and it was OK. Didn't know what I was doing, but you can't swap server types, so you have to choose official/private/solo and stick with it."

12041,The game itself is very enjoyable to play however I keep running into download problems where the game download drops to O mb/s I am no sure if it is my internet but other games and updates have not had this problem.
12042,yes
12043,"Wildcard ? More like Wokecard. 

Used to like the game. 

However, after Scorched Earth extension, it just became SO BAD. To the point when they have to take others modders map creation, and make it their own, deluding the players. Very poorly optimised, even the .exe application did not get a proper name ""ShooterGame.exe"", LOL.

Also, keep your political sh*t out of the game. Making you ok with k***ing children to be born, you can go to h€ll now. I'd rather keep my money and buy some guns. Could be useful some day."

12054,"The game gets overshadowed by being a dinosaur survivor game, by people saying it is a child's game due to their being dinosaurs in the game. But the game is a challenge and very fun. Most creatures want to kill and can kill you very easily, like ants. I've played the Xbox version of Ark for 17 days which is 408 extra hours spent on this game which I've not even had this game for a year, so it can be very addicting. I would expect for the next 2-5 years I would have spent more than 1000 hours on this game"
12055,good game sad for it's price
12056,gud gaME
12057,"I've been playing solo, but this game would most definitely be fun with 1-3 other people dedicated to playing with you. It's a little rough at the start, but once you start taming dinosaurs it starts becoming easier and easier."
12058,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
12059,"Its a pretty good game if you put enough time into it can be really fun
the only bad part is when you first begin and you have nothing so i highly recommend this game"

12103,"As many recent reviews have stated, politics are not to be mixed with gaming unless a game is a political commentary. After 1000 hours of support, I sadly must cut myself loose from ARK. As a recent announcement has stated, part of their sales will be donated to a slew of pro-abortion activist groups. This is not only a mistake on the part of the devs, but a mistake that they must learn from if they are to survive as a company. The simple truth is that most players do not wish to be making a statement on real world events with the purchase of a game. While it may not be to late for Wildcard to recover from this, by issuing and apology and delivering a solid ARK II, I fear this whole event may taint their storyline in the next game. As for my review, it may once have been a positive, assuming you can run it, but if you are looking for a survival game to get into that wont make a political donation, skip this one, and watch ARK II very carefully before you buy. May the public backlash be a lesson Wildcard, and may it teach you to follow the big rules of gaming companies.

12158,"I recieved the game during the giveaway, and was somewhat afraid to load it up as I've heard horror stories about the game's bugginess.

Turns out those fears were unwarranted, as I've encountered practically nothing worse than minor visual glitches or slight annoyances.  If this game is somehow more buggy than Skyrim, it must entirely be people whose PCs have no business running the game.  That or poor saps running the Windows build on Windows add OS complication BS to the mix to make it extra spicy, bug wise (running the Windows build via Proton has worked flawlessly so far).

So ignoring the bugs issue that frankly is vastly overblown...

ARK is a game where you play as a human whose combat abilities can be summed up as ""dino fodder"" at the beginning.  As you gain crafting recipes, you learn new recipes alongside increasing skills that allow you to survive for longer, as well as taming dinosaurs, birds, fantasy critters, sci fi beasts, robo-dinos, and whatnot, that further improve your ability to survive.  Taming is usually a pretty straightforward affair, being basically ""knock the sucker unconscious, then give it food before it wakes up"".  Some beasties however require other means for taming, especially some of the rarest and most unique from DLC maps.

The game, even at lower end settings, looks wonderful.  Only annoying thing is that reflections are always on and aren't terribly well done, but everything else looks fantastic.  I'd highly recommend spending a while tweaking configs until you've got the game running smoothly while looking good (protip: disable light shafts and bloom; they don't actually add true bloom or lightshafts, they just cause the game to run worse and look worse; also if everything looks blurry as hell, try turning on ""low quality streaming assets""; if loading from a slow HDD it may just take the game from ""ugly as hell"" to ""actually pretty nice looking"" as it drastically speeds up asset loading and makes the game buttery smooth at the cost of some prettiness)

In terms of how difficult the game is, solo-wise it's a nightmare at default settings.  However, virtually every aspect of timing, leveling, dino behaviors, and even natural phenomena can be tweaked on your singleplayer/LAN server, and I highly recommend cranking up the settings hard for your first time playing solo.  Once you've gotten to understand how the game works, feel free to neuter the settings for future playthroughs, or if you plan on playing online.

Speaking of online, the public servers are apparently a toxic mess.  While I haven't played on them or private servers, if it's as bad as the stories would have me believe, your best bet is to find a friendly non-official server with a small number of people, or even just play the game with IRL friends who you're cool with.  I'm assuming some of the bugginess can also be attributed to toxicity online and the netcoding being messy, which is a long way of saying ""stay off of large official servers if you value your sanity"".

For ""endgame"" content, after reaching a high enough level and obtaining relics strewn about each map, you can take on a ""boss dino"", which is different for each map.  Killing said boss dino is your ultimate objective, but it takes a loooong while to get the resources needed to not die, and/or the friends with enough gear to help you succeed.

I personally love that some of the dinos use famous dinosaur-themed sounds, like how raptors sound like a certain movie franchise's dinos.  Most critters have distinctive sounds, but outside of things like raptors, most of them are pretty standard for a game like this.

In terms of tutorial...sorry, there isn't really one.  You're thrown into the game and left wondering what the hell you need to do.  I'd normally be critical of this, but there are enough player made resources out there to drastically reduce the frustration level this would normally cause to not be as big a deal as it would be in other games.  Still, I would hope that Ark II would have an actual tutorial map/mission/whatever to help newbs not feel overwhelmed.

Music wise what's there is nice, but there isn't really much.  You do get more music when playing on official maps though, so there's that.

The lore of the game is introduced via ""explorer's notes"", which are scattered across the various ""story"" maps and together help paint a picture of what happened in the past.  They're nicely written and illustrated, but a bit of a pain to find.

Basically, the game's great.  At full price I'd be leery of it, but on sale, or when they gave away the game to literally everyone on Steam who paid attention, it's probably worth it.  I've already clocked in almost 45 hours in the past week alone, and actually lost sleep over it.  It's that kind of almost addictive quality."

i tried if last weeks when free. 

i regret of losing my time with this game. Is a bull s tt h i t 

the people are the worst nightmare, they dont let you in peace and you must start everyday all over again, everyday? NO!! Every hour!!!! if you're lucky."
12207,"I would only recommend buying this game if you can get it and all of its expansions for $15-20 total on a MASSIVE sale - and ONLY on the Epic store (more on that below). Even then, the general headache factor might not be worth it. You've gotta be a particular kind of masochistic. You will require a... particular set of skills.

The base game experience has always been pretty awful, but mods have been its (sole) saving grace... since day 1. Don't even consider playing on official servers; that's indescribably terribad (also since day 1) and the overall experience has only grown increasingly horrendous over time. Likewise, trying to play without a handful of critical QoL mods is nearly as much fun as getting a root canal.

On the other hand - IF you are very comfortable with using (and troubleshooting) mods in UE titles, and IF you are very comfortable editing massive .ini files in games, AND IF you play exclusively on private servers self-hosted either by yourself or by (good) friends, there is plenty of fun to be [strike]had[/strike] made. Most of the expansions are dumpster fire cash-grabs, so ignore those until you can get them all at 90% off or better. Until then, just download the free Ragnarok and Valguero expansion maps and play there whenever you outgrow the Island. The paid expansion maps are worth a brief foray eventually—just to tame certain overpowered dinos and unlock some character levels—when it's uber-cheap to do so, but they add very little collectively and can safely be ignored if you don't care about min-maxing every little thing. (You can also get mods for the aforementioned maps that add all remaining DLC dinos to them, which is an even better option).

What else... oh, yeah: play only with your friends and people you meet through them. Definitely stay away from the community in general. And absolutely ignore any form of official interaction or communication from/with Wildcard. They're both death sticks; they will make you want to go home and rethink your life. Don't peek your head out of friendly private server games for long, or you'll end up with ulcers and a bad taste in your mouth.

[hr][/hr]

Regardless, do NOT buy the game on the Microsoft store if you do decide to get it. That version of the game does not provide the option to self-host private servers (meaning you must pay out the ass to one of Wildcard's awful ""official"" hosts), does not support mods (though it is technically possible if the host will allow it, albeit with a massive headache factor), and does not allow multiplayer with Steam or Epic players. You'll be stuck playing with the 0.2% of the human PC gamer population who own that version of the game, and... ugh... [i]xboxers[/i]. *Shudder*. It's stupid. MS is even more stupid. Windows Store games are the stupidest. Avoid all of that stupidity like the plague that it is. 

[b]I'd also STRONGLY recommend that you NOT buy it (or anything else) here on Steam, either.[/b] Steam has grown to embody all that is wrong with PC gaming, and its interference in the industry is a major factor in PC game development continuing to devolve annually - increasingly favoring the quick turnaround of attention-deficit garbage instead of the interesting, quality products that gamers actually want to play. Notably, Steam is also increasingly stepping up their efforts to aggressively censor factual, useful reviews—like this one—as public perception inevitably continues to shift against their blatantly anti-consumer policies. Well-meaning gamers out to help their fellows avoid bad purchases are working against Steam's profit margins, and they'll only tolerate so much of it. 
As much as I hate Epic, in this case it is absolutely the lesser evil.

[hr][/hr]

Most recently, Wildcard decided to channel their development energy toward turning the game into a political platform. It's exactly as annoying and obnoxious as it sounds.

Astonishingly, (lol), the game is no more the better for it. 

Next update, perhaps they'll add a [b][i]""My game, my choice""[/i][/b] button to the dino-breeding UI, with a mouseover tooltip reading, [b][i]""I object to the circumstances under which this dinosaur egg was conceived and shouldn't be victimized by being forced to hatch it.""[/i][/b]

Hey, Wildcard! Here's an idea:

Support [b]gamers' right to choose[/b]... not to be subjected to obnoxious white-knight virtue-signaling and [i][insert trending SJW politic rhetoric here][/i] in our games and gaming forums. We have to deal with enough of that :poop: every day IRL, and it doesn't smell any less like :poop: coming from you.

I don't care what they are or which particular arbitrary way they're bent; take your politics and GTFO! :steamthumbsdown:

– [u]and, once you've done that, fix at least a couple of the worst 4-year old bugs in the game, maybe[/u]?"

It has many survival elements but unlike games like Rust you find yourself in a hostile enviroment that tends to encourage more friendly encounters with other players"

12234,UwU
12235,can be really laggy and you die 50 times before you can get a base but by god I can't stop
12236,"Very challenging! Potentially many hours to come.. i have over 110 hours but i'm still a noob; there's so much content... thank you for the base game. I am seriously considering buying some dlc to go with it. Can't wait for Ark 2!

I'm not interested in the PvP aspects, that's too hardcore for the likes of me (I love PvP but not this game) but playing with a few friends would be great in a co-op Pve way, so we can chill, relax, and enjoy, and take our time. It's the journey not the destination right?

Playing solo PvE is very engaging and I'm sure I'll get a thousand or two hours out of that alone as I like to take it slow and enjoy the ride. It's alot of fun building homes and bridges and whatever else or just go exploring (but watch your back and keep your SA at 100%), there's some savage beasties out there.

I love the fact that I built my first noob home out of wood and was progressing nicely WHEN some giant carnivore I think it was a Soro attacked and destroyed my wood base. It was freakin' awesome.

You'll see birds diving for fish, raptors eviscerating their prey, the wildlife is really cool.

To close, I love how 'long' this game can be, you really get good bang for the buck. It's a marathon not a quick 'wham bam 40 bucks please' cookie cutter garbage game. This game is really special and I'm glad I found it.

edit: I picked the base game up for free on Steam recently and in appreciation I intend to buy Ark 2 should it turn out to be comparable to the first."

Having been asked to support the killing of humans, I can no longer support these evil developers. I feel this was a direct deception of the puplic trust, so much so that it demands reparations.   Wow, yeah,  we should demand reparations in the form of our money back. Seriously, conning people into supporting breaking the law... Shameful, but when you add on that they want your money in order to kill people, well, yeah, I feel duped.   I want to be compensated for the 6000 plus hours I've spent supporting their HATE campaign against humanity. I supported ARK in it's infancy, perhaps I should have aborted it then......"

12267,"After trying to play this gave over the past several years, I would suggest you passing on this game.

Most every server is dead. You may find one of two LARGE players that are still on a map, but all the decent locations to build they have taken. most other locations you try to build they would have placed a few structures to prevent you from building. Sever lag is horrible on most every map some MUCH worse that others. Servers crash constantly and take about 15 min to restart, in several cases the servers will go down for days on. You must submit a lengthy ticket to WildCard and get no response.  Anything you tame dies after five days of not logging in, even if the server is down and you receive no notifications the server has returned to an active status.
This game is riddled with exploits and has no moderators on most servers. I see constant grieving or newer / smaller players such as single players to friends that are trying to play the game by much larger groups just for the fun and entertainment of the larger group. Although multiple reports were send it over weeks due to clear violations of the game rules and harassment policies, not a single care was given by the WildCard employees. No even a follow up to anyone of the people that filed the complaints.
As you trasnfer from one type of server to another to farm resources or tame new dinos, you stand a huge chance to by kicked out of your own tribe due to a server glitch and loose everything you have worked so hard for over you life in the game. and again.... WildCard will not assist you with this. They will tell you that""Sometimes"" the servers glitch and ""things happen""  ""Sorry for your loss"" and end the response. 

PVP is riddled with players using Aimbots, meshing hacks, or just one shot your base due to a new hack they find, and the admins do little to nothing to stop this much less slow it down. 
PVE larger player tribes will place hundreds of dinos around smaller players bases preventing them from being able to play if the smaller player does not give way to the larger player and give the larger player everything they demand. This goes unchecked on most servers with again.... no admins.  WildCard will openly tell players  ""Sorry, we do not support your server any longer, but is you leave everything you worked for behind we can start you on one of our new maps where we do offer limited moderation. 

Over the past months Wildcard has been pushing controversial political agendas in the discord as well as in the game itself. I am one that plays a game to get away from life and politics, I do NOT want those being forced on me in a game. regardless if I agree or disagree with the topic or not.  Please just let us all be humans that want to have fun and find friends. 

Take it from someone that has spent thousands of hours trying to overlook all the game flaws as well as listened to all the games community managers try to tell me the game will get better soon... Just to watch every update make the game slower, cause more lag, cause multiple other issues in the game, just to have another update released a few days later to cause again.... more issues.

Save your money, This is a dying game that very few play for any length of time anymore. servers lag often making it difficult to play."

12280,"honestly starting and leveling is great after you figure out what you need. but its impossible to build in most areas due to pillars being placed everywhere  by other players, you also wont survive in most spawn areas due to higher level stuff constantly roaming and taking you out in a few hits even if you try to run. 

graphics and potential are a 10/10
actual gameplay as a new person is 2/10

as mentioned due to the pillars stretching for miles outside bases it isnt worth playing this game or buying it. save yourself the money or time.

edit. still hard no on online stuff without a server for friends but single player is 100x better and sadly more fun. you can survive with almost no effort and slowly build up with no rush or giant things bashing your house down and poisoning you or eating you only to camp your base and corpse making you incapable of reclaiming everything and starting from scratch for the dozenth time"

Unfortunately, building, combat, and just about everything else feels very early access but they are already advertising Ark 2 soooo ... yeah.

Although there're two things I must tell you before you buy; First of all, try to play with friends, especially for your first play-through. Second of all, I must warn you that the game may require a lot of messing around in the settings to get it to run well(this being partly due to the hardware I'm using, but is still a bit of a problem regardless). Other than those two minor issues I had at the beginning, I've had very few serious problems with ARK! In other words, I definitely recommend! One last thing though, I did receive ARK for free, but I'd still buy it if it wasn't."

I will also never support this game or this company ever again.  Stay out of politics and stick to something you're at least mediocre at, developing games."

With some focused tweaking for playability this game could have hit higher spots on the game charts.  The game gets really good after some tweeking in private mode or on a private server.  

I think the game is also loosing money by not having official private servers for rent."

When it does work, the mouse frequently won't stay active on the client and I have to do a mouse ""frenzy"" to get it recognized again by the client. Also, other apps are being randomly launched so also probably due to the mouse issue. Looks like a fun game but these issues make it somewhat unplayable on Mac OS."

12387,"Awesome game
"
12388,"While the premise is interesting this game suffers heavily from poor execution on both a technical and game mechanical level. 
Outside of performance problems most recurring issues I faced revolve mainly around dinosaurs (pop-in when exploring, them getting stuck on terrain a lot or straight up falling out of the world upon leaving a cave and general dino AI issues like them becoming unresponsive and not reacting to whistling) and building (clunky placement, the tedium of having to craft all parts of the build individually and the high resource requirements for crafting things in general).
Progression is heavily based on grinding to a point where you basically grind one thing to unlock being able to grind another thing. The engram system can be very awkward especially with how saddles are distributed among the unlockable recipes. I very often had the issue that could tame a certain dinosaur long before getting a saddle for it which made a lot of them rather pointless (for instance I managed to tame a Baryonyx quite early into the game but while following me around it died to getting stuck on terrain). In other cases early unlocks included saddles for dinosaurs I never came across while playing.
Overall the only well executed aspect of this game is the visuals of the dinosaurs. While they may not be scientifically accurate they are not over the top and very distintictive. It was fun to discover new types of dinosaurs and on many occasions I was able to spy one in the distance and correctly guess what it was by dusting off the remains of my younger selfs interest in dinosaurs.

Hopefully Studio Wildcard will focus on just doing their job and release quality product on time with Ark 2, but if past is prologue, Ark 2 will be late and lacking features.  It won't be until the modders fix their product for them, that Ark 2 will be hopefully something special. 
Their are plenty of other quality survival games being developed by studios that focus on just the game and listening to their communities. I would rather support those developers."

Visually, this tops off anything I have seen before, Just the fun to be able to wander maps (0 challenge level) is worth the while.

12446,"Whoha. A game that make my graca roar (RTX 2070 super oc). Even though imo the graphics are just acceptable, even on high. Sadly the graphics become TERRIBLE as soon as you wanna try to increase the life-time of your gear just a little bit. 

The welcome by this anticheat blah blah was already a VERY bad sign, when I started the game. Yea, I knew already this is just another multilamer game. But WTF does studio wildcard think they are, asking me to install their BS, before they know if I wanna play online at all? This game is marked as singleplayer. So give paying customers a choice BEFORE you decide to crap up their system! 

So a bad starting position for the game. 
After I found my way through the menus (and hopefully successful disabled the multicamper crap) I qickly constructed a new Char (easy work, thats a plus point) and started the game.
Without reading any tutorials, I quickly found out, that I don't have any clue who I am, what happened or wtf is this diamond in my arm. 
Only minutes later I found out, that I can't kill every creature with bare hands (but the poor party-dodos - don't ask me, what they are celebrating with their funny party hats on) but I can smash whole trees into dust. 
So I ran around absolutely planless smashing the ""interact-button"" to collect 100 items per minute. A whole mountain of stones and other stuff.
After I died a couple of times by suicide and by unfriendly nature, I found out, everything collected stays collected - but unluckily not in my pokets (the ones of a nude human, lol).

After a while I even found out, how to enable stuff to be crafted. Sadly not how to craft it. ...or how to sleep. or anything else. 
After all of that I found out, there is a kinda tutorial somewhere hidden in the menus. But I already had enough ""fun"".
Absolutely not worth more than 120 GB!!!!!!!!  Yes, you read it. Onehundredtwenty GIGABYTE! 

Alltogether this game is so much fun, of course I recommend this game! As sure it is only 60 GB big. Ha ha. ;)"

Im not going to even touch the broken state of PvP that is controlled by several groups that completely wipe newbies no matter where on the map they are.

The game is fun and novel. It quickly goes away if you try to grind for decent stuff. Maybe Ark 2 will fix these problems, we'll just have to see."

Good parts:
+ The world is pretty and nicely detailed, starry nights being the most beautiful part of the nature and the dinosaurs look lovely too.
+ Lots of stuff to do, it is not too boring.

Bad parts:
+ The game is clunky and buggy beyond belief. It feels like it was brought together using sticks and rubber tape. UI glitches and artefacts are disturbing.
+ Dinosaurs might be pretty, but oh how dumb they are. Running circles around you and ignoring entirely just to rip into parts at a random moment. But maybe that is by design.
+ It is not terribly engaging and in many ways feels half-baked, like an alpha version of a game concept.
+ It takes way too much space on the disk.

That's it. For free it is lovely and awesome, but I would ask money back if I bought it."

"
12506,"wouldn't recommend. most of this game involves dying and getting back what you lost, and after enough time it becomes mind numbingly boring to lose one of your animals and have to get a new one just so you can lose it again later. its only fun in the early game when you get to have fun taming the dinosaurs.

the most fun of the game is progressing through the levels and making new items like crossbows or guns, but the big problem is the constant annoyance of not having enough engram points, losing said items and having to spend such a long time getting back to the point you were at. another thing that's completely ruined most of the experience is the ridiculous 'ascendant items' that completely ruin the flow of the game, mainly because the way you get these is either by standing on a rock with a crossbow or bow and shooting it, with no risk for you or by opening boxes that are locked by level, getting you a pump shotgun that can pretty much kill everything in one shot to one clip (six shots) which is insanely overpowered and means one of the more powerful enemies, the rex, is made incredibly easy to defeat, almost entirely making anything annoying because it is terrible in comparison. anyway, i give this game 2/5 stars, only because the views in the game are alright."
12507,I'm convinced the positive reviews for this game are bots. This game is laughably bad. No wonder it's constantly on sale or free.
12508,"Shitty game, let's not forget these are the people who sold DLC for a game while it was still in early access. I hope you get to scam just as many people with your 2nd installment as you did the 1st."

12511,"I've enjoyed the game for many years, bought it for my kids and hosted servers together, the game has some issues but overall is an amazingly fun time.  If you have no politics then its a good purchase, if you have no ethical stances unaligned with Wildcards then its a good purchase.  

Sadly the company has come out as a politically woke and donates income from its sales of their games to political organizations that support practices that are at the least, divisive socially.

Sadly this means purchasing their games or products, as they've publicly announced their actions and intentions, means supporting their political causes directly.  If you support those causes then this is a great way to get politically responsible, if you don't then its unethical to promote or purchase these products any longer.  

I personally wished my gaming space to be free of such division and strife, I've long found games a middle ground to reconnect socially after arguments and fights with friends over the years, finding common ground to build on.  I guess the world and corporations have moved on from these safe spaces though and laid down their political axes to grind so grind away I guess."

12513,"Sorry, but I have zero tolerance for games that expect you to not just know that you need to make a campfire, but also how to actually make it. And once you do manage to figure that out, how to use it. Make a tutorial available for those of us that might enjoy it, if we could just figure out how to actually play. My autism goes in 100 different option directions all at once and blocks me from enjoying the game!!

And what is with going to the trouble of getting the items required to craft some thing. Crafting it. But not actually getting the item. Is that some pathetic bug, or a stupid game feature!

I accidentally demolished a floor section instead of a wall section. This floor section had a large cupboard on it, completely full of stuff. Now it gone, along with everything that was in it.
Placing roof pieces on angles is very hit or miss. More trouble than it's worth, to get creative.

ATV's are useless. No steering and no reverse. Went partially up a rock face. Now it's stuck there for ever. 
 
Imbeciles made this crap. Your campfire runs out of wood. So of course, rather than being able to simply put more wood on it. It is that dark, that you can't find it. Guess what happens next. You freeze to death!"

12523,I'm so glad I didn't pay for this
12524,"Very cool game I bought it on xbox on its release, I recently got it on steam, cant wait for ark 2"
12525,Dinosaur
12526,ass
12527,baru maen udah banyak yang punya tex
12528,The game has lost their way. Will be uninstalling and not purchasing any additional of their titles. Keep to just gaming guys.
12529,good.
12530,"As a newb I was concerned I wouldn't be able to play, but even i picked it up pretty quickly. Plus, my partner who is an avid gamer enjoys playing it too. Great game for all skill levels. I will say though, the optimization is rough; one update should not need a gig of space."
12531,ok so i have been using steam for a long time and its very disapointing how i have triple the space the game needs and it still needs to reserve pace and its taking forever to update its pritty lame how i have a custom built pc that can run any game with no problem and download any thing fast with no problem so there for if any one can help me i would really like it and if it aint me which i know it aint me then steam and the devs need to figure it out plz help!!!!!!!!
12532,w
12533,"Good so far, just kind of confusing"
12534,"The linux version is all but abandoned.
Even with steamplay, even getting into singleplayer is tempermental.
If you have a system that's not windows, you will not be able to play this game (even if stated otherwise)"
12535,Dino roar
12536,I've been playing on Xbox since it came out before I got it on pc its a very good game and you will get addicted
12537,"You're a video game company, leave your politics out of it. We all know the reason you support ""women's rights"" for abortion is because yeeting the fetus is cheaper than your company paying maternity leave."
12538,better then stumble
12539,"I love Ark but not your typical Ark player..
i Love playing ark for the freedom of building and the ability to completely change the settings.
for example, i super boost leveling for more weight so i don't have to spend as much time grinding and i can leave the surrounding landscape natural to make very nice looking homes/bases and or even raft builds.
Ark is one of the best building survival games out there IMO but there's so much more for anyone. pvp with everything from melee , gunfights, explosives to dino fighting. incredibly underrated game.
since i discovered mods, i came to pc as i have more than thrice the hours on on console than i have on here.

highly recommend!"
12540,Great game loved it i have only played it a total of 5 times but it is already second on my most played at 28 hours
12541,Developer adamantly pro child murdering.
12542,"It's fun for a minute, but quickly just turns into a grindfest. Most times I've died in the game are because the game glitched. The installs and updates take on average 4 times longer than a game of comparable size. This is not a good game, but it's got cool moments. I cannot recommend this game by any means. I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT IT TAKES TO INSTALL IT."
12543,I could NEVER support a company that supports murdering babies.  Modern science has proven that a life is a life at conception and Wildcard says we should have the right to kill babies based on convenience.  If you're against killing babies this company has openly stated they give funds to fight FOR abortion.
12544,dinosaur is good
12545,"this game was very good and fun until people and politics came along, i don't understand why everybody nowadays has to get so involved and heated over every little thing that happens. a few weeks ago was the lgbtq pride month thing and personally i'm the type of person who says ""what happens in the bedroom stays there and nobody needs to make a big deal about it"" well now things are starting to become a big deal and ever woke bloke and their mother is now trying to jam it down our throats as consumers. GET WOKE, GO BROKE!!!!!!"
12546,it  a good game to play
12547,So fun to play if you play with others!
12548,yes
12549,dinosaur survivalmmorpgsandboxexplorerhackandslash fun
12550,I fought several dinos as soon as I woke up with my bare naked body. The bugs aren't friendly. My friend said some dinos are friendly. He lied. 10/10 don't spend your money on this game where you constantly get raped in the first 5 hours of gameplay.
12551,very good
12552,"I've played this game for several years and only recently got it on pc. I enjoy this game even more with mods, but even after over 1200 hours of play I still cannot be bored by the pvp adventures, and goofing around in pve. This is my second favorite game of all time second only to terraria."
12553,Better for people that like playing long-sessions at a time.
12554,best game!
12555,god or what

12563,its fun
12564,bloody amazing game
12565,Really fun game to play with friends. Love taming dinos and going on cave adventures.

12568,"Honestly, the game is really fun. Even better with friends. SO good in fact that when ark 2 does release I will most likely be one of the first to get it. 10/10 would recommend to everyone who likes survival with extra steps."

12579,its an amazing game if you like building crafting and taming although there are bugs and stuff the pros far outweigh the cons
12580,"Survival, building and dinosaurs sounds like a wicked combo, but I've tried it twice now only to stop about 30 minutes in, It just feels clunky all around. Combat is floaty and hitboxes are weird, the vivid colours and the motion of the camera actually gives me a headache and I'm not typically sensitive to this stuff. 

It looks nothing like the trailers. But hey, I got it on a free weekend so... It's also a 200 GB download. 

I think Valheim and/or Conan is better executed, personally. But I really want to love this concept."

12583,really good game can someone give me point please!!!!!!
12584," good game  but wise they   make adjusments seems like they force you to tame  dino to get any where wise more a  gameplay choice still a good game

12591,"Fun game, but can be hard at time and does take a good amount of time. Great game to play with a lot of friends."
12592,k
12593,Once in the game it is entertaining.  THere is  challenge involved with almost all the activities.  I find It just plain fun.  I do have a problem with getting into the game.  So far I am only able to connect on the coat  tails of a friend.  Hopefully that will be remedied soon.
12594,"Somehow, through its bugs, hands down the best game i have ever played. I own the XBOX one version as well, but the mods on pc are amazing. My only complaint would be the Official Pvp servers, they suck unless you are on 24/7. I mostly like singleplayer since I can choose my mods, so I don't mind too much. Even with this game eating half my external drive, I always return to it when other games can't provide the fun experience of ARK: Survival Evolved."
12595,"Absolute worst building system I've ever had to try and use. Hours of frustration and seizure inducing placement previews for the whole family.

The Dinos are kinda cool though."
12596,noice
12597,actually goated wit the sawce no cappa
12598,"Love this game so much! Tons of fun-building, taming, breeding, exploring etc.  Private servers with mods make it even more fun. 5 stars!"

12607,Love the dinos :)
12608,This game is amazing but it's so massive. I need to get more storage to hold all the dlc.
12609,"Solo play for ark survival evolved is excellent. After you play the game you can change almost any setting for the gameplay desired. Taming rates, gathering rates, experience rates, damage done, damage received and so much more to keep the game interesting and easier for solo play. There are so many good maps you are free to do what ever you desire. I love ark and look forward to ark 2's release. Keep up the good work devs i have a 1000 hours in game and am still hooked!!"
12610,Dinosaur can make babies good game.
12611,A good game that punishes you if you leve your house.

12615,This game is somewhat fun but is also buggy as heck.

12624,"This game is absolutely void of Quality of Life features. You feel that the devs didn't put any love or though into it, just wanted to make money. You miss features in every corner of the game. I got it for free and feel robbed.

- Why can't I cancel current crafting progress?
- Why doesnt clip half the objects to other objects?
- Why is the building system so fucking awful compared to games like Valheim?
- Why is there a tube system which is fucking horrendous to look at? Why even bother?
- Why can't you rotate things which you wanna place?
- Why cant you call back dinos if you set them to wander and ignore signals? Why is one of the main features of the game so fucking barebones after all those years?

It's just so fucking void of Quality of Life features that it feels like a game just recently released in early access. Man I feel so robbed"

12631,I got the game when it was free and when it stopped being free it wouldn't let me enter to ARK so I decided to buy it and when I bought it I still couldn't play it it said error
12632,"lovely
"
12633,cool shit
12634,.
12635,"Definitely the best Dino game. It's really a pleasure and enjoyment to play this game alone and even more with friends. There is a bit of a learning curve but bit of commitment and few tutorials on YouTube are enough. I really recommend this game, it's great for killing time even tho it can be challenging at times."
12636,"I just started on the island and so far so good. I've died to various circumstances. (Totally not my fault I swear)
In one instance I found myself caged in by some high rocks while an over amorous turtle wanted to have a talk with me. The relationship did not end amicably. He won in the divorce and took everything. I learned a lesson that day. The rock and a hard place idiom will never be the same.

I moved on fairly quickly and found some new friends, made a garden, built a cute little house, and started to more than reclaim what I lost. Now I am flying high, keratin rich. 

for anyone new to ark like me, it can be a hilarious blast. The frustration just makes it better because sometimes the situations we find ourselves in are hilarious. Sure it can be a grind, but it's worth it. 

Mind this is single player and there is a learning curve when it comes to both visual and general settings, but it's not that bad at all. I play on a lap top and use Nvidia Experience to boost my game. At first I didn't like the look but I was being silly. Once optimized the maps are beautiful. 

As for the servers? I can only wish you luck and good fortune. No matter where you go PVP is brutal. I lean more towards PVE. Still challenging but worth it. 

One of the best time sink games I have played so far. (Plus the community isn't so bad. It's always fun to see what new creations they come up with next.)

12668,finna end it
12669,I love the survival aspect of this game and the fact you can tame almost all dinos in this game. Overall it is honestly one of my favorite games of all time and I strongly suggest you get it.

12689,"Ill make this short this game will suck out your soul and hours of sleep, once you start down the rabbit hole its hard to get out, while it says i have 226 hours that amount is doubled on other places. Great game sell your soul and play it."
12690,"This is my first ever review on steam but I feel like I have to tell you that this game is so not worth it.
Ark is the first game to make me so mad, like really mad. I was so excited to play this with two of my friends BUT 1st of all, it takes ages to download. It completely consumes your storage for literally nothing.

2nd: I came to the game completely clueless, I never watched Ark content neither did I know what it was about and it should stay like this. The game explains nothing. NOTHING. I tried to figure out how to craft something for straight half an hour (without watching a video obviously).

Then, 3rd point: the next hour I kept dying. CONSTANTLY. It was a never ending loop. Dying, respawning, dying, respawning... And somehow I managed to escape this loop and found a place to build a little base. All was fine and I even enjoyed the game after surviving the first 2 hours that were the WORST 2 hours I had in a game. BUT the happy time was over quite fast because when I had some stuff gathered, some mf raptors showed up and killed me in like 3-4 hits and destroyed my whole base. So again I ask myself how does it come that there are only dinos out there that can kill you in literally one second and are so much stronger
and faster then you. There is no balancing.

My last point: Why cant I play with my literally only two friends on a private server????? Why do I need to spend extra money on this crap??? Even the undedicated server (or whatever it is called) is not working. It brings me to an window where I cant do anything except closing the game.

So yeah I hope you did not spend any money on this crap. I luckily did not.
I will definetly not play this any minute longer, there are so much more nicer games out there and I need my storage space for these. So I will uninstall it.

I'm sorry for the long review but yeah, worst game I played in my entire life.
(pls ignore typos, english is not my native language)"
12691,very good graphicxs and tons of mods to make it your own game
12692,i love ark due to the best of the best maps and ive never had so much fun in such an open world map. the only downsie is the updates.they take forever.
12693,game is so great
12694,good
12695,its awesome
12696,"Ark is a pile of shit. The developers do NOT fix the bugs in the game and there are so so many. Instead of trying to fix them to make the game more enjoyable, Wildcard decides to push out more content with more bugs. 
Now
All that being said. You are either going to love this game or absolutely hate it. There is no inbetween. I really enjoy this game i am a huge dinosaur nerd so i think its very cool. I also think its very fun though. Sure ark is very pricey, but you dont need to buy ANY of the dlc since there is so much free content available in the game. Yes it is repetetive Yes it is grindy But youre always welcome to make this game your own you can add any mod you want at any time you can adjust every single setting and make it enjoyable to you. 
Even if you dont want to play the game as intended there are admin commands  that just let you do Whatever you want  you can literally spawn a level 1 million dodo if you really want to and just have it reck shit. 
I enjoy this game so I reccomend this game."
12697,This is a great game to play and grind with friends not the best game to play solo unless you like dying and not progressing but other than that this game is awesome my friends and i have been playing for a week and already have over 40 hours on this game so much to do and grind for we haven't even finished the first map and there are still so many more for us to continue the grind.
12698,100

12703,hahahahahaha dino goes auurggghhhhh
12704,"Ark: Survival Evolved is a very addicting and immersive first and third person survival game based on life with dinosaurs, where you can kill or tame these fantastic beasts of the past. Ark: Survival Evolved offers a single player experience, where you have the whole map to yourself to conquer, tame, and slay with only the help of your tames, or you could choose a multiplayer PVP or PVE experience with other players logged on to the same server as you."

12721,"learning how to play this game isnt easy but the sense of accomplishment  you get when you get pretty good and make your base and get some bad ass dinosaurs is by far the best feeling ive had in a while,  played on console but on pc it looks and runs way better 10/10 would play again."

12740,Game is probably great in MP with firends but if you play it in Singleplayer it is an annoying grind and very frustrating when you get killed by wildlife.
12741,Never in my live have i suffered through a more brain numbening expierence than this
12742,the most bugged game
12743,Best game in the world
12744,amaing game but once u finish a single map and u try playing other maps u find it meeh a copy paste here and there even if there are new creatures and stuff i dont know i feel like the 1st time u play it is very special and fun .

12749,"Of course this is my opinion, many are free to disagree! Obviously the community is quite large. I wish I could give a neutral option, I really do. But if pressed for how I lean, truly, then I have to say no for recommending.

I've put countless hours into this game. I really love it for everything it *could have* been. But, in my experience, mods shouldn't be the thing that makes your game the most enjoyable. The defaults on this game are dumbfounding. Its obvious that Wildcard is improving, see: the genesis expansions..
But why not balance your game better and make sure that it isn't so frustrating to play on alone and brand new before doing all the DLC? Optimization? Whats that? So many QoL things that are just lacking entirely.
Some players really like the weird jank and work around the systems rather than with them, I think that's totally fine. But my take is that its offputting to be playing against the game and deliberately fing around to do things in a way that isn't frustrating as hell.
If you want to play with mods, are fine with checking a wiki for unstated info (If you don't want to facecheck every mechanic), and have a friend or two to play this with, then sure, I think it can be for you. But I can't in earnest recommend this game unless you get it for free or you are very sure that the weird janky parts are something you can love despite it all.

tldr: I really love this game. Its not really as good as it had promise to be. If you've got friends, patience and you look at this game and REALLY think you'll like it even despite any weirdness in mechanics, well, why are you looking at reviews then?"
12750,yes
12751,"I honestly thought this game was horrible and never played it before the free to own weekend. I saw it was free, and instantly got it, thinking ""well, lets give it a shot.."". Glad to say I was quite wrong. Game is a lot more fun then I expected. even though i have yet to work up the courage and play multiplayer. I have played it everyday since then and have yet to find fault with the game with the exception of getting merked by therinozaur within the first 45 min of gametime. Highly recommend it. Its Minecraft with dinos and guns. what else could go wrong?"

I must say getting a flying animal like a pteranodon or an Argentavis has probably been the most enjoyable part for me so far however I know there is so much more to the game and can't wait to continue playing and discovering more!!"

12781,"Oh wow. So this is a very good game, you might rage a little after you die the first coupe thousand times but you'll get the hang of it. Takes up like 200 gigs but i don't mind. Gameplay 10/10. Lag: Yes. Beefy Computer: A Requirement, Unless you want to run on terrible graphics. Wish that you could connect to other people via hosting, those who are not using steam to play are able to connect that feature would be nice. 
So overall 9/10, one point deducted because of the various problems described. I will 100% change it if the multiplayer thing is added."

12786,"On the surface this game is fun and addicting, but after losing so much of my hard earned items time and creatures do to bugs in the game and server lag, I can't recommend this game in conscience to anyone unless you are a masochist. I am a late-comer to this game so as many years as this game has been out to still have this many alpha and beta level bugs is unacceptable. For example: there is a feature in the game where if you die, you are supposed to see a red X on the map to show where your body is to give you a chance to to go and salvage your items and any tamed creatures you had with you. however, apparently there is this issue where sometimes it arbitrarily just does not show up, for no apparent reason. This is basic game dev 101, not something that should still be an issue this many years and expansions into games lifecycle. That being said the actual game and mechanics and depth are great, so if you are cool with spending 40 hours+ days/weeks/months taming and leveling up a pet dinosaur, only to lose it all when the game inevitably decides to bug out at random, then by all means, have at it. You think may think, well that was a one off, that was a once in a lifetime glitch, and computer is super fast and you have a top tier internet speed... nope, it doesn't matter these glitches are running rampant, they are NOT rare, they are the norm. I am uninstalling now, I just wanted to try to save you from wasting your time and DEFINITELY don't pay anything for any of the newer premium DLC, that only encourages the devs to keep churning out new maps without fixing the bugs in the core gameplay. Rant over, Good luck!"

12810,fun game and can be hard at times
12811,cool dodo
12812,"It's a love-hate relationship, Ark is amazing don't get me wrong we all know its faults and strong points. But I can guarantee you'll fall in love with the game once you get passed all the bugs, oh and the crashes which most have been patched It becomes a whole experience. You will find many beta males on here who get salty when you raid them so do bask in their failure for not making a decent defended base!!!!"
12813,"its a very good game, for single player and multiplayer.
very fun, do recomend"
12814,SSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
12815,"this game itself is good, its just the updating, optimization and other shit. its genuinely so annoying. i tried reinstalling the game and it kept pausing, same thing w the updates. also dlc problems too. i tried installing dlc and it says that i have it but i dont have it??? theres so much shit its actually fucking aggrivating and insane."
12816,ok
12817,Good Game

12819,funny dino game mods go brr
12820,"Very gud game!

But not when you get ARK'ed :P"
12821,"soooo where do i begin. I would say it is worth buying if you like any of these things
-Dinosaurs
-Survival Games
-Base Building
-Genetic Tinkering
-Dropping poor souls from high altitude
-Caging helpless people
-Breaking out of cages
-Dieing in some of the most suprising ways
-PvP that is hilarious, furious, and confusing all at the same time

Probably not your game if any of the following applies
-Hates dinosaurs
-Don'd like to learn a bunch of different dinosaurs abilities
-Have any form of heriditery addiction traits and do not have 40 hours a week to play
-Want to keep health relationships
-Want a structured and guided play though

Overall can easily put in 200 hours just exploring the new dinos and areas so imo easy to get your money out of it."
12822,Good game just eats ur disc space

Optimazition is trash and for some reason this game with all of its DLCs is like 400GB (how?!). I've played so far only pvp and I have to say that most of the servers are trash with trash ping and game does not react the way it should. Absolutely horrible experience

12900,"It seems more like a proof of concept, or an early access build, despite now being years old. It seems pretty all over the place with ideas, balancing, themes etc. In some ways this creates variety, keeps the game fresh and helps the game in a lot of ways. But hurts it in just as many, especially with balancing and power creep. Hopefully ARK 2 provides a more polished, and well rounded experience. Still enjoyable to those willing to put in time. Not worth the price tag normally, but on sale or for free (which it is currently) it's a much easier sell in my opinion.

Was also quite nostalgic since I grew up loving dinosaurs, but lost interest as time went on. So coming back to ARK reignited that interest in some ways."

12947,"Frustrating at times and the official servers suck, but with some basic knowledge you can make a world you actually enjoy to be in or join one that is. Gather, breeding, and maturation rates need to be pumped slightly more than official IMO to keep it from really feeling like a fat waste of time if you lose everything. As you will lose everything. I used to be mad at Wildcard for the shit service of the official servers, but at the end of the day they give you the tools to, like I said before, make a world you actually enjoy to be in. With the thousands of unofficial servers you don't even have to go through the effort of trying to configure a world you want to play in. Dinos, survival, fairly extensive building, bosses, and exploration. There's even a story connecting it all if you really feel so inclined to find it all out. It can seem like long and hard work but in the end I think it's worth it. At least I'm hoping so. My steam hours aren't reflective of my all time play, but I still haven't ascended or even gone through a complete cave yet. Hours upon hours wasted for what feels like nothing, and yet the game keeps calling me back... I just want to feel satisfied finishing what Wildcard has to offer, spending probably over the last decade or so making and polishing this tool for the community to enjoy. I truly believe, as of now, I will be when I get there. I will update when I have become worthy..."
12948,Game is good
12949,"Note to beginners: Ark is a good game, and if your going to purchase it just know this, Ark isn't about fun dinosaur riding and meeting nice people, Ark is a game that requires grinding, not big grinding just a bit of grinding, even with cheats it takes a bit. Ark is a fun game, but its also a novelty, sometimes you'll find something fun to do in it, then after that you realise it becomes boring again. Ark has a ton of fun things to do, but also it has a ton of boring things. Arks a bit of a rollercoster, but buying ark is not a choice for me to make, its your choice. If you want to have fun with dodos and t rexes! Maybe buy it! But once again it's not my choice to make."

Ark also goes on sale a lot, so if you plan on getting it, you should wait for it to go on sale, I got it for free because the sale was 100% off. Edit: I used to play all the time on Xbox on Non-dedicated servers, steam ark is WAY better."
12978,this game has so many things to explore

13000,it is fun
13001,"Only get it if you enjoy a mod community that takes better care of a game than the actual devs.
ARK is the exact definition of ""A buggy mess"" and the devs only add more and more(From new maps. new creatures, new items, etc...) and fix absolutely nothing.  Lost Island for example, the water has been broken since it's release(Water is visually there, but the asset is missing) yet despite the many complaints, the devs have yet to give a simple patch to fix the issue.  That among every other bug in this glitch/game break museum of an app, it's just not worth the money they're asking......"

13044,"I love the first person action game play, it makes you feel part of the game and more realistic. In 1st person watching a really big dino coming at ya with their big teeth glaring puts you on the edge of your seat for sure.
 With so many mods available you can do anything you want, from building little villages, pretty little dino collections, or building gigantic castles even having godly creatures that swoop down and clear the map of any other dinos, Up to heart stopping moments when you're being eaten alive in a boss fight. 
 The game can be both really frustrating but also really rewarding."

13113,i love riding monkeys!!!!!!
13114,So much to do.
13115,"I actually cant believe im just now playing Ark this year, having looked at it for a long time it was a no brainer to claim it for free when I could, this game is honestly pretty great.
The graphics are pretty beautiful to look at, and as long as you have a sense of adventure and curiosity you will constantly find yourself enjoying new stuff in this game when you start playing.
That being said it is a survival game and it can be a bit difficult, I would highly recommend watching a quick beginners guide and try to learn patiently, you will likely die a lot starting out to random carnivores near ""safe"" starting areas and you may even starve to death while trying to find a peaceful spot for a hut.
Once you get a little house with a bed to respawn at though the game immediately opens up to different things to do, if you like crafting and survival games and enjoy occasionally being lunch for a T rex this game is worth getting even at full price.
Also worth noting that its worth messing around in single player and then finding a unofficial community server to play on, official servers are very hard to start on and can be quite toxic with no online moderators to help you with issues."
13116,bruh this game is so dope
13117,"Really not much of a starter area or anything to teach you how to play.  We were unable to connect to any of the servers, so were stuck on local.  Think we will stick to Icarus for now."
13118,this game is quite possibly the worst game ever concieved
13119,"Very fun game, if your computer can run it.

Requires 300 GB of storage for the smallest map, and the cave loading is a death sentence.

Other than that, the game is fun with the homies, but ooga booga when you lonely."

Except you tame dinosaurs. One complaint however the game likes to freeze A LOT! If you have not already played it play it and wait for ark 2 coming whenever the devs decide it should launch on PC."
13140,"Building is very hard to do. Frustating at some point. Parts that does not want to snap, adding non essentiel building part so you can snap the other building part and destroying it. Make no sense. A lot of bugs. Like cannot open any box or lockers, stuck between rocks. At some point cannot even know how much material needed to built any accessories. Dont bother to pay for this game, you are waisting your money."

13246,"Every 15 minutes, the server lags for 15 - 40 seconds while it ""saves"".  Server has about 10 - 15 people on at all times out of 70 MAX, yet the server dino tame limit is almost maxed out.  This means that you will not be able to breed or tame any new dinos, especially during events, because many of the tribes are sitting around with about 500 (the tribal cap) tamed dinos, most of which serve no purpose whatsoever.  If they need more room, they create a second tribe to store overflow dinos there.  Meanwhile, virtually all of the players from the tribe are off on other servers (like the new one, Fjordur), and only come back every so often to refresh decay times and restock feeding troughs.

Lag and rubberbanding aren't nearly as bad as it is on console.

Kibble recipes are different now, and dino eggs are classed by ""size"".  And for some reason, a Compy egg is considered to be the same size as a Trike egg.  A Trike's poop is literally BIGGER than a Compy, but because a Compy can only be tamed with Raw Prime Meat (maybe kibble?  not sure), it magically craps out eggs of equal size to that of the Trike's.  

One of those games that had amazing potential, but executed very poorly because they hired out an amateur development studio to write the code for the game, then paid for the cheapest servers they could.  A different company owns the game now, apparently (or whatever happened), and they've made dramatic improvements over the years.  But, still very questionable decisions are being made, existing issues have been ignored in favor of making an Ark II (which, to be honest, is probably for the best).

I'm hopeful for Ark II, so long as they have a different development team working on it; programmers with experience and know what they're doing.  And, hopefully, they don't go as cheap as possible on the servers again.  Better servers would have allowed larger capacity without bottle-necking and crashing, and the in-game performance would be far better."
13247,i just like the game in general and hate sometime when i die in the middle of nowhere
13248,support's a month for nothing special that doesnt relate to the game besides that only the building system is poo everything else is ok
13249,I LOVE BEING BIG AND BLA-
13250,Game is better with friends and wayyy better with mods at this point. The smithy cant even hold all the ingredients for certain mastercraft blueprints without them so that makes no sense at all right? However there is a dino for every need if youre brave enough to tame them all and deal with the lag of having like 30 dinos at your huge base. All in all though the content is fun and the responsibility of leveling and maintaining dinos is interesting and proves to keep you coming back day after day. all in all i give it a 7/10 vanilla and 8/10 modded.
13251,Dino go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
13252,hi
13253,Awesome survival game to play solo or with some friends a bit buggy but overall fun.
13254,"You will either drop this game at .5 hours our play past 500 hours and either way you will hate this damned game, still an amazing game, get a good group and do a private server with settings to where you are happy with them and you will be good to go"

still don't know how to beat it"
13290,"I play this game as a distraction from the stresses of life and it is very relaxing even when i am being chased down by a ravenous raptors. The crafting, building, taming elements can be a bit laborious but once mastered(or tweaked in the settings)it becomes second nature and serves as a path to the ultimate prize, beating the bosses. Preparation is key to success and taking shortcuts will only serve to put you back to square one(it can be like playing snakes and ladders and landing on snakes all the time) so be patient and you will be rewarded. A great sense of achievement awaits those who have the mental endurance  to tame an army to beat the powerful bosses and it doesn't stop there as your can continue your adventures on the many extra official and custom maps, great entertainment and value for money. Oh and did i forget to say it is a fantastic educational tool as my 8yr old son has learnt to recognise and name nearly all the dinosaurs in the game."

13308,"This game is completely massive. The 300GB is justifiable because of the amount of content this game has, so do not be discourage on the hard drive size. If you do not want the DLCs, the 150gb is still reasonable enough to spend an eternity in this game. Now for the gameplay, it is absolutely playable solo, but with friends time passes by so fast you may clock in thousand of hours which yet more stuff to do. 10/10 there are some bugs, but not game breaking."

13339,"It's no wonder this title, along with Rust, are lauded as the primary cesspools that created modern griefing; the rest of the content here is gated behind such an imbalanced dice roll of even being able to survive longer than 2 minutes that unless you have a veteran player to hold your hand the entire way through your first playthrough (barring that, listening to one of the nerve-grating misophonia-triggering voices on YouTube that create annual guides all saying the same things) you will get nowhere with zero guidance in a game that seems to just assume you know everything about it from the first time you boot it up.  It mostly feels like a complete disconnect after so many years of development, where the game has been developed and redeveloped so much to the benefit of the existing fan base that has been here that the dev team completely abandoned the new player experience... Or even a hint of an onboarding process."

13376,"Ark: Survival Evolved (stylized as ARK) is a 2017 action-adventure survival video game developed by Studio Wildcard. In the game, players must survive being stranded on one of several maps filled with roaming dinosaurs, fictional fantasy monsters and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players.

The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective and its open world is navigated by foot or by riding a prehistoric animal. Players can use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures, with the ability to build bases as defense on the ground and on some creatures. The game has both single-player and multiplayer options. Multiplayer allows the option to form tribes of members in a server. The max number of tribe mates varies from each server. In this mode all tamed dinosaurs and building structures are usually shared between the members. There is a PvE mode where players cannot fight each other."

13388,"The game is nice and the story lines are articulate! Although... It's not very beginner friendly. I remember just starting out in the ""easy"" zones, and at either side of me there where dinosaurs that where aggressive and gave me a free ticket over the river stix! I quit for a little bit because of this.. but I came back and watched a few videos on how to survive and then it was only semi-easy. The creature clipping could use some work. 
In summary the models are good and so are the story lines, but it definitely has its flaws."

13428,The game was great and the community was awesome until a tribe of losers with end game gear decided to destroy everything we had because I didn't want to trade away my Shadowmanes that were generously sponsored to us. Can't recommend it unless you want to be soul crushed by the worst people imaginable.
13429,"shit game, still fun though"

13435,"this game Official servers are hot garbage, maps take up to 10 seconds to save while you freeze the same amount of time, it happens countless times, is a neverending cycle of freezing your game just to save the server map data, I would get it if it was every 30 mins or an hour but every 4 minutes???! guess they run their servers with a toaster as command center cuz holy fuck how bad its gotta be."

13443,Fun exploration game recommened playing it with friends
13444,"I came in wanting to play mods, and it turned out that I couldn't last in the island for 5 seconds without my game shutting down. 

I spent days optimizing my PC, I pretty much multiplied it's performance ten-fold. 

Yet it couldn't run the normal game, with a fully optimized PC, the lowest settings possible, and even worse graphics via the launch menu. I couldn't last 20 seconds without an error showing up. All of my playtime has been:

1: Downloading mods for 45 minutes
2: The rest of it was spent trying to actually load onto the island. 

It's poorly optimized, Steam is essentially lying to us, I met the ""minimum requirements"", and still had to turn the settings all the way down, even then, I could not load into the game. The fact that WC has not bothered to fix this gives me very little hope for Ark 2, no one wants a game where only PC builders can actually play it. This game needed to be able to be picked up casually. It's a rare sight to see the console version doing much better. The console version of Ark ran so much smoother compared to PC that it's an embarrassment. In addition, my PC has better specs than my Xbox One x, which could run Ark no problem. I don't know what Wildcard was on when they were messing with the PC version, but they sure did mess up. Until I fix this issue myself (and I might now), I cannot recommend this mess, I just can't."

13461,"I absolutely love this game! It's just that it couldnt run on my laptop. For those out there seeing if this is a good game to get, I would say ""get it!"" The only bad parts about this awesome game is that it's quite laggy and buggy, plus being a lot of storage. For my device, I couldnt even load into the actual game. I tried quitting the game and its taken 2 hours and its still not closed. I know its just my device that is effecting this, but otherwise I've played it on xbox and I really love the game. I would totally recommend the game to people with a goodish pc, otherwise your game is going to be quite crappy."

13484,fun
13485,When i suggested this game to my friends. i talked about how we could play together. but all that had happened when we got the game was how we couldn't even play the game together. when we would try to invite eachtoher or join eachother. i wouldn't do anything useful. just continue to sit on the home menu. and after 5 minutes or so. it would talk about how we couldn't connect to the host. would not recommend this game.
13486,"The game is fun, different and a new survival game for me. Having to survive in the prehistoric ages against dinosaurs and whatever is roaming the map is a nice change of challenge. There are many different species of dinosaurs that I never heard of. If you want something different, try this one out."

Just kinda to bad they added all these modern day things, but atleast mods can help out alot!
Not that i persee mind them, if there was more of a singleplayer campaign to the game but i will be runing an intermitent fantasy/medieval server depending on if people are willing to support the power bill to.
might even decide on 24/7 server."
13507,Amazing Game once you get past the terrible programming
13508,"great survival game, recommend pve before pvp unless you want to go try hard mode"
13509,it's like Oblivion meets pokemon and then they run into minecraft. really fun.

13511,explorer note.
13512,its aight
13513,Although the game maybe a bit unhinged it still fun for the most part i started just a few days ago and only encountered one bug which surprised me.
13514,"I love the game itself, being able to tame creatures and build and grow your own base. It allows for a lot of different game play and the different regions are awesome. The only downfall is the amount of space it takes up to play."
13515,so shitty

13529,"I've been playing this game for awhile now and even though it has it moments, I love the game all the same, from the diversity of creatures on each map to the beauty in each maps biomes. It's something I would definitively recommend it as a game to anybody 10/10"

13536,This game is fun and competitive. however i sujest useing modes if you are not comfterbole with losing your stuff upon death and to take things and make a joke to lighten the mood.
13537,"There's quite literally nothing good I can say about this game, but now I simply wish to leave a negative review, nothing more. At 20 minutes in I said to myself, maybe it really is fun, it could be that one game both me and my partner will enjoy. I'll just have to push myself a little further. I really regret thinking that. If you're curious about this game, download it while it's free, and remember not to hesitate to uninstall the game."

13555,i like it
13556,good
13557,good game
13558,its alright
13559,"I love the concept of the game. Being able to build, explore, and tame dinos in a vast map is already great. Having all this with other players present on the same server to form allies or make enemies is even better. The game is glitchy but you learn to live with it. I've played the game over the years on a couple other platforms, so I'm not a complete noob despite what my steam time played status says."
13560,"just asome
"
13561,ark
13562,"only 44 hours in and I haven't even began to delve into what this game has to offer. I am really enjoying what I have played thus far but a warning for new players to this game : watch tutorials and mess around in creative mode before you go into public servers. Alternatively you can find yourself a friend that has some experience to help guide you through the early game because i think you will have a really bad time otherwise as I have not seen any sort of tutorial in game.
If you are a fan of the survival game genre like ""the forest, grounded, or valhiem"" you should have a good time with this one as well because it is quite similar. and DINOS!"
13563,"Trailer looks awesome when it comes to play the game it's one of the worst game i played, you spawn you die, no chance i would buy this game"
13564,ark
13565,shit game
13566,gotta love ark...
13567,game good
13568,"Amazing game But my pc need an upgrade XD
"
13569,"You can ignore my hours as most of them are outside of Steam.

Ark sounds like a pretty good game. Another open world online survival sandbox game, but with dinosaurs that you can tame, raise, and breed. Unfortunately, its one of the worst optimized games I’ve every played, is extremely grindy, and wants over 300GB of storage space.

13601,DINOSAUR GOOD
13602,i played for an hour and i got banned for no reason
13603,A great game i have been playing since beta in 2015. i used to play it when it first came out on xbox and i have come back to it. I'm happy with the new content that has been added to the game since i last played and cant wait for the sequel.
13604,"you innocently get ark. you hate the game. your friends go, oh guys lets play ark. you cant stop yourself. you boot the game. pain. repeat"
13605,fun dino game

is this because of mods. please help"
13612,"A lot to do and lots to explore, unexpected fights and lagre animals."
13613,Good game very fast and optimized
13614,"I blows my mind that the game has any positive reviews. We spun up a private server for like 8 people. The game is so poorly optimized we had to change nearly every factor in the game to make it remotely playable. If you play the game as designed you will spend all your time starving, dehydrated, and unable to craft. If you optimize the game yourself on the server side you will find that the game is boring as hell. The building is terribly broken. I tried to make a doorway using premade parts which snap together and had to duck to get inside (like that makes any sense for snapping blocks). You cant move objects after 30 seconds so building anything is a total hassle because you lose all your building materials if you want to try out one thing and then decide you dont like it. 

I lost 40 hours of a build because a trex spawned inside my base for no reason and ate everything. 

People who like this game are modding it until its playable, which says a lot about how bad the base game actually is. Its basically unplayable, and when it is playable its not fun. Huge letdown in a genre of games that I absolutely love."
13615,game broke fun tho takes up to much space its fine though at least for me

13655,lit
13656,"This game is for fantasists and animal lovers, and for Minecrafters who are looking for something new but not entirely different.

Progression takes the form of levels of technology, and engrams or crafting recipes are revealed gradually, allowing developments ranging from spears to cannons, thatched houses to metal ones, and things like boats.

One of the highlights is the ability to tame almost any animal, and use it for farming, fighting, or as a mount. It's very enjoyable.

The disappointing element of the game is how it punishes a spirit of adventure. You can stay at home and farm, and even keep progressing, in relative safety from the elements and hostile creatures. As soon as you start taking risks to go and explore, you die.... Sometimes it's a real effort to recover from a setback like that.

On the other hand, this is a game that is gonna keep on surprising you. Highly recommended."

13673,"great game also very hard i guess idk y im typing this but hey this is a good challenging game wat r u gonna do abt it? play it? yea u better bc not enough ppl are talking abt it even though it has its fair share of bugs its still a FREE (AT THE MOMENT OF ME TYPING THIS AT LEAST) work of content that had its price down to 0 so ppl could appreciate it and u better enjoy it and not complain abt it bc there r mods for it on pc only but apperently there r rumors of mods being on console and if it doesnt run right well get a better pc layout bc u cant just force your pc to do things better with ""free virtual rtx 3090"" or some virus crap like that if u have a 6 yr old graphics card and good cpu and ram and other crap i dont think u would be able play this but idk try it for ur self and see and remember customize your graphical settings and when uu try out mods note ur game is more than likely to freeze no matter what and its normal what u should do is w8 for it load if ur game freezes if it doesnt load then press the windows key and right click the bar on the bottom even tho ur cursor doesnt show up at first move ur cursor down and u will see it so right click the bar at the VERY bottom with nothing in that space and then click task manager and on the bottom right u will see a grey and blue box right click it and press always on top and u will see a new window so click more details if theres not anything there and u will see a whole bunch of things find a program called shooter game and right click it and find end task click it and ur game will close and un freeze and i only said all that too prevent like 10000 ppl from msging me ""how do i do this and that"" and ppl think i know code if u want to ask questions please DONT ask me bc im most likely not gonna know but thats entirely unrelated to the review but if u have the necessary hardware then give the game a go"

13693,"First of all, its really good and well done game. It only has a few bugs and glitches but nothing really big, except for one giant problem. A ton of players wants to play on non dedicated server which sounds pretty simple. I played with my friend two days in a row without any problems at the third day i got the ""unable to query server information ...."" error after fixing some stuff i was able to join again. (non dedicated servers are locked to 4 players and we have been 5, so we kicked one) After a few hours of playing my game crashed, so i tried to reconnect but i always got the ""connection lost timeout"" error. The help for these problems in the internet are basically useless. They give the advise to change the ports of the host, but if that would be the problem the other 3 players wouldnt be able to join. The ARK support itself is even more useless, they just tell you that they dont have an impact on the non dedicated server, so they cant help you. I did every advise that you can find, but it still dont work. I can join official servers, unofficial and even non dedicated servers in the ARK list. 
I really tried to enjoy the game, but these errors made it one of my worst games that i own."
13694,i like it

13726,"I got this game when it first came out. I hate it. 2022 I still hate it but for some reason I keep coming back to play this damn game. I hate wild card I hate this game. I do how ever love the dinos. Ive been playing PVE mainly since the release and privately owned servers. Owned a server twice. Hosted Tribe wars. Stopped for a year. Came back to it when I met IRL friends that were playing it. Tried PVP Official got wiped by an alpha tribe, played conquest merged with an alpha tribe. Went back to PVP Official merged with another alpha tribe. Got wall hacked and meshed by a box tribe ([][][]). Went back to PVE to relax and recently started Conquest again.

Ark has always been a vicious cycle of love and hate. Yet all this time I keep coming back although all the heart aches. Im still pissed at wildcard instead of fixing this broken game they think the better thing to do is release a new map every damn time, and now they are working on ARK 2 and you bet your ass it would be another STUPIDLY BROKEN game once again from studio wild card, cause thats what they do make fun yet broken games.

Here I am typing this still playing, waiting for Ark 2.

P.S. Theres a forced choice of ""Do you recommend this game?"" and honestly spent a solid 10 mins before I could answer..

Why do I still bother..."

13778,its is a great game where you build big bases and then you get raided in under half an hour and you have to start all over again.
13779,"With console and PC I have been playing for about 300 hrs total. I will say this game brings pain if you play alone the pain feels and gets worse. If you have a group of friends wanting to try a new survival game this is it. I play with friends and we have loads of fun and pain together. (IMPORTANT: THIS GAME WILL BRING TREMENDOUS PAIN WHENEVER IT KNOWS YOU'RE HAPPY SO ENJOY THE MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS) Graphics are nice not the best mind you but if you have a good to great rig, the game is very enjoyable. If you don't have the patience for a literal grind like game becomes a job at that point then stay away from Official Servers. Ark is it's own category of grind, so with that in mind do Unofficial Servers if you wanna have fun."

13795,"8/10
would be like a 9.5 out of 10 if it wasnt for its absurd size (400 gb with every dlc!), if you have storage to handle that, its a must-buy."
13796,"Who doesn't love a good game with dinosaurs and alien creatures, especially when you can tame, ride, and fight with these beasts? If that sounds appealing to you, then you're in luck. You can even play co-op with people, raid others' bases, or maybe even work together to build a massive base for you and others to live in. Not only that but you can subdue massive beasts and tame them with various foods so that they will fight alongside you. And you can also breed tamed dinos, make a massive army, and take down a list of different bosses. One thing to note, however, is that this game doesn't have a true tutorial and as a result, does have a slower start. And even when you do know what you're doing, it does take a bit of time and work to get to the resources necessary to create guns and other late-game gear that you need to start taking down bosses and the like. So this game can require somewhat of a time commitment. On the flip side though, if you want to play single-player, you do have the option to customize your in-game settings to make things give more resources, certain things spawn faster, make eggs hatch sooner, and even how often you and your dinos poop. In addition to all of this, if you enjoy mods, there is a nice-sized community that makes really amazing and unique mods that undoubtedly spices up your gameplay a bit. But at the end of the day, I would highly recommend this game. It's positively unique in many ways and has a lot of work put into it. I'd say if you're looking for a new game to try, why not pick this one up?"
13797,The game was free for me when i got it. i had to buy the dlc for it. my only complaint  about the game is its 430.81 gb on a windows 10 pc with all content

Maybe it is a good game but no tutorial, no idea what to do. Not even worth it for free! Waste of hard drive space."
13825,"good game
"
13826,"this game is literally the worst game that you will ever play, unless you have played it already then its already over for you. I've only played this game for a bit, but those who have been playing for a long time already know that this game isn't a part of their life, their life is no more than a part of this game"
13827,"i dunno man. i tried it for 2 hours. my guy started ""oof ouching"" and the screen turned red. I looked at my inventory and noticed my ""food"" meter was at 0 so i ran around and bashed a dinosaur like 20 times trying to get its succulent meat, then keeled over and died. I understand that its sort of a survival mechanic but it could have been explained a little better. Its also hard to tell which rocks are ""minable"" and which are just part of the ground. Im glad i picked it up when it was free to play. id be pissed if i dropped $30 on it. This game is also pretty glitchy on my machine"
13828,"cool game. dinosaur go bum bmubububmub
"
13829,This is a great game. The Coding is a special brand of spaghetti. But other than that it's a fun experience for anyone who enjoys the concept of taming dino's and surviving from nothing to riding dino's with super armor and guns that can put down a t-rex. Not to mention due to how many settings you can play with before you start the game you can customize your experience more than you'd expect.

Game crashes and dumb deaths, people trying to PvP on PvE servers and a GM crew who wont do anything to address even bugs/glitches when it DC's you or crashes (because the game servers are not fit for purpose and cant cope) and you die and lose everything.

If this is what Ark II is going to be like, dont buy it."

Or the time it takes to do something i feel like this game takes my life away, The food and eggs run out after a time and they usually recall you from coming back with something crazy time when you might have something in actually life to do. OR if your gone for a week you can't really come back or your base will be gone. I like to play causally that is why so that is the reason i Play a little here and a litte there on pve severs, I played a little bit on pvp but i didn't last long big tibes own everything unless your base is in a cave or prime location.

13869,"This game ruined my life, ever since i got it i have spent around half of my entire waking life playing ark survival

Loved it,Would play again,"
13870,This game is one of the MOST sadistic games I've ever played and I'm a pretty big masochist.
13871,"Decent game first and foremost. Online is where it shines. Decent people ( for the most part ) with a few bad apple's like in many online games. 

Pro's-
-Looks ok.
-Plenty of things to do to keep you busy.
-Many discord groups running in game shops so nothing is off the the table to obtain.  Nothing costing real money as it's a trading system with in game items.
-NO MICRO TRANSACTIONS thank god.
-Challenging game for sure at the beginning.

Con's-
-The game will be dumped by Dev's at the end of 2022 with no foreseeable support after that.
-The only DLC (Genesis) is broken beyond all belief. Pray to your God every time you enter Gen 2 that the servers don't crash immediately and you loose your character or things forever.
-Seems like the more they update the game the more it breaks.
-After a bit of time in the game it just turns into Dino day care and becomes a super repetitive cycle.
-No regional only servers so who knows what language the server will be using in chat.
-No real story 
-PILLARS ( if you know you know )
-Getting support for in game problems (i.e. Bad players or pillar spam) can sometimes feel like a waste of time due to very slow dev response if you're lucky enough to get a response.


Overall it's just a decent game with no narrative. If you like mindless sandboxes with dinos in it then you should like this game. But if you like games that have ANY kind of story to tell, Don't like game breaking bugs and/or glitches. If you want a stable server you can count on not to loose anything at a moments notice and you want support from dev's then avoid this game."
13872,I would totally recommend this game for people who are looking for a tough multiplayer/single player game that is survival and fun to play with friends.

13876,"Bang Bang Chicken:
Prep: 15 mins
Cook: 10 mins
Additional: 15 mins
Total: 40 mins
Servings: 4
Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients:
⅓ cup milk
1 egg
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
¼ cup potato starch
¼ cup all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)
oil for frying
¼ cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce
1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)

Directions Checklist
Step 1
Whisk together milk and egg in a bowl until smooth. Add chicken to egg wash and marinate for 15 minutes. Drain.
Step 2
Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and ground red pepper in a bowl and transfer into a large resealable bag. Add egg-washed chicken pieces and shake until each piece is completely dredged.
Step 3
Heat oil in a large skillet to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
Step 4
Add chicken pieces into the oil in batches, about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, so as not to drop the temperature of the oil. Fry for 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry remaining chicken pieces.
Step 5
Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first batch of chicken and fry another 90 seconds. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Fry and drain the remaining chicken. Transfer chicken to a medium bowl.
Step 6
Stir mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang together in a small bowl. Toss fried chicken with sauce to coat.

Enjoy!"

13887,"It's not terrible, but not great. It is just kinda wonky. A lot of things not polished. I feel this developer is just a bit cheesy. The first DLC came out when this was still in early access. I avoided it because of it, but my son kept asking to play it with me. I'll do most anything to spend time with my son so I bought it on sale.  We played it a bit and he lost interest because it is buggy and unbalanced. They made all these DLCs but never optimized the main game. Now they are working on ARK 2. It can be alright to check out for awhile if you can get a good deal. I put not recommended because the reviews are overly positive and contrary perspectives are needed."
13888,minecraft but its slightly worse. but since minecraft is a amazing that means that this game is really really really good. 9.9/10
13889,I get treated like a SLAVE in this game
13890,good very good game
13891,"bing bong, this great."
13892,"Sadly I cannot recommend this game from my perspective for a few reasons.  

1.  It does not feel beginner friendly - I just wanted to play the game solo and when trying to set things up, there are SO MANY settings to check and go through that I had to go to YouTube to get an understanding about some of it.  It does not feel like a 'pick up and play' sort of game.  

2.  Poor game optimisation - The first time I tried to play a map on Ark it just instantly froze and crashed on me and I have quite good hardware so that surprised me.  I once again went to YouTube to get some suggestions on what all of the graphics settings should be to make the game playable.  This is where I have to mention the game Rust as it is much easier to get your settings just right to make the game playable for you.  I think the developers of Ark focused too much on trying to make the game look good, they should have put more time into the optimisation first.  

3.  User interface -  Although part of the new game experience is to get familiar with your HUD and understand how all of the things in the game works, I just felt overwhelmed by all the options and I wish the design of it all had a more simplistic look. Sometimes less is more and once again, that's where Rust does it so much better in my opinion. I just felt so alienated trying to navigate through everything. 

I know there are a lot of people who love this game for one reason or another and I am happy those people enjoy it.  

Sadly, I am not one of them."

13966,"The Game is out now for quite some time.
And has been in early access an even longer time.
But it still feels like it was just published to early access.

I once bought it because it checks a lot of my like to play boxes:
[list]
    [*]Survival
    [*]Quite hard
    [*]Crafting
    [*]Graphic nice but not the main focus.
    [*]A lot of achivements
    [*]Dinos ;)
[/list]

I now got it again for free but still cant find myself to enjoy it.
Or understand how this game can have a very positive review rating.

The UI is just terrible. Menus, Crafting, Skill, Inventory management; Basically everything is hard to use.
Like if the Developers couldn't decide if they want to develop for Console or PC users and just mixed everything.
Different colors, fonts and sizes everywhere. Sometimes a radial menu, sometimes hotkeys, but always unintuitive.

Your Dinasours are either stuck or teleporting around, i don't get why this core mechanic is still so flawed after years being in the game.

The game has been poorly optimised from the beginning, focusing on ""beatiful"" grafics and ""content"" before quality.
My old PC did not have the power to run the game with a acceptable framerate.
But with an RTX 3700 my framerate still just scratches the constant 40 fps.
And i successfully achived a crash to desktop by creating a folder in crafting menu.

I don't get the game  -.-"
13967,"make it free
"
13968,"This is one of the best MMO games I have played. The devs really thought through how this game works. I love the fact you can tame dino's, and I do not know of any other game that has done something like this. I do think that this game has brought in a new type of genre of survival games"

Ark needs a easy report system for those types of people other than some players the fan base is nice and even nicer to new players I wish I could go back in time to when i didnt know how to play for the laughs me and my friends had when not knowing what to do and throwing spears at a rex. i would say this is a 8.5/10"

Right now what are the issues with ark? Giant laggy egg farm bases, OP Gigas, and the current balancing mess are what is most discussed.
I will add my own feelings to this list. To many Dino spawns, too little difference in use of Dinos, and flyers make most others obsolete.
I will start with to many dinos. Compare the long and detailed search for a good high level quetz. They are rare, you have to really search for them and it feels like an effort, but a good one. Anything else is pretty much common as dirt. From playing on Valhalla map it really feels different, some dinos are common, others are damn rare.
Follow this theme, huge numbers of smaller plant eaters. Tons of dodos, turtles, parasaurs etc, with about the same stats as now, and maybe a little less meat drops. Common dilos. Fairly rare raptors and carnos, with a bit more health and damage then now. Really rare Rexs with about the same damage and alot more health, but slower. Rare brontos with 100k or so health, bit reduced damage. Really really rare gigas with the same health but less damage and are really really slow like encumbered bronto slow, but with some form of really good drop so its worth teaming up to hunt. maybe with spears and guns since its so slow?
Increase meat and hide drops proportional to health. Gameplay would then be balanced around speed vs size health and damage. Want to go get some meat and hide? Take a raptor and kill a bunch of dodos phiomias etc. Want to get alot at once? scout for a bronto, take a much slower rex to kill it, maybe a 5-10 minute fight now, with withdrawing a bit to heal, but not burst damage so the risk is manageable. Kill it and get a few hundred meat and hide.
On the survival aspect, take away some of the chance. Give rexs a footstomping sound with a larger range a la jurrassic park, so you have to pay attention for it, and carefully retreat, but you have a good chance of escape if you pay attention. Larger no spawn range so an alpha or giga doesnt randomly spawn close to you with no control. Carnivores other then raptors are slower, so if you pay attention you may escape.
Alphas should be good and hard with high HP and fair damage but not huge. Multi dino fights for sure, but not a roll the dice to loose a tame fights

On Flyers:
Pretamed stat changes with a damage ptre, Argent or quetz there is little need for others. I took my Ptre farming as it slaughter brontos as easy as rex. same with and argent. And Quetz is gamebreaking. Too fast too damaging and insane with plant turrets.
Make the ptre a scout flyer only. Little damage other then against other flyers. Maybe slower. Use it to travel between bases and scout for that rex or bronto.
Make argent a hauler/ do a bit of damage but not a huge ammount. Keep its speed about the same or a little slower.
Make quetzal have much higher HP but travel slow, like encumbered slow, so its the flying base intended. Take a trip to the volcano, or a mountain, mine for a day, haul supplies between outposts. Maybe take away its damage entirely.

Probably remove PVE wild pickup as it trivializes alot of taming.
Then we are back to a game where there is a reason to be on the ground. Which makes the map feel bigger once again.
Now what takes up the map and created huge lag? Egg farms. Why do we have egg farms? Because its easy and efficient. Reduce kibble needed, and make tamed dinos not lay other then for breeding, maybe even make kibble the only taming food for each dino Want kibble? go out into the world and find the eggs. Spend time playing rather then running in circles and sitting afk.
Other related elements: large and behemoth walls, that clip into terrain, and weigh alot. IE go out farm the elements for one, like gates are now, and you need say a bronto or mammoth to carry it back to base once made and then place it. Maybe a few more resources as well. Like say teeth for an upgraded form of arrows dropped from carnivores in relation to their size.
What will all these changes give us? A less laggy, more varied world where you have reason to go out and run around and play. No more clusters of half a dozen brontos at a spawn point constantly, so dinos are rare and meaningful. A somewhat varied viable playstyle. A raft with a couple raptors and a trike would be viable, or a bronto and paracer base, that had high enough hp you can actually take it out and use it, and not worry about logging off with it out in the world. Want to go hunting? take a raptor and hunt lots of fast little stuff. Or a carno and hunt trikes and stegos. Or a rex and fight paracers and brontos, while everything little outruns you. With the huge hp increases on large dinos, no more raptors easting brontos, but at the same time the raptors now needed to be fast enough to hunt smaller things. Resource gathering is fine other then I would take away berries and thatch from mammoths and brontos. Male em haulers/ wood only."

13996,If you are working person of a society dont buy it otherwise hell yeah baby
13997,"Ark review in conclusion. One of the best games i ever involved especially in survival genre of games. But devs ruined this game by not block esp cheats and still be around even after 5 years. Long story short all good until someone jumps in your server and scans entire map with esp and find everything in a single day. Everything hidden, rathole ,even the smallest thing or tame will be found and raided by those cheaters and wild card doesnt care at all that game gets ruined. Search in youtube a video with this name ""The ARK Developers Won't Ban Cheaters Anymore"" and also how bad esp is for this game. And on top of it, they gave a copy of game for free before a while. That means that those cheaters will be able to use steam accounts with ark copies and esp for free while in the past they were need to buy the game and get banned then buy next account etc. Now they have as many as they want to burn. 
Too bad, an epic game with great gameplay/lore/survival and all rest, that is wrecked because devs dont care about it....
Good job guys..."
13998,"revisiting it, and its even better than i remember

10/10 would recomend

14006,"Gonna start out that making servers with friends can be kinda tricky or frustrating at times, but for the most part after it finally gets set up and everyone can find/join the server, its great!! Super customization settings for  your comfort in gameplay, would recommend it to any of my friends,"

optimization is shit.

unless you want to play PVE don't bother playing and wait till ark 2."

14015,Ark is an awesome challenging survival game
14016,Dinosaurs are cool
14017,"no one told me this game was going to be this good lol, its a bit rough on the edges in some area (optimisation/glitches) but it is overshadowed by the ammount of content that is in this game"
14018,cool game
14019,as soon as you think you are done with the game.... it sucks you right back in. it is like the ex from highschool that gave you good top and you always went back to that the toxicity of that 24/7 snatch..... 10/10 would recommend
14020,fu*ked up idea of the game but really nice when playing <3
14021,"Its addictive and very fun :D
"
14022,"Great game to play with friends, a bit of a pain to learn and understand but once you understand the general concept it's one of the best games you will ever play, perfect mix of grind, action, PvPvE, and of course dinosaurs.

14036,"This game can be very buggy at times. A lot of players think the dino's are way too easy. 
Personally, I can't go a  couple of meters outside my base or I'm already dead. Not to mention the times when alpha raptors literally spawn next to my base. 

Yet despite all this, this game is freaking awesome. Surviving in the wild with your friends while being surrounded by dinosaurs that you can TAME yourself?! And then use those tamed dino's to your advantage? 

It's pretty sick. 100% recommend."
14037,wait for ark 2
14038,W game
14039,very fun w ur mates
14040,"Very good game , would recomend for everyone"
14041,"I love this game. But man you need SO MUCH STORAGE to run even the free map extensions. Now for the average Gaming PC it probably isn't a problem because you probably have a beefy hard-drive but for some reason I only have 460 gigabytes so If I want to run anything else other than ark its relatively impossible for me. So Im not leaving a negative review for the actual game-play, Im leaving a bad review for the sheer amount of storage requirement you need."
14042,"I did recommend it, but each map, are like 20/50GB and the game which it is like 200GB more. If you don't have 1TB free, it's not enough. 😅"
14043,Good game
14044,"jklhnoi

"
14045,make griffins submissive and breedable and I'll continue playing. Game is currently unplayable due to this.
14046,"to many bugs, small inconvenience that add up.
Some of them:
To hard to find my friend on a multiplayer server, i need to suicide until i spawn randomly near him, or die while i try to go to him.
Weird settings menu that sometimes bugs when changing settings and performance drops from 100 fps to 30  fps, then it dosent matter what settings i have, graphics epic, or low , it still jumps around 30 fps and i need to restart the game for my 100 fps to get back to normal, and sometimes dosent work and needs more restarts
Dinosaurs collision is off sometimes they bump in to you and makes you teleport around them
I need to tell my friend the exact name o f the server i am on, because if i try to invite him it says its full even if its 50/60 players on it.

14060,"so fart my experience has been mediocre, i met a guy on this game and we kinda became friends
he has been playing this game since its release, even on a shitty pc he told me.
he has around 1.449.2 hours played, and he is teaching me stuff which is fun. but god damn. just because we played for few hours, he forces me to play this game every day, he is soooo annyoing writing me in discord, skype, teamspeak, and steam. to play with him. he is sooo annyoing that i started to dislike this game. everytime when i see ark i always think of that ex-friend
and it makes me angry. like gorilla angry. so angry that i want to beat my wife.
ex-friend if you are reading this pls leave me alone. 

the game itself is meh... but for the price its worth a buy
"
14061,"Don't get why people say this game is buggy, I've been playing it on a non-dedicated server through Hamachi with a friend and I haven't experienced anything weird yet.

Also insanely fun gameplay."
14062,"If you got it for free, play it, its ok. If you didn't, dont buy it. Constant crashing, retarded AI, Not Optimized...
But if you got it for free its expected and still fun. I dont think that this is worth 25$ tho."

14102,"Very well made game there are still some shitty things that i dont like but its an really nice game with many things to do.
"
14103,"ARK is a great game, but definitely has some imperfections. Although the grind of the game is enjoyable, it can be tedious when you lose all of your progress to a glitch like getting stuck in a wall or a server crash. Personally, I have over 2000 hours on Ark XBOX and i'm looking forward to ARK 2 in 2023"
14104,this is a very enjoyable game if you have a lot of time at your disposal because it can be VERY time consuming but the time spent is worth it because if you have the right friends in ARK it can be the best game out there.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he sat on my laps while dressed like an anime girl and we started playing it. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The good news is, its easy to catch back up to your stuff to begin with so, early deaths don't set you back as much, still annoying but, at least you can quickly catch back up"

There is always something to do and you cant get bored. The  only thing i don't like is how difficult it is to join other players.

14325,"This is only my 2nd or 3rd review, and I felt it necessary to describe my short time in the game.

I only have about an hour and a half in the game.  It's not very long, but it's long enough to understand that this game is NOT for new players.  It may have at the beginning, but the entire starter area is completely spammed with structures from other people; namely pillars.  They are everywhere.  I cannot even place a campfire, which is needed to not die.  The only option is to start heading away from the starter area to a land that other players claim is open, but I can't get there.  My level is too low.  Within minutes of leaving the starting area, some dinosaur kills me.  I can't actually decide where I respawn, so I have to choose to do so in a random location.  I do, and within minutes, I'm dead again.  

I was told by the other players on the server to built a raft and go north.  I have no idea what level I need to be in order to build a raft, but I wasn't close.  I'm not interested in just running around and chopping trees and picking up rocks until I am a high enough level just to leave so I can start playing the game.  

The game looks interesting, but I will never know.  I can't even place a campfire."
14326,"Don't get me wrong, i'm grateful its free.  I've wanted to play Ark for a while but i was too cheap.  But had i bought this game and didn't realize that it requires 328gb i think i would have shat myself.  I don't know any game other than ark that requires 328gb of space.  holy hell."

14399,"I missed out on this game on release. Finally have a PC strong enough to play and its one of the best video gaming experiences I have had in a while.

Only issue is that with all of its DLC this game is like 400+ GBs kinda ridiculous.

Edit 1:
This game is really awesome but it does have its issues. 
I personally like the futuristic stuff with the prehistoric but thats just me.

1. DO NOT play on official - I strongly advise avoiding PvP at all. I recommend playing with a few friends on a PvE environment.
2. Very buggy - A good amount of bugs will not make that big a deal but there are several bugs that you will run into that can be frustrating after running into a lot.
3. Very grindy - I love me a good time sink but sometimes it can be a bit much. This will differ from person to person but I had to mess with server settings for a couple hours and adjust them to how me and my friends liked it. This game is damn near unplayable with a job without boosted gathering.
4. Playing on Non-dedicated is basically impossible - At first me and my friends played on Non-dedicated for The Island and Scorched maps. This was fine but there are three major problems. Number one is that some days your friends will join just fine some days they cannot connect for no reason. Number two is the tether. I have a beast PC now and had the tether maxed out to what it would allow me and yet my friends would still be teleported back to me. The other issue being that they are not allowed to explore caves/dungeons without the host. Lastly Most of the timers even on single player settings seem to be balanced around having the server on at all times. Eventually it was unplayable once we made it to the Abberation DLC where each biome is a separate instance where it will teleport you to the host. So we caved and bought a cheap dedicated cause I hate port forwarding and all that garbage. 
5. Modding - Luckily we are on steam but this game in my opinion is unplayable without mods. If you were planning on doing cross platform with some friends or something you might wanna reconsider.

This game is truly way more fun than I ever thought it was gonna be though. Several very in-depth systems and mechanics each map is very unique and adds lots of new creatures and biomes to explore. Expanding your base and slowly gaining access to better equipment is awesome. Taming creatures is one of the best draws to the game for me even if a creature isnt necessarily useful I like getting everything I possibly can like a pokemon game. If you can see yourself past these issues its amazing and the modding for this game is incredible."
14400,fun
14401,yes
14402,"The main reason I had never purchased this game is because purchased and played Atlas at launch, without ever having tried this game before. Atlas had cool elements but ultimately was poor experience and launch in my opinion (can read my review).

It's actually extremely difficult to quantify and describe, but this game comes across as much less serious and more childlike visually on the surface than it actually is. Once you actually try playing, it's quickly apparent. It also feels visually superior, vastly better UI and much better performance than Atlas.

From my perspective Atlas did a disservice to this game. I've had this game on my wishlist and it took it being completely free for me to even give it a chance. By the way the game is incredible, it's literally pure unadulterated crack. This game is the #4 game solid on Steam with concurrent players for multiple days now, even if temporary this exposure should be positive long-term.

It's refreshing to see, especially from a game that's been developed for years. Maybe allowing a demo or another free claim period may bring in even more potential players. I now am fully convinced that you just need to try the game for yourself because it delivers on it's own merit. 

In Ark you spawn on a beach and start gathering materials and surviving intuitively just like you would in Rust. This style lends itself perfectly to the single-player game mode. In Atlas you sit at a port aimlessly gathering enough stuff to build a raft, waste hours sailing to every island that's already completely claimed by zergs or other hostile players. 

It's genuinely impressive how much fun to play and good Ark feels in single-player. It's similar to Rust but with dinosaurs and skill trees, which if you're also an RPG fan like me is pretty cool. Many common mods in Rust are how this game is inherently designed. Things such as being able to fast-travel between placed beds. In Rust the /home or /tp commands are custom mods that are not part of the vanilla game.

Ark is an improvement visually from Rust as well. So far the feel of the game and how it plays plus how buttery it runs feels much more smooth to play than Rust. A large part of that is due to servers and the game being online.

I feel like anyone who bought Atlas and didn't have have Ark already in their library should have just been give it for free anyway, without needing to claim it manually. With that being said, it was free and I finally tried it. I played for 16 hours total in my 1st session and I couldn't put it down. I literally fell asleep in my chair sitting up before having to log off. This is the experience I wanted all along. Not the same gameplay, but the enjoyment factor I was seeking when I purchased Atlas, and the promises that I felt it never delivered on. 

I do appreciate the fact that I was able to give it a chance free of mental expectation. Honestly it never had anything to do with money, I can afford the game no problem and had the funds already in my steam wallet when it was on sale for an extreme bargain price. I had the game in my cart and when I went to purchase I thought about it for a minute, the summation of everything discussed here.. and I just went, ""meh"" and cleared the cart. 

Feeling rushed and like you have to decide whether you like the game or not within 2 hours can be an unpleasant experience all on it's own, regardless. Not having to worry about refunding or anything like that and just playing it made it a lot easier to take in and attempt to objectively enjoy the experience.

As far as the whole dinosaur aesthetics coming across childish to an outsider. I'm not sure exactly how you remedy that or overcome it, my idea would be to make the media for the game more focused on the skill trees and character progressions. Maybe consider reworking the character creation slightly to be a more traditional RPG style as opposed to so outlandish and cartoon like. 

Had I been exposed to more of the intricacies of the skill trees and game design elements I may have potentially had a different disposition as opposed to just being blasted with images of colorful dinosaurs without really having any ideas as to why, or any context of what it even means for the game and it's gameplay experience.

The serious and devastating world that the game takes place in is not represented fairly or accurately by photos or clips of bright multicolored dinosaurs with no context. The flying also looks somewhat far-fetched from an outsiders perspective. There's a lot of things that visually don't translate accurately or properly represent in media how they actually present or feel on screen to encounter in game firsthand.

Just focus on the depth of the skill trees and how unique they are. The trees are fantastic, so methodically placed out and an immense number of levels. It's thoroughly good in an RPG inspired style system. Highlight the fact that it's survival game with a sweet open world, awesome skill trees and outstanding character progression. That's what people actually care about and enjoy. That's what real single-player fans are after, and have been in a draught.

Another game that somewhat parallels my experience with Ark is Minecraft. For years I always talked down on Minecraft, thinking ""why would I play that, it's ridiculously blocky, looks terrible and the gameplay looks primitive"". Well just like Rust, during 2020 lockdown desperation I tried Minecraft for the 1st time. Now I love Minecraft, it's one of my favorite games now and the modded game has endless replay potential.

Overall the game is really fun and great to play so far, super immersive and a massive scope on the gameplay timeline and progression. That's the best way I can describe to depict how you just won't know unless you try it firsthand. I just wish that I had tried this game 1st before Atlas. The game a lot of the time so far reminds me of a combination of Conan Exiles and Rust when in the single-player format.

I haven't tried playing at all online yet, maybe it's a less favorable experience. I honestly don't care about that at all though. I can have an unfavorable online experience in literally every other game that exists. They are all just pumped down people's throats nowadays. What we have been missing for years is a genuinely good single-player experience. So far this game delivers on that. No server, ping, lag spikes, cheaters, griefers, a-holes, zergs, etc. to ruin your experience. 

Single-player games always have always been and always will be the best games. Without any question or doubt. There is no opposition, they are the industry standard. It's what sets the tone for every other game that exists. The gameplay for every single multiplayer game ever created was inspired by or derived directly from previously existing single-player games.

 Whether doubters realize it or not, all multiplayer games are derivatives single-player games from decades past. Without Doom, Duke Nukem etc. there are no other shooters. It's the core and essence for the gameplay mechanics and world designs. Philosophies from single-player games are the foundational basis making up every ""multiplayer"" game that exists now.

You've heard of, ""What came first, the chicken or the egg?"" Well here, single-player games are the egg, and they came first, indisputably. There used to be no internet, single-player games were all there was. It doesn't matter if you don't believe or agree, the truth is the truth and that fact is a constant that is unchanging.

The only style of games that you could make an argument were born as ""multiplayer"" games are absolute garbage like 'Among Us' & 'Fall Guys' that contribute absolutely nil to the gaming zeitgeist. They are a parasitic trend that have nothing truly original to offer. Zelda, Mario, Tomb Raider, etc. you name it every great game of all-time was born as single-player.

Thank you for the game!
Look forward to getting into some DLC after some vanilla game :)"

14419,"Scummy devs forcing peoples who got the game for free to buy all the dlcs while showing a bunch of ""free"" dlc that you cant get without buying the ULTIMATE SURVIVOR edition that isnt free. 

-gameplay : was fun to play kinda,  was mostly grind, you were forced to make your own server if you didnt want to not go to work because you'd need days to tame one dino with normal settings.
 
-Content : base of the game was fun, but then it turned into a strange stuff with robots and alien creatures as well as mythical creatures. Maps are huge in size (and file size)

-graphics : eh, normal like any survival, with the few nice views in some maps

-note : 2/10 for the scummy dev part mostly, would be a good 5 or 7 without the current devs. 
if you want a jurassic survivor just take the base game with the primitive plus, if you want a survivor with giant robots and dino and dragons and stuff, just do yourself a favour and play a tabletop RP instead, you wont have the mindless grind.

14428,"I have only recently downloaded ark when it was free to keep, I have hundreds of hours on PS4 however.

This game is a royal screw-up of a fantastic concept. Gameplay is plagued with bugs and crashes compounded by major singleplayer balance issues. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely a fun game, but the way that it is balanced almost forces you to play on a server if you want to make late-game progression. There's a reason this game has a reputation for being buggy, within 10 minutes of playing it on Steam the game crashed and messed up my system files somehow. Now I can't even play most of my games for more than a few minutes because it will simply crash, after launching Ark once. I still love playing with friends on PS4, but the extremely frequent bugs, unrealistic balance, and computer breaking bugs ruin the experience for me. The developers have made a good game, and their hard work shows. But can they stop and take a minute to fix major issues with the base game instead of adding DLC after DLC? Seriously guys, we get that giant mechs and fantasy creatures make money, but just fix the actual dinosaur game before making whatever these new DLCs are. I have hope for Ark 2, and plan on buying it, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game until Wildcard actually takes time to fix their game, which probably will never happen. Unless its on a ridiculous sale and you have 125+ gigabytes of storage you are willing to throw away, don't buy this game."

14449,"I have played this game on and off for years on the PS4 and can confidently state that this is the absolute worst, most frustrating, buggiest, and poorly designed game you will ever spend 2000 hours on. I don't know why us Ark players put up with such a broken pile of garbage and a dev company that doesn't seem to give a flying foxtrot about fixing anything as trivial as the game simply not working half the time, but we do and we keep coming back. 
This is a game that, every few months, I get a hankering for and I come back to it and play it nonstop for a couple months before getting so fed up that I quit again. Yet, as much fun as I do have during my time on it while it works and in between the bugs, I couldn't possibly recommend this game to anyone. Us long-time Ark players know this game, warts and all, and we've accepted it as the buck-toothed, hunch-backed runt that it is. I'd feel guilty getting any of my inexperienced friends to play it because I know they won't be able to see the kernel of fun below the layers of refuse. 
I've never wanted so much to simultaneously give a game 0 and 5 stars. What it does well, it does VERY well. The level design, music, aesthetic, gameplay concepts, etc, but when asked to actually be a game and do things like detect hit boxes, register where floors and walls are, or even load a server then it all falls apart. Somewhere in here are the makings of the best game I've ever played in the same way that somewhere in my septic tank is the best burger I've ever eaten."

Base game was about 60$ when I bought it like 5 years ago, + 40$ for the genesis season pass, OK, + 100$ in SSD to account for the completely unhinged content optimisation that went on for this colossal game.  = 200$

14550,"amazing fun, im so glad i picked it up for free no less!
(well kinda, after all this time playing i kinda had to get the dlc)

iv ebeen playing on a freinds modded server, and still learning as i go on, but overall the experience is amazing!

i think this game and all the content provided in the free expansion maps alone is enough to keep you set for a few months at least!

the dlc... just extra fun!

this honestly looks like multiple game sin one!

maybe the graphics arent the prettiest to some, but to me, i have seen some wonderful sights and places!
imagined story scapes and such, or just built a base with a nice ocean view!
it did push my gpu way up tho but the fix i found for that was to enable the command console using tab (default)
and entering: ""t.maxfps 90"" (the number was an example) the game seems to run ok rendering 140 fps but i really dont want an oven for a pc, so i like to lock using the command.
theres another way modifying the game files, buit i havent tried!
overall, amazing improvement now, but game itself already awesome!
the fps thing is just because there is unfortunatly no fps cap/vsync like most games have these days! 
theres also graphics settings youtube vids out there for general improvement help if your pc needs it!

but game itself is yes super fun! <3
Cant wait for 2!

14556,Recommend....!!!!
14557,It is a good game as their is a vast variety of things to like building and taming dinos or even completing the game.even once you've done that there are lots of mods to try and you could even re try beating the game.
14558,dinosours`
14559,good luck :)
14560,Since the game was free on Steam I got it and played nonstop for 50+ hours still rising.This game is so god damn good it deserves a prize it also has everything it needs to keep you and your friends entertained altrough sometimes it really makes me mad as hell its a good game after all.

14575,its dont for low end pc's
14576,Great game. Even better mods. Bring back Survival of the Fittest!
14577,"Pros:

- Very nice concept
- looks kinda nice at first
- Dinos

Cons:

- Starving/Dehydration way to fast, but u can just drink salt water no problem
- Most Dinos are too easy to kill/tame
- Movement only in the direction u are facing (especially annoying when flying/rafting)
- Terrain is badly meshed
- They fucked up ambient occlusions
- depending on ur settings L.O.D. dithering gets applied even to the skybox and clouds
- EVERYTHING REFLECTS LIGHT, Get ur retinas toasted by looking at a leaf
- Ur dinos will get stuck on a branch on the floor, while the wild ones clip thru everything (even ur base)
- Cooking mechanic is trash
- Gunplay sucks, big fat ugly crosshair that stays on screen even in ADS so u cant see anything
- Base building is the worst of all the games i have played
- Cant build a big nice base (like in the trailers) in solo survival unless u have infinite time and no soul
- awkward structure placement
- sloped roof obstructs placement of sloped wall, u have to build roof first
- 1 Tree ~ 50 Wood, 1 Foundation ~ 10k Wood (U can use tamed Dinos later to farm more efficient tho)
- Crafting mechanic is trash
- Inventory management is a nightmare
- Run 5km for supply drop, get thatch door and water bottle blueprint
- U have to google everything (7yrs of development and no tutorial)
- gamebreaking bugs are not nearly as frustrating as the mechanics itself
- u freeze to death at night so all u can do is stand between 2 campfires for 20 minutes or u will die
- EVERYTHING POOPS, Cant disable pooping sound (have fun with ur Dodo farm)
- Files are all uncompressed so get rdy to download 300GB 
- UNICORNS

Fazit:

I would love to love this game because there is a lot of potential and it is actually fun for the first few hrs but after encountering all these annoying things i listed above i just cant play anymore without grinding my teeth down. I really enjoy survival games (RUST, DayZ, The Forest, Valheim, etc.) even when they are not that good. This Game has Everything, just in the worst way possible. Seriously, how can u fuck up so much with so many good games out there that are basically the same minus the Dinosaurs? 
I was hyped for this game when it came out as early access in 2015 but after 7 yrs all the devs did was adding content on content, DLC after DLC and just left fixing the game to the modders. Never listening to the Community, never updating any of the annoying mechanics and now they announced ARK 2 which translates to ""no motivation to fix stuff and no pride in our work"". Oh yeah, but thanks for all those Laser Mech Dinos, Mythical Creatures and Unicorns.

Overall the Game is a VERY overpolished pile of trash and that makes me really sad. Would love this  to become a good game one day but hopes are low. 2/10"

14582,"A buggy mess with more gamebreaking bugs then the switch console had faults. It barely functions and character design is horrid. BUT it has amazing graphics on non players. Although a derpy AI they got the feel of a prehistoric paradise down.

Pros:
- Nice graphics
- With a bunch of mods it kinda works and can be fun. Just don't bet on the save not getting corrupted.

Cons:
- Bugs a-plenty!
- Horrible gamma options (settings can kinda fix it)
- Extremely grindy on normal settings
- Anything overleveled can make you go back to zero whenever"

14636,"This game is poorly optimized and kinda buggy, but it has dinosaur riding which is something most games could use more of. If you have friends to play with this game goes from great to amazing. If you like to lose yourself in games with a lot of content get ready to lose hundreds of hours."
14637,"A broken, unoptimized mess. Don't get me wrong: there are good things about this game, but the experience is badly sullied by how incompetently it is put together. This plays and feels like an early Early Access game, not a finished title! I recommend getting this game for free or for a few bucks at most if you can.
Here's a summary of what I found good and bad about this game in my 7 hours of playtime:

The Good:
- Huge map to explore, though it does feel a little empty.
- The environments look pretty and there are moment of genuine atmosphere.
- The concept is really neat and hey, can't go wrong with dinos. You can even ride them! :)
- I am a bit of a sucker for survival & crafting games... and a bit of a dino nerd.

The Bad:
- 125GB install and 400GB with all the extras is just nuts. The game seems to lack general optimizations and polish and this is reflected in performance as well as the install size.
- Many, many visual glitches. Had the lighting break on me a few times. The bloom/glare effect is absolutely horrendous too, often blinding me completely. In general the graphics tend to be a bit of an assault/strain on the eyes. Otherwise the game is quite pretty, though I feel this is purely thanks to Unreal Engine.
- The AI barely functions, I constantly see dinos get stuck on things, completely break their pathfinding (seen a Megalodon beach itself, nose down and ass up, and killing itself... twice), stuck in attacking something invisible or not able to move at all. This really took me out of the experience since they play such a big role in the game.
- There are just bugs every 5 minutes, really. Some are highly entertaining, some are just frustrating.
- The interfaces are rather clunky and can be a little confusing at times. Some things lack important explanation (such as the sleeping bag being a one-time use, I had to start over due to not knowing that)."
14638,"I have played this game since in preview on the Xbox and i have always ended up coming back to this game and starting anew, always finding ways to explore and mess around and make new discoveries. It is a game that is not very forgiving but very rewarding if you play correctly.
I have so many stories from this game that I could not write them here as it would be half a or even a whole HP book. I have found that the best way to experience this game is to go out there and make the discoveries yourself thinking way outside the box. you never know what you will find. I recommend giving this a go, if its your first time look at the settings on single player and make it a little easier on yourself, if not look into boosted servers as these can be good too for new people. IF you want a real challenge though then go for the hardcore servers and see how long you survive. The only shame I have with this version is I need to get all my skins and all of the things I had on the Xbox again, thats tough"

14679,"Worst of the worst. No physics, no fps, no animations, no graphics, no interface. Everything and everyone is a box. Make a fucking wall in your inventory and put it on a place.

14690,"It's literally free for the next 9 days, and it's one of my favorite games of all time, having easely put 300 hours into it on PS4. But, while I do love this game, it has a lot of issues. There are sooooo many bugs, like seriously. I was playing with friends and we made a lot of progress( a lil wooden hut, a pte lvl 100, full metal gear except flak, ...) not that much but still 3-4 hours of my life. next day we start the non-dedicated session again and... gone, everything except our levels. It took only about an hour to get everything back, but I was so mad. Also, this isn't  as much of a complaint as just a warning, but be warry of the ""easy"" on some spawning locations on some maps, because the bog in genesis 1 is probably one of the worst areas out there.
Anyway, just get it. It's free and if it isn't anymore, I do still believe it's worth 20eu. Also, DLC is fantastic(for the most part) so don't pass up on that, except genesis 1 and 2, cuz it's actual shit."

14729,"Been playing this on mobile and getting used to PC..
My First run.. spawn o a random map location, trying out controls, been eaten to death by a croc.
2nd run.. spawn again trying to find my dead body, been mugged by chompy to death
3rd run.. just minding my own business when a rex tried to eat me the fall to my death on the edge of a mountain
4th run.. built my first simple 4x4 house for my base successfully, after a few a bronto stepped on my house and raptors feast on my body.
5th run.. I started to play single player mode and got my full revenge on those bastards!!! ahahhaha
I love this game"

14733,BUGGY AS HELL
14734,Worth it
14735,"If you like PVE, play single player mode alone or with friends, locally...PVP is not for the feint of heart...otherwise, the graphics are beautiful, and the crafting / building is fun."

14740,Highly Recommend this game Although it needs a good graphics card and alot of storage Its an AMAZING game If you get bored of it there's different islands you can do with there on unique Dinosaurs / Animals you can find! Highly recommended by me

14742,"Great game, i enjoy playing with the community but a lot of servers aren't as good as the console ones difficult to find servers that balance weight with gathering."
14743,13 hours in and I already hate the game. -6/10 would recommend for someone else
14744,"the best game ever
"
14745,GOOD GAME
14746,"It is a cool game.
"
14747,"1/10 game. In fact this might be the worst game I have played in a decade.

I was so prepared to explore an island of dinosaurs and this is what I got:
- graphics that would be bad even in 2010
- drinking salt water from the ocean rehydrates you
- your character poops themselves every few minutes
- 80% of the dinos are neon robots
- can't place campfire or anything due to players building on noob spawn
- gamebreaking lag every few minutes

The only thing that didn't suck was the community but 99% of the servers are dead. I got this game for free and I feel like I've been robbed."

14758,"Good game to waste a few hours in, and works great on Proton if u have the hardware!"
14759,Dodos
14760,"The basic idea of the game in my opinion is great. Being able to tame and ride dinosaurs while building anywhere and anyway(within allowed game mechanics) is simply put... amazing. The game is beautiful to boot as well, assuming you have a PC able to handle the poorly coded game engine. Its terrible controlling mechanics for Xbox controller players is off putting. It's so badly made for PC. 

Sadly these are not enough to keep me playing. There are too many bugs, to much grind, not enough customer support and not enough time in my life to participate and survive in a multiplayer world where not only can players and dino's destroy everything i've accomplished but also time."

14779,"This game is amazing to play with your friends. Although, unfortunately, multiplayer has been really inconsistent. The first time I played with my friend on his non-dedicated server, everything worked just fine, but the next time we tried to play together, his server would not come up ever, and on the rare occasion that it did come up, it would not let me join. We have now spent hours today just trying to play together rather than actually playing the game. The guides online for fixing theses issues were incredibly unhelpful too. This game has been around for what, 6 years? And it still has issues like this? Anyway, the actual game is okay if you're not including the bugs and garbage server system. I enjoy the thrill of running from a baryonyx in pitch darkness with my friend."

14796,"This game has been out for so long and is still so full of bugs. One wrong move and your stuff will forever be trapped in a wall, just out of reach. They keep adding more and more content but refuse to fix what they already have. Not to mention this game requires over like 300gb of storage and the loading the game takes longer than loading GTA V. If you wanna feel rage or just want a reason to commit an atrocity in your neighbourhood, this is the game for you.

8/10 I'm looking forward to the sequel (there better be more inbreeding)."

14806,Fun. Lots and lots of fun. Mincraft but with dinos 👍🏽
14807,love
14808,"This game is great if you want to play by yourself.  
If you want to play with a friend forget it.  
I have spent many hours trying to walk people though how to connect to their friends' non-dedicated games.
I am not paid by this company, screw them.
Go play Lost Oasis, or factorio, or anything but this, if you want to play with a friend."
14809,Very addictive and it took hours from my life. :D
14810,"I love this game so much, it has so many great things about it. Although unfortunately my game won't stop crashing. First it was on the island after 10-15 hours of progress. Then it just happened on scorched earth. I have tried every single possible thing and have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times to get it to work and it never does. Just nothing works and if they don't fix this in the next update, then I will try their support and if still nothing I'm going to ask for a refund even though I have so much time into the game."
14811,dayym this game
14812,This game is goofy sometimes but I cant really get into it enough to see all that it has to offer. Its best enjoyed playing split screen on an xbox with someone who you like to troll. Its good though I think.
14813,it's so fucking huge to download that i actually just use it to throttle my roommates internet for 17 hours at a time. great product would use again

14849,"Literally the worst game I have ever played. I would rather deep throat a fat log of Vin-Disel's constipated rock solid mucous covered shit than play this game, the fuckers literally released DLC while the game was still in early access which is bullshit for the obvious fucking reason of it being insulting to backers to have the money they put into a project used to fund a cash grab by the developers to attempt to get more money rather than have it pay for the godamn product they were actually funding. In response to the following backlash the fucking penny pinching cunts decided to not make the new DLC content free but instead just released the game 5 years fucking early so that they could continue to take the money of the original backers and funnel it directly into making more new DLC content rather than actually devote it to improving the awful base physics engine UI Levelling and Crafting System, Lack of easy multiplayer server hosting or even changing the godamn font which have stayed exactly the same since the start of the game's development. Instead all of the actual changes they made into making ARK playable, patching bugs updating core game mechanics past tech demo levels of depth and usability and making a finished product of a game were deliberately witheld from the players to scam them out of their money with DLC to drip feed them content to tide them over until they finally released the Finished original ARK Survival Evolved as ARK 2, likely as a full price game. and the worst part is that the lowest of the low, barely passable as intelligent life ARK players actually bought into this shit"
14850,Why is it still not free? It said until June 20th 10am PST but as of right now it is back to $30. My friend was about to get it so we could play together and now we can't. It won't be fun without friends

The dedicated servers are just not very fun for me. Servers don't wipe so they lag because they are littered with unused bases, and almost every time I spawn in I'm surrounded by walls because they build mini prisons around spawn areas. So single player is great, I'm in love with how big the map is and all the possibilities in this game."

14958,It is a good survival game. The only problem is that is not too beginner friendly as some Beginner servers on beginners areas are populated with advance gamer structures and you will need to watch a beginners guide so you don't waste much time in the beginning.

ARK! you start on the island with NOTHING you have to gather materials to survive and its up to you from there. you can ride dinosaurs, fly pterodactyl,s fly dragons, raise dinosaurs like your own interactive jurassic park.ARK is a must have if your into dinosaurs, survival and a hardcore playstyle."
14962,The story is really good and the maps are really well made. The bosses and mechanics to the game are very good and over all it's a good game in my opinion. The only problem have with this game is PvP and some BS the game gives you sometimes.
14963,Awesome game. it's too bad they decided to go woke with the pride month event. It's passed time for this liberal BS to stop. Get woke go broke!

You can lose a weapon from your hand, if you then hunt the culprit down you even get your weapon back? Of course not."
14976,"This game is so bad that you cannot cross a river without dying. For an hour and a half my friend and i tried connecting together on a server but it just would not work. So we loaded up a legacy server to try and get in a no pop one. Spend 2 hours just dying over and over to spawns that were way too strong and aggressive in the starting area. Nothing about this game is intuitive at all. If you are thinking of trying it out for the first time, Don't. Just wait for ark 2 or go play rust. This game will do nothing but waste your time and piss you off."

I like that most of y time no longer has to be  spent harvesting planting and  cooking  kibble.  this  lets me  explore more and  tame  . I get to see things  that are new  to me in so many ways.

15050,good game. although better with a friend
15051,"ARK is a little different than your average survival game. Starting out can be a bit rough. Be patience. Once you start to level up your character and tame some dinosaurs, the survival aspect becomes much easier. Ark has it all; Base building, growing crops, taming dinosaurs, breeding to achieve stronger dinosaurs, crafting to advance your armor and weapons. Both PVE and PVP servers to pick from, just look for a community that fits your play style. Solo player? no problem. Most of my 3,000 play hours have been playing solo. Have some friends join you, and share some laughs. No friends you say, then join a tribe and work with other team members. Having trouble or need more of a challenge, then check out online video guides to spark your imagination. Ark has several maps and lots of dinosaurs, endless adventure possibilities."
15052,"Ark is like a drug or something, you always come back to it no matter how much you hate it. 
The game itself is okay, except from the huge lack of explanations when you play in solo, I won't even talk about pvp official problems here because it was a really bad experience for me (basically everyone with a life I guess). 
Overall I mostly played with friend on non dedicated servers and the game is very buggy, gamebreaking bugs sometime, per example I lost a huge amount of time trying to restore my saves because the game crashed while I was loading. Just imagine being 100hrs on a world and then you load in and nothing's there, no character no tames no constructions nothing, and this happened to me several times. 
Basically If you already started playing then it's too late , you're doomed to play ARK for the rest of your life, however if you didn't play this game yet I really wouldn't suggest it to you.


Anyway I'm saying all that while still playing this game, I'm really looking forward to Ark 2, I hope WC will be able to make a good game and maybe this time it could be optimized."
15053,i can recreate the odst experience
15054,"Glad I never had to pay to play this game before... Joining a server and not being able to set camp because I'm ""too close to an enemy foundation or gate"" so you just walk like a stray dog along the seaside with no place available to start to play. Great experience! Gonna save some disk space and uninstall this huge piece of 125GB waste. 
And that is why, imho, this type of MMOs are the plague of video gaming. We're lucky we have so many other better survival games that we can play and really enjoy the most, simply because they're just not MMOs. I thought this game was popular, didn't really know why, but it's free so I decided to try it. Bad move I guess... So instead of running a private server just to BE ABLE to play, the best I can do now, is to mitigate that stupid hype for ARK with a negative review. 
Steam should add the tag ""walking simulator"" here because that's mostly the only thing I did as a new player trying to find a place to start building :D (or getting eaten when trying to get inside the jungle lol)"

15074,Any true Survival game lover would love this game because it takes everything about a survival in to consideration. from hunger to dehydration and huge dinos and mythical monsters even to crafting and building its a great game to play with friends or the hard core pvp player so i would recommend this game to any hardcore survival gamer.

15151,"frustrated review: the game is entirely too hard on your own or with just one person. in the easy areas there are crocodiles, pirahanas, and dilophosaurus' which are superiorly op for the starting area where you have no tools, no weapons, no skills... it doesn't make any sense. i play with my gf and we just kept dying and dying from something new whether it was the birds, the crocs, the pirahanas, the raptors, the troodons, the compys... its just an unforgiving world and its a bit too full. full of dinos and animals that have no real sense of placement or anything just peppered here and there. the graphics are awful and all the servers from when i first booted up the game were oversaturated with no-lifers who had taken over the map with their buddies or themselves.

-shrug- the game sucks. all dino games suck right now. path of titans, the isle, this, beasts of bermuda looks too old, just dont play dino games right now or ever. accept it."

15177,"Hands down best game ever made,"
15178,"This game has the most disgusting UI, the largest file size ever, the worst performance, and yet everything about it is great. 
This game manages to be both: terrifying and magical, frustrating and fun. I've made bases that I love, tamed and bred dinos that I love, and lost both. One of the best games ever made."
15179,"TL;DR : very boring uninspired tedious gameplay, totally unbalanced ressources gathering, (out)dated technically, lose progress when leaving game.

Played for nearly an hour because the game is free right now. Tried it before and had it refunded. I hoped the game had get better now.
Was I wrong...
Character creation to begin with is really barebone and really not good looking, visually and technically the game now feels very dated. Then came the UI, outdated by fifteen years I'd say. Very unpractical, very unintuitive. Craft unlocking through leveling is made in a very unlogical way in my opinion, ressources gathering is ridiculous. Hundreds and hundreds of wood units cluttering my inventory when I only needed more and more thatch. Except this comes from downing trees, in very small quantities, but wood is everflowing rendering inventory management ludicrously cumbersome.
After 45 minutes I had a small platform, a bed, a storage box, a fire, and finally my character learned to wield a stick to defend itself. You're basically playing a monkey here.
Exited the game because I was getting really bored, returned, launch single player again... The game asks me to create a new character. Everytime I leave and comeback the world is back to its initial state and I must start another character. I don't even care how to fix this at this point, having to learn how not to lose progress on an auto-save title shouldn't exist.

I have to mention also the crashes at launch, the game not saving your settings, the window popping side when logging in or out... Extraordinarily unpolished for such an old game. I had this game for free in the ebd and somehow I still feel robbed."
15180,This is a very fun and interesting game to play with friends and family. I highly reccomend. it can get glitchy every now and then but i think that is just my computer.
15181, e
15182,I think it's a very interesting in how all the controls work and the very detailed character and creature. Also everything in general!
15183,Best Survival Game For players who want a challenge
15184,after 1000 hours i can say ark is one of those games that take over your life and becomes more of a job than a game at times however even after telling you that i wouldn't change a thing.

"
15248,"With how long this game has been out I genuinely expected it to be a lot more polished when I got my hands on it. In all honesty, it feels extremely janky to play and I don't get how it's been such a 'hit'.

Ichtiosaurs swimming above water, trilobites on the beach, land dinos getting stuck in terrain (and each other), terrible player animations (don't go into 3rd person mode, trust me) etc. - all this on a local game that I can't blame lag for.

Overall, while it may have some deep and complex systems in there somewhere, the basics are nowhere nearly polished enough. And yes it may occasionally LOOK pretty, but only if you look at a static image - otherwise if you let it run you may notice that triceratops keeps walking into a boulder for all eternity.

PS: Why is thatch so much harder to source than wood? How does this make any sense?"

open world, build anything you want, tame all sorts ,little hard at first learning how to survive, but once you got it then its just a matter of grinding up enough to stay alive, i hate playing on servers, theres always someone out the with a bigger base and kills you on any server, 

spent many hours on private, and enjoying it heaps

It can be hard but is quite a balanced difficulty if you learn how to play it good (Like the basics of survival and taming). I strongly advise you go check the game out and buy it if you want. Sadly, you cant turn off blood, just the blood on the HUD (On the screen and not in the game)."

15302,"I have never played a worse game. These ""developers"" just rapid spawn creatures that can insta kill you in areas you are, and call it a ""game mechanic"". There is no combat mechanics, there is no healing mechanics, there are no audio cues. The ""game developers"" punish you by artificially making it hard by spawning hard creatures rapidly around you.

It has gotten to a point that I can predict when a creature will pop out of the woods. It is such a pathetic survival game, not one mechanic in this game when it comes to combat. In a combat based game.

15309,"I got the game for free. It usually runs for 17€, determining the amount of scrutiny.

The game is missing the following basics:
1) a ""start new game"" button in the main menu. I had to consult web research to figure out how to launch a new game.
2) menu navigation. You cannot just start a new game. If you click ""local/host"" which is ""start new game"", you cannot just start the game; instead, you have to set ~100 parameters. Only then you can actually ""start the game"", however only by clicking ""make player"" (yeah, so that is another thing you have to do first, duh).
3) When the game then actually starts, you get sent as a hulk-like man onto the beach of an island with two big dinosaurs in front of you. You are cold but then 5mins later without leaving the spot you will also be hot. There is no introduction what to do. You literally have no clue. There is no character that will introduce you to the game; that will tell you what to do. Compare this to any person player game, like pokemon red, ocarina of time, or horizon, or even doom. Everytime the game has to start with someone telling you what to do and how you do it. Not so this game. You would have to go on youtube and let someone show you what you are supposed to do. But because this is a laisure activity, I won't.

A weird aside notice:
The game looks like an N64 game which is fine for a free game -- not for a 17€ game in 2022.
I run a Radeon VII from 2019, which is a strong card.
I noticed tho GPU ran on 100% load, which is crazy for that low quality. So I scaled down the grapics from middle (preset) to low. *Now* the graphics looked really poor. This always puzzles me: how some games look effortlessly preme and others crank the nob out of your GPU and look poor anyways."

[list]
[*]Dinosaurs
[*]Survival base builder
[*]High tech influences (and late game high tech gear, etc.)
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*]Zero tutorial
[*]Zero guidance
[*]Very grindy
[*]Starter regions are all water locked-- and you'll very likely to die crossing the water
[*]Starter regions can be invaded by much higher level aggressive fauna-- and you'll die multiple times (possibly losing your whole base and all your gear)
[*]Starter regions don't give you access to the resources you need to explore further, not even in limited supply
[*]Without crystal you can't carry water anywhere else, and without water you will die quickly
[*]Taming Dinosaurs is never tutorialized-- it doesn't teach you how to do it. And some dinosaurs require you use kibble to tame them, which is a hidden recipe. And in order to get much needed resources, you are pushed to taming a Pterodon so you can fly to the resources you need, but to do that you need kibble, which takes a secret recipe. Did I mention this isn't tutorialized?
[/list]

I managed to get level 55, tried exploring, got mobbed by aggressive fauna, they killed me and the dinos I'd tamed to act as pack animals. I'd died a couple of times before that, but this was kind of the last straw (so to speak.) I just wasn't enjoying myself. Two days of play flushed away in 5 minutes."

15428,"Try as I might, I could not get this game to run stable, constant crashes,(about ever 30 to 45 minutes) bugs, and lack of a tutorial to get you started just wasn't fun.  

Tried building a foundation and it kept telling me that it couldn't because it was blocked.  There was NOTHING in the way, just flat ground.  The building is way to restrictive, and cumbersome.  the way food and water depletes in seconds is just stupid.  Run 50 or 60 yards as a noob and you run  out of food.  

I didn't find the game fun at all, it was just one source of frustration after another.  It was free, but it's uninstalled and wiped from my account.  Garbage like this has no place on my computer.  Back to Conan Exiles, it runs fine with no bugs, crashes and building is a ton better than this junk."

It's incredibly fun IF it works, but usually it wont, and definitely not for an extended period of time. bugs and glitches are encountered around every 30 minutes of play, some more severe than others.

The game remains extremely broken and poorly optimised, but eh, it's not making good money so lets make a new one i quess.

I really wish they would at least try"
15434,"ARK: Survival Devolved is a survival multiplayer experience that you will want to miss out on.

Enjoy the ridiculous customization of your character and then do yourself a favor and delete the game because that is the furthest extent of ""fun"" in this game.

15455,"Let's be fair, it's fun. If you play with friends, because it's a glitchy, confusing, and unclear mess. It's a second monitor game. That's what it is. Also playing with friends pretty much requires a dedicated server because you can only go 200 meters from the host. It's kind of fun. Kind of. It gets boring quite fast if you don't want to look up everything. Again, it's fine, however, it's buggy, and confusing. Would not recommend unless you are really bored."

15475,"I'm just going to start out with the building mechanics of this game are extremely grindy and no wall or roof section rotation are just a breaker for me, can't even get into the game with how terrible it is. Stay tuned, I will give it a little longer and update this review, but at this time I cannot recommend it.

Continuing with my review, more on building, apparently building causes all resources within a set distance to stop respawning, now while this can be tailored in the settings, that leads me into my next feedback.

All the settings that can be tweaked were a bit confusing, some you had to turn up to decrease them others you had to turn down to increase them while some you had to turn up to increase, and well, you get the idea, but there are so many and you can end up screwing up the feel of the game so easily, it's all a bit much and seems completely unnecessary.

Purpose, this game is pretty well purely a survival game, I am sure there are those that would call it a sandbox survival, but as I've said, the sandbox aspect is so minimal it just sucks.  As for the survival aspect, I have played a couple of these pure survival games and it just ends up being a chore to the point where I would rather dig a hole in the backyard in the real world over 3 hours of getting enough stone to make a 4 bedroom house.  My thing with survival games is, well, if you want the real feel, then there has to be real risk, as in if you die, you lose everything, and I mean everything, but it is never that way in these type of games, you drop your pack and lose an hour of farming and crafting, so really survival just isn't enough of a point to like the game.  They did add a little ""quest"" to defeat the almighty overseer, but first you will need to beat a limited number of bosses, but first you must visit several horribly balanced caves to obtain an artifact that when combined allows you to fight a boss, then you get the joys of going to those caves again for the next boss........grind.

The dinosaurs are cool and the graphics are lovely in my opinion, however the gameplay lacks so much that I would have to say I enjoyed PixArk more.

If I were to recommend an alternative, Conan:Exiles, at least the combat is fun, the building is much better and more indepth, the survival is just as pointless, but it does have a similar objective that is less grindy."

15492,"The best dinosaur survival game out there. Games like Beasts of Bermuda, The Isle, Path of Titans and others cannot compete. This game is a grind, and commitment is required. Friends make it easier (and more fun!)

Ark:se takes survival to an unfathomable level. You must face starvation, predatory dinosaurs, harsh biomes, and other players all while struggling to survive. You will die many times over, but you will overcome the challenges.

There are currently 180+ creatures in Ark, and most of them will kill you or die trying. Each has its own special use, with some overlapping. You will need to tame them to succeed. Many of them make harvesting resources much easier so you spend less time grinding. And plus, there's nothing that beats the feeling of slaying the dinosaurs that have put you in the grave using a better dino.

Vanilla is very adjustable and almost every setting can be tweeked. There are thousands of mods that make the game so much easier for casual style players. My favorite mod is definitely Structures+, however there are plenty more if you don't enjoy strict vanilla.

Because this game has such a steep learning curve, most players will be discouraged from attempting to learn. However, the community is truly amazing and has everything you will ever need. There are written guides, video guides, websites specifically for resources and taming guides. If you have a question, the community has already answered it!"

15531,"Eh. Its extremely difficult, even when you spawn in an area that is  ""easy"". Theres a lvl 140 dino ready to kick your ass.  Finding a server is very difficult, there official ones are either full or no one is on it.  Playing single player is boring. 

Joined some private servers that have  too many mods being used and changes the game completely, or joined a server where there's VIP/give real money to get items. 

If you are going to play, make sure its with a group of friends otherwise finding a server is difficult.

15578,"The game has many problems, mostly the fact that it might possibly be the worst optimized game ever created. High disk space, frequent lag, long loading times. If you have the patience or hardware to get past that, though, it's pretty fun. There's a lot to do and even more with friends.

The game also caters to the hardcore PvP playerbase, meaning it's pretty unbalanced in PvE. Most of the issues with that can be mitigated with server settings or mods though."

15597,"This game is trash! Pure and simple.

Trying to play this is like running one of those rigs on that MudRunner game; an exercise in [u]extreeeeeeme[/u] patience. It's so poorly optimised and I've got a fairly new gaming rig. Also, over 100GB download [u]just to even play the damn game[/u] will need to be downloaded so you'd best be sure you really do want to play this because the time spent waiting for it to install won't be repaid quickly by gameplay!

I wasted almost an entire half-day trying to get this piece of junk to install. I should have known Steam was trying to tell me ""don't waste your time with this garbage!"" as it took an aaaaaaaage to download lol

Don't waste your time, trust me... over 100GB of your space can be BETTER used to store BETTER games on Steam, or Epic, or Origin for that matter! DON'T PLAY THIS... JUST DON'T!!!"

15599,"fun, but at times annoying"
15600,very good game
15601,very nice game
15602,"There are so many issues that just ruin the game:
1.) Its laggy, you will be ported around a lot.

2.) The performance is poor. I can easily play games with much better visuals, but ark just looks terrible and is still slow.

3.) Skill system is simply increasing max of what ever.. e.g. max stamina, max water etc. there are no real skills.

4.) Hunger jumps back and forth . You eat, it goes up a bit, than rapdily falls down, then jumps back up, etc. It seems to be random.

5.) But the worst of all, are the controls. There is a toolbar with up to ten usuable items on it, and the mousewheel does not scroll through the toolbar, but instead changes to third person view and back to first person.
You cannot harvest stuff while you have something in one hand, so you need to unequip it then harvest then equip again.
Even the campfire has a full circle menu.
When you build a house, you need to build all walls individually then place them.
If you want to pick up something you get to visible response, meaning you sometimes pick up the wrong item etc.


-> The game feels like an alpha version of some indie title."
15603,i cant join servers with that anti cheat thing i install it but it says i didnt what the hell

Never have i ever felt such anger. 
 all i wanted was to play with my friend. 

but all they give us is shitty tether

shitty fucking tether.

and if you want to play official well get ready to pay up paypig becuse you need all dlc. 

Dident even buy this but i got robbed today."
15612,s'pretty good.
15613,Good game. Very addictive
15614,"litterarly the worst gaming experience i have EVER had. this game does EVERYTHING to piss you off, its even impossible to host a simple server cus its so buggy. all i ask is to be able to play with friends. Even this minor feature it manages to f*ck up...
absolutly unbelievable.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!"
15615,"It would be a nice game if there wasn't constant issues with connecting to friends servers either time out or just crashing. You can find a whole bunch of ""fixes"" online but they all say the same thing, meaning if you have done all those and still doesn't work you are SOL. This is an ongoing issue, you can tell that by the amount of threads stating the same issues all in different years."
15616,this game is a lot of fun but the one thing is you have to grind to get good
15617,I've never been so scared of hearing footsteps and noises.

EDIT: Fall damage seems to be fixed."
15627,"my friend turning trans
his pp: but you didnt have to cut me off
oh yeah the game is good"
15628,"This is a perfect example of developers and gamers thinking that making a game super grindy is fun and challenging. ARK fails to be both. The game-play is repetitive and boring. The crafting lacks intuitiveness and logic, the map is completely useless, and the game overall fails to have any real direction. Even putting on a couple cheats and exploring the world left a ton to be desired. I got this game on a free weekend, and I still want to ask for a refund. Not sure at all how this game became popular, unless it was just from a bunch of trend followers drooling over youtubers. Have at it if this is your thing, but this is a terrible game in my opinion."
15629,do not recommend
15630,fun

15695,"dinosaurios y survival, nashexxxxxx"
15696,"Have played Ark religiously for the past 6 years, finally have it on a decent PC and I've been missing out. If you love survival games, cave diving, boss fights, hunting for that perfect tame, breeding armies to your specifications or raiding other people's bases....this is absolutely a must. I play a lot of single player as I am older and dont have time for raiding much anymore, and even the singe player customizable settings are worth the purchase."
15697,freinds+dino=fun
15698,"This game is terrible. For a free game, it has some quality, but it is not something I'd dedicate meaningful work into. Whenever you die somewhere remotely far from your spawn, you're forced to either fist-fight raptors naked or  make equipment, by that time your equipment would've despawned. Even if you make it to your body in time, the thing which killed you still sits there, camping your body to fight you again. Not to mention the absent moderation on official servers and/or admin power abuse. Adding to the idiocy, the the animals that can steal your items have the worst balancing. One moment, you're doing whatever you may be doing, the next, the weapon you have  is stolen by a random bird. Then it proceeds to thieve the rest of your food and equipment because you have no ranged weapons. The whole game looks to be some sort of freak show. The shaders are absolutely terrible, making the water too reflective, and the day-time sky near blinding. If you happen to die at night, you can't see 5 inches in front of you, and have no easy way of lighting the area around you. Not to mention how the garbage temperature system is intuitive, wanting you to cool down somehow then immediately asking you to heat up. Not to mention the obscure way to progress, forcing you to sit around and wait for something to happen. There is also no tutorial (or anything similar), leaving me to wander spawn, confused on what to do. I don't know if I'm doing a mistake in any of these ridiculous things, or it happens by chance, but it just happens to make this game one of the worst I've ever played. It may be easy to start out with for others, but I can barely scrounge up a reason to barely like this game."

15730,"Wasted a few summers on this game on the ps4 version. Great time killer and the process of leveling up is addicting. Starting from nothing and eventually building up to something. The grinding never stops so there is always something to do to keep you busy. Having more people to play with makes the re-buildup process much quicker after you log back on and find out your base/tames you spend hours, days, weeks, or even months doesn't exist. Find people you trust and form alliances to help ensure everything you worked for doesn't get wiped. Build Conquer Thrive. Just remember that once you devote yourself to ark, there is no turning back... It will always find a way back into your life. Long live the Great Khans."

15791,"10/10, I started playing it on my pc recently but have had the game for 4+ years on my Playstation. Great storyline and 10/10 gameplay. Can't wait for Ark 2 to release."
15792,"I think this game is better for multiplayer. once I found admin commands, it sort of ruined the whole experience for me."

"
15819,"Big dinosaur, Very good"
15820,yes
15821,"Survival games are a second jobs, but this game takes it to the extreme.
Combining RPG style level progression with multiple skills.
You can go into pvp and get murdered by 12 year olds and get your poor shack raided while you're offline... kind of like Rust.
You can play this in a PVE or single player mode, but then you see that the game is made for groups of people and it is not made for single player.

If you want a second job, or maybe you just don't have one and you need to feel like you're doing something, sure, download 120GB of 2017 game that spent years in early access and released paid DLC before a full release of the game."
15822,Ark fun hehehehe
15823,good
15824,"There are so many horrendous bugs, sometimes even game ruining ones, like bloodstalkers floating off into the sky and other tamed dinos falling through the map, but you get to ride T-Rexes so I give it a 7/10: would recommend riding a T-Rex."

15829,Good game. If you have friends to play with in this game then it is a bit tricky because the multiplayer is buggy but other then that the game is very good. Also should get while its free until the 19th. The game does have some bugs but not game breaking. 9/10

15861,"BADLY OPTIMIZED, HORRIBLE UI AND UX, TERRIBLE DESIGN DECISIONS (WHY ARE THERE 3 TYPES OF WOOD). JUST PLAY MINECRAFT WITH A DINOSAUR MOD."

15864,eh ok
15865,dino dick
15866,no
15867,"yes
"
15868,"this is a game that has, to my knowledge, made a completely new genre of open world multiplayer, a genre that is like Minecraft but not. in fact, it is more like no man's sky without planet-hopping, well, actually, no. the map are not procedurally generated at all. it's actually like conan: exiles really. the problem is that it's REALLY F***ING BUGGY. on other reviews, i've seen people use ark as a level of bugginess. and while the bugs may have been patched, and my computer being below par is cause for others, the bugginess is still hard to ignore. all they need to do is maintain the game{in reference}, and yet they're an ark 2! it's kinda stupid. but, i did have fun playing it, and i still have hope that they'll fix it, and i don't want to stand out, soooo, i'm giving it a up, but don't expect me to play it anytime soon"
15869,i suggest using a mod called primal fear its very good i recomended it:D
15870,gey
15871,best game ever
15872,"I like the idea of this game but it feels too grindy and theres too much waiting, couldnt they made some sort of singleplayer mode ?"
15873,How the fuck do i delete dlc's i currently have 3 GB left on my pc LET ME DELETE THE FORDUR DLCC!!1 would recommend
15874,It is very good

15880,"good dirt
"
15881,"I have played Ark on and off for a few years and let me warn anyone that this game is hard! I run a dedicated server now and the players often complain about how frustrating this game can be however it is a risk and reward scenario. The longer you play, the more effort you put in, the more amazing the game is. If you are up to the challenge this game is great but if you are a casual gamer, avoid this title."
15882,amazing game
15883,k
15884,Big dino pet very good game
15885,good game ♥
15886,"This game aged very differently from a lot of games. Unlike a lot games where they age like fine wine, this one aged like store-bought cheese, edible, but, would you really do it? with a hefty price like this, you would expect absolutely smooth graphics but this game made my pc explode. 

Go outside naked, you have a better survival experience than this game."

15925,Chep
15926,"great game and lovely they're giving it out for free now, but 375GB really? needs some compression"
15927,;l
15928,"I enjoy a bit playing this game overall at least 100 hour (2 accounts). Its not a bad game and taming dinos are joyful.
However what really started to piss me of is some unreasonable facts:

I stay near the Camp Fire with Leather outfit and eatting 20 cooked meats. My characters is slowly dying because its too cold and some other unrecognizable status effect (black red smth). WTF? Like how can it be too cold when im literralty staying inside camp fire, eatting processed food in safe place.

I built a raft and was sailing through the ocean. Suddenly ""GOD decided to drop from heaven some little raptors (these with sleeping effect) that were chassing me after like insane in the middle of the ocean for no reason. I wasnt afraid as my hero was brave and
wanted to swim away. But No no no... wild dino decided to break the real life physics, teleported through the wooden foundation floor and jumped inside my boat. Then good sleeped and got killed. Great really makes sense.

Reborning? Respawning after getting killed? no worries you can choose the bed to respawn at the same place.
After respawning, where the heck is my bed, it suddenty decided to go away.

Did you think that you can sleep in the SLEEPING BAG or in BED? Dude are you mad?
You cant sleep there in neither Single Player not MP they are only for respawn purposes - LEGIT as F...

Save Gam... save games what? Never heard of it before. You better use SP command cheat:
admincheat saveworld 
and
manually copy backup save folder like in medieval ages. Afterall it's challening game, isn't it?

Do you rush too much with you houseboat?
Be prepared for self disappearing lost tamed dinos. Be grateful for your wasted time!

Really just go outside and have fun there or play another game.
Unless you are a sadomasochist like me, but im done with it.

15935,Its a good game with a lot of mods
15936,สนุกกว่าที่คิดไว้เยอะเลย ตอนแรกคิดว่ามันจะยากกว่านี้ แต่สำหรับใครที่จะเล่นต้องมีพื้นที่ในคอมพิวเตอร์พอสมควรเพราะใช้พื้นที่ค่อนข้างเยอะ ผมได้มาตอนที่เกมนี้แจกฟรีในเดือนมิถุนายน2565 บอกเลยว่าผมแนะนำเกมนี้เลยครับสำหรับใครที่มีพื้นที่คอมพอเป็นเกมเอาชีวิตรอดที่เล่นเพลินมาก
15937,nice game
15938,"Played half an hour.
- Had no idea what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to go.
- Crafted a spear, stabbed a dino to get its hide, spear broke on the first hit.
- Couldn't pick up a stone if I was holding a hatchet.
- Randomly defecated on the beach.
- Got jumped by a bunch of dinos that vastly outleveled me, in the starting area.
- Still had no idea what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to go."

15941,yes
15942,"Its an amazing game untill u discover pvp servers. Then it stopps being a game and becomes a full time job.
and you may want to kill ur self at times, raiding a weaker player makes u wonna continue playing. Would recommend it to everyone."

I uninstalled the game promptly after that.  thank god i didnt spend any money on it or id demand a refund."

15990,"Well, I wanted to play this game but it kept crashing.  It's not like my rig couldn't handle it.  I have an i7 with a GTX 1050 TI and 8 gigs of ram.  Another thing I noticed was Windows 10 itself came to a screeching halt even though the game was closed; and when Windows did work, the files took forever to load.  After uninstalling the game, I was able to get my computer back and my files load immediately.  I never had this issue with any game I installed in my system before.  And don't give me ""it's a spec issue"" because I have run Cyperpunk 2077 full settings 116 to 132 FPS easy!  I wanted to enjoy this game but I simply couldn't so uninstalled."

16015,Yes bug
16016,"No need for a long list of pros and cons here. With Ark, we own more content, more action, more survival, more mounts, more crafting than you will ever need...ever. 
This title has been in my library for some time...years, I think? I kept pushing it back for other titles and opportunities that are no longer viable. And well, after a brief download, I went in with zero to none knowledge of the game. Within a few hours, I was able to complete my quest for survival on a whole other level than I anticipated.
Am I mad that I waited so long to play? Yes, and no. I missed out on several expansions over the years, but the sweet part is that I can jump into any one of the creative expansions available (most are free atm) and team with the pros. The pvp and pve both have the NPC to overcome...and believe me, you haven't lived until you narrowly escape the relentless pursuit of a pack of wolves...not any kind of wolf though, it's the Pre-modern man kind. 

What are you waiting for? Why are you still here? Get out there and fight for your other real life...Ark."

16039,"The concept was great for a survival game when it was about dinosaurs (wish I had tried it when it first came out), now they have lasers, robots, alphabet soup of genders, and other crap. The game still has a lot of issues/bugs and it's not well optimized over all these years, it doesn't really take away from the fun just rather sad they can't or won't fix them (just adding in maps and creatures.) 

Then they had to become yet another company that has to pander to muh pride in June (that went over well,) then they'll move on to [next current thing I support]. Then they gave away the game to anyone just to hype up Ark 2 which is Dark-Exile (which they are changing how the game is so that will more than likely be a huge flop.)"
16040,"this game is so damn fun especially if you get some of the dlc's playing with friends is so fun and im not trying to get this game sales but deffinetly get at least a couple dlc's because it is so fun and your will have so much fun, (and probably shit your pants from the jump scars)"

16043,"This is the most broken trash I have ever seen. Even singleplayer, the most BASIC game mode, has a massively game breaking bug that prevents ANY long-term gameplay. Resources that have not yet respawned when you exit to the main menu will never respawn again. This issue has existed since 2018 and the developers REFUSE to fix it! DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME! I can hardly even recommend getting it for free. To top it all off, the developers would rather make a whole new game than fix the game people payed for!"
16044,"3/5 stars
This game has the potential to be so much fun with friends but it lacks on the technical side of things.
constant crashes and bugs in game such as getting magnetized to a dinosaur while trying to run from it can make it a huge headache. But the potential it has for fun makes up for it... kinda.  Do not buy if you don't have friends to play with"

16048,"I will be honest, this game is actually awesome but the official online servers are so bad that I had to make my review a dislike. I spent an hour at one point attempting to connect to a server with an official max capacity of 70, yet the server only ever showed a max of 64 players online. I attempted to connect to the server directly through View>Servers on Steam and choose the 'join when slot opens' option and for an hour no slot opened. Not sure if this is a failure for Steam to ping the server or Ark to respond (my money is on Ark).

16049,"The linux client will crash whenever you try to click on anything in the menu so those on steam deck will have to force proton, even with proton my frames got cut down by 75%. So the steam deck users probably will want to rip out their eyes while trying to get this to play smoothly on that.

If I can get it to work on the native client like how it is advertised to work then I could change this review because funny dinosaur game where you can poop goes brrrr







TLDR: Doesn't work natively on linux, windows is unoptimized, install minecraft with the ArkCraft mod to get a better experience"
16050,after 40 hours in a pvp server i can say this game is worst game for pvp. you work hard to build a big base with stone walls and high lvl players destroy your base with 100 c4 charges. like its really easy for them to get c4 and grenades so that makes the buildings like nothing(shit useless) and you have a gun and cant even shoot the players because they run with the speed of light. this is bullshit. these 2 issues are enough. but i cant deny the pve is good and you have full freedom to build everything in the game. wish there wasnt that much c4 and grenades like candies. i heard c4 charges are really expensive in rust so you cant just fly all over the map with a dino and destroy all the buildings.
16051,Fun Game Cant wait for ark 2
16052,Dino go bRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

16059,"good game, hard but good. def a grind"
16060,its very fun
16061,good
16062,really good game 10/10 i have 8000+ hours over on xbox evey play the game sense i was like 9 love the game play it NOW im not asking
16063,Pretty good game if you have months of time on your fingertips
16064,Epic :)
16065,"The doggos in this game come in a wide variety of forms:

Passive, aggressive, maniacially aggressive to the point where I run halfway across the map to escape them, bing chillin, or borderline cute.

The doggos can be leveled up, given lots of food, they can help build your base, and they can forage material for you! Just like doggos in the real world, except these ones are A LOT bigger."
16066,it is fun
16067,I like the game But im super mad i wasted 30$ Usd on it when it was free. but great game never the less
16068,rawr
16069,"This game is alright, with excellent graphics and terrain....but this game should focus more on quality and features.

1. Tether. I shouldn't have to explain this. Tether is the worst feature in this entire game. It throws other people off the land or gets them killed. Even at max tether, it's still not that much space and they should add a way to stop tether.
2. Crashes. During multi-player, people have crashed or glitched out.
3. Lag. It takes at least a minute to load an artifact cave.
4. The amount of space it takes. It takes about 200 gigabytes for the game. It takes so much space but then gets rid of space it doesn't use.
5. While people are happy about Ark being free, the people who paid for it didn't get their money back. We didn't get anything back.
6. In Ark 2, please add a feature that gets rid of Tek and Riot armor. This is a dinosaur survival game. Not a game where you become Iron Man. I know you can get rid of engrams but things like terminals and boss portals are still a thing.
7. I have had multiple Dinosaurs fall through maps and could not get them back. Please add a command to teleport dinosaurs to you or some sort of structure. 
8. Dino taming. Please add more passive tames. It doesn't make sense how you fill a dino with tranq darts, force-feed it food with no other option, and it's somehow your friend?
9. Ragdoll. It may not seem like a problem until you get swarmed by dead bodies that somehow stretched across the map. There is clearly enough money for death animations. You did it with Bosses and...Compys?
10. When other players crash in the non dedicated server, it takes more than one try to get them back in the game.


These are only a few problems with Ark. Please fix your game or get rid of these in Ark 2."

"
16127,ark is so shit but play it fo sho fo sho
16128,idk I haven't played it that much
16129,"It is a survival game therefore it is very intense. You can rationalize that you are in a sandbox. So what do you do in a Sandbox? Have fun and don't take it so serious. So there are a lot of adjustments in the options and settings to adjust your play levels. You can make it as hard as possible or make it as easy as possible. I am shooting for the middle as this is my first time playing.
The graphics are stunning and the sheer size of the game map (The Island) will give a player tons of game time. Overall I would recommend.
"
16130,shit fucking game

^I have a GTX 1080 for reference (low/medium graphics)

Who made this shitty game? I am unable to host a game that anybody can join and I have to have some battle pass shit that costs money to join an open server.

16225,"Works 10%  of the time. Got it for free, still not worth it"
16226,"I wrote a more in-depth review, but Steam decided that it went missing. So, here is the short and sweet version.

If you can pick up this game for free, then great, enjoy some time with it.

If you don't own it yet, and the sale is over, you may want to reconsider. By no means am I telling you not to purchase ARK, if you have your heart set on it, then get it. 

The reason why I wrote this review isn't to comment on the game itself, but rather the studio that owns it and the side-effects of ""ARK overdose"".

Studio Wildcard is about as unreliable as they come. Without fail they constantly delay DLCs and updates, break other features with said updates, and don't fix the current problems with the updates. If ARK was just an elaborate cash-grab, then I wouldn't even be mad, because it worked well, very well.

Just take these words as another viewpoint of ARK. Consider if the investment into this game is worth it, worth your time and energy. For the many hours that I played this game on my Xbox account, It certainly wasn't worth it for me. Most of the time that I had fun while playing was with friends. We weren't even taking it seriously, just a couple lads screwing off for a couple hours, and ARK was how we did it. But when you were just playing by yourself, it got depressing. I mean, the burnout that I had from this game was second to none. I had stopped playing a few years back, tried it out at this recent Steam sale, and it is exactly what I expected.

If this sounded like a rant, I'm sorry about that. I probably vented too much. All that I ask is for you to consider what I said above.

Is it really worth it?


Edit: I forgot to mention that you need a NASA supercomputer and their storage space to even run this game. Seriously, the base game is 125 Gb? Not even including all the DLCs, then it goes up to 250+! The DLCs also cost about as much as the base game, each!"
16227,GOOD
16228,GOOD GAME SOLO OR WITH FRIENDS
16229,cool game
16230,nice game
16231,very fun survival game
16232,this game is really nice
16233,very fun
16234,"10/10 if u have no aspirations in life and want to be a virgin 4ever
"
16235,"really fun with friends, although I wish it was easier to set up a server, or that when hosting a non dedicated server others did not have a distance limit around me"
16236,"After more extensive thought, one would assume that one of the most advanced and comprehensive creations that has ever been thought up by the Human race, especially in the 21st century due to fierce competition such as popular media like ‘The Big Bang Theory’ and ‘Rick and Morty’, would be the development of the video game commonly referred to as Ark Survival Evolved which is renown for inspiring a childlike wonder in all who play. God bless Ark Survival Evolved. Similarly, there would be a hint of irony and it would be very hypocritical for oneself to ignore the fact that although such historical work like Ark Survival Evolved does have a place in all of our hearts, from its engaging characters, advanced mechanics, varying terrain and a complex ecosystem that teaches you from very early on that this isn’t a normal game. This game is designed for gamers, particularly those who practise against minorities. Ark Survival Evolved is more than a video game, it is the foundation for many strong relationships where love is cherished. This is where E-girlfriends are most common. E-girlfriends, E-girlfriends as far as the eye can see. Even the most experienced and battle tested veterans that have graced the immersive and welcoming community that resides within Ark Survival Evolved will spend days searching for the perfect E-girlfriend which has loyalty and a keen sense of respect. They even remember important dates and anniversaries such as Birthdays and they are often prone to assembling cucks from far and wide in order to appease their Boyfriends from yonder lands through parties which mostly take place at the Centre Arena on Friday nights around 8:00PM PST."
16237,its free for now

16294,supa cool game yes yes
16295,ok
16296,i like the challenge of surviving in this game where you actually get hurt punching trees it is nice that it seems to follow some kind of logic with punching trees and know it will hurt you
16297,"Thanks for the help from no one.  Hope the game is better with fewer players. 
Seriously though, if you spawn on a mature server you just get killed immediately.  Start a new server with some friends and it will be fun.

16298,"The game is a relaxing but, tough survival game . Even, tho there are a ton and I mean a ton of walking survival games . This may be in the mid range for survival island games . I wouldn't say it's great . I've noticed a ton of bugs and weird glitches within my 6 hour playtime . 

 However, the game is relaxing and fun with friends ."
16299,Would not reccomend.
16300,"Just feels unfinished. No guidance, buggy and in general just not what I expected. While it's fun for a little at the beginning, I started hating it because pets kept attacking stuff and dying despite being told not to. 
Have fun catching a fucking OTTER for 30 minutes that needs fish BODIES you have to drag to them to tame only for it to die or despawn later on. 
Nah."

"
16360,"ive played this game for like 80 hours on xbox and its really fun survival game, but if you dont have a good dino to tame in the beginning you are going to constantly get your shit rocked by low level dinos until you have a gun or find a good dino to tame. also the pooping mechanic is useless why is that a thing? there is also some other stuff like the sun being so bright that it turns your screen white when you look in its general direction and the terrible UI. mostly this game is fun with friends but its ok to play alone sometimes."

After it took AGES TO DOWNLOAD with one of the most game space I have ever downloaded... about massive 120 GB!!!!!
I expected much less lag and better graphics than on console... well again I got dissapointed... I know every server is different, but even Conan Exiles or DayZ became better in terms of lags and playability... it feels this game got stuck since it came out... Iam really sorry to say, but I will delete it, allthough I love Survival games...Last hope will be ARK 2!!!"

16400,this game is super fun but watch out and try not to rage because it is really hard at first and expect to get raided
16401,"have 5k hours on ps4, this game will make you the most racist person in the world that even your mirror will be scared of you"
16402,"The game is great. Everything is about experimenting things yourself. It's a survival game with the survival experience. An experience you have to learn and die and get PTSD to a massive fucking dinosaur stomping you out in your house.

The game for me is very difficult, but mainly because I refuse to look anything up. I believe this game is best played blind, because otherwise you would loose the true survival experience. But I still love this game, even if I'm too scared of that dinosaur to leave where I had settled."
16403,its a good game
16404,"You spawn, you get tools, you get raped by a raptor aaaaaand repeat"
16405,"This survival game is both thrilling and challenging! There will be some rage, yes, though like some people say"" ""You reap what you sow""!"

16407,"pretty good

After you do that you can drag their body to the nearest water source to drown them.  This is repeatable for your enjoyment.

16422,it is a really fun game with lots of things you can do. The only problem that I find with the game is that the raptors come from everywhere and guard your stuff/base.
16423,Great game have lots of old memories on it and new ones too. Really recommend anyone getting it and trying it out.
16424,Poggr
16425,A game I would recommend you getting. A multiplayer game where you can tame dinosaurs and create your own base. Basically minecraft but with dinosaurs = a lot of fun
16426,"The game is pretty and all but whats the point of it really?
It's a prettier and smoother but less interesting version of minecraft.

16431,"this is the most frustrating thing i have ever come across, first my game crashes after a few minutes and then when im trying to report the issue i have to make a profile on their website and they have a security question asking witch was the first dlc they put out ""idfk! how would i know"" ´later´ but for some f*cking reason i cant log in and now i have to wait 15 minutes because i have tried too many times F.U.C.K OFF"
16432,"It took my about 4 hours to set up a port forwarded server.
That may have been a nightmare but that doesn't mean I don't like the game. I've actually played it for about 250 hours on Epic before transferring it to get achievements and for ease of access so I definitely recommend it. For an ultra casual like me, the base game is difficult and grindy but if you are a filthy casual as well, don't be afraid to change whatever settings allow you to have fun."

16524,"After map Fjordur  I decided to write an review. This game is very good with mods or without, I reccomend playing this game if you like dinosaurs and mythologic creatures. Fjordur is very good map with very good new creatures, my favourite creature is desmodus, it's  very fast and it has many capabilities from other dinos. In this game you can build beautiful structures and get new friends on PVE, or fight others and try dominate server on PVP. This game also has DLCs free and paid, for everyone there will be probably one map that will be his most liked. Ark survival evolved has very good and interesting storyline. If this review didn't make you to like this game, maybe you will like Ark survival evolved 2, coming in 2023."

16587,oh holy lord above give me my time back
16588,"At first release times, this game were trash. Now it's a rock solid game. If you are interested in dinosaurs and a maniac who like to tame them by throwing rock to head of living things. Guys, it's the best for you. It still has some problems with fps, idk how but it TAKES A BIG BITE FROM YOUR SSD or HDD. I'm not a fan of Tek items. It doesn't fit with the idea of living in a world with dinosaurs. If you dont like either just don't use them.
pluses
+ Guys, it's a game that you can tame and pet dinosaurs
+ You can feel that you're not the hunter but the hunt.(Haven't you chased by a raptor?)
+ Can have a dodo army????
+ Got really good maps and normal ones.
+ Has multiplayer and singleplayer options.
Minuses 
-Got problems with fps.
-Takes a big bite from your memory space.
-Sometimes when you join a server, some maniacs can keep you in a prison.
-If you don't like gathering it's not for you.
"
16589,This game is nice and all of the maps has so good dinos and places to build your home.
16590,Would've been better if the game wasn't 180gbs. For context that's more space than Forza Horizon 5 and Elden Ring combined.
16591,VERY FUNNY GAME

16593,idk man its fun tho a little buggy at times but really good solid 8/10
16594,"Ark: Survival Evolved has the potential to be a wonderful game. It's clear that the developers put a lot of work into the 3D open world that comprises the players' environment.

Unfortunately, the game experience comprises more than simply the world environment. The interface between the player and that world, especially in a game that requires extensive crafting, is vital to the gaming experience. The Ark interface is a failure in that regard. It is clear that it was created by coders, rather than people who have actually done UX design before.

It's funny. I saw game streamers #Markiplier and #JackSepticEye playing a pre-release version of the game, and the interface was much simpler and cleaner than the current hodgepodge of unrelated features that make up the crafting, inventory, tech, and animal training functions.

Oh yeah. A lot of the text on these screens is impossible to read from more than 2 feet away from the monitor.

Rating 2/5 stars for unpleasant gameplay, but the potential for a 5 star game is there."

16596,👍
16597,if you want to get killed by a group of Raptors play this game
16598,"Ark is like having a girlfriend
At the beginning you work really hard and put in the time to get things to work out, you dedicate days of your time trying to getting everything perfect, you end up loosing sleep over it and having it play on the back of your mind when you aren't thing about it, but in the end there is always someone better than you who ends up taking it all from you leaving you with nothing but a screwed up sleep schedule and all your hard work gone.

i recommend this game"

16646,"Running up a snowy mountain firing a machine gun at a woolly mammoth from the back of a tyrannosaurus is a fantastic example of the reason many video games exist: living out ridiculous childhood fantasies. ARK: Survival Evolved has plenty of that to go around across its multiple sprawling maps - which it calls ARKs - which can be explored solo or crowded with up to 100 players. Some lingering technical issues, bad dino AI, and an extreme amount of grinding to reach endgame are the main factors keeping it from being as sharp in the tooth as it could be.

Like many of the survival/crafting games of the genre it partially helped popularize, ARK dumps you on the beaches of a massive, foreboding island with just enough clothing to stay modest and your own two fists. From there, the challenge is to stay fed and hydrated while avoiding a huge variety of terrifyingly detailed dinosaurs and other beasts long enough to progress up the tech tree. Early in the life of a character, you might be taking out dilophosaurs with throwing spears and hoping a triceratops doesn’t come and knock your thatch hut over in the middle of the night.


From there, there’s a really nice flow of technological progression that makes advancement feel like more than just an increase in stats. Thirty hours later, you may preside from a sturdy stone castle from atop which you snipe pterasaurs out of the air with a rifle. By the endgame, it’s possible to have a massive steel fortress full of blast furnaces, complete with electric lighting and gas generators, churning out components for building rocket launchers and SCUBA gear.

label=A%20Lumbering%20Beast

But the excitement is dulled as the amount of menial grinding required to reach the higher tiers of technology goes up exponentially, to the point where it could take an entire day of playtime just to stock up on ammunition for certain weapons. This can cause things to really start to drag when you’re just getting access to some of the most interesting tech - especially if you don’t have a large tribe of other players to help you divide the labor. It’s one of those games that can be played solo, but at least on PvP servers, I wouldn’t recommend it.

Players are your greatest opportunity and your greatest danger.On public PvP servers, other players are both your greatest opportunity and greatest danger. As I learned the hard way more than once, making sure your shelters are hidden from potential looters is far more important than making sure they are strong, and I often returned from less than 12 hours offline to find my barricades wrecked and hours worth of resource harvesting hauled off. Things get much better if you can work your way into a strong tribe of players that can protect your stuff 24/7.


In offline single-player, there’s actually an extensive and detailed sort of campaign to follow that will take you to a variety of monster-filled caves to acquire artifacts and summon three challenging bosses. There’s a giant spider queen and a bona-fide fire-breathing dragon! These encounters show quite a bit of attention to detail, though they rely a bit too heavily on summoned minions to increase the difficulty. It’s also extremely punishing to lose in one of these encounters because not only will you lose any armor, weapons, and ammo you had equipped - potentially several hours of gathering and crafting - but you’ll also lose the artifacts needed to summon the boss, forcing you to replay those challenging caves all over again.

Narrative flourish distinguishes ARK from its genre brethren.Defeating all three bosses unlocks an endgame dungeon that reveals a surprising amount of backstory behind the ARKs and their purpose, which came as a pleasant surprise in a game that’s ostensibly just about riding dinosaurs around and smelting ore on first glance. It’s this narrative flourish more than anything that really distinguishes ARK from its genre brethren. The sheer amount of time and effort required to get there the traditional way is probably more than most solo players have the attention span for – even after more than 60 hours of focused play I had to resort to using console commands to shortcut certain steps just to be able to access the final area in time to write this review.

label=Every%20Size%20and%20Shape

Beyond the bosses, I was highly impressed by the diversity of creatures crammed into each ARK - most of which can be tamed, and many can even be ridden once the appropriate saddle is unlocked and crafted. From bumbling, docile dodos all the way up to the colossal, carnivorous Gigantosaurus (Latin for “I bet you wish I was merely a T-Rex”), each looks fantastic and has a distinct set of behaviors you’ll have to learn to deal with them. Riding with a pack of direwolves or taking flight on the feathered argentavis for the first time were major highlights of my ARK experience. The process of taming itself is just annoying, though. It consists of knocking your future pet unconscious and then feeding it while it slumbers, waiting for a painstakingly slow (especially on larger creatures) taming bar to complete. It’s the epitome of the “Sit around waiting for something to finish” activities that are ARK’s weakest components.


Though ARK has emerged from a long early access period with most of its nastiest bugs fixed, there are still weird graphical glitches all over the place, like shadows popping in and out randomly and intermittent frame rate dips. Worst of all is the fact that the AI on larger dinosaurs is pretty terrible. The best strategy for killing anything beefier than a raptor remains getting it stuck on the terrain and plinking it in the head from total safety. Even my own tamed dinosaurs often get stuck in trees when moving through a forest if I don’t babysit them, and in some cases became so badly stuck in caves that I had to kill them to recover the items they were holding and move on.

Verdict
When I’m having a good time in ARK, I’m having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, I’m still hungry to play more after the 60 hours I’ve spent so far. There aren’t a lot of survival games that have legitimately held my attention that long."

16661,"No, i can't quite recommend this game unless you want everything stripped from you with nothing you can do to stop it, or if you like having enemies you literally can't kill spawn in and annhilate you, or if you like not being able to recover your last items because there's 4 different dinosaurs above your corpse 5 times your level because you stepped 2 feet from the easy zone.
Apparently i do like that."
16662,"This is possibly the worst optimization I've seen in a game. I spent most of my time on the server list window which kept freezing for a long time trying to load all the servers, after finally getting in game everything was super sluggish. Although my specs are recommended for High settings, I could barely play it on Low without all the freezes. About 150GB of badly coded software basically."

Number 2 can sit on the shelf. I don, t recommend games when they have a lot of comments from more serious players then myself, I have  beta tested games , gw2, fo3,4,76, me3, andromeda, Skyrim online, Recommend a no kill zone until peeps feel comfortable with the game up to at least level five, and then either boost them out or freeze their level until they move out of it.

16684,played the mobile version for few years before getting my pc and i bought ark for 80$ best 80$ ive spent in my life graphics are life changing and the soundtrack OMG is soooo good and nostalgic this game is my ideal survival game the only downside is the large storage space it takes up almost 1 terabyte to download most of the dlc's highly recommend getting this before june 19 to get ark for free this game is a masterpiece and has a special place in my heart

16696,"only pay for this game if you truly hate yourself. only worth the disk space if free, you hate yourself and you want to live a second life.

i never understood the way people would write reviews and put ark survival evolved in the bugs section
i know better now.

its not like i hate the game, i actually enjoyed playing for the 3.5 seconds that i had a clean slate with no bugs

it takes 12+ hours to join any server and by the time it downloads the 2 mods needed for a server ill have travelled the world, started a family and finished every single university degree 

everything from launching the game, joining a server or even updating the game has issues.
id keep going but i would wear our the 100 million clicks on my keyboard"

16705,
16706,Good game & lots of content but stupidly take a lot of disk space. Solution? buy new 1T Hard DIsk.
16707,.
16708,"ARK Survival Evolved, the title alone makes so much more sense once you played the game. It truly is an evolved survival experience! ARK is one of those games you‘d imagine in your daydreams. Lots of unique Dinos that you can tame and ride, building your own Jurassic Park and all of that with your friends. And they did a phenomenal job!
There are some downsides like Loading times, file size (this game is 375GB for me not including 2 DLCs) overall smoothening the game experience and I‘d suggest to truly appreciate this game you‘d need quite a decent PC. Despite that this game has everything you can wish for! More than 400 unique creatures in total to see and tame, Bossfights, base building, workshop mod support and events after 6 years! Plus, it’s for free now! (Not including Genisis 1 and Genisis 2). There is a lot of content to see and experience so it is hard to put it all into words. This game has a very wide variety of content and I do believe there‘s something for everyone in this game.
I‘d rate this game 8 out of 10 due to the downsides I already mentioned. My biggest issue is probably that my game is taking nearly 400GB of space and that it‘s not always the most smooth running game. Despite that the massive amount of content and mod support is just amazing."

10/10 would recommend"

16716,I can finally have dinosaur friends :)
16717,"This game is very fun. I spawned in on a beach then my bones broke from how cold this regular beach was, and how hungry I was. most dinos are cracked so dying a lot early game is my favourite part. but honestly ARK is a pretty good survival game because my character pooped."
16718,i want my life back
16719,Dinosaurs
16720,Idk what I would do if some of these creatures still exists😌😌
16721,"The game is very interesting and fun to play. The goal of the first day is just to build a base that is gonna be safe to stay in, and later you can go and tame some dinos. I am just really enjoing it."
16722,"Wildcard, please look up ""Data Compression"" on Wikipedia and then consider doing it.
I hope that by the time Ark 2 is out you learn how, but I highly doubt it.

16729,"I will admit, it was a free game when I tried it out and got the download. That being said, it is a rather fun survival game..... looks like you get to be the pack leader of your own set of dinos. I have only played single player, but the problem I have is the force exits and random restarts/deaths due to glitches. It does seem like a fun game, but it seems even more buggy than fallout new vegas was on launch. While I would rate this game a 3.5/5 so far, the 1.5 it is lacking is completely due to stability issues. I would buy ark2 now.... if it was out and if i thought it was stable"

16748,"Typical case of good concept, poor execution. 
Game is a buggy mess, constant clipping issues, sloppy dinosaur and AI design and not to mention the incredibly poor optimization. The game has been out for years now and instead of fixing these issues, they've pushed out further content, more dinosaurs, DLCs and events and now they're planning on releasing Ark 2.0. 
I just hope they can learn from their past mistakes and make Ark 2 what this should have been in the first place.

If anything now is a good time to get it whilst the game is free, but I honestly can't recommend it to anyone unless it's heavily discounted during a sale."

Edit: Maybe a fix, boot via ""join"" from the friends list drop down next to host.

Ok after many many hours of trying to get this working ""right"" we have gotten it down. The multiplayer very much feels like it is still in early access at times, and do not have your dinos fall from a rock (they will die), other than that it really is a fun game."

16821," I wanted to like this game I really did.

It looks great and I haven't had any game breaking bugs but I just can't

It's aggravating
It's annoying 
It's tedious


While it's very pretty and has a great core concept I just can't keep playing as the randomness and unfairness of the game gets to me.  Sometimes you'll spawn in and die in seconds to a dino that's also spawned there.

Ok try again...oh goody a alpha raptor pack comes by and kills me and my tame in two seconds.

Third try. Got a better spawn this time. No nasty dino's close by. Build a smallish base. Get a few tames, things are looking up. Oh  then a Titanasaur wanders thru and flattens your base while all your arrows can't even hurt it.

Fourth try.  Going good again.  Got some nice tames, got a decent base, got some armour and a rifle so time to explore a little? Nope. Killed crossing the river by 4 piranhas and two crocs who grab onto you so running away is impossible.

Quit game, uninstall.

It's true game doesn't pretend to be fair or structured in anyway and for some that may be a positive but for me I'll pass.  Real life is aggregating enough I sure don't need it in my games."
16822,ark is the way. ark is amazing. ark made me realize that im nothing without this game.
16823,"Initially I paid for this game and returned after 30min because it was so confusing and unpolished. Now the game is free and I decided to give it another try as months have passed by as well. The game still feels messy, with weird colored fonts displayed overlaying other text, no guidance whatsoever for new players, poor optimization and poorer graphics. The netcode seems to be pretty bad too as I joined a server with only 80ms and PvE felt super buggy. 

I remember years ago when they were pitching this game. It was suppose to be revolutionary. It's years later and this is what we get, this to me tells a lot about this studio."
16824,good free game
16825,game is dogshit. i dont recommend

16827,HM
16828,when i craft something it doesn't give it to me
16829,"Its a cool dino game
"
16830,"It's terrible.

First off, the game is HUGE.  Like, ridiculously huge.  The game assets are poorly optimised and duplicated, so it's astounding how much disk space it consumes for the relatively mediocre graphics and models.

Secondly, it's very, VERY easy to get caught in a loop of respawn -> immediately die.  IMMEDIATELY die, as in within seconds.  The tryhards will stress ""it's a survival game"" and ""you need situational awareness"", except neither of those factors mean anything when the game can and does repeatedly respawn you right next to a dino that can both outrun you and kill you in 2-3 hits.  That's not fun, that's frustration for the sake of frustration.

Thirdly, the game is extremely directionless.  There's absolutely no help at the lower levels.  You'll look up guides on how to sleep.  How to pick up rocks.  And so on and so forth.  The game is made for people who already know how to play it, which means complete newbies are going to experience nothing but frustration.  And then, I assume, many will (like me) question why they keep around a game that consumes such a collossal amount of disk space when it isn't fun to play."
16831,gut
16832,my favorite game
16833,
16834,"I paid absolutely nothing for this game.  I died 3 times in the span of 5 minutes.  There are no tutorials, no indications on where to start, the only on-screen indicator was that I had levelled up and it didn't even tell me how to open up my inventory.  No Man's Sky was better value for my money and I paid (#DIV/0!) times as much for it.

Yeah, I know there are tutorials that I can access on the Internet, but for an $80 game it's garbage."
16835,"I played on a priv server - not a public one so I won't comment on what the community/culture of the game is like, just the gameplay! 

Starting off is a little complicated, and sometimes annoying. In first 10 spawns I got ganged up on by a pack of huge dinos that wouldn't leave me alone - which made starting out a bit of a bummer. The game can also feel  a bit overwhelming. I had to look at a lot of tutorials on how things work, how to build, tame, etc... plus also found out there is a compost bin bug which is annoying.

HOWEVER - Dinosaurs made it so much fun! I made a saddle for a Parasaur i named Banana and a got triceratops named Jevin, and they are great as carry mules and fun to ride :) Me and my partner have been building a small base, and now that we have the basics all learnt, we've been taming dinos left and right, and i'm currently building a little Dodo pen for our Dodos. It's a really fun game once you get started and i'm really enjoying myself! Again - not sure how public servers are, but I love the priv server we made and it's definitely a fun game to play with friends."
16836,This game is like learning to ride a bike but the bike is on fire and you realize its not a bike but instead you're on a metal chair contraption with spikes on it and its constantly jabbing in the back till you lose the feeling of pain and all your emotions are eventually stripped away leaving you feel like an empty shell.

16856,"I've got over 42 days of playtime on the Windows version.
Need I say more?

If Yes, here you go: ARK is an incredible game, for the most part. If you're planning on getting it, get it on Steam. It has BY FAR the least bugs, though it is still buggy, and for such a massive game, load times aren't insane, mod support is great, and direct-hosted multiplayer servers are available. ARK is my favorite game of all time, and I'd rate it a solid 8/10."
16857,"better than rust
"
16858,It's so fucking exiting
16859,very fun game and with mods its even more fun
16860,I love this game! It even runs on lower end pcs and that's what I love about it. Only issue is it takes up lots of space but the graphics are amazing and they are fairly decent on low graphics. Personally I don't like the pvp aspect of it just because it's really weird but that's just me. The pve is endless fun and I never get bored. I definitely recommend this game to anyone.
16861,Optimize your game instead of making a second one

16868,"45 minutes in... not impressed. So far its a non-user friendly rip-off of Conan Exiles: Isle of Siptah (""Exiles""). Ex. Exiles has an intro and something of a story, theres a prompt to your journy. Ark does not. Exiles has a bit of a tutorial that leads you into the adventure. Ark has nothing of the sort. 

will update at two hours play time... but for now... even though i got it free... just no."

16870,Awesome game Recommend everyone to play. Few bugs Crashes when I join a server but other than that recommend anyone to play it. I would be glad to have ark 2 but I will work my way to that hope everyone enjoys this game :) keep smiling
16871,my only complaint is how large and unoptimized it is. other than that its a great game if you boost resource gathering multipliers. overall 7.9 / 10
16872,ARK is a game where you can basically do anything you want
16873,Ispent 15 hours just maxing out levels

Settings don't save properly and get reset when you go back to main menu/restart game. Looked online, its been a bug for 2 years and never got fixed. If something as simple as that doesn't get fixed, your game doesn't deserve my time.
I now understand why its being given for free."

"
16888,"decided to try ark again after 4 years. 

worst decision i have ever made on steam.

the game is absolutely unplayable due to latency issues when more than 5 people are connected to a server. (im american playing on NA servers). if you play on a PVE server. you literally have no available space to build with because every server has been absolutely riddled with random foundations and posts so that no one can ever build anything. and theres no recourse to it, because you cant even destroy them like on a pvp server.

all in all... absolute disgrace that in 4 years, the same problems are still gamebreaking.

i saw ark 2 was announced, so i took a chance on relearning a bit about ark after a few years of not playing... total mistake.

stay away from this game if you enjoy sanity.

i forgot to mention it randomly crashes every 30 minutes or so.... on a 3080"
16889,good
16890,GET EATEN BY DINOSAUR HAHAHAHAHSAHHASHADYUAHDAHDHASHDHASDHASDHASDH

16896,10/10 IGN
16897,"I liked how easy you can make this game. for example i can turn up the taming speed and lower the torpor which allows me to tame the basic dinos and progress relatively easy.  I also love the randomness of ark, like how I can turn a corner and find an alpha raptor trying to kill me. I dont like how thicc the game is and it took all day to download but if you watch some videos learning to play this game is fun and easy. I love how its free for the time being and Im so glad to play a high quality game like this one."

Extremely not beginner friendly and way too hard to learn. I would not recommend this game to anyone except insomniacs so that they can finally get some rest. The only thing I will give this game is that the atmosphere is pretty ok and character creation is in my opinion the best thing about the game I had such a blast with the character selection. my conclusion is that it's a worse version of rust."

16929,I love this game.
16930,"Where are the quality of life updates? I can't even split stacks or eat food from a container, play Valheim instead."
16931,"Picked up the original, pre-tek cave on the island, ARK long, long ago.
At 1.3~k hours deep, it's still fun.
The game is very unforgiving, and extremely time consuming if you play with normal, unmodified tame and breeding rates, unless you are playing online, with friends, where the times keep moving when you aren't.
There's still a bit of jank in it, even now, but over all it's come a long way and admittedly, will likely remain one of my favorites for some time to come. 
As someone who greatly enjoys PvE-survival, where I'm not also forced to do major combat every thirty seconds to 'survive', it's got my 'Do play, is fun' seal of approval.
I will forever stand by this statement however; Leeds suck, and are pointless unless you have a severe issue with PvP rafts, Ichthyornis needs to be disabled because they're still not fixed, and Gigant's can fall off a cliff and die as a collective whole, but at least they serve a purpose other than pissing off players.
Replace all 3 with Dodo's and have fun with ARK: Survival Evolved, it's worth buying when it's on sale. (It's a very large, and now expansion heavy, game, so I will always recommend 'sale price'.)"

16968,"dam this game takes up a lot of space, but its worth it. best game ive seen in years. I have to restart my pc just so I can play, kinda funny ig. The DLC's are nice, but even so you can still get the creatures within them from the GMsummon cheat. I would only get the dlc's if you want to play the map(s). The game can also get really laggy, even though I have a monster pc. Ton of bugs, I was gliding with my maewing in the abberation map and got stuck in a whole in the map, near the rock drake eggs.

If you start the game not knowing what to do, your doomed. I started the game after reading the wiki page, on taming, farming, weapons, etc. So read that before you start, or you will die asap.

I would like to see albinos in the game tho- I love them B)"

It keeps bringing me back because of the awesome gameplay, fun and spontaneous adventures and of course; Dinosaurs!! I love base building and designing houses/bases/cathedrals/etc. This game provides that in an abundance. There is soo much to do in this game and it keeps updating with more and more content. Fantastic game and will continue to play until my very last carno!"
16973,Always loved Dinosaurs.  I like the way the developers made them move in what we think is realistic ways.  I also like building bases.  The building process was greatly improved from the original and makes things easier to work with.  Awesome game.

If you made it this far, I applaud you. But in all seriousness, this game is really fun. I usually don't enjoy survival games, but the flow of leveling up, stat allocation, dinosaur interaction, and every other thing I mentioned simply flow SO WELL together. If you love dinosaurs, you'll love this game. Is it without its faults? Absolutely not. Is it free on steam (til Jan 19th 2022) and worth a try? HELL YES!

Also there are MODS! Everything under the sun that you could think ""Dang if only they'd done X as well/instead"" trust me, there's a mod for it in the workshop. Come try it out, I guarantee it's worth the time."

17028,"Got it for free, umm it's pretty good i guess"
17029,"Fun game, great if you wanna buy a private server or maybe even your own world for solo play.

All public servers are ruined in every single way possible, solely by the community. Playing multiplayer on your own world, not a server, is unviable due to tethering. So buy the game and then spend money again on the server so you can play it, similar to minecraft if that scammy way."

You must stay within a certain tiny radius of your host

The game is mildly funny with friends

With all content it is 400GB+

Do not buy this

17039,"What an amazing game. So easy to spend hundreds and hundreds of hours on. That being said, the company who made it is total fu c-king trash who only cares about money. In what world is an almost 300 gig game with 20+ gig updates okay? OPTIMIZE THE FU C-KING GAME ALREADY.  The company doesnt give two sh-its about any optimizing, just the fat sales. But hey, its okay cause Ark 2 is coming out. I'm sure its gonna be the same garbage since the company doesnt care.  Buy at your own risk. 
Is the game amazing? Yes, you will want to run home and play it. 
Is it frustrating to deal with? More then any words can say. Its buggy and unoptimized trash that needs its own PC for storage."

i also really like the varying colors and patterns, the sounds they all make, and the tek animals! super neat addition.
i've been playing this for somewhere around 3 years (i had it on my old xbox) and i've always loved paleontology, ever since i was a kid. highly recommend to paleo enthusiasts, survival game enjoyers, and anyone looking for a fun co-op game!

17069,"Eh... as a big fan of survival games, I was expecting better. The UI is confusing, the animations are pretty bad, and there's a lot of RNG-hell. Also, the description is wrong... you don't start naked. Big disappointment to those of you who wanted to play nekked girls, haha! :) But there are better games for that anyway. It's not all negative though... the leveling system is decent, some of the visuals are pretty good, and the confusing UI is eventually workable. Also, I can't help but chuckle like a school child whenever someone rips one... even though it makes no sense in the context of your character, who could be wearing a suit made of chitons and out comes a dookie. Poop jokes aside though, there were just too many rookie mistakes in this game for me to really enjoy it. And inb4 someone comes back with ""but it's free!""... yeah, that doesn't cut the mustard with me. If I had to pay for this game, I'd probably have been rather upset. Play it for some laughs if you want, but to be brutally honest, your time would probably be better spent elsewhere. An alright effort by the developers... the potential is there, but it needs a lot of work.

EDIT: I played the game for more time after I wrote my initial review but my opinion hasn't changed in the end. Honestly, the game got a bit boring after awhile too. I guess if you're into team play then it's more fun but as a single-player survival game, look elsewhere."

17091,"I have over 2000 hours on PS4 ARK, this game used to be so popular and fair. But when the mana came out the game got unfair and then everyone soon had wyverns and it was just impossible to play solo on official servers like me. Anyway ARK used to be my full time job, playing 16 hours a day just to hatch my babies and raise them to 100% boosted lvl, i would only sleep 4 hours a day to protect my base and always hide my dinos in the transfer and I used to always live on a boat or build a secret base in a underwater cave. I would always get offline raided and my addiction finally stopped. But I am glad that I played this game. But I do not recommend playing official ark if you are not prepared to play 16 hours a day."

17109,"I love the game, I just don't like the cheaters. I've been playing the game for years. I started on Xbox, and then moved over to PC for a better experience, but it ended up being a worse experience. With so many sites that can track your character, many users are using the name of ""123"", which helps prevent tracking, but it also limits any type of punishment for abuse for those particular players. I don't mind the game play, when it's played the right way. 

Yeah, there are people that complain about bigger tribes picking on them, but it happens. That's part of the game. There's just more to it though. With the use is ESP, aimbot and other cheats, it just makes a game that is already based on survival, even harder. Wildcard can't stop the cheating, so they don't even try, they just keep releasing content to grab and much $$$ as possible. I hope Ark 2 is better, because I'm looking forward to playing it, but if the same cheats are around for Ark 2, you can count me out for that as well."

And when I say immediately, I was sometimes killed be a giant predator in a <2 minutes after respawn. Also, for a survival game, there aren't any unique death animations, you just take damage and when your health is too low you slump over. I wish I could give a more in depth review, but the game wouldn't let me progress far enough to do that."

17164,"I'm glad this game is free.
I played for 2 hours, got tired of dying and deleted it.
people were nice and gave me tips, but the game is still so weird! I played with a AMD5800H RTX 3070 

respawns are wild, the graphics are ugly and glichy, nothing like the trailers suggested, dinosaurs behave so weird they either surprise you, or they group on you, or just run away never to be seen again.
The ""easy"" areas have LVL 95 dinos in them who one shot you from nowhere!  the easy places have Piranhas in the water, these fish swat you and get you stuck in the water and then kill you.
people block whole Islands with their castles, which makes traveling a huge waste of time.

I regret playing 2 hours, that's how much I hate it , it's a game made for kids in winter holidays who can play 20 hours a day, not for normal people with lives who want to enjoy"

It did not feel right you to lose your newly tamed dino because you could not kill the attacker when nothing happened bc of imput lag. I was alone on this server and still it lagged. I assume the European servers are not in actual Europe. Leaving it at recommended, as I do not actually know anything of the gameplay. I played only about 20 hours and most of it was dying bc of lag and running back to my bag. And I got it for free. For a free game I got my money's worth XD"

There IS story, but it's minor and it's not like ""follow the quest line"" type of game, it's more collectibles you can find throughout playing the game.

Made it to level 25. Had my very first tamed Dinos. Wanted to move away from the beach and live on a small island, yeah good luck that. Got killed and couldnt respawn on my bed even tho I left it there just in case. So now everything is gone cause I got killed again trying to find my poor dinos.

Very frustrating, not much fun because of that.

It is as if the developers at studio wildcard reached deep into the depths of game creation and brought to life the effluent of open world survival genre, presets are thrown together like faeces from an apes hand. The game only appeals to halfwits and incestuous goblins from a long lineage of inbreeding with egos so fragile if you insult their cult-like tribe they will completely destroy your router in a sadistic paroxysm. I have 26 hours which I will never be able to retrieve but I do not regret playing ark survival evolved,  as I now know a definitive method to identify sexual deviants and online predators.

17324,"I played some of ARK, and I like the ideas, but sometimes the execution just isn't there. It's minecraft with dinosaurs. Good  enough

but building is a huge pain, taming dinosaurs can be a bit aimless not to mention time consuming (I spent about 25 minutes taming a dinosaur after spending an extra 8 or so trying to find out just what it prefers to eat), the path finding on the dinos are broken at times, the map could use a tiny bit of improvement, these all sound like complaints, but they aren't because I ""get it"", it's meant to be an immersive experience, and that's cool, but a ""survival"" campaign and a more ""arcadey"" campaign would've been a bit better. Getting lost in the woods because night time may as well be a black screen while a raptor comes up and shanks you can be...eh, kinda annoying, but the options to change these settings do exist. There is technology like torches, lights, and even electrical equipment, but the constant juggling of items due to weight limits and trying to work with storage is just as much a pain. I can offload my cargo to my tamed dinos but they have to not die from everything to be useful.

and then ARK's probably biggest offender is time itself, I get it's supposed to be satisfying to build up to a fully sustained agricultural society but man it turns into a huge time sink quickly. I got it for free from the ARK 2 announcement, and there are things to enjoy it but really it just makes me want to play dwarf fortress which I'm waiting for the world to build while I write this.


I recommend this game but with the full warning that it's a game you have be very patient with"

17347,"This is the first bad review I've ever written, and the first game that I actually think that it's unplayable. It's a fantastic idea, it has epic scenery, good graphics and so on.

What isn't great is choosing the easiest location and still getting clapped by raptors that you can't run away from, can't fight, can't sneak past and will lose all your dinos and items you have grinded for thus far, because they will stay where raptors killed you. So I got locked in endless cycle of making the most rudamentary weapons and armor and then losing it.

From the technical side - the ubiquitous high mouse latency, that makes it hard to aim at anything (but I can't take it into consideration since it is common for almost any modern game). Inventory and menus drops my fps to about 5, making it pretty annoying. And 125 GB of space occupied because of uncompressed files? 

And where I even have not gotten - getting base destroyed by RNG spawn of OP dinos, getting griefed by non-rookie and higher level players in multiplayer.

This game is absolute grind that pretty much guarantees you that you'll lose everything. From my experience - one of the few games that is literally unplayable.

Edit: So, I was fortunate enough to not get attacked by agressive dinos and actually could play the game. After getting 3 trikes, I could actually travel somewhere. After a while T-Rex (AFAIK it's supposed to be one of the hardest dinos in the game) spawned and I thought it was over, but I completely destroyed him - for some reason, when I was starting, I almost couldn't move without dying at the start and now after getting few a dinos in about an hour I'm unbeatable by regular dinos, makes sense. But my PC crashed and now all my settings and world settings are reset and my character is gone. Anti-corruption backup file didn't work, steam cloud does not contain any ARK file. I can see a chest I placed earlier, so maybe my dinos are still there and the new character owns them, but that means I have to get to them from scratch, which means I'm going to be dying for a long time before i can think about getting any progress. I think I'm done with this game."

17363,"I like survival games, but not does where you can lose everything what you hard grinded in several hours.

Start was hard (no one explains something), but i got into it (Solo).

Later a Rex spawned near my house. Now you can think what happened -> destroyed half of my base
Ok, lured him away to an another big buddy. 
Went back and started repairing and crafting again.

Good, around 30mins later the same Rex came again and destroyed all things. 
Tried to get back to pick up my inventory, but it was an endless loop in dying 
..... and no, i don´t want to cheat. 

Think with friends and others it would be easier and funny, but how said, losing everything to start from all over again ? 
In online servers it´s a bigger mess,. While you´re offline you can lose everything. -_-
Sry, but not after my taste. 



Graphics, details and animations of dinosaurs/dragons/creatures are made good. Insects look a bit crap.
Environment is ok. Saw better ones and with fewer graphic glitches.
About data compromise we shouldn´t talk here. -_-


Maybe i think over it and try solo again later with different pre-settings -> (feels like cheating) (Ծ‸ Ծ), but currently....

17373,"Started the game, had fun for a few hours, then some disease infected player ran by me, infecting me. The disease was very annoying and wouldn't go away so I looked it up on a wiki. Turns out it never goes away, persists across character deaths, and the only cure is made from ingredients from higher-level areas, impossible to get for a new player. Meaning the only solution is the start from the beginning with a new character, throwing away hours of progress, and hope nobody infects you again. Uninstalled."

so about the game

*I've been playing for a while, it get very grindy and raptors will murder you.
*while I'm offline in a public server apparently people will find where you log off and kill you with a creature that doesn't 
 exist in that particular map
*never trust people named gus

Over all this game can be fun if you play with a friend, And that is the best way to play, otherwise you will logoff feeling irritated because the game can be very unfair"

17442,no like
17443,very boring game when you play by the rules or play alone in single player with no changes to the game settings. The online clan type aspect of this game is definitely the best part playing with a group of friends having fun abusing game mechanics to do cool stuff like putting a mech with a railgun on its back to tame a space whale is what makes this game have so much replay ability and content. definitely recommend this game 8 out of 10

17465,This game is better than getting pussy!!!
17466,"There are a lot of cool survival games out there.  Not this one, though.  This one is stupid.  It confuses arbitrary difficulty for fun, at least in the early game.  It's like this:  Die, respawn at your sleeping bag which is destroyed because you only get to respawn there once, get killed immediately by the thing that killed you last time, now respawn ""randomly"", in the middle of the night, with no weapons, clothes or torch, find your way back to your home in the dark, dying about 20 times, finally get there and try to grab your stuff, get killed by the thing that already killed you twice, respawn randomly again.  But hey, if you grind a few more hours you can build a bed which you can respawn at more than once.  Hooray.  Or, even better, go play Valheim."

17473,"without a doubt the worst, buggiest triple A game I have ever played. insanely bad joining and inviting mechanics, so many bugs that its become a meme, pumped out DLC's, slow game crashing mods, horrible difficulty scaling, prone to freezing and crashing. couldn't figure out how to join someone for a few hours (joining and inviting rarely works) figured out that you have to let your game stay frozen for a bit before it MIGHT work (usually gives an error message) also takes forever to start up a server if you're hosting it. I have no clue how this game was ever 60 dollars. TL;DR, buggy mess is a gross understatement, its free now and can be really fun with friends once you figure out how to get it working. try it out but make sure you have weed or or a cigarette nearby."

But after years, the company refuses to fix any of the visual glitches, the camera shake makes me motion sick and turning it down doesn't work anymore for some, and even on higher resolutions the game looks like it's playing in 240p. It has been YEARS. But instead of fixing it, they're trying to shove more content in and make an Ark 2 when the game is already overly massive and poorly optimized. I want to recommend Ark, but this studio does not deserve the thumbs up. I'm probably still gonna pour hours into this game, but I cannot recommend this game. I genuinely feel bad about buying the DLCs now since they clearly didn't put that money towards finally fixing things"
17537,"Extremely unintuitive game. Instructions for doing something as simple as create your own server and inviting your friends is a research project in itself. Then friends join server and immediately bleed to death. Other friends can't even locate the same server. Not recommended.

17539,"Decent game, but the difficulty curve solo is garbage.

being ambushed by packs hostile mobs, raptors spawning a foot away from my front door, carnivores AI only focusing on you even though there are plenty of other delicious meaty sticks that you run past, over-levelled mobs in easy areas, AI being able to attack through geometry, knocked out tames and them waking up and eating all your narcotics and meat you pack into them(Like they just disappear).... someone needs to playtest this online solo and actually balance some of the things to make it an experience you can survive, because as it stands, the game is really cheap in the sense that you will die constantly to things you shouldn't even be seeing until you have basic gear.

On the flip side, man, playing with even one other person pretty much stops all these problems, unfortunately, reliably getting people to play any game is just not even a thing... basically don't bother if you are planning to get people on board with the game and just talk to others online and create and online tribe (personally I don't like doing this as my work schedule means I can't reliably be online for ages or on certain days) 

Oh and guys, please stop building your bases at the spawn points and locking people into the easy spawns.... another major problem of being locked in or out of certain places essentially stopping you from gathering any resources online and bottlenecking you into spawning in the medium and hard zones.

Great game in concept, needs better spawning and levelling or I need better friends.

The game is unforgiving and grinding, and progress feels meaningless. 
It's just as easy to die with resources as without. 
Cannot sleep in game, so you're wandering around in the mostly dark for half the game. 
Taming dinosaurs is irritating and time-consuming, and in the end there's barely anything you can do with them. 

I realized that I was not having fun. I was just irritated, struggling from one task to the next, only to realize that it wasn't even worth it in the end. There's a big sense of ""...Now what?"" 

On top of all of this, the game is super buggy and glitchy. So. It sucks. Not my thing."

17563,"bro if you download this in 2022 after its free..... just be ready jesus christ 




oh yea and not optimized :)"
17564,dinosur
17565,"I only got it for free, pretty sure m not a fan of this game. 
I don't know, there's sumthing bad about it.
I am really sorry for my 'not recommended' opinion, tis just not my thing."
17566,this game is so much fun to play with friend or alone with the amazing creature and the great story line 10/10 for me.
17567,You will die to every thing the game doesn't care what level you are or what you currently have in your inventory
17568,hrd
17569,"I have 5900x with a 2080 OC,but the game Still run like a Low End Set-up   , poorly optimized.

17571,I hate this game
17572,Fun and exciting
17573,"A+
"
17574,why do i get knocked out the second i get hit by a dinosour
17575,.
17576,"Ark.
"
17577,Played PVP official severs when the game first released on my xbox and I have never had a survival game entertain me for as long as this one has. Nowadays i would rather play PVE than PVP because most of the servers are dead. This game is extremely fun and can be very unforgiving. I recommend this game.
17578,"It's free and not $60 CAD, so yeah I can recommend this"
17579,its an endless loop of suffering just build up having a good start then afking for 1 min then get ur base get raided by a 500k hp stego and a lvl 156 character with a giga. but its just so addicting u just cant stop playing it
17580,"Pretty cool, i know nothing about dinosaurs which makes it fun. I mean if you do that's cool too. It's like Minecraft but not like Minecraft. But it is very cool, and don't look anything up because that ruins the fun i think. I personally play on single player so I can pause the game. But overall its so far fun, and very exiting, i do recommend."
17581,what do you call an upset dinosaur? a Dino-Sour
17582,rawr
17583,small dinos are mean
17584,"This game is fun but also very rage enducing, make sure you know how to play the game before trying it or else you will NOT like it."
17585,"Very challenging at first, but this is one of best games I have ever played."
17586,better than rust
17587,fun
17588,Tired of steam asking so giving it a negative review.
17589,pretty fun
17590,my potato pc can run it at 26-30 fps
17591,This game is fun BUT NOT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS. spent all day trying to join a friends server and also a non dedicated server and accomplished NOTHING. ridiculous. make it easier to join friends directly from steam or something
17592,"Easily the best free game Ive played. Games have come a long way. But there is no story. You just die, over and over. Level up, get stuff, build a base and die. Spawn right beside a trex and die. Swim across this river? Nope, you die. Everyone on the server would have to work together for this not to suck. Instead everyone attacks you to avoid the grind."
17593,"I have put over 300 hours into this game, and I have not even attempted to do the ""story"".  It is too fun to just tame dinos on a single player world.  
The only gripes I have with the game are that it is a very buggy game, and the amount of space it takes up on the hard drive.

But I have an army of turtles and there is a tickle chicken, plus all the other dinos are cool too."
17594,its fun untill your running home and find a pack of trodons.
17595,Those dodos didnt stand a chance
17596,Its a fun game I recommend it.
17597,"Very fun game, but I continue getting a glitch where I can't join my friends servers, this glitch is still going on, if anyone knows how to fix it, please comment."
17598,dino=good
17599,no
17600,I cant craft now
17601,yftfuy
17602,its super fgin to have a pet dodo
17603,STUPID FUCKING GAME THAT DOESENT WORK. TO EVEN PLAY THE GAME YOU NEED TO SPEND HOURS TROUBLE SHOOTING JUST TO END UP WITH A SHITTY MEDIOCRE EXPERIENCE THAT LEAVES YOU WITH A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH. FUCK YOU ARK AND YOUR RETARD DEVS.
17604,Good game
17605,i like it

17607,"I shot a dino in his cock and he died.

10/10 would shoot a dino-cock again."
17608,"This game is a lot of fun, this is one of the best survival games out there, the Play as a dino mod is also a lot of fun

Edit: Sorry, I probably should've put more effort into this review XD, I'll add more stuff about the game that way people can get a better idea of what the game is like"
17609,Wasted 13 hours just to get a bug where I can't join a server.
17610,yur
17611,shit
17612,"cool game, has 3 mechanics I really like, survival, rpg and dinosaurs xd"

17614,this sucks
17615,OUCH
17616,such a good game but is now even better because its free
17617,It became free so I should've just kept the money
17618,this game killed my sanity painfully
17619,me and 2 friends played it.    they proceeded to lock me in a cage and feed me poop till i passed out.   they said the game was 10/10.  i give it a meh
17620,pro but not the best graphics
17621,ME BREAK ROCK!!
17622,GOOD GAME
17623,Love this game. Spent hours and hours and still love discovering new areas and game mechanics.
17624,can´t play as BIG ASS CHCKEN 8===D
17625," good game but the genesis DLC is so bad dont buy it just get scorched earth, abberation, and extinction :)"
17626,"Good game I still dont know the cutroll that much and in ""creative"" mode I dont know how to spawn animals but its good games I got for free"
17627,dålig
17628,"i have a love-suicide relationship with this game. By the way, don't let my game time fool you, i have plenty more hours on the ps4. Also this review only talks about the single-player experience because i don't have enough free time for servers.

at some points i feel giddy with joy over all the possibilities and things i can do, all the dinos i can tame, all the shit i can build, the places to explore, the landscapes and caves to scavenge; it draws me in every time i see the icon on my desktop. At some points i look out on the island or cave i currently inhabit and i truly feel accomplished over what I've done over the many, many, many, many hours I've grinded. And that's just it. Grind.

The thought of it puts me off, can i really be bothered to collect, mine, chop, or otherwise massacre 300 of whatever material i need? Chances are the answer is no, and yet i sigh and slump in my seat, and get on with it. A simple way to fix this is to put the harvest gain from resources up several notches, a fix that i definitely could've done with many moons ago. However, this may gain the attention of sweaty virgins who haven't looked into a loved ones eyes since the last base raid, who will then proceed to list off your IP address, and call you a fake gamer. 

Exploration is my favourite part of any game, the preparation, the perilous unexpected situations, all par  for the course in many of my favourite games. Ark is a game that practically relies on exploration for you to progress, which is fine obviously, but the deaths are so ridiculously unforgiving and stressful that the mere mention of the mountain biomes makes me break out into a nervous sweat, and i begin reminiscing on when i flew over the aforementioned mountains, pressed the wrong button, fell off my pterosaur, plummeted several hundred feet, which was then proceeded by hours of trying to retrieve my best gear, only to give up and silently weep into my hands at 4am. 

Other cons that bugged me:

- Bugs, so fucking many bugs 
- atrocious combat
- bugs
- lacklustre base-building
- maybe im just an idiot but i couldnt find a simple way to play with a friend without playing on public servers
- b u g s
- the game lacks style or any semblence of imagination, no artisitic direction to capture my imagination

Overall, this game is ridiculously flawed, but, it's the definition of a guilty pleasure."

The temperature effects are bit extreme and could do with some tweaking and the multiplayer is absolutely terrible: just griefers and trolls destroying your work and imprisoning your character to force a hard reset just so they can milk you for blood bags. But aside from the Griefer-friendly multiplayer aspect (Being honest, the Dark Souls series is kinder in it's multiplayer than this game is) playing on a LAN or password protected with friends is a blast. And even the single player is fun and challenging."

17743,"Two and a half hours in I haven't encountered any bugs. Note I tried to grab the free DLC maps before installing and it and just three of them increased the required storage to over 200mb, so I had to disable those because I didn't have that kind of space on my pc. It does suck that you apparently cannot learn to craft everything and you have to rely on other people to craft other items if you want them, since I'm playing single player, but that's not a huge deal."
17744,the game barely even lets me play it always says a host connection error.
17745,ARK is one of those games that I always come back to.  I started playing 5 years ago on Xbox and now play on PC and it just keeps getting better.  I really enjoy to play solo personally and appreciate how easy this game makes it to balance the grind for single player.
17746,Ark is a very fun and unique game that I would deeply recommend to others.
17747,i got this game very early on and spend a lot of time in it. i got into some tribes made lots of friends and had some good fun. now looking back on it i can easily say ive been scammed hard by the frigin developers who dont care about the players as even if you try playing today you will still have the same bugs and problems we had in early acces. its been years and theyve been popping out dlcs and now even a second game but they still havent fixed a lot of errors from the early days and whats even worse is they are constantly adding new stuff to unbalance some mechanics even further. I really enjoyed the concept and the game not gonna lie. but the developers definitely suck. years later this game still plays like alpha version. i know because i was there when it was in alpha. very fun concept and some very fun mechanics but i am definitely not giving the studio any more money. they just want to milk us. take our money by tricking us with the huge potential of the concept. empty promises and never delivering a finished product. even when everyone knew the game was definitely not finished they released 2 dlcs. No man. Just NO

Don't buy this, the ""very positive"" reviews are bullshit, and don't waste your time on this"

Attempted to load new world.
Game froze on menu screen for 45mins.
Uninstalled."
17812,"This game looks terrible and the UI is very awkward. I'm playing on a very high end PC. There are some basic settings like VSync missing causing my computer to run at way over 300FPS. Using third party software to enable VSync doesnt get rid of the screen tearing, just reduces fan volume. It just seems like an Early Access game that is early in development. 

I got this game for free and I feel ripped off."

About the game, its a dinosaur meets futuristic tech meets lovecraftian abominations,
[SPOILER WARNING] the game is about getting of the arks(the island you start of) on to a corrupted earth,destroing said corruption and killing rockwell(main bad guy) to stop him on his crusade to take over more planets whit his aberrations of normal life.Yes this is a dinosaur game, and its great.
Gameplay:Survival PvP/PvE/Solo sandbox where you try to survive the extream enviroments the game puts you in like:
-a tropical island,

"
17825,"Ark is an amazing game and now that its free you can experience it with your friends. I have played this game on and off for about a year now and its one of the better games ive played on steam, Best of all if you like rust in pvp servers this is literally rust WITH FUCKING DINOSAURS. I do reccomend you buy it."
17826,mental game
17827,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

17868,ITS SO FUN
17869,"The graphics are okay. Game play sucks. The character is suppose to explore but can barely jump a log let alone climb a small boulder a 5-year-old child could climb with ease. The second you go into a jungle you're hot and need to find somewhere cool. Three steps back to the beach and you're freezing and need to find some place warm. When swimming, the character drowns, even when you keep his head out of the water, which lessens his exploration abilities. For beginners, game play is entirely trial and error, with no instruction on how anything functions. I got the game for free, so for me, it's a good game to use in creative mode, using the LeaveMeAlone cheat, when I need to relax after a stressful day and can focus more on building and less on exploring and fighting off dinosaurs. If it wasn't for this, I would delete the game and never play it again. Needless to say, I will not be trying the new Ark 2 when it comes out."

17906,minecraft with dinos....aiite
17907,"Buggy unfinished Roblox looking game with horrific performance, uncompressed files that take up way too much space, and art direction that looks like it was directed by a 3 year old. Survival mechanics seem non-existent and the menus and UI are horrifically cluttered and unintuitive. Feels like a broken buggy tech demo for a bad indie game. Not worth the mental effort of thinking about."
17908,"None of the files are compressed so it results in the base game taking up over 150 Gigabytes, let alone the dozens of gigabytes from the DLC maps, The performance on any system rarely goes above 80 frames besides the lower or medium settings which look like a 1990s experimental digital animation from Disney. The graphics are some of the worst of any survival game and they haven't updated them whatsoever. The prompts and menu navigation is dated and looks unfinished despite it being out for years. The only good thing is the funny experiences running from dangerous dinos with friends, but besides that the game is grindy and poor. I wasted £50 on this, should've been free from the beginning."

17973,"This game over seven years has evolved into a phenomenon. Is the game sometimes laggy? Yes? Does the game suck sometimes? Yes. Yet, I have put tons of hours into this game. I love dinosaurs, I'm okay at survival. For me it hits almost all the boxes. Survival mechanics that aren't too try-hard. Dinosaur collecting/taming. Grinding levels to eventually take on a boss with your friends. I mostly only play PVE and my PVP experience is limited, but I love this game."
17974,dinos go BURRRRR

works with a i5 gen 3 cpu and a gtx 960 4 gb gpu on medium settings with a minimum of 15 fps on hugely modded maps and on genesis part 2 while hosting own server on the same computer
Very nice
more than 1 play style
more than 1 mode
a few bugs here and there
overall not bad"

17983,play favrot game of all time
17984,"Unpolished and buggy. My leg broke because I began starving. Animal behavior consists of roaming around and pretending to eat or getting stuck between rocks unable to escape. 

Interface and text fonts are some o f the worst I've ever seen. Very poor impressions for what is supposed to be a fully released game.

Dinosaurs look great, but you can just watch a documentary or movie for that.

I got it for free and I want a refund.

18000,Scum-of-the-earth developers. Releases DLCs before finishing the game when it's still in early access (yes I know it's a long time ago). And now you're unable to buy DLCs separately; you are forced to buy all the DLCs even if you just want one. Don't support developers like this who are moneygrabbing whores.

18003, i have alot of hours in game as u can see and i come with the conclusion game bad
18004,Absolutely fantastic game. Still playing it happily after over 1k hours :)
18005,"323 GB + size with dlcs ? and on steam it says that disc space required 60 gb sure for the base game maybe but what about all the dlcs ? They at least should recommend that : Hey ! we got a Ftonn of dlcs and they are all huge in size so we recommend this size to clear up before downloading. My SSD ran out multiple times after trying to download it. I deleted multiple games just to clear 30 GB space for it. i cleared a 100 GB so it will have some free space. the next day i woke up and checked on it all the disc space was gone but the game still said 29,7/30 gb downloaded i was like this is a joke right ? checked disc space it was 125GB (the game files) And it was the same ammount of files like it was there a day before so I knew something is fucked up. uninstalled it and seen that it didnt display the 100GB that it downloaded but now with all the added dlcs steam could have estimated the disc space required. over 323 GB required space. just wow.. okay.. could be a nice game.  But probably i will play this game in my second life or maybe in  my third life because thats what i heard it is that grindy. Who knows some day i might come back to this game with more free space"
18006,good game
18007,Too many bugs and broken animations..not optimize.It was released in 2017 but has not been made this bugs yet.. not recommend.

18024,"It's buggy but good and a lot of bang for your buck. The insane amount of storage is a problem for many, but I use a small 2TB external hard drive for this game and GTA V. That way storage isn't an issue."
18025,"This game is survival, adventure and great game. I love the graphics, musics and mostly the design of the creatures. My most favorite part of the game is mostly taming and riding the dinosaurs. My favorite dinosaurs is T-rex, Baryonyx, Suchomimus, and Spinosaurus which is my most favorite dinosaur of all times. So let the survival adventure begin!🦖.

Also this game is now my favorite👍🦖

And then, there's the game itself. It's clunky, ugly and requires such a rig to be able to run properly they added 5-6 different launch options, ranging from 'no sky effects' to 'barebones game that cannot be a thing, even if it's 5 years old or more'.

18075,Weirdly not as bad as i heard. Takes a bit to get used to but otherwise one of the better survival style games.
18076,The game is free now but you can always pay with your mental health.
18077,"I would not recommend this game to anyone.

There is a severe imbalance here. Trying to play solo, every time I get a house built, start making machines to progress myself, the AI spawns a bunch of predators that kill me, often before I am able to get inside my house. The predators glitch through even stone walls and do damage. I can't get away. When they do kill me, I can't get back to my stuff and my house because the predators linger, stuck in some weird kill loop that has them endlessly attacking my house when there is no one (and no meat) there, or attacking some random herbivore corpse that wasn't there before, but is oddly so close to my corpse that I cant get my stuff back. 

Whats worse is the tuneable aspects of my single player server do not help. Turn down the dino damage? The AI just sends a pack of seven raptors instead of one or two. Heck, why not make a nearby triceratops attack randomly while im minding my own business chopping down trees? Those weird acid-spitting dinos? Lets make them appear randomly early on to spawn kill the player 7 times in a row til they rage quit.

I have a running theory that the players who got ARK free now that the sequel is dropping are being trolled by the developer with this not fun, nihilist version of the game. I will likely delete this from my libraries and forget about this joke of a game."
18078,Megalodon scares me enough to where I cannot enter the water. :(
18079,Bruh' if you don't already own this game and you call yourself a gamer then you got a problem.
18080,yes
18081,"I spent literally the entire day taming a few dinosaurs, trying to build a house, not being able to find stone inside giant boulders, and then having a dinosaur that was marked as ""level 1"" appear from nowhere and kill me and all of my pets in 1 hit

there's a ""tech tree"" where you level up and spend points to unlock the ability to build a square full of dirt but all you can do with that square of dirt is spend multiple days growing berries that you can just grab from literally any bush or fern in the game

everything in the game requires absurd amounts of resources you can't really get without the style of grinding you would find in a game where you could pay real money for resources

I unlocked the ability to smelt metal only to not be able to do it for two hours because I couldn't find dinosaurs to farm the 65 hides required to build a stone furnace that wouldn't kill me in one hit

and at the end of the day, all you can really do is build a house and then replace it with a better house. if that's what you're into, you'll have much more fun with a dinosaur themed mod for The Sims"
18082,One of the best games iv ever played hands down.

18087,"I feel sad for every person that has paid money for this game. Incredibly stupid mechanics , cant do anything without getting attacked by some lvl 100 mosquitoes at the easy area, i tried to tame a lvl 5 para and my wooden club broke like 5 times , i use the bola and as soon as i hit it i get attacked by mosquitoes and little raptors and it's just frustrating af, seriously im glad i never bought it even though i always wanted to play it its so badly made it's almost unplayable. just stupid and frustrating"
18088,"Really fun, lasts forever and is very expansive. I'd give the graphics a 9/10 and overall game enjoyment a 9/10 too. Worth the money although I got the free version that'd been given out for free"
18089,its really good when you get the hang of it 4/5 stars can get a little boring but good
18090,veri gud men

18093,it gud
18094,This game sucks. I bought the game and then loaded one of the DLC's but it doesn't recognize that I have it when I try to join in a game. It sends me back to the DLC page where it tells me to click play which does nothing. When I try to join another DLC it kicks me back to the DLC page where it tells me to download but I click on it and nothing happens. Wasted a half hour trying to join a game. Whoever created this game is an idiot.
18095,very fun

18111,"In light of ARK 2 being on the store page now, I just wanted to take my time to come back here and say that this is maybe the single worst game i have ever played. 0 redeeming qualities, boring ass game play and just a big straight hunk of ass. If you main this game i actually feel sorry for your parents and ancestors. You are automatically a bottom of the barrel human being with a terribly unfunny boring personality if you think running around aimlessly with dinosaurs is a good experience, even with friends the game is dead, i would rather stick a toothpick under my toenail and repeatedly bash it against a brick wall then have to play this ever again."

18136,"Ark is one of those games where you can find glitches on accident, then try to replicate the glitch and you fail at it. It is also one on the type of games where you end up making toilets for hours that happen to take way too many resources to make. Some of the recipes for items are ridiculous and stupid. So far I have not played Ark on PC for too long, but these are some of the things that I have noticed."
18137,good game not crazy buggy
18138,"Took a WHOLE day to download!!! Not to mention the game wouldn't stay in full screen, kept exiting every few seconds. I couldn't even play the game, since it kept freezing and crashing. Too bugged and overall a waste of my time."

18159,"Idk why yall are shitting on a 7 years old game… 
First things first I’ve never played it before (in ur good old days) because my old Laptop couldnt handle it back in the days and now it was out for free and my friends (that played ark already some years ago) asked if we want to play it all together.  We ended up playing it for 8 hours on our server we rented together and we had a pretty fun time and couldn't stop playing it, also there are plenty of maps for free for this game and tons of mods. Yeah of course its buggy but geez its 7 years old, right now for free, got a massive world and its not unplayable buggy. Also the fantasy creatures are imo not that bad, I think they are interesting tbh."
18160,easily one of my favorite games ever

18163,"Purchased on EGS before learning that Studio Wildcard specifically went out of their way to gimp that version of the game to disallow the use of mods. You can download mods. You can put them in the folder. You can configure everything to work. And then the game is still hard coded to not allow them.

They said a long time ago that mod support will come to EGS but they haven't done it, not even going so far as to remove the deliberate artificial block.

Now it's available for 'free' but I still can't play half the game because I refuse to pay $40 for access to DLCs I already have.

Just can't condone this kind of developer attitude. Purchased the game on EGS specifically to support the devs more and that's their attitude on it all. Fun game (in a small community setting with 'solo' server settings as ""normal ""settings are beyond laughable and just into the realm of bleak and depressing) but screw the devs."

Given that we haven't touched the game since like 2019, I wouldn't recommend. However, if you like games that are overly hard and a glutton for punishment; this game's for you."

18209,"I both absolutely love and hate this buggy, optimized mess of a game. Beware that the size of the game is very large, it will take up a lot of space. I love the gameplay aspects of taming, riding, and fighting dinos; and hate falling through the map at random points, frame drops due to terrible spawn management in certain areas of some maps, and generally trying to manage the bugs that come with each major update. Aside from the issues, Ark is addicting and the grind feels rewarding until near endgame, there is tons to explore and mods make it even better. Recommend picking this up when it is on sale, its not worth paying full price."
18210,"It's a fun, janky mess of a game. Why is it 160GB though? WTF."
18211,"Bad optimized. Good concept,poorly applied ! Time and nerves consuming..."
18212,"I know this game is played by more people than there are people who live in some smaller countries, so this negative review will probably amount to naught. But maybe the devs will see it, maybe I just want to vent because I'm really annoyed.

I've tried so hard to enjoy this game but I must be missing something fundamental because the incredible aggro and damage of these dinosaurs in ""starting easy areas"" are nuts. I started the game in single player and made it easier by changing some settings like how much damage I deal and how much damage monsters deal. I chose the easy starting beach on the basic map and quickly got murdered in the forest so I thought, ""got it, forest dangerous, stay on the beach for now."" So I stayed, created armor, weapons, made a beach camp, and even tamed a mount to ride. I then thought, ""alright, I have defenses and weapons and a chunky dino, let's explore just a bit. So I walk about 100ft down the shoreline and a pack of 3 level 35 raptors tear me to shreds in about 6 seconds. I was still only around level 18 in the starting area. The raptors then proceeded to never leave my dead body so I couldn't get my stuff back.

Okay, slight set back. So I make new armor and weapons and shields. Less than one in game day later a deinonychus decides he's fond of my camp so he decides to literally just stand around my base while I cower inside and he stays hovering around my base for TWO in game days. Never straying more than 50 ft away. I finally try peaking out to just run away, he sees me, kills me, then destroys my camp.

I absolutely rage quit for a day. I then google some tips like a noob. Most say you should get an army of dinos to protect you. Okay, I can get on board with that, let's try again. I rejoin the game, find a new private beach and slowly start building up again. I get 3 dodos tamed and 3 dilophosaurus. I finally get the nerve up to try leaving the 100ft radius around my house and within about 5 minutes of carefully exploring another deinonychus spots me, sprints through my dinos WHO ARE ALL ATTACKING HIM, comes right to me, breaks my shield in 3 hits, then kills me in 2 more. So, I'm done. I'm glad so many of you found enjoyment in this game but I'll be damned if I understand how I'm supposed to stand a chance against high level monsters that just patrol the starting area and pretty much insta kill you."
18213,fun with friends or alone :)

18216,"After doing some building, the game gets very boring. You're either taming dinos or unlocking recipes. Also multiplayer is very glitchy making it hard to play with others, and it's less fun by yourself"
18217,This game sucks
18218,bad.
18219,free was too expensive
18220,"Ark is one of my favorite games of all time. I also like to call it my therapy game. I went though a tough divorce about 5 years ago and this game kept me sane. It was my form of escapism. You feel immersed into another world that you get to explore! I have mostly done PVE and a little PVP. I started off playing vanilla on The Island years ago and I've played through most of the maps modded.  
As much as I love the game, it's fragile in the technical way. I've had a lot of technical things go wrong like servers not loading in right, audio cutting out, having to uninstall and reinstall the game several times... but the game has worked out for the better and they have made improvements throughout the years. 
So, overall I recommend Ark: Survival Evolved! Have some patience and you'll be rewarded with an awesome experience."

18252,cool game
18253,314 gigabytes for some of the dlc
18254,"Good game, they never optimized it though to be aware that there's a high chance it'll run very poorly. Also, just trying to play with friends on multiplayer is a nightmare. You have to jump through many hurdles just to make a server and connect to eachother (it's 2022, there's so many ways they can smooth out that experience but Wildcard chooses not to).

Keep in mind, this isn't even commenting on the fact that they left the game files uncompressed, meaning you'll have a fun time downloading almost 200 GBs of assets the game studio simply couldn't figure out how to compress, or the new Season Pass..? Why would a game like Ark need something like that?

If it was 7 years ago, and Ark just launched, I would give it slack. But it's not 7 years ago and the state of the game is a mess. But hey, they're giving it away for free so you can experience the mess for yourself."

18348,"Game is balanced for an MMO experience and punishes those who try to get single-player experience out of it.  Between this game's transparent aping for Fortnite and the sequel's obvious Dark Souls copycatting, what's the point of ARK that can't be achieved better in other games?"
18349,Can't even join a server
18350,"Yes although the game can freeze and be frustrating making you reinstall the game countless times it's fun solo,or even better with clans"

18353,"By far the best game I have played where you can accidentally eat poop.  I have never seen poop fall out of the sky in any other game, that is for sure.

My favorite part so far was the time I pooped and leveled up at the same time, so the game cheered on my character for pooping himself.

Looks amazing on Epic, but maybe setting everything to epic is why I can eat poop? Who knows."
18354,"Multiplayer is a pain in the ass to setup, I've tried more than 3 times. It never works."

18360,"Fun game to play with friends! but I'm only doing the not recommended because it's optimization is just god awful. I don't even have any of the major expansion DLCs, and it's over three hundred gigs.

Devs, I don't care if I enjoy the game or not, an entire hard drive dedicated to a SINGLE game is not okay. Fucking fix this, because if it was a more manageable size, you'd probably get a lot more fuckin sales. At the very least, don't let Ark 2 become the same."
18361,"it is awsome
"
18362,"imagine if every world survival game was crammed into a blender; drunk, and vomited on to your screen.

imagine the amount of time it takes in rust to build just a 1x1 and stretch that out beyond grind. you literally have to have no life and your parents love just to play the game in a small entirety just to get anywhere. 

i looked up a starter guide and shortly realized id rather read all religious scriptures in the world 2x over before i could even finish learning how to play this game. 

if time is the only thing you have in the world and nothing else beyond having any sort in life; this is for you."

18372,"its awesome that ark is free now as i used to always play ark on my xbox. games like ark always had a soft spot with me and i decided to take up other games like rust until i found out it was free. ark still even now is full of the experiences i loved and will continue to love and i believe that this may be another one of those games that will never lose its amazing qualities. there is only one downside to ark. vanilla ark with no addons has terrible space to quality optimizations its a very big game and takes a lot of space. 
to conclude it though, ark is my one of my favorite games and damn well may stay that way."

18384,"Malware.
It immediately tries to re-install itself when you try to un-install.
It's an un-optimised bug riddled mess, none of the files are compressed.
It stole the build mechanics from Conan Exile and somehow managed to make them worse.
''Horizon Zero Dawn'' was a hit so: Mech Dinos.'
the Series ''Vikings'' and Disney's ''Thor'' was a hit so they try to cram Viking/Nors Mythology in.
Nothing gets fixed and/or optimised (they probably) don't know how) just add more BS creatures.
(Cold blooded Reptilians in arctic regions is my pers. fav.)
It's not a Survival game with PvP, it's a Dino Zoo Sim and there's better Dino Zoo Sims out there.
There a lot more to this, but frankly; I can't be arsed.
I'm too busy cleaning my SSD with Potassium Chloride and then set it on fire."

18387,lol....
18388,"When it was first released it was horrible. But i t got better to a level of ""meh, kinda cool"". Its still so big that the basegame and 1 dlc take up around 100 GB of storage, but the game itself is quite enjoyable. That is if you play offline. otherwise you may loose almost all of your progress after 10 hours total cause the server got reset or you got raided and you cant even savescum out of it. Otherwise its a very beautyfull game with an abundance of stuff to discover, a variety of available playstyles and the constant feeling of having achieved something eventhough there is still so much mre to discover. It can become kind of grindy at times when playing with default settings so dont be afraid of setting gathering multipliers up a notch or two. And reload if you lost all your stuff insead of trying to get it back by running naked into a horde of predators."

You will lose and your base will one day for one reason or another fall. This is a fact. Once you accept this you can go forth and have fun knowing that its just a game and nothing more.

18504,"So i played this game yesterday and today, and i just installed the game yesterday, so during my time playing it i experienced alot of lag, and every now and again it comes and goes, and eventually it stays away, however i'd like to nail dark firstly is that, please for goodness sake compress the games files, it took a huuuuge shitload of disk space which bugged me alot, lastly try to rework around the main menu of the game, add a tutorial or whatever for beginners! cause i had a hellish time trying to figure out stuff, whats worst is that i struggled to position buildings in a way i'm happy with, but most ended up going terribly wrong, or won't clip into the building, the first case is the wood platforms for when i wanted to add a bed in the interior made, and didnt wanna add on the platform in the interior but rather outside of the interior directly under the platform.

Next i'd like to mention, is where to find things, like i searched things up and nothing were really helpful, the map on Lost Island where i started off first came off different looking compared to the maps i looked up, i was hunting for obsidian but couldnt find it, whats worst is everything around you attacks you when your trying to get your barings or move around, which is good and all but the problem is the lag, last i checked my internet isnt the problem but rather the game itself, which lags at the worst possible moment when you wanna defend yourself, or run away, and you end up killed either way which i'd like to note is infuriating.

And my last complaint is that when you want to host your own server, the game doesnt seem to wanna host it, and i ended up remaining on my own in my own server patiently waiting for whoever to join, whats more of a bigger issue, you have like zero clue how to make it host or ping, which i'd recommend probably try working on a easier way on that than rather hard as hell for big brainers to easily solve, where i am however a dummy :) so i can't quite figure that out plus that i'm a noob who was looking for fellow players to learn with or teach me how to play games, so note the reason why i wanted to host my own server, cause i kept running into other players who spoke in other kinds of language and i couldnt understand them and they can't with me, which is another problem.

So i'd like to add to perhaps add like... language servers where people can pick their own prefered seperate servers based on their language and play their game from there, and people can pick the english, japanese, or whatever other languages, and make their own servers in those languages which focuses on people who speaks mainly of those languages and make things easier for players, instead of just like awkwardly struggling to find a place for themselves and whats not, i been joining random servers trying to find myself a spot but always ended up with people speaking entirely in other kinds of language, and otherwise making things srsly awkward.

As for character customization, i liked the idea to how your char's hair grows in game as soon you get started, but what bugged me the most was that there was a lack of customization to how you wish to design your char's face, like example getting rid of the rinklish bits around the lips section, and the lack of more hair colors, (I hadnt played too far in the game but people can correct me at the hair color bit if they wants), but otherwise the game is really good, and i was laughing my butt off at the case at how you can design some kind of mistake of an abomination human in a weird way possible, but otherwise, my main problem is pretty much the insane lag that strikes at worst possible moments, aand when ever your char die you lose all your junk in process, and you have to run back and forth to get your stuff back, only to die again and again and again, till your safe with your junk in hands.

But otherwise for my last complaint, as i mentioned above about hosting the game, the last straw to why i uninstalled the game, is due to attempting around hosting the map i made my char and his progress in, ended up crashing and giving me an black error screen of sorts, not too mention the game as a whole flatout crashed on me and shut down my steam in the process, soo do please make hosting servers more easier and fix the game propperly as people been complaining, reviews such as this is meant to help improve the game, and based what i've seen quite a huge number of people has gone ignored it seems, but i get some is okay to ignore and just progress with unique and interesting creativity, but those with the huge amount of disk space and other problematic issues, i'd request in their behalf to please kindly fix your game in order for many good souls to enjoy. Thank you. :)"

18540,"If you like survival games, this really is a staple game. Despite being a terribly optimized clunky shit, the concept and content are extremely well executed, even when unmodified. As with all god tier games, you can modify the base configuration and add mods to tailor the game to your tastes. This is posted at 1.5k game hours which I find worthy of paying full price for to include DLC (some maps were meh)."

18545,"Okay, let me save you some time. If you're from the Americas, this games population seems to be pretty dead. There's plenty of EU servers, but I only see one Americas PvP server that's got any decent population. Granted it's like 7:30 am, but if the games population was doing well it's really not all that early.

Secondly, when you install the game, you'll notice it recommends a whopping 120gb of free space, but only downloads 40gb. Well guess what, if you wanna play any of these DLC maps it's a whole ass other games worth of data and that's where the 120gb recommended is coming from. That said, between the time it'll take me to find a server to play on that doesn't have garbage ping and the time to download a map the size of a damn game, I could've already found and been playing on a Rust server. 

Maybe I'll give this game a go at some point, but 30 mins in it's already starting to become irritating just to get going. Perhaps come the 4th of July when I'm drunk off my ass I'll have the patients to get this bs started."

18594,"Since the update, the game has been held hostage at 100% download with literally nothing left to download for couple days now since i started it. Since i first got the game, it's been a serious pain with minor and major bugs and glitches that varied from clipping through terrain, seeing through the entire world because ""fake visual-only terrain"" loaded, real terrain is loaded on top of things that were built like the entire floor of a home, the small, medium and large plots being underground because of it too rendering them impossible to use and forever gone (unless you quit and reload several times). The dinos get clipped into objects like giant boulders or trees, if friendly and following you, you need to break it yourself or you won't see them again. if looking to play with a friend, you better pay extra for your own 3rd party server because the official servers are not friendly at all (the concept of the servers specifically, not the people) and local hosting for it is just plagued with so many inconveniences and issues that trying to play as the host or with someone else that is hosting will cause inconvenience to both of you at the same time. Mods for the game are limited to what they do. some interestingly good ones and some quality of life ones exist but of all the mods that exists, they are either abandoned, have 50 or so copies of it that are abandoned or are popular enough and still function but just feel like you are playing an alpha version of the game for how poor the game handles the mods (mods function great, it's the system of how the game handles the mods that becomes an issue running mods)
if you want the free map dlcs, you best be ready to download the game. and then, download the game. after that, download the game. basically, everytime you add a dlc, you have to download the entire game. of course, you can stop the download and then grab the other dlcs and only actually bother downloading after you added them all but, you have to do that multiple times and naturally someone who doesn't really think of that, would just be stuck downloading the ENTIRE game just because they grabbed a map DLC and have to download the entire game everytime the get 1 map dlc.
nice that the game is free. hard to complain about it being free. but, I paid for the game when it was on sale sometime ago and honestly with how the game performs and the lack of care i've seen just from the gameplay i've experienced personally, the announcement of ARK 2 makes me think this game was abandoned in a state similar to what 7 days to die ""looked like"" 2 years ago. honestly, looking at the games now, 7 days to die looks near the same state as this game now except all the systems in 7 days to die tend to function better for what currently exists than this game. I mean, 7 days to die shows a mountain that can be physically walked on. Ark sadly has mountain terrain that doesn't exist and you will fall through the map and die.
I'm sure I can uninstall and reinstall the game to fix the current issue I've been having with the stick at 100% download for several days bug I'm dealing with but tbh, think the best answer to this bug specifically is to just uninstall and move on.
In fairness, my biggest gripe is the frozen download problem but everything else mentioned is just something that piled on to make this bug a nail in the coffin for my tolerance."

18606,"Absolutely massive.  You'd best have a 500GB SSD to devote to it.

18607,"On fjordur release on all pc official servers people just tamed desmos and griefing people on the beach as soon as they spawn or not long after they make a thatch or wooden hut, i have not seen one stone base besides my own and the global chat across all four oc servers was filled with people complaining about not even being able to run after spawn due to a tribe with multiple people just spamming echo location with the desmo.


Either remove echo location or remove ark from the steam store because its falsely advertised as a sandbox survival game when the reality is you cannot play how you want at all you are most definitely forced to play a specific way even on pve servers & unofficial.

Which leaves solo or your own server.

Wanna run your own server from your pc your playing on? Well you have a cap of 10 people that can join and they all need to be within 300 of the host or you get teleported back to the hosts location.

Wanna host a dedi?
You will need to pay 3rd party to host a server for you ($80ish dollars per year) 

Or build a pc good enough to host the map and amount of players you want (upwards of $1000) and then ongoing upgrades to keep it running after each graphical update and tlc patch.


This leaves you forced to play solo or seeking hardware or services from a 3rd party, which means wildcard does not provide the necessary infrastructure to run their own software and services, which literally means its illegal to distribute ark survival evolved within Australia as it does not meet the minimum requirements for a digital product or service.

Furthermore upon request of refund, steam attempted to only refund me 33.41 for ark and all addons, i paid 74.53 all up and even cross referenced this with my purchase history in steam which confirmed they tried to refund me nearly half what i actually paid.


Valve corp, you will be receiving an email from either me or fair trading  Australia or both, i’m surprised you’s didn’t learn from the first fine issued."

18649,"This game is a parasitic leech on your free time that feeds off negative emotions. It's great!
In all seriousness it is a decent game, but there came a turning point where I realized I wasn't having fun anymore. I was simply logging on to feed my creatures so they didn't die. It became a chore I had to do before I could do other things with my free time. After I realized that, I quit. It is worth to mention that its a very unforgiving game, and will expect you to just tough it out. At times it is extremely unfair, as it will spawn you nearby predators even in areas designated as ""easy"" zones. Additionally. the online community is absolute trash. Perhaps the worst most toxic community I've been part of. Not nessecarily in the sense of people who will call you racial slurs in chat, but those who gatekeep, demean, and ride their high horse so often it has been fused with their ass. While I have no personal experience with the PVP side of the game, it appears to be a hellish experience. Constant wipings on bases for no reason, contributing to a problem where if you are not in a ""mega tribe"" or an ""alpha tribe"" (the biggest tribe on the server) you are basically screwed. Mega tribes are generally cross server tribes (groups of players, similar to guilds in mmos) who may contain several hundred members across various game servers. They are often invasive, and will simply invade and claim entire servers for themselves, due to the fact that the outside man power will always beat single server tribes, unless they are also facing similar ""mega tribes"". From my understanding, the mega tribes generally ruin the pvp experience due to their position of power over other tribes, with the ability to effectively stop them from playing the game if they choose to. If you are not in either a local seat of power in the form of an alpha tribe or have the support of other servers in mega tribes, you will be met with a horrible experience of constantly having your progress reset for no reason. Even if you pose no threat, nor are encroaching on any other players territories, you may be squished simply under the assumption that you may be a starting point for a mega tribe to gain acess to the server. Moving on to PVE servers, the official servers are ok at best, but have many problems. A large one is pillarring, a process by which a player or tribe constructs hundreds or thousands of cheap pillars to place around the map in places they aren't nessecarily claiming. This disables building of other tribes and players in the areas, and due to the PVE nature of these servers, it is impossible to remove without decay or claim timers on the server. The only way I, and a lot of people. find enjoyment in multiplayer ARK is through unnoficial servers. However, due to these being run by players, they may simply shut down and loose all progress within them. The main way I would reccomend playing ARK is through single player, however many core aspects of the game are designed around multiplayer play, and many would argue that single player takes away from key points of the experience. However, disregarding the multiplayer component and the capacity in which you play the game, the game is simply buggy. It has a reputation for being on the the buggiest games that has a relatively large playerbase. Some range from minor visual glitches, up to gamebreaking ones."

18677,You can shit in this game
18678,"It's definitely come a long way from what iBallisticSquid used to play all those years ago, but at heart it's still the same extremely well crafted yet not too difficult dino survival game it always was. It's one of the only games where the resource gathering grind is fun (mostly because your life is at stake no matter how well-geared you are). The building system is still a little meh and the game crashes at the most random times but aside from that I don't really have much bad to say, just own a decent PC and play on.

I haven't bothered with the multiplayer content myself but from what I've heard it's basically just prehistoric Rust with less griefing."

18704,"Game is a grindfest, if you want to get anywhere, you better make this game your job (make sure you quit your job and/or school beforehand). It is realistically impossible to reach endgame content alone granted you play with base settings even on singleplayer. To get anywhere, you have to tweak every single settings because I sure ain't breaking 50k iron ore nodes alone to get myself an industrial forge and I'm not waiting 7 fucking real life days ingame for an egg to hatch. I only have 80 hours on pc but have about 600 hours on console and let me tell you this, unless you mod the living shit out of the game and look up how to tweak the settings for a balanced experience you're not going anywhere. (trust me, me and my friends tried out thousands of different settings back when the game just came out just for the game to be playable) Not to mention you can't even play with your friends on an actual private server without having to pay for the server monthly. Private games are pure cancer given the fact that everyone is limited whithin a tether distance that is based on the location of the host (it's 250 meters iirc). At some point, they added an option to change the tether distance in the settings but they promptly removed it because then people don't pay for servers so less cash coming in. The whole idea behind this game is making profit, there are bugs that were present on launch that still exist to this day but they are never going to fix them."

I put hundreds of hours into Ark on Xbox so to see that it's free now on Steam made me want to play a bit for old times sake and it holds up extremely well. If you're a sucker for dinosaurs like I am or enjoy open-world survival games like Minecraft, Subnautica, Stranded Deep, etc. then Ark is right up your alley. It's an absolute must play. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you."
18734,w
18735,This game sucks but I got it for free so I'm not going to bitch
18736,"If you didn't get it while it was free don't bother getting this game. It is the most unoptimized and forgotten about game I have ever seen. They just keep adding shit to it without fixing anything else. More content = more stuff that breaks. They don't assist any modded styled servers, if you want over 20 cool mods have fun sitting and watching ""Loading mod 2/20"" for the next at least 30 minutes. Like man I almost have 1000 hours and don't wish this game on anyone. As it is enjoyable when you get in the server just everything else about this is hot trash. Cave walls you can little clip through 80% of the time, or dinos get stuck on random crap inside the caves. 

Moral of the story is the game is over 300GB without mods and is just trash. LIKE I SAID it can be fun with friends on a modded server but modded servers take 30+ minutes to load into and if you crash then it's over for the day, and if you don't crash you somehow blue screen from going into the water.. (this happened to me and my friends on a regular basis)

Why did I write this review? ARK 2 is said to have ""Souls like combat"" and tons of features and I doubt this company will fulfill that or anything else it promises in the description of ARK 2. 

Make ARK enjoyable and fix this crappy 300GB game. Don't just drop it."
18737,"One of the best games I have ever played. A complete mess of bugs and nonsense, but combined in a glorious way to make a really open ended, epic sandbox.

18825,"Overall Opinion: Grindy, in-depth, a bit buggy, and jam packed with fun unique survivor content. Especially fun with a group of friends, but PVE or local servers play so much better than PVP.

Pros:
- Gratifying progression system
- beautiful landscapes and creatures
- lots of unique creatures with unique abilities
- decent structure building allowing for creativity

Cons:
- PVP is too grindy and time consuming to want to get into
- various bugs mostly with the game engine
- Too much tech was added in, so later stages of the game lose the unique charm of being a pre-historic survival sim"

18838,"Game sucks, literally takes a millennia to try and join a friend only to be hit with connection time out. I'd rather play Rust and face the toxic community than this slow ass laserdino game. 

Waste of money and you can't find any good servers that are cross between epicgames and steam."
18839,"Ugh... didn't know it was so bad until I got it for free... if you don't get grieved by players, an oversized pelican or a baryonix will do you on your spawn point until you scrape the keyboard with your fingers, and if you random respawn to avoid such camping, you will be tossed in a spider nest if you are lucky and you manage to escape with your skivvies intact before getting yourself yeeted down a cliff by a diplodocus that was passing through. After being camped 50 times by angry fauna every damn time we respawned and saw people saying that the game improves if you turn off all wild fauna, they gave up. My 9 hours is a testament that I tried at least. A pteranodon ignored my freshly caught salmon to then being yanked away by that damned baryonix that ate me first and then the salmon. Curse you, Why the pteranodon ignores fish in front of itself for 10 minutes but a baryonix and that friggin pelican leap towards it from miles away? it beats me, I even tried to put narcotic on the flesh but in-game instructions were not clear about that and I ended eating all in frustration. Made me want to commit seppuku at the jaws of a nearby megalodon because I was fed up of trying to retrieve my equipment where the baryonix was camping and of trying to follow a tip from a random player saying ""tame a pteranodon and ask it to kill the pelicans!"" hooray for the tip!
2 days was enough. At least I got a single achievement for my trouble. If the sequel still has this crummy player experience, wait for it to become free so that you don't pay for an anxiety simulator unless that kind of thing is up your alley.
tl;dr
UGH..."
18840,GOOD
18841,"Way better than it was a few years back. I havent done the new map yet, but Im excited about it.

18845,i honesty hate this game
18846,"I wish there was an ""in between"" button for the ratings, honestly.
Yes, I did play as a lone wolf so, it was a lot for me to figure out on my own. I would feel a bit better if there was a tutorial area.
- Spawned in, got trapped in someone's base.
- Spawned in another location, got eaten immediately.
- Pooped.
IDK, maybe I'll give it another shot someday, but for today, It's going in the ""maybemaybemaybe"" section of my games.

If you like a challenge, this is for you!"

What is life but a fevered dream?
Their eyes are yet to open
The gears are set in place to guide me to affinity
Atrophy, the thorn of time's aging vine
Harrowing winds press the mesh and curse the flesh rotting away
But here in this reality, my thoughts transform fatality
An almost endless exploration of our cosmic minds perpetuated through the sands of time
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady, this lucid dream
Lingers onward
Indefinitely, I am one
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
As you sow, and so you shall reap
What is life if but a fevered dream?
Restless nexus, my consensus
Striking at god at fucking will, yet and I am still not even satisfied
I fabricate, manipulate, incinerate and duplicate
Restabilize the precipice, my arbitrary exodus inside where I confide, looking down on this steeple
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady, this lucid dream
Lingers onward
Indefinitely, I descend
Despairing plunge into the omniverse, sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves in the infinite
Despairing plunge into the omniverse, sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves as we become
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent
Icarus, I'll eat the sun
These fragile wings will touch the sky
And paint the world in black and white
Bring forth the cleansing fires of rebirth
Recreating my image within the paradoxical
Burn in the embers of my fevered heart
Witness my omnipotence
Cursed judgment, devoid of this flesh, bring for my affinity
I am the omnipotent being
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll touch the sun
Omnipotent, I am the one
Icarus, I'll eat the sun
Oh

18862,"Stopped playing when it started changing from a dinosaur survival game into a survival game with.... whatever the hell they want. Fictional or straight from the back of their brains. Also as soon as i unlock the first guns in this game i start to lose so much more interest, tho i know for others its probably where it gets more fun idk. I know primitive servers exists but no one plays it enough really which is sad. 
Still a good game in reality. They simply took it in a different direction from what i was expecting. 

And they took my Alpha supporter cowboy hat skin i used to get on spawn with the Parasaur blue saddle skin. Now that pissed me off ( i havnt checked to see if they love me enough to give it back). 
Took it away from me like i wasnt the first guy in my servers area to find a Parasaur and tame it and actually have people freaking out because simply taming a Para was a power play lmao.

I still recommend as i know my tastes in games are specific and i get bored fast, and since i get bored fast its amazing i have this many hours in one game. Tho i wouldnt be able to play more than an hour now at a time without getting bored. Im lucky to make it past the menu of some games. Just vibes you know?"

Make sure you come into this knowing the down sides the first being the super buggy nature. There are so many constant updates but often some things go unfixed in favor of producing new content.  The second problem is an upside to some people. It's SUPER grindy!! Lastly make sure you understand someone can wipe your whole base in like 10 minutes while you are offline if you aren't careful."

18879,dinesor
18880,"As a survival game, ARK is lacklustre and most other games in the genre do it's mechanics better. The game is also poorly optimised, the base building mechanics are awful, official servers face unacceptable rubberbanding and lag issues and there are a number of technical glitches that cause connection issues and CTDs. 

The graphics are pretty good (aside from the UI, which is easily the ugliest I have ever seen in a fully released title), and riding big dinos around with some friends can be fun, but otherwise the game is a huge disappointment and I can't possibly fathom why it is so well-regarded. 

I probably say ""I hate this game"" at least 5 times every time I sit down to play, but that's not entirely fair. I do not hate this game. It's fine. I just can't recommend it unless it's heavily discounted (or free like it is at time of writing)."

The game seems to like having a multitude of various animals and dinosaurs and absolutely zero will to sort out major issues, that plagued me on the Xbox when i first played Ark when it was released.

Noticed it was free on steam and thought ""oh cool, i remember that game""
Downloaded the absolute mess that is their file system and got on to a server.

Nothing has chnaged from the utter mess it was when i first played on xbox all those years ago. Well, except all the new content which is riddled with all the flaws of the previous content.

Please, for the love of god, have a bit of pride in making games and content."

This game on the other hand has a lot of unfinished edges, a buggy Beta UI, and an atrocious Linux port... There could be some good game deep underneath this all, but it's not worth my time looking for it."
19026,it is a good game but you cant sleep
19027,Dont get this version if wanting to play with people on xbox because through steam you cannot play cross platform. go buy the version on xbox instead. even though i got this game for free on sale it does not exuse the fact that if i wanted to play with xbox people you cannot. making you buy the xbox version

A MUST have game for those that wish to spend hours on end solo or with friends, the more people the merrier, lots of servers and server options that allow you to play the way you want to given a need for a challenge or a need to have fun in the most reasonable of time with higher rate servers being available. Tons of fan made content that add more than it takes away from the mission of the game being a survival title. 100/10"

19051,"This game is has so many emotions and feelings bottled up inside of one package, and it's truly hard to explain. Some days you can be on top of the world (and your dinosaur babes) while ruling your ARK with an iron fist and an iron hut. Other days, you're getting gobsmacked by angry pint-sized birds and getting your hut evicted permanently from your cozy little cliff. You can go at this painful and jolly experience alone or with a few coherent friends that can be used as bait later on. With the amount of replayability and freedom you are given, this game is definitely worth spending some time in. Have fun, roleplay as Bill Cosby with homemade narcotics, build a cult, or just not die. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to people who enjoy teamwork, going solo, exploring, building, farming, surviving, fighting, and experiencing breathtaking creatures."
19052,A really fun grindy game. It's especially fun with your friends whether you play on official or on your own private server. There is basically no end to what you can do in this game. There is a plethora of mods to use and there is just so many maps to have fun with as well. Highly recommend

19090,nice
19091,361 Gb is all I should have to say about this game
19092,"This game is so bad. It takes a lot of time to load, and I get it's probably supposed to be a AAA game, but man, even GTA 6 would probably load faster. Once you enter the game, no tutorial, no guide, and I would not want to hear a word said by a 2 million subs youtuber who no ones ever heard of. The game has gameplay bugs and graphics bugs. It has too many imaginary features which make the game out-of-touch with reality and you instantly realize how bad it will be."
19093,"Love this game and it's a shame I have to give it a low rating as protest against Ark 2. We want Ark 2, not Ark: Dark Souls. Fix it."
19094,"This game is awful. Me and my friends wasted around one hour figuring out how to play together and in the end, we never did."

19158,You're going to die...a lot. But it does get better. :) Have fun. Try PVE first. Tame everything. Use dododex app or website for taming help.
19159,"Ark just became free today and I was exited to play it, the moment I download it and try to join a server the game just pops up the steam page with the new Ark 2 and nothing else. It kicks me back to the menu page of ark and does not tell me what the issue is. I tried getting in contact with support but all I find is threats  after threats which I am not about to go read 1000+ of them to find my solution. Bad experience from start to finish and I couldn't even play it."

19193,"You guys are ruining what we loved about the original Ark... You aren't Dark Souls, You aren't Elder Scrolls Online, so why are you doing this? This is actually heart breaking because the first game is such an amazing idea. Could have been such a truly amazing game, and it was, to an extent. But the execution? The way y'all have handled PVP is appalling. And thats not the only thing that makes me sick but the fact this game is over-run with CHEATERS and y'all do nothing about it. Global ban? they get another account. Dev wiped? Well their base wasn't on this server anyway.. Why in the world is aimbotting and ESP not a device ban? Why is meshing not a DEVICE BAN??? Like c'mon guys. Seeing what y'all are doing with Ark 2 is a slap in the face and I foresee micro-transactions and lots of them. I hope to god I am wrong... but its not looking good. Don't fix whats not broken. Ever heard of that? Y'all had a great formula at one point but I feel like it was lost along the way and now I am grieving for the community because you're literally kicking all the TRULY faithful supporters like myself to the curb with this single-player/MMO/hack and slash BS. To anyone reading this with hope for Ark 2, they neglected their first baby in favor of money and greed, what do you think will happen to the second? This is a very sad day..."

19213,very funny
19214,"Went in blind, played for about an hour and honestly the game is not for me. The interface is very clunky and the crafting system leaves alot to be desired. Got as far as building a basic shelter, with a sleeping bag and you can't even sleep! Little creatures the size of my foot killed my character even after taking several punches to the face. Constantly having to worry about your food/water levels, your too hot, then your too cold etc. It feels like i am fighting the interface and game rules more then surviving. Sorry not for me"

19237,"this game sucks
bad optimisation
bad gameplay
pretty bad graphics for the performance
literally unplayable on most servers when playing solo
if you are playing on the minimum specs the devs suggest, be prepared to run it on the lowest resolution, lowest graphics and at 10fps"
19238,"1. I wake up, unknowing of my surroundings. I scratch my wrist, noticing an interesting gem planted into my veins.
2. I look around, to see I am on a beach. I lick my dry lips, and I hear a... Russian man?
3. I see a man on a giganotasaurus and a screaming Russian man riding on top of it, fully clad in metal armor, wielding a pike.
4. I get torn, limb from limb.
5. I respawn
6. I run around, gathering materials for a good few hours, progressing from a fists to primal gear consisting of clothen armor and a stone hatchet and pickaxe.
7. I settle down on a cliff overlooking a pond, building a thatch base, and night falls.
8. I decide to tame a dodo in the morning, my first companion!
9. I hop off for the night
10. I get on next morning, a beautiful Sunday morning
11. I was killed by [EZ] 游戏大师
12. Repeat

19241,"(I just wanna say I have around 500 with steam epic games and ps4 combined) okay with that out of the way I just want to say this is the best game I have ever played and I'm still not bored of it after 500 hours. It's crazy how much content there is in this game all the free maps, mods and different ways to do stuff. There might be a few bugs here and there but that doesn't matter the game is just too good for it to matter. The only bad thing about this game is: it takes like 200gb or something like that and that it's kind of laggy for medium computers otherwise it's amazing and atm it's free."
19242,"Started playin this game on Xbox release . I was captivated in 10 minutes, yet ready to quit in 30 as there was no tutorial on what to do, how to craft, make tools or harvest. You just spawned in scratched your arm and found out. Over the course of the years I moved on from legacy servers to official's, purchased the game for PC and PlayStation. I ended my tour of Ark before Crystal Isle release. It was a love hate relationship to say the least. Ark is a magnificent game, both in crafting, building, surviving, and living on the edge. You can do it solo or with others, however word of advice, I hope you trust the others as it is very , very easy to get insided and robbed in this game, made easier by the cry pods. So adjust your clan settings and hope for the best lol. However amazing this game is, is foreshadowed by the fact that the developers are not really keen on fixing issues in a timely manner, nor do they come off as efficient as many servers lag bad and rubberband alot (example ragnorok map). Which causes you to die in all manners or loose tames at times if not extra careful. The fact that this game is so amazing that the players put up with the devs and lack of fixes speaks to the game itself and the content, which you will not find lacking between bosses and mini bosses, cave runs, temple runs, loot drop harvesting for Blueprints or maybe you wanna craft your own special blueprint (60 berries, 20x3 of any type makes a great drink), (50 raw meat makes a great food source once crafted into a bp and it bypasses the cooking stage and no ill effects) and as you learn the game you can make even better stronger personal recipe's. Back in the start element was a pain in butt to get and utilize as you cant transfer it, however they have made that quite easier to obtain and even transfer now which makes the game overall easier and fun, Putting teleporters in strategy spots for easier harvesting and returns to base to organize, into tek storage boxes that show the item inside and number so you dont have to access it all the time. Cryo pods changed the game as back in day we had to hand feed a baby until it was able to get on the trough and then had to make sure that stayed full, it was a pain coordinating all that between a 9-5 job. Now you can Cryo your pet and when you have time to work on the tame throw it on the ground and hatch it from the cryo pod and continue where you left off. It also makes storing these animals so much easier as now you dont have 300 plus dinos out getting hungry every other day and at risk to griefing or natural eggro of wild animals attacking. (NOTE: if ever find a base with timers decayed and there is a crypod full of pod and the pods claim they have dinos inside but pods are dead and dinos say dead, destroy the floor it sits on and collect all the pods and place them into a working pod and once they are charged the dinos should say alive and no loss will occur, unless they fix this or haven't already lol) So in short this game is amazing and if your ready to combat the game and also the dev environments inside the game aka lag and rubberbanding, then you will have a blast. Mods make this game easier and even better to play. I prefer official myself. My review would be in end that the game is a 4 star game all day however because of the devs inattentiveness and lack of fixes at times or inability to resolve issues i would knock the overall rating to a 3, a low 3 almost 2. Hopefully Ark 2 is better, however i dont hold out much hope as i've been around long enough to see how the treated Ark evolved. I figure launch day is going to be a catastrophe at best"
19243,FUCKING STUPID SHIT LOSING TO LVL2 WHILE UR LVL9

19254,Playing this game solo vs with friends is like a whole different experience. especially if you and your friends are alright with a little competitiveness and fooling around. this game when played solo feels like an actual survival game with properly terrifying moments that will get your heart pumping and maybe sometimes frustrate you... okay may be frustrate you a lot and if played with friends its an amazing experience that you and your friends wont forget
19255,i mean it's alright ig
19256,hehehaha
19257,"The game looks much prettier than it does ingame, ingame it would look good in say 2013. While not being a total clusterfuck, the UI is bad. In the menu which shows map, inventory, group etc, there is no icon for Crafting, so you have to check keybinds to find crafting(!).

Also i turned down damage of dinosaurs to give me a chance to, you know, survive during the test, but suddenly i ran into a raptor and it killed me in a few hits. Great. Trying the opposite, i attacked a turtle and it took like a minute to kill - or rather stun. To kill it i needed to hit it a few more times.

Oddest thing is that you get XP for just existing - XP is literally ticking up as you stand still, and gives you points to spend on skills, you don't have to do anything - just alt+tab and watch some youtube videos while your character is leveling up.

My verdict is: No, just no - There are better games today like Valheim and other survival games that offer more with better graphics and more well thought out UI and game mechanics. I got this for free as a giveaway, but at the moment don't feel like playing more."
19258,"I can't even fit this on my computer. I would like to be able to fucking play it. But since devs are too stupid to optimize textures I guess I still can't play this, if only..."
19259,"This game sucks and everything about it, paid alot of money for it just to eat my disk space and then it's free. Wow thanks for scamming me."
19260,It is an out of this world experience.

Just as well I got it for free. Easily and quickly deleted, never to see the light of day again."
19274,nice
19275,very dont play with to many mods tho it will break trust me
19276,"gamezz fire yoooooooooo! Recomend to every 4 year old and every 90 year old specifically. Only those two ages because everyone else has very little experience in the dinopsaur world. Only 4 year olds and 90 year olds have sophisticated knowledge of Paleontology. Paleontology is the study of dinosaurs. If you were smart like me you would know that their are three main periods of dinosaurs. The three periods are the triassic period which was 252-201 million years ago, the jurassic period which was 201-145 million years ago, and finally the cretacious period which was 145-66 million years ago. I am a professional dinosauroligist (AKA a Professional PaLEONTOLOGUST). I am the most known in the world for my ledgendary time machine that I made myself and used to study the dinosaurs. I created the period names long time ago with my time machine and started the idea of the ledgendary movie series Jurrasic Park and Jurassic World. If you don't listen to my studies and teachings and try to take the dinosaur test, I promis you you will fail. As the ledgendartyu quote from Donalbraham Lincoln ""you can do it if you want to. If not then do it anyway because you want to. Be the tperson they want you to be and study the dinosaurs you want to study  because thewy are old and crusty."". This quote haS STICKED WITH MY RTHROUGHOUT my journey of paleontology and I will continue to teach these quotes and pass my knowledge onto my future grandmother in hggoipes she will teach her grandson. I have always had a special love for dinosaurts and old things since i was a 206 year old child. It was taught to me by the ledgendary dinosaur mother and birther of all life. Her name is quesadilla and she is the wissest creaturee of all. She was known by everyone as the chosen one because she was created by life itself. She was woirshipped by all creatures and was kept undeer high top secret seecurity by the department of qwuesadilla defense. She started the ledgendary council of the higher order called the dinolegacy corrdination of crusty raptors aka dinos. she was kjept under security buyt alsop was hidden from the humans and other creatures that didn't beleive in the moethod of the ledgenbd]ary god Quesadilla. If anyone disobeyed her orders, then she would make them eat cinomon tosast crunch to death and then thrown in lava. TYhey would then be revived and put into ice toi cool them off and then make them wear human clothes. They would then be forbidden from the animal order and then forced to live the rest of it's days as a human. Although not many have the privlage and the guts to see the legendary Quesadilla, the ones that do, have a major bond with her and they are the only people Quesadilla trusts. I have very strong sources because me myself was their and talked to Quesadilla myself. I used my time machine and went back into time to the dawn of creation AKA the birth of Quesadilla. I was the first one to build trust with her and many more were to come."

19285,"Probably the best crafting and survival games with dinos. It is hard to get into initially when there are so many other people on a server who are alpha established. Better to find a well run server that is newish and make to read the fine print, server restarts are a thing. 

Best played with committed people. Try and avoid servers that are way to over modded, where dinos are literally on fire. Can spoil it a bit. 

Overall, great fun."
19286,"Solid idea for a game, a little rough around the edges and poorly optimised but still a fun experience. Probably one of the games I've had the most fun playing both solo and with friends. I'm excited to see what they do with the sequel.
8/10 would recommend."
19287,"great game laggs tho
"
19288,Unoptimized as hell. Just play rust or minecraft or something (or burn your money)
19289,"This game is really fun to play with friends. When playing single player it is quite nerve-wrecking but that adds to the survival atmosphere. It feels like there is always something to do. Building is really fun. Do not get too attached to your creatures because, well you know. 

Extinction is my fave map, it feels like the easiest map to navigate because it is always day time outside of the dome areas. 

I have a lot of sweet memories playing with my friends so i recommend playing if you have a community/ friend group who wants to try something together."

19327,"I remember getting Ark when it first dropped in Early Access. Looking back, the experience is very very much the same. They reached a point where what they had would ""work"", just not that great. Rather swing back around to tighten everything up and polish gameplay, they just left it and started focusing on expansions. It was insane to see an early access game actually offer paid expansions and the negative affect it had on gaming is one part of the entire rise in exploitative practices in the industry that's an issue now.

At the time, it was a notable entry into a relatively niche genre of open world survival games. Now, it feels like an outdated experience that the devs knew functioned sub-par, but opted to pump out easy content they could earn a profit from. Instead of reworking things, they directed their attention to getting the broken game onto consoles. No matter how many expansions they've released, they've never gone back to revamp movement, combat, dino interacting or any of the key KEY aspect of just the gameplay itself. Yes, dinosaurs cool, build house cool, but it feels like ass. And the dinosaurs lumber around, completely unaware of their surroundings, getting stuck on/in structures, nonsensical movement patterns, random dismounting...the list of things wrong with just basic function is insane.

If you can swoop it up for free or via Game Pass, have at it. PvP servers, you'll be raided at night, usually by cheaters. PvE servers and you still have to deal with nearly every aspect of gameplay feeling 60% complete."
19328,I like turtles
19329,.
19330,"It's like a toxic ex
"
19331,"less than 8 hours into the new map, chinese cheaters duped a bunch of stuff, and started the boss fight every 5 minutes for over an hour.  What a crock of shit this game is to allow this cheating to continue to happen year after year.  I know people that didnt cheat that got banned because of corrupted files on their computer, but these guys aimbot all day long and Wildcard sits on their hands.  Shame.  Could be so much more of a game."

19333,how do i delete then reinstall the free version
19334,it can be difficult in some servers if ur not used to the flow so i would recommend starting off by yourself and getting the hang of it. it can take time to understand differnet ways of playing this game and yes it can be unique as many survival games r but its still work a look at and maybe an attempt if ur into some

19341,"    Ark is a intense action packed game. I play Ark with Primal Fear mods and just love it. I am a builder and Ark allows you to build many types of homes and bases.  You can build everywhere including caves, desert, and underwater. The Dino's are amazing and beautiful. As well as dangerous and unforgiving. I love taming many of the hundreds of Dino's and riding them into battles.  Playing Ark online allows me to meet many other players from all over the world. Thank you for developing Ark and I will be playing for another 20 Yrs."

19357,"I am a 51 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 13. My son recently downloaded ARK and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

19372,"By far the best survival game ever made. 

You can explore large expansive biomes and build bases.

I love taming different dinosaurs and getting full Tek gear. 

The options are endless alongside all the mods you can use.

Just pray to the digital gods it doesn't melt your PC.

Only problem is it's not as optimized as it is on consoles. 

I still wish they would put cross-play with XBONE on this version. 

It is worth every minute of gameplay.

Grab it for free while it lasts. 

Just waiting for Ark 2 now."

19386,the game was better on console when it was in early access constant crisp 20 FPS and lag game runs too good now even though it still runs like ass like max's gob
19387,"You will hate this game. Bugs galore and unfair PvP (if you want to play that mess) will make you question why it is you play this hunk of junk. BUT, there is nothing else quite like ARK. Once you tame each of your creatures for the first time and take down the bosses that appear seemingly impossible to defeat upon just starting out, that is when you will feel a sense of satisfaction that may justify the pain and suffering you have experienced. Now ARK is free or not majorly expensive (depending when anyone sees this review) there is no reason why you shouldn't try this game. There are objectives for everyone: Speedrunners can try and smoke the bosses ASAP and completionists can try to tame every creature and through trading and breeding develop all their creatures into the strongest around. ARK isnt flawless and it never has been but it has always retained a very healthy number of recurrent players and there is a reason for this, its not half bad."
19388,i cannot play the game without it bringing up a stupid thing called BATTLEYE and EVERY TIME i hit a stupid server it puts me back to where all the other servers are tell me why it wont let me play?
19389,Super fun and mods are free so you dont have to make backup files

19398,"Game is great. But there comes a point where the bugs (not talking initial release) and patches become too much. Patches are absolutely massive and glitch when paused or the screen goes to sleep, causing them to restart (160/190Gb back to 90/190Gb). Long story short, having over 130 games in my library, I have NEVER had this much of an issue with a game EVER. Cumulatively, Ark has had more update and download time than all of the others I own COMBINED (I am NOT exaggerating), not to mention the wear and tear it causes on your HD."

19442,"Been playing solo for roughly just under 200hrs and all I can say is that I still find stuff to do in the game, which is always a bonus. The replay-value of ARK is astounding and given all the in-game mechanics that you'll have to learn on your own (with the help of some external research), it's no surprise why there's a ton of things you can do when diving in. Single Player is a pretty okay experience, but I bet the real strength and flourish of the game lies in multi.

Worth a try at least. Good Luck Survivors!"

19445,"Gameplay -- Once installed you create a character (probably the only good part of the game). Once that's ready you join a server only for your eardrums to be ruined for the next 30 minutes as it blasts you with 7000 decibels of raw sound. Great. Next you open the menu and turn the sound down so you don't go permanently deaf. Bonus time, while you're in the menu, turning down your sound, a dinosaur wanders by and kills you. Fantastic gameplay, if i may say so myself. 

Performance - Medium settings asks for something like a gtx 670, yet still throws my 2060 to 100% usage, and as an added bonus, the fans are in a constant state of spinning up and slowing down like a defective vacuum cleaner. But hey, 170 something fps, right? 

This game is a piece of garbage. Had it not been free I could not in 1000 years imagine wasting actual money on it

19473,its good
19474,"This game is meant to be played multiplayer, for you and your tribe to help each other out, to join parties and chase dinosaurs together, to build bases together, to better mankind together. The PvE experience on a private server is pretty good in this regard, though it does require a dedicated server which isn't free (unless you have a spare computer with the right specs to allocate to the purpose, which isn't free either).

This game has notorious public PvP servers. Be forewarned, some personalities may find this fun, but you're going up against ultra-skilled ""hackers"" who know just how to glitch-vibrate their way into small, nearly impassible ratholes via parachute as a grappling hook to throw grenades in and wipe out your turrets, wreck your nearly impossible to find well hidden base, and take all the stuff you've spent hundreds of hours trying to acquire. Consider that on PvP, predation on other players is the most effective and efficient way to play quickly and fast, and that this is in fact how the game is played on PvP."

"
19476,overall pretty lame and janky
19477,"Don't let my playtime confuse you, I played thousands of hours on different names and platforms. As a whole, ARK is a top 3 gaming experience of my life. The grind, the worry of an offline raid, the progression, etc. It was spot on. What was NOT spot on was the expansions and the direction the game went. It went from caveman technology up to current technology with sentry guns and armor. Once they began getting oddly mythical it all went to sh*t. Metal Dino's with lasers, flying electric birds, glowing garbage, volcano fire monsters, you get the point. Went from bush survival to space fantasy over the course of a couple of DLC's and they could bring those animals into your server, destroy the server, and leave again. I hope, I PRAY, that ARK 2 doesn't do this. Bigger isn't always better."

19482,ark survival evolved
19483,epic gifted last year now steam same crap
19484,so good i forgot life
19485,"Fun, sandbox game. Easy to sink hours into, survival, building, taming dino's."
19486,"I love building, exploring, discovering, taming and breeding dinosaurs. The details and variety of dinosaurs is amazing and how each of them offers something to help you out. Such as brontosaurus is very good for berry gathering and is good to take with you as they can carry so much. I've only played single player.

I like the primitive style game play and dislike tek and how you can eventually use electricity.

Though this game is not suitable for those who expect a game to tell you what to do and where to go, the freedom it offers is good. It does get quite boring as there ends up not much to do besides breeding dinosaurs to eventually fight bosses. There is no NPC's or quests and the only way to get the story is through the notes you find in the world. I just feel bored and don't feel there is enough variety in what you can do in single player.

This game needs a good PC to be able to play, but even so it is poorly optimised and takes up a lot of space. I always make sure my drivers are up to date so wondered why I was all of a sudden getting a freeze with fatal error report. I verified files and it said 2 files were missing and they were being restored. I have no idea what would of caused that and after that the game is running fine again. This game is really annoying it occasionally has errors and ends up with missing files. You often have to spend time verifying files. And also have problem where the sound cuts out completely even though the sound still works when testing a you tube video and then have to verify files which then says 2 files are missing.
I found the problem was that my power supply was dying and finally carked it. 

So far since playing Ark I've had to buy a new SSD and power supply.

Since being poorly optimised it makes your PC work very hard, it may make your PC components die quicker. So play at your own risk.
Ark is now free which they could at least offer the DLC at 50% off for current owners. Genesis is still only 20% off.

The game is fun but also frustrating with all the problems it seems to have.
I have mixed feelings about the game I love it but also hate it and not sure it's worth recommending as a game should not be so problematic.

19496,"they're so obsessed with making money on a new game they won't fix the bugs on the old one... 

while it's a great game it still lacks a lot and i mean A LOT of polish especially in single player. 

before you get it here's some Pro's and cons

Pros
expansive maps (excluding genesis)
plenty of places to build (excluding genesis)
a story map that actually focuses on story (genesis)
dinosaurs and high tech - nuff said
taming for all you dino kidnappers out there
can choose between pvp and pve

cons
very buggy especially in single player
cannot use configurations in single player because wildcard can't fix the simplist of issues
basically have to play on someone else's server if you want to play
massive filesize
wildcard has moved on from developing this game actively and will not be fixing bugs
gameplay is very broken especially in regards to taming

19511,"Look close at the first picture. To measure leagal length you have to
have the breach fully closed. Then using a dowel stick it down the
barrel. When it stops against the front of the breach (the face that
sits against the face of the shell), mark the dowel at the end of the
barrel. My barrel is 28”. So the mark is at 16”. It wouldn’t look odd
because of the length of the chamber below the barrel is long also."

19532,very good
19533,"Not worth it.

Felt more like bloatware than an actual game after awhile. The storage of this game was taking up 200 gigs on my 1 tb external drive. Heck, I needed to get an external drive to be able to play this game because I was simply running out of space from this game alone. I had a couple of the free dlc's as well, but that's no excuse for the sheer amount of space it took up. It was fun at first but the optimization is terrible, the graphics can be crappy and seemed like they kept on adding things without fixing problems.

Only thing it had going for it was the creatures. It was fun to explore, tame and eventually destroy everything on the island with a pack full of Sarcos/Carnos. But it became tedious and not worth the money or massive storage space it took up so I uninstalled it and never looked back."

19551,"On the surface, ARK seems like a fun game that you could play with your friends, it's fun to go around the map capturing or hunting any animal that comes your way and bringing them back to your (or your friend's) base to either tame them or make use of whatever resources they have.

However, when you begin to install the game, you suddenly notice that the game takes like 89 GB of storage space, which means that if you have a low-end PC, you'd have to uninstall everything just to install the game, and even if you don't have a drive as big enough to accommodate the game, you better save up on a bigger drive. Even if you have a better computer (as I do), you would often find yourself uninstalling the game several times to free up a boatload of much-needed space.

That is just the beginning though, as soon as you boot up the game, you start to realize how much of a buggy pile of shit this game is, for example the physics is absolute trash, if you end up in a bad spot and get stuck in it, good luck trying to get yourself unstuck, you'd either be relying on your friend to get you out or just wait until you die later on. Of course for a game that came out 5 years ago you'd at least expect most of these bugs to be fixed. But it's clear the developers don't give a rat's ass about this game, they care about churning out new content every 5 seconds to give the illusion that they give an absolute fuck about this game.

I would only recommend the game if you're confident your PC could run it, and if the developers could at least rectify most of the issues they should've done years back, even by then given that ARK 2 is coming out, I'm not too sure if they ever will. Just pray that someday, they'll fix it.

*EDIT*: The game on Linux takes up 89GB, while the one on Windows takes up 125GB, which is even worse."

19596,"My statement on this game can simply be put as,
""I don't like this game.""

It is an opinion, so don't let it stop you from trying the game. This game is free now, and even then, it's not worth your time. I got this game long ago very near release day when it cost a small fortune. It was bad then, and it has only gotten worse.

Let me start with a short description.
This game's purpose is to waste your time. It goes out of its way to take away your hard work and effort.

All games exist to waste your time, but at least it's a measure of enjoyment. Ark does not do this. If you go into this game, go into it expecting to lose everything, multiple times over, just trying to survive, let alone even beat the game. Also expect to look up a guide if you don't want to explore every square inch of the same looking island.
Oh, the DLC maps? They're better by technicality, but they used to cost money too, almost as much as the game itself - Each.

Let me tell you a story. 
You spawn on a beach, start swinging on a tree or rock, and suddenly, the neutral entity turtle chunks you for half your health because it thought you were swinging at it.
So you run a good distance away. You manage to work on a base, tame a few dinos, spend hours levelling up. Then an Alpha Raptor spawns in the starting zone, who demands fully automatic weapons, armour, and some of the best tames in the game to even kill.
You lose everything but your exp. All your resources. All your tames. You have to start with banging rocks together again. No guns nor metal.

This will happen to you multiple times in the course of a playthrough - completely unprovoked, entirely against your control, will everything be taken from you.

Everything is a lot, too. This game is grindy - and I personally don't mind that. I play BDO, I love BDO. But when you die in BDO, you only lose 1% of your exp, not literally everything you worked for. And in BDO, when you die, it's because you went out to choose to fight something. 
Not with Ark.

I have similar complaints with its other mechanics like exploration, but more so, especially how to breed dinos to be strong enough for the end bosses, you need to dedicate time out of your life as if you actually live in Ark to grow them. 5 hours for a Tame to mature to a Juvenile, and during that time, if a baby isn't fed constant attention, it dies very easily. Then you have to wait an entire 24 hours before you're allowed to breed the same pair of dinos again.

Of course, these are default settings, and after quite a few updates, you can actually change this - unless you're playing on a server that isn't yours.

There are stories of people neglecting sleep, food, and hygiene to even compete with the PvP in this game, and even if it's a PvE server, good luck getting to the major resource nodes when everyone has taken everything.

There's a lot more I could say, but it's miserable to talk about. I'll happily complain about it in voice chat, though.

Will I still play it? With friends, yes. But anything is fun with friends."
19597,"Game was fun when initially released, but Studio Wildcard soon began pandering to the massive hacking player base from a certain country where the facts about the *1989 June 4th Tiananmen Square protests and massacre* are controversial and twisted. Refusing to ping/region lock, or even ban blatant cases of hacking in some instances, allowing entire clans of hackers to take over and ruin servers, thus making multiplayer virtually unplayable outside of private locked servers.
Soon after they started pumping out comically overpriced DLC in an attempt to claw back money they lost in a legal battle.
But hey, now the game's free! and I hear Vin Diesel is super into it, he's a cool guy, right?
But seriously, this isn't worth the massive download, at all. Don't waste your time, even if it's free."

19676,no sex with gigga 0/10 wold not fuck the dodo again
19677,Fun to play I give this 9 out of 10
19678,"I don t want to die yet

"
19679,i hate it and i never want to play it again
19680,i love ark you have to get mods NOW but watch videos on mods to understand but just get ARK NOW
19681,"it is awesome and it is easy to learn and it is very etertaining 
"
19682,Visually beautiful and intense. Enjoed every second of this game !
19683,make it free while other ppl payed gg
19684,"This version of ark is able to be played with mods, this some how makes the game 10x better. Being a loser with over 500 hours on windows 10/X-box ark I can verify that this addition feels more official and gives you more customisation."
19685,"On my first year of playing, it was really enjoyable"
19686,"2500 on PS4 and i purchased almost all DLC's (because Scorched Earth is pointless), it's a great game, but it just has some hefty requirements to run smoothly but it's free now so it's worth trying."
19687,"I've played this game on ps4 and i love it even more on pc.
i love dinosaurs and this game only adds to that love.
"
19688,"Engaging and deep open world survival game. Pretty, wide. I didn't expect taming and breeding animals to be fun, but it turned out to be!"
19689,sheesh!
19690,yes
19691,This game is incredibly addicting. Love it. Though you will pull your hair out when you die and lose a lot :D
19692,Dinosaurs
19693,There are some complications that are really old and have never been fixed but they don't completely ruin the game and the game itself is fun and has a really unique story with days worth of content. I've been playing this game since the alpha and I can honestly say it is 1 of the best games I've ever played.
19694,Good game vwry fun with freinds
19695,Beat dodo is fun
19696,git

Wake up in cage to kids laughing saying ""You're not going to touch us""
I laugh
They kill me
End of my pvp experience on ark.

It's a great game, I've enjoyed every bit of it and would recommend it to anyone thinking about buying."
19700,"Bought it 2 weeks ago for 25€. Now its free. I hate my life 
"
19701,fun
19702,"Too many furries/scalies, other than that. Community/game is great!"
19703,very  fun can play for a long time. but it has a lot of lag.
19704,Oh my Gaud! So annoying and glitchy! But honestly you get addicted to Ark and its impossible to stop playing lol. So survival with dinos and huuuge amounts of things to do. Highly recommend it.
19705,"nice and best
"
19706,It's an awesome survival game with dinosaurs.
19707,"I remember when I bought this game years ago.
It ate my computer space because nothing is compressed.
Optimize the game, not leave everything uncompressed.
That's stupid.
And look it's free.

Get the game if you want. Just get ready to download over 200 gbs of uncompressed files.

Btw I remember when it was actual dinosaurs, now there's dinosaurs with lasers and fantasy creatures... Also season pass is a thing now??

Honestly game's a mess now. I'd rather play a normal dinosaur game that has actual dinosaurs
instead of whatever this is."
19708,Its fun
19709,great game ive played this for nearly 50 hours with my gf and its stil fun to play
19710,THE BIGGLEST SCAM EVER OF GAME COMPLETLY CANCER
19711,very addictive game

19713,"So much to see n do... Choice of playing alone or with friends, if you like with a very large group..... my personal fav is the building."
19714,gave it a like!
19715,"laggy and poorly made, i had this game for years, changed my pc setup many times and it still doesnt run nicely"

19725,"Strictly PVE Experience: I only started playing a year ago but there is an abundance of content to explore. With the base game, DLCs, and mods, there is bound to be something you will enjoy with this game. Build a massive base with elaborate designs or keep it simple and focus on other aspects. Scour the maps for high level dinos to tame and make your life easier. Fine tuning of settings allows for even more customization of game play. There is no way, with my play style, that I will complete all the content before ARK 2 launches but I'm sure I will be playing this game for years to come."
19726,"As a veteran player I can tell you now, Dinosaurs are cool."
19727,yes
19728,yes
19729,Okay
19730,still waiting for vin diesel
19731,good game
19732,"Been such a fun game playing with my friends and wife.  The maps are so big that there is limitless exploration and new places to make a home.  So much fun, we have been playing the main island map for over 50 hours and still only really explored about 30% of the map.  Can't wait to see the rest and the other biomes and also the other several maps."
19733,switched from ps4 to pc and i must say it night and day
19734,"If you like to become slave of the wild life join ark, this awesome game will 100% kill you in less than 1 howr and raptors or trodons will camp the sh*^ of you! 10/10 I RECOMMEND!"
19735,"Love the building, exploring and Dinos.. This really made me realize what a wary person I am as I spent a long time just building up everything before I even made up my mind to see what the story had for me. I have only just touched the tip of the iceburg when it comes to this game. Also, I prefer to play solo only. This is one of my escapes from the world."
19736,bad game
19737,Dino Go VROOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM

19747,Yes
19748,👍
19749,if u have time this game is for you
19750,So much fun its a challenging game if you like that this is the game for you. There are so many different features to this game including mods that you can use. On top of it this game is always being updated.
19751,nicee
19752,just the best game for pvp and for pve

19759,"I really enjoy this game with many many hours played with interested friends, however I couldn't recommend it to many of my other friends because the default balance is so heavily weighted to PvP. Even the ""single player"" settings put PvP balance ahead of just enjoying the game."
19760,It's AMAZING
19761,sussy
19762,Very fun if you play with friends cool mods just dont play official servers if you dont have all day everyday to play and guard ur base.
19763,nice game
19764,"I have been playing ARK: Survival Evolved since 2016. I try other games, but I always come back to ARK, it is my home game. I love to content, the game play, the challenge, the excitement. Best Game Ever!"
19765,fun game
19766,Nice
19767,"Still newer to playing it on PC, but i came from playing it on XBOX since it first came to to early access (Roughly 8k+ Hours). Altho it can be flawed, this has been my favorite way to waste alot of hours for what would be no reason."
19768,I moved to PC for ark 2. Over excited for everything to come. including the last DLC for Ark survival evolved. I've been playing for over 4 years. Thank you!!
19769,Can't play half the game because the giant creepy crawlies in caves are too life like. Recommended.
19770,fun with friends
19771,"destroys my head forever.
Seek medical help at all costs.
Priority: very high"
19772,"It is a fun game to play either in single player or multiplayer.
So many different mods you can add to it from the workshop including modded maps.
It is overall one of the best survival games to play with friends."
19773,"Play the game for lost time, money, and your job (if you have)."
19774,"Honestly one of the most beautiful and fun experiences I have had while gaming whilst simultaneously being one of the biggest shitshows ever, regularly bringing my heartrate near mount everest"
19775,Best game ever also gets you addicted and sleep problems and depressed but besides that best game ever :)
19776,"There's no other game like this. I think I have 8-9K hours playing on console, and still find new things to do. I just bought the Steam version to play on my custom built PC. It's a much better experience if you play without spawning in whatever you want. Very rewarding leveling system. I like survival games so this game is perfect for me. If you like survival sims or crafting sims, adventure games or whatnot, get this one. There's several maps, and you can transfer your character and equipment between them. At first it's a struggle, but as you level up you can accomplish more rewarding challenges. Use your dinos to your advantage, they make life easier."
19777,Getting eaten by a dino is the highlight of my day.
19778,good
19779,This is the best game I have ever played
19780,THIS GAME IS AMAZING DEFINTALLY TRY IT OUT IF U LIKE DINO GAMES AND SURVIVAL GAMES
19781,"only thing that is probably gonna be better is Ark 2. fucking amazing experience as a game, although you may encounter some glitches like falling into the map and unforgiving scenarios like losing everything you accomplished or took days to get :D"

19790,good game
19791,It's definitely more fun modded and with friends but worth checking out regardless!
19792,one of the most fun but  also buggy games ive ever played 10/10
19793,Very addicting.  haven't played any game so hard since I was like 12 hahaha
19794,nice
19795,"Fun with friends, not too fun by yourself."
19796,"I have played the game for more than 100 hours. I have played on official and unofficial servers. I think I am qualified to leave a decent review.

I highly recommend this game to everyone, it has a lot of features that will make you lose the perception of time. I mean you can tame dinos, raise them and fight with them by your side.

Plus, you can build things like houses, traps and any structure you want.

It has its drawbacks, yes. It's extremely difficult, it has a lot of bugs and you absolutely must play on unofficial servers.

Please just ignore the negative stuff and experience this wonderful game for yourself. It is unique and deserves to be experienced. I play it every day and simply accept the bad things. Every single game in the world has bad things but people keep playing them because they enjoy them."
19797,"i love the game, its amazing, a few bugs sometimes, but its still very good

19814,good
19815,There's just so much to do. Do I wish the graphics were a little better? Yes. However the size and options you can do in the maps make up for it 10 fold. I love this game and everyone should play it.
19816,Fun game to play with friends. Love to explore the variety of maps and trying to tame cool creature which usually ends in death which adds difficulty to the game.
19817,"Very fun I recommend, but a pain in the ass when you die and get your loot and die again"
19818,yes
19819,best dinosaur game
19820,"Honestly wish I played .4 hours less to refund this game. To this day the developers still won't fix game breaking bugs that everyone knows about. Trying to play PVP without everything just dying because people are abusing the bugs is just a nightmare. It's only worth to play this PVE but the DLC, time investment, and getting a group together you trust enough is just not worth the effort of doing or paying for. 

It sucks because the game play and theme of this game is great, just it's another game that basic mechanical problems that could be fixed if the developers showed it better love and didn't greed."

19894,ahem before you download or buy think if it's worth it 60 for main and 20 for most dlcs is a small price to pay but hundreds of hours of work wiped is the agony that will be felled on you if you like the game and play it for real it just not worth it it never is... other then that great game and time waster with friends.
19895,"Sexy
"
19896,"Great game if you have the money for $1700+ laptops/desktops. Game size easily gets to 400+ GB. Graphics could be better, bugs aren't absolutely game-breaking but are very irritating sometimes alongside game crashes. Good variety of creatures, activities, decorations, and scenery. Not a whole lot of good mods to choose from. Not good for single-player starters, but you're guaranteed to get your wacky little naked self eaten by a level 150 Dilophosaurus on the beach the moment you start in an official server. If you're not eaten, you're constantly fearing other players and probably waiting for your inevitable doom(s). Even if you have a group of friends to play on a private server with, its still pretty frustrating, and taming can take several DAYS (real time) whereas breeding can take MONTHS for optimal results. Creative mode gets boring after you've done just about everything there is to do and seen everything there is to see, and Genesis forces you through nearly 100 missions per zone (there are 5 zones, so this comes to ~500 missions) to progress, and then you get to do it again in Genesis 2, although there's only one 'zone' with ~4 sections to it. Play at your own risk (or utter frustration). Although I will inevitably keep returning to this game every few months, I will still warn others of what they're getting into with this game."

19907,"One of the best survival games I've played. So much content to explore and taming dinos is super fun. Keep in mind that out of the 7 ish maps, 3 are free dlc I believe and the other 3 are paid dlcs so the base game doesn't guarantee you all maps."
19908,bpood
19909,"This is my favourite game and also the game I hate the most.I can't start playing without getting destroyed by rex,alpha raptor,gigantosaurus... in early game.Would recomend if ur ready to spend 10 hours a day just grinding to get destoryed by one of bosses."
19910,this game has the worst server lag iv ever seen and theres some bug form switching maps with your same character
19911,very  good multiplayer game ever lots of content
19912,I enjoy this game. You may also enjoy this game.
19913,q
19914,Very fun and addicting game :)
19915,"One of my all time favourite games.
Started with BETA access on console (which led to over 1000+ hrs of incredible fun) to another 250hrs on PC more recently.

With the long awaited Fjordur just around the corner, I can see another 1000hr play through coming very soon!

Ark on PC with a select few free mods and you can't go wrong with this game. Yes it has its quirks, yes it's very clunky when building but hey, I love it and you will too!"
19916,love the game. i can sit and play for hours
19917,ok
19918,"Very fun game if you have the patience.
"
19919,ok
19920,love it cant wait for !! ARK 2 !!

19928,.
19929,You can be a caveman and have dinosaurs what else does a game need?
19930,its fun
19931,yeah bro its got dinosaurs.
19932,Hours of fun and many maps to explore. Plenty of re-playable content and you can always spice things up with some mods from workshop. Meet wide variety of dinosaurs and other creatures and tame them to command and ride them yourself. Everything has their uses for something. Some creature might be good for farming stone and the other one good for wood.
19933,h
19934,devs help us
19935,Game gud
19936,I love dinos!
19937,good
19938,Wonderful opportunity to be eaten alive by raptors! 10/10!
19939,Top 3 survival games of all time. PvP is rough but is still fun.
19940,"If you are okay with grinding and spending endless hours building, gathering, killing, etc. this game can be added to your list of games to play."
19941,"hwne ui say i ujsut farted and sit stibnks it smelsl really bad 
"
19942,good game
19943,love the game
19944,game is lowkey ass but its fun if you play with friends. definitely not a bad game tho

19948,good game
19949,yes
19950,no
19951,By far the best survival game however its buggy and runs like an obese snail 10/10
19952,"Love ittttt

19953,unique game
19954,"if it wasn't the size of your mother and also not the buggiest game alive, i would play it more."
19955,dino nuggets :)
19956,"Enjoyable experience, if you can stomach the egregious connection and loading bugs.

ARK: Survival Evolved is a great survival game with fun yet challenging PvE and PvP gameplay, and can pretty accurately be described as ""Rust with Dinosaurs"". The problems arise only once you've sunk a decent number of hours into your singleplayer game. Along with bugs faced by many open world games (pits you can't escape from, flinging especially with high movement speed) ARK has it's own slew of problems you wouldn't expect a AAA game that's been out for this long to have. Half of the time, with or without mods, singleplayer and non-dedicated sessions will not start at all, leaving the game hanging and leaking memory. This happens to all my friends as well as me. Crashing while joining a server will leave you unable to ever connect to that server again (until the server restarts), and even though crashing while in-game rarely occurs, it happens frequently when loading. World saves corrupt weekly, losing you hours of progress. Want a friend to play with you on a non-dedicated session? Get ready for hours of debugging on both sides, only for the issue to fix itself a while later.

Community mods can make the game much more enjoyable, but good luck loading into ANY modded world if the game isn't located on a solid state drive."
19957,"Ark catched me because of my interest in dinosaurs. Although still buggy at some points, it didn't disappoint. I like it."
19958,a
19959,Best waste of time and high-stakes multiplayer game there is. its rust plus extra stuff.
19960,no

19966,Yes.
19967,yes.........
19968,FUN
19969,I am a dinosaur nerd. And I also like survival games... so ... this is two of my most favorite things together... I don't know what else more to say... you can ride a trex. That's all someone would have to say to me to get me in the game.
19970,I just love the taming dinos and building aspect of the game.
19971,"Love killing small harmless defenseless animals!
10/10"
19972,very fun and mods are very creative
19973,a bit(very) glitchy but its a solid game but new players shouldn't go on pvp or they most likely will be gone very fast apart from most of the pvp community youtuber's like syntac and meola have really nice community's and i would recommend checking out syntacs discord even if you dont like his youtube videos or something if you have a question just like ask there
19974,10
19975,"Great survival game. By default it is more of an arcade version of survival with tech; but you can modify it to your liking.

The good:
Too much to list. Def worth a buy.

The bad:
Graphics are good but a bit buggy at times. Like blurr and artifacting (2080ti on 2k highest settings)
The dino AI is awful (getting them to follow you through a door is hard mode).
Herding isn't a thing for the most part. Mostly MMO style pathing between a few points.
If you want realism the dino ""abilities"" are a bit weird.
Building snap points could use a lot of work."
19976,"its ass, you cant even have a thatch base before it gets raided by a giga. the only way to play this trash game is by becoming a slave for alpha tribes."
19977,"What. The. Actual is wrong with this game?
It'S such a buggy mess, it's almost unplayable!
Spawning in the sky, Randomly dying by fall damage, broken map geometry and, and, and.
also awful mechanics"
19978,its a good game put there is alot of bugs they need to fix
19979,"if you like rust and other games of that nature , ark is the same but better because you can tame dinos ! you can do online an join servers if you wish but keep in mind people aren't nice when it comes to staying alive lol but the game is great <3"
19980,"This is a Exremely fun PvE and PvP survival crafter, I find myself returning to it almost every time I'm bored with most games"
19981,"very good only played for a bit
tbh it felt like 2 mins of gameplay"
19982,It pretty good.
19983,really good game if you are looking for a challenge and if the normal maps get boring there are tons of mods
19984,itsa very nicesa
19985,dino
19986,bc it is a fun game
19987,9 outta 10
19988,good
19989,best survival game ever
19990,"Well let's be honest I bought Ark way back in 2018 and well at first I didn't like it, it was way too grind of a game I would sit there all day getting wood and stone excreta and still hardly get anywhere I played around 50 hrs with a small group of friends then just stopped because I just didn't care anymore.
Now 4 years later another small group of my friends bought the game on steam and made a server and I asked them if I could join I don't know what it is about this game this time around but it's actually been fun grinding levels and getting resources and learning a lot about the game like today I tamed my First T-Rex and I was just munching on stuff it was fun.
Now the game still needs some work but it's still very playable it takes a bit for things to load in and giant rocks sometime appear and disappear right in front of you.
But overall Ark is A fun game with friends definitely not for alone game it gives a great dino challenge 

Graphics 7/10
Gameplay 8/10
Dinos 7/10
Challenging 8/10 
replayability 6/10
"
19991,Very god i kill my frend lol
19992,I like Dinos
19993,good game 10/10
19994,"This game is Amazing, i have played this for hundreds of hours on console and when i upgraded to pc i had to get this game.
the graphics are so nice BUT the gameplay is ok.
it is rather brutal in the way that a pack of raptors can really ennd your life if youre not careful but later on when you get a gun or crossbow they just become a source of free hide/food.
i have never ever liked dinosaurs but after playing this game i started liking them, i like knowing the name of the dinosaurs and that i learnt from this game.
all in all ill say.
Graphics: 7/10
Gameplay 6/10
progression 9/10
difficulty 8/10
all in all 7.5/10
do i recomend this? yeah but just keep in mind there will be a bit of research and skill needed (or friends)"
19995,very cool survival game.
19996,"wack ass dino game. game is literally 200+ gigs for what?(thats with dlc) shit gets old quick, unless you're a no life. i know people that eat, drink, and breathe the game. wake up and instantly get on the game just to do the same old shit."
19997,"This is one of my favorite games, I love it and especially with mods! But the game itself is a fun and challenging survival game and there is so many things to do that I've played this game for more than 2 year and didn't do everything yet! I recommend a download for this the price is worth it."
19998,"Ark is an amazing game, only after 700 hours am I now starting to get bored of it. I still find it fun every now and then though. If you like survival games this is the number 1 in my opinion. 100% worth every penny, especially on sale but even full price it's worth it. I only play single player, but I've done pvp servers before and for the most part they're fun as long as you play small tribes. But if you want pvp to be even better, get some friends."
19999,its a really good game if you like survival games

20012,"super detailed and realistic although its very big, if your pc can handle it get it"
20013,"very very addicting, do not play normally unless you want to spend tons of hours on this game, I recomend that you play with 5x taming and breeding speeds at least. You could almost do that for anything honestly but those 2 for sure. Other than that this game can be very scary but once you get into it, there is endless stuff to do and you always have stuff you need to do whether you are on a pvp server (idk why) or on a friends only dedicated server, no matter the map its overall a great game."
20014,Great Game. Just needs some bug fixes
20015,Good
20016,so like creepy shit flys at u at 3 in the morning and like a bunch of little kids want sakdhhalshdlashk anyways do the fortnite dance

20021,"game fucking blows cock'
"
20022,"The concept is good but the game is buggy, the path finding is trash, the clipping is terrible, the way the NPCs function is sloppy and for all the years of the game being out instead of fixing the game itself they just kept adding more creatures.  I get features sell games but have some pride of work and fix the world and the engine guys."
20023,"I got this game, installed it 3 times, and cant even play it. When I try to join a friend, it crashes and when I try to start my own world everything except for The Island does nothing when I start it and The Island freezes the game so badly that I had to use Task Manager to close it. Not worth the $60 USD I spent on this. My 4.5 hours on record was me trying to play it"
20024,i love it

20047,Dinosaurs
20048,"This game is really enjoyable, if you have mods. In my opinion this game is one of those games that needs mods to play. The taming, for one thing, is really boring and without mods, this aspect of the game is awful. Other than the mods, me and my friends have had so much fun with this game and play it for months or even a year at a time. Overall if you can get mods for this game it is a good buy, if you can't I'd still give it a try."
20049,"I love this game and hate it so much at the same time. I really enjoy it and have hundreds of hours on the console version, but this one is nice too. I wish you could customize settings per map, instead of all of them as a whole. But other than that, and dying so much, it is a very fun game."

20062,dino bussy
20063,Amazing game addicting asf. If you want to play legit your gonna either need alot of time on your hands or your gonna have your world for a long time before you get anywhere. personally i love the game and have around 1500 hours on xbox and its way better now that im on steam. overall i recommend the game especially if you have tons of time to play
20064,very fun to paly with friends
20065,Good game. Dinosaur go brrrrr
20066,Ark Is A great game with many things to do. I recommend it for gamers who want a challenge

20076,"I bought this game since it was recommended 'similar' to my favourite survival games (Subnautica, Green Hell, the Forest, etc).  Very disappointed so far.  It does not have the sense of 'urgency and despair' you get from usual survival games.  

I find the trend of games that rely on YouTube and other sites to explain how to play their game to be a very lazy trait on the part of the gaming industry.

20097,"very good

"
20098,"This game is incredibly fun to play, especially with friends! tons of creatures to tame, and the environments are interesting. My only issues with it is the fact that the game takes up so much of my storage, to the point where each update makes me have to uninstall game after game in my library. It's not something that's fixable I reckon but it is a huge downside to this game. I may have to stop playing it in the near future because my laptop can only have so much space lol"
20099,It is a better version then minecraft.
20100,this game is a amazing dinosaur rpg game the textures maps and the creatures are all a amazing part of the game it is a garunteed keeper if it was my opinion

20118,Horror
20119,Way too slow of a game.  You can spend hours playing this and get nowhere due to the amount of resources you need to collect to build anything.  There are dinos that can help but capturing and taming them is a pain in the ass because other dinos come and eat them when you're trying to collect them.
20120,gg great game good should play real fun add mods like omega
20121,Great game!
20122,This was a really fun game and so far I've been plying it every day since getting it.
20123,good
20124,"Ark is an amazing and fun game that you can always get back into no matter how long you take a break from it. It doesn't every get old since the game developers are always bringing new additions into the game, Unlike a lot of games that rely on mod developers to kept players interested."
20125,"First, I don't really like the game and rather to babysitting taming dino. However after try hard for a day, I'm officially addicted to this game and play it like 12 hours a day,"

20151,"Ark is like an abusive relationship. It's crazy addicting and the good times are better than any other good times, but you know deep down that the devs are going to get your hopes up with QOL fixes and DLC that will inevitably be late or never come. 

I've turned to using the phrase ""getting Arked"" in any video game in which a bug costs me significant progress or headache. 

Despite this, I still haven't learned my lesson, keep coming back, and would 10/10 recommend this game."

20172,"There's a metric ton of stuff to learn about this game that I could realistically write an entire novel and only be half way through explaining the mechanics in depth. The game is a massive time sink, depending on how you play,.There are plenty of servers that make the game less tedious, or if you want to play singleplayer, you can tweak pretty much every setting yourself and make the perfect experience that you want. Or if you want to spend 4 literal real life days raising a baby T-rex you could always play offical! (Don't. For the love of all that is holy don't play offical) A good chunk of your time is gonna be on google and the wiki looking for information on the game. But all in all, the game is worth the massive time requirement to learn, and get good at it."

it's a really fun survival game if your playing with friend.s"

20181,very nice

20200,"good

20201,"I only have 95 hours logged on PC but I have a couple hundred on PS4. This game has come a long way. It was always an awesome concept but the execution was a bit poor in the beginning. Now you have a fully fleshed, well running game. I don't even do the story aspects (though I watch Youtubers do so and it looks awesome) so even just as a dinosaur based survival game, this offers so much. Add in the rich modding community and this is a game you can play pretty aggressively for years without ever getting bored."
20202,Its cool
20203,ITS GOOD
20204,love this game so much! very glitchy but worth it!!
20205,its good
20206,"I've spent nearly 2000 hours playing this game at the time of this review... I was tempted to leave a negative review because that would be quite funny. Instead, I obviously enjoy this game. Sure, there are issues here and there... but Studio Wildcard didn't make hundreds of millions of dollars from this game because it sucks... it's clearly an awesome game. Though I should mention that I only play on a private dedicated server. I never play official. Maybe that's why I enjoy it so much :)"
20207,HaHa Dinos go brrrrrrrrrrr
20208,ark is a really good game if you like open world survival games if you like that genre i would definitely recommend this game

20222,okay this game is good but it says 60GB okay but really its a 125.17GB like jezzs make the file size small man that game is too fucking big for no reason at all due to who many maps and the dlcs isnt even worth it okay i have a 1TB ssd okay it should not take up so much of my ssd space okay that is just bullshit this game is fun to play okay i love this game and having a blast but the size of the game should not be that fucking big for no reason if anything the DEVS are just lazy an not fix there shit to lower the game size because the community keeps making cool maps so they just make the game size more and more bigger and thats just bullshit and they know that.but hey if you like it and wanna get wait for it to go on sale I RECOMMEND YOU GET A #TB OF A SSD OR A HARDDRIVE THIS GAME SUCKS UP SPACE FOR NO REASON

20252,This game is optimized terribly with ridiculous file sizes. DLC and community content is a total shitshow. The workshop is stuffed full of scams and contributors stealing content from each other.

20264,The game could be fun but the community is the most toxic community I have ever seen in any game. If you are starting the game on an official sever good luck because you will be chased down by people on dragons and wyverns killing you and your tames simply because they saw you. 6/10 game  -10/10 community
20265,gud soup
20266,"Amazing game for feeling like you're in a real survival situation. It's good for people of all kinds because you can play more primitive style, more advanced, with mods etc. There's dinosaurs, fish, robots, aliens, mythical creatures and so much more, which can be mutated for colours of your choice, there's creatures for everyone."

"
20273,"Despite being a very DLC based game (which already makes it difficult to obtain for the average gamer), it's actually quite an engaging piece. I purchased this game while it was on sale around December 2019, and it is something that I enjoyed for every minute of gameplay. 

Something that I do find frustrating though is that it is near impossible to host a private server for you and your friends, and to have one that won't be overrun and griefed by randoms costs a lot to host. As someone who wanted to play this casually with her friends, that was my only real deal breaker.

If you've got a pretty penny to spend on DLC and server hosting, it is something that I recommend. If not, prepare to either play this game solo, or have your base completely destroyed and taken over by strangers on all of the openly hosted servers for the public."
20274,soul crushing.

20280,"Played this for a long time. Loved it. Had a lot of stuff and bases on PvP servers. Today I uninstalled! Too many cheaters that are not being controlled. The developer wants to sell their games but are unable to provide protection from cheaters. That renders their games a fail no matter how wonderful the game is in and by itself. Its a shame! Good bye, that is it for me!!"
20281,"I got perm banned for living in the mesh as a solo player with all the mega tribes running up on my regular bases with level 350-400 duped meks, wildcard would rather ban the solo players then the people who are ruining the game with duping and cheats. Guess I'll just play something else."

20294,its fun you learn dinosuars names
20295,Very good game I played it for 99 hours so far and I am still not board of this game  because its so addicting.
20296,"Ark is once again a game with amazing potential and unique concepts that is absolutely ruined by its meager excuses of  developer and moderator teams. An astounding presence of bugs, and known game issues that we're never resolved and continue to not be address. The develops pay no sentiment to the players or listen to any sort of grievances and develop a holier-than-thou attitude when approaching reports. Their servers server stability is laughable, to the point where some Gen2 servers even drop into the 70%s of actual uptime. Many of these crashes resulting in item or dino loss, to which wildcards response is they cannot replace any items, and dinos can only be replaced with lvl150, random stats, color, gender of the same dino, essentially the equivalent of Gamestop's policy of buying back your whole library of games for $5. It's laughable and down right disrespectful. The mods don't care, and while a decent amount of the PvE community is friendly and kind, its spoiled by the bad apples who ruin the game for other while the GMs watch and either do nothing, or punish the victims. I'm absolutely disgusted by the way Ark is managed, and I have no doubts Ark2 will be as much of a poor excuse, my sympathy is to those who will wish to continue playing Ark1 but Wildcard has made it clear they're going to just about abandon the game. It's a shame this game was developed by Wildcard, it sincerely could have been such a gem."
20297,Its like having stockholm syndrome.
20298,"globo**** corp shit. Buy it if you want their ideology popping up on your feed whenever a ""current issue"" month rolls around.
Otherwise, could be a decent game if they ever optimized or fixed anything."

20304,"its boring, like rust but even worse. not even mods make it fun"
20305,"This game is overly time consuming. its pissed me off but i have to say i like the game enough to keep playing it and i like exploring the new maps and the fact you basically have digital pets that are dinos and more recently more fantasy type creatures. its probably would be better if my old gaming friends played with me.
the down fall is you have to have a super computer to run it smoothly"
20306,p
20307,dino
20308,its rust but dinosaur and cool things like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh monke
20309,Great game if you also go to the workshop and get some dlcs it makes the game fun if u have beat everything without them.
20310,"Shit, broken, unbalanced, barely logical, terribly designed mess

also why does this game let you unmount a bird 500 feet into the air, what situation would you ever do that. . . . . . except accidentally pressing the key. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

And I'm also rating down this game cause the microraptor exists, a enemy so fucking retarded that a small litttle insignificant little shit can somehow stun lock you for 8 seconds and cause you to die cause you are no longer able to defend yourself."
20311,nj
20312,good
20313,it is fun
20314,"This game is, without a doubt THE BEST game I have ever played.  Like Pokemon meets Sim 2, for adults.  I literally play no other game than this.  What I love best is that you have to work.  It's not a game where you wander around and find things that make the game progress.  You work for everything and you earn everything.  I only pray Ark 2 is a worthy successor."
20315,super laggy but also fun
20316,"Great game. Learning curve is steep, but worth it!"
20317,One of the few games that I had to stop myself from playing. Super time consuming and super deep and great. Looking forward to ARK 2 and hope they figure out the hacker issues online.

20324,Really fun! also i love to migrate and explore the ark I've never killed a boss yet though I've never got to there there are many Dinos my favorite on is the baboon though there are not happy when taming they brutal but anyway i suggest you to play the game i'm sure you'll find what you like

20352,A really fun and well thought out game but will melt your CPU and graphics card for any low-mid tier computer. If the games graphics weren't so demanding this would probably be one of the best games out there but it seems like you'd need a 10k dollar PC to play without your computer exploding. 8/10

20364,"game is fantasic, great graphics, tons of features.. defenitlely my style and genre. build your base, tame dinosaurs, survive through primitive times. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games, and dinosaurs.
the only bad thing about this game is that it can be very buggy at times, and takes up ALOT of storage.
other than that, love it!"
20365,This game is terribly optimized and you need a literal 3090ti to run it at max graphics 1080p60. Other than that it's fun and looks good. It also has dinosaurs.
20366,Amazing game! 10/10 addicting!
20367,"This game is nothing I could of imagined good storyline, great details, & plenty of more mods to discover, get ready for an awesome adventure new survivors"
20368,not recommended game
20369,"Many of my friends asked me to buy and play this game.
Which i did,
And I've put a ton of hours into this game.
(The xbox one version I've play hundreds of hours)

Even with mods- it's boring repetitive, or too easy. I've never play with the right balance.
Every moddable game i've play there are mods that change things up.
Not with this game
And you'd think with the million options to change games settings it would lead to infinite replayability....it helps for a little bit.
It also runs...okay (90 fps on high/ultra) on a $2100 custom built pc in 2021. Optimization is poor- its not 7 days to die bad but I used to think maybe they'll work on it- but instead they're focused on adding more maps. 

That, and cheering on the groomers and banning people for calling them out on it.
Because of that fact alone- I will never be returning to this game.
I play games to get away from the world and all the shameful debauchery of society 
Not to be preached to by the groomers and boomers.

If you buy this game, you're going to love the crap out of it- then, you're going to hate it.
I wont tell you not to- (unless you have morals), because I've clearly enjoyed this game. 
But dont say I didn't warn you.
It WILL eat days at a time. And not necessarily in a positive way.
It's a good game with mild replayability.
But with a insensitive dev team, and don't play multiplayer unless you've friends. It's very Rust like (which is the community, not the devs fault)"

20381,"devs are fags

happy pride month ... disgusting. 
"
20382,This game is really fun a few bugs but that is expected with any game. The only thing that makes this game hard is the insane learning curve it has since all of the dinos have special uses and how to make everything work. If you are playing this the first time i would install either structure plus or super structures. Since it helps with the building aspects but it is a very fun game just a very steep learning curve. I do recommend buy might wait for it to be on sale since it is the near the end of its life since the new version is coming within the next 2 years.

I always wanted to play a game where I could heavily interact with both. Now, how in the fuck do you fuck up a game so bad that even I don't like it? I'd rather eat an apple crawling with ants that's been sitting in the sun for 3 days than ever play this dumpster fire ever again."

(it seems like an alpha) overall i despise this game with passion. thanks for listening to my ted talk

20446,"I have been playing Ark since it was in alpha. I have played on every platform and it remains to this day my all time favourite game. There is a big learning curve for a first time player but that's what i love about it. It truly is a survival game. You learn to recognise the dinosaurs based on their footsteps and their individual noises. It helps you be very self aware of your surroundings which is important if you are to survive. There is quite a few people that will talk bad about the game but they all fall into the category of I hate the game but i still play it on a daily basis. I always described ark as a drug. You always come back no matter how wrong it has done you because it's so addictive. You can always re-build a destroyed base. re-tame new dinos you may have lost and re-craft your lost items. There's always something for you to do. It's such a great, surreal experience and i would highly recommend anyone to give it a try."
20447,"If you like dinosaurs, and crafting, or maybe even just exploring youll love this game. Some parts may be a bit glitchy but hey, its open map so its to be expected. Be prepared for several hours just to disappear as you journey through the Ark."
20448,cock n ball torture
20449,I love this game!
20450,One of the best games i have ever played years of Fun worth every penny
20451,wer sd
20452,scawy dinos rap-e yo booty
20453,"very recomended game, tha's so cool and amazing gameplay"
20454,Buggy game that doesn't take pride in fixing anything.  Instead they invest dev time in silly events.
20455,stop begging me to get this game and then just not play it!!!! i even bought a $50 hardrive just so i could actually install it
20456,it sucks
20457,As someone who's played since 2015.  (played mostly on xbox prior to game pass) I keep coming back even if none of my other friends do. PVP can be rough but the server selection makes getting wiped a bunch ok because building back up is easier unless you play strictly vanilla everything. plenty of amazing mods and the dino selection is pretty good. ultimately you're either going to love this game or hate it.
20458,I like dinos but without the other people
20459,pp
20460,"When game developers start pushing woke, they are on the ""do not have anything to do with"" list."
20461,to laggy
20462,the mods are good
20463,"I love the aspect of this game. It is fun to tame, ride and breed your dinos. It's like Minecraft meets Jurassic Park."
20464,Was a great game for a time.... now? Well they are pro-child grooming. So I havent played in years and I suggest people not give them a dime.
20465,"This game is pretty fun! I got it for the dinosaurs you can have as pets. It's fun riding on them! You can tame the dinos, ride them, and take care of them. I also have a workshop add on where it allows you to be the dinosaur! It's really fun! This game is also multiplayer so you can play with multiple people which is really cool!"
20466,"this game is VERY fun however its simply boring at some points due to how unoptimised the game is, my pc can run almost 240fps on any game however i struggle to get even 30 with mods installed then u need to buy all of the dlcs or play the free ones which are never updated"
20467,Pushing their agenda on the players. I can't even escape from it in video games anymore.
20468,i love the variety of dinos the mods they are cool because it makes the game more fun and challenging
20469,the game was fun but after about 50 hours the game stopped working and every time I tried to play the game it would crash
20470,Good:)
20471,"good game
"
20472,"EDIT: As of now with the total game and dlc being installed takes up 385 gigs. Absolutely gigantic; I've been gaming for years and this is the biggest game I've ever encountered. Not only that but the downloads are buff AF and the gameplay has gotten worse since the recent patches and expansion. If they ever actually optimize their game it would be good. For now I can not recommend. Sad to say.

Super fun game! You can literally do damn near everything in the game. My only gripe is Scorched Earth is waaaay too hard imo. But I'm no survival ace like most of y'all."
20473,Ark is a ok survival game.. But it lacks in every department for it to be any good. It is clunky and the progression feeling is just lacking.. Dinos looks awsome tho!

20493,I love it all. The survival part where you have to be careful. The Building where you can make your Base what ever way you need it to be. And the Taming dinos for strategic uses from helping get materials to using  them for Big Boss fights.
20494,Goated Game 10/10
20495,"What can I say.  I've got way too many hours in it, so I must really like it huh?

Sure, it's buggy and everyone bitches about the optimization.  At the same time, if you look at the cost, and the amount of fun/time you spend with it.. Chances are it's a great value.  

I mean, I don't recall exactly what I paid in total (Game + 2 season passes for DLC's), but I probably paid less than 4 cents per hour in this game."
20496,i love ark
20497,"Great game! takes up a lot of space, but its a great to play by your self and with friends. 10/10 would recomend"

20503,"Overall it's a good game. Had way too much fun with friends, but could just be overall less buggy and prettier. Especially the building is nerve-wrecking without mods.  Can't wait for the next Ark, although I'm also scared it'll be disappointing. I just hope they take the criticism from this one seriously, cause the concept and even story of the game is awesome."

20522,its ruining my liife
20523,i played this game since early access and have watched it grow. this game has some of my most fond memories form my childhood from modding the game until it would stop working to hatching hundreds of dinos to raise. a lot of people complain about it lagging and being buddy but most of the time it is because it is to modded for you pc. 9.5/10 i love this game.

No"
20549,"yes, official giga good lol"
20550,Doesn't work 80% of the time. Crashes constantly. Waste of money.
20551,the only game i always go back to play when i am bored
20552,"I genuinely have no idea how people get to more than 100 hours on this game and still have their computer alive and well, when i say this i mean that ark is the only game to ever literally overheat my cpu (ryzen 9 5900HX btw) and trigger the restart failsafe for the computer to not just die. i DO like the game and i DO want to play it, its just that i literally cant do that without my entire pc possibly becoming an electric grill. i would recommend if you have THE BEST cooling system in the world, but any other than that will simply not do (yes i do have a really good cooling pad for my laptop, this still happens).
if you are not careful, this game WILL kill your computer. (not saying from experience)

all in all, this a good game until it comes to bugs and optimization, i will not talk about bugs but ark is the MOST UN-OPTIMIZED game i have EVER seen, NO game has been able to cook my cpu as good as ark. i have heard that the epic games version of ark doesnt kill your pc, so if you want ark, go there."
20553,"Hours played: 315 hours. This is probably the most immersive survival game I have ever played. If you have friends ready to dedicate some time to a shared survival experience, then I would highly recommend you make a private server to explore ARK within. Playing on official servers make you run the risk of getting griefed, loosing weeks of work.
Opinions of cons: game is grindy (unless you tweak the settings), graphics are poorly optimized so you need strong computer, new expansions are repetitive to the original one."
20554,"I had a huge house on island 395. I built it for a very long time. I spent an incredible amount of time and effort on it. But on the territory of my house, newcomers began to appear, who had just arrived on my server where my house was located. And since the players appeared inside my house, they could not leave it and complained to the developers. The developers, instead of moving the spawn location to another location, simply destroyed my house. THEY HAVE IT DOWN. It's their fault that players show up on my territory, but they were too lazy. All my work is gone. And so it is with everything in this game. Gen 2 keeps dropping and you lose everything. And more and more. I do not recommend playing this game."
20555,nice game
20556,"dino cool but game could be more polished 
lots of bugs"
20557,very fun game

20589,mid
20590,"I have fun at this game but the game is poorly reacting to everything and it is filled with too many problem for me to recommand it to anybody even if I enjoy the game.

- crash // I sometime crash even if it is rare and I have a good pc but I noticed that often the game give a blue screen to many player AT THE SAME TIME, I had at least 5+ player crashing at the same time so I had to protect the body of my friend in the dungeon and learn that half the lobby got a blue screen.

- Really stupid loading zone // they place loading zone in hostile spawn still, in lost island by example there is a loading time underwater, that is super long for most people, 1 person out of 2 drown before finishing loading, and it is so long that the piranha you killed respawn on you and kill you during that load.

- Worst hit registration I have ever seen. if you shoot a dino he is gona have a hole in his face but 1/2 time (often more) you wont receive a hit marker so it wont count.

- pillar PVE// I am already established but some people will put pillar so it prevent people from building (you cant build near other player structures) so I can't see someone being able to start fresh in 90% of officials servers

- bug and unfixed problem that have been there for too long. a ton of bug happen with dinos like mana that jump out of the skybox. dinos that disapear without dying for no reason ... you can walk trough some walls, and die. antimeshing will often destroy your stuff if you die when that happen.

I played 600 hours but because of multiple of my friends that dont play anymore because of what I stated previously I can't recommand this game for new players.
Even if I like the game, it still feel like an Alpha.

20640,"I have only been playing ARK for about 5 months now and I was a Xbox player and have fully integrated to PC. I absolutely love this game. At first it can be a bit challenging because of the dino's, weather, and other things that can potentially kill you but once you get the hang of it its a pretty bomb ass game. I also really enjoy the Mods that are out for the game to help players out but to also make the game a bit more interesting and challenging. I would recommend this game to anyone who love Minecraft as this is almost the same thing but with DINOS! There is a some issues as ALWAYS when it comes to games but its nothing to LIKE hate or get flustered about. I hope this review helps newbies and as always HAPPY HUNTING!"

20645,very good and has dinos thats a razatik certified game
20646,gud soup
20647,"Man, what can I even say about ARK. I've spent countless hours grinding away just to make enough arrows and gathering enough resources to tame a dino, then babysitting the unconscious dino only for it to be mauled to death in an instant the next day.  I've gotten into death loops, losing tame after tame as I try to get back to my corpse and retrieve my gear before deciding to cut my losses and start over. I've gotten wiped before I could finish my first thatch hut, and quickly realized that unofficial PVE is the way to go for a player like me. I've had my precious Carno fall through the map, never to be seen again. The game can be one big, frustrating slog!

But I've also flown all the way up to the skybox on a snow owl, pausing for a moment at the apex to take in the view before diving straight down at top speed, dancing around wyverns and snatching their eggs from under them. I have conquered my fears and plunged into the caves, taking down waves and waves of impossibly high leveled bugs with my bear and emerging battered and bloodied but victorious, with an inventory full of loot. I've met and allied with small groups of players, each of us lifting each other up and building not just villages, but communities. And I've discovered and installed  incredible mods made with care and talent that improve on every aspect of the game. 

This is one of those games that you just get sucked into, and when it's good, it's magic. There IS a lot of grinding though, and I recommend trying out unofficial or single player so that you can mod the experience to reduce this, or at the very least change the settings around. Also my tip: start on Ragnarok. No DLC purchase required, and you'll have a much better time there than on The Island. Or you could also try Fjordur for a similar experience, but you'd better make a fire fast if you go that route! 

ARK is a buggy, poorly optimized trainwreck but man, you gotta give it a try."

Edit: Online for new players (aka me) is dumb. ran into a spanish clan in a NA server and as soon as they figured out I didn't speak Spanish they threw me into a cage. The thing is though, I was in a server where I had really good ping. I don't live near any Spanish countries, so I was kinda suprised when I found a spanish speaking clan that didn't seem to have any english vocab (I live in the topish middle of US).

Also the climate in the new DLC is cold af. I kept dying to the cold for like 20 minutes till I just got off."

20669,"Anyone who likes rust or games that allow you to do pretty much whatever you want, will love this game.
This is probably one of the biggest games I have ever played and I have been playing this pretty much since it came out on console and am still finding things on even the first map that I didn't find before. Even after you complete the game, the amount of mods that people make for this game will make it so it never gets old.

My advice though, if you have never played this game, play it normally first, then with mods. That way you don't get overwhelmed and not know what the hell to do, because you will be plenty clueless just playing the normal game for the first time, don't need the crack known as mods to make you any more clueless. 

After you get over that though, and get past any cheaters, which most of the free roam survival games have, you will probably develop a crushing sense of impending doom every time you log onto this game, only to find that no, you weren't raided last night... Usually.

The pvp in this game is pretty much the same as rust, drain turrets, kill dinos, blow through compound. That sort of thing, but if you raid while they are online, it can be like avengers endgame levels of awesome, going to war with a clan. It's rare, but if you know what your doing you can have battles at that level.

My only real gripe about this game is how time consuming it can be, even with modified server settings. That's just par for the course with this game however. Be careful of some of the admins on the modified servers too because some of them are kinda Dicks and just go around destroying stuff.

The other thing is that some of the stuff in this game isn't fully optimized and can be pretty buggy. I have a stupidly beefy computer so, I don't get any lag even with max graphics and all the intensive settings turned on, but always install this game on an ssd, if you don't and you play with mods, you will be loading in for upwards of 40 minutes, even on single player. With the ssd, it takes like 5-10 depending on how many mods you install

Pretty much 10/10 will continue to play again"

20724,Big Dinosaur eat me and i like much very
20725,"Its ground breaking in many ways, so kudos for that. But it more more than anything a buggy pile of shit. You will lose dozens of hours invested in your high level dinos to bugs or glitches all the effing time. I've lost three nearly level 300  imprinted dinos to 3 separate bugs, all of which are known and have been for a long time. It takes a really long time to get a dino that high. Then are are so many game breaking bugs and glitches like the artifacts not spawning in. You can't fight the bosses without the artifacts. These bugs have been in the game for literally years. The devs who wrote this game are worthless. And they are now trying to convince us to buy another overpriced pile of garbage without ever once fixing there trash first game. WC f u."
20726,its a good game lol
20727,.
20728,It has dinosaurs need I say more....

20738,The game has its bugs but all around great game lots of differnt ways to play
20739,"A lot of fun and alot of pain, i hate to love you and i love to hate you, Ark"
20740,"Great fun, really enjoyed the game, but it just very intensive on my laptop but that's not that surprising."

20743,This game is a great game with lots to but i advise to play with a friend.
20744,"A game I keep coming back to to roam the wilds and behave like a caveman, while also building towards being more than human."
20745,"Very good, very nice"
20746,it is a good game but you will die alot and so will your dinos so you will have to be able to keep playing no matter what rly
20747,very epic

"
20750,great game to mod and playu with friends endless amount of stuff to do
20751,dinos
20752,sometimes this game is very fun and cool. but most of the time it makes you want to kill yourself.
20753,"One of the best games I have ever played. 10/10
(get all DLC)"
20754,beeg leezard
20755,it requires a lot of storage and it crashes a lot
20756,its ok
20757,"The game itself is good, but WHY IS THE BASE GAME 125 GIGS"
20758,I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
20759,Is good game. kinda glitchy
20760,I recomended this game
20761,SOme of the most fun ive had while gaming with friends is in Ark.   Its a unique experience.
20762,its very fun especilly with friend but playing alone is also awsome and the dinos are really cool and epic
20763,"Let me tell you this game is ass, I gotten eaten by a small T-rex with no arms; way to laggy."
20764,"This game sucks and is too old. It should not be played by anyone, ever."
20765,its fun but i cant play it crashes to much its not my laptop please fix it happend to other people i know
20766,amazing
20767,This game is cool
20768,"Great Game! Fantastic survival game loop, with a great sense of challenge and a long-term endgame. 
Love This Game, and wish I played it sooner."
20769,"Steam needs a ""Meh"" review button.  Seriously.

It's decent, if you like dinosaur games and survival, you'll like this.  IIRC, Ark jump-started the survival-crafting genre that's now prevalent on steam.  I could be wrong, however, this is what my brain inside my meat-suit claims.

Be grateful I gave this a positive review due to the fact I spent over 300+ hours in this addicting game."
20770,"When this game starts my PC cries, but at least I get to die on the Ark! Over and over again....."
20771,I have a love for dinosaurs so I'm biased
20772,Challenging and fun. You can adjust the difficulty to better suit our playstyle.
20773,"Amazing game
"
20774,"very fun yes, but pay to win"
20775,Dinos man
20776,good game cool dinosaurs worth the money.
20777,"great so far
"
20778,Yes
20779,i like it sometimes
20780,"Takes a very long time to download, and a lot of storage space. BUT, its alot of fun!!"
20781,Amazing but only with friends
20782,cool
20783,One of the best survival games for sure. 100% worth the money for both singleplayer & multiplayer!
20784,fun
20785,Great game!! Definately recommend mods on the steam workshop makes the game 100x's better!
20786,"It is basically Pokemon but with dinos and fantasy creatures, and for people with masochistic tendencies. 10/10"
20787,"takes a while to download and it takes a lot of storage i would get it though it takes a lot of storage but it is better on pc than console because you can download mods for free and stuff so i would say that it is worth it.


im not good at punctuation so dont judge the review please"
20788,"...yes,,,,"
20789,"SUPPERRRRR FUn 


Dino"
20790,"good
game
but no dino"
20791,gud
20792,this game is so good with primal fear but without primal fear the game is also good
20793,The thing about Ark is that it has everything I don't like in a video game yet I still enjoy it greatly.
20794,good
20795,laggy xd rawr game
20796,my rex starved to death.
20797,"so fun with friends
"
20798,"I originally bought this for my playstation, but I really loved the game. Decided to buy it on PC and did not regret it! Only con with the game is the 200GB game size. RIP my storage."

20808,Good soup
20809,black women = good
20810,"Very good
"
20811,This game is fun but why the fuck did thei need to add that annoying ass titanocomba
20812,its very frustrating and buggy but a great survival game and you can customise your settings to make it easier or harder
20813,"I would have recommended this game before genesis dlc, ever since the release of extinction Ark has gone downhill. People want to play Ark for the dinosaurs, not all the tek and futuristic dinosaurs."
20814,"if you want to get crippling depression because your base that you spent 3 month building got raided because you logged off for a day
"
20815,fun game
20816,Super amazing game! It's really good if you just want to sit with some friends and hangout with dinosaurs. Absolutely terrifying at times too!
20817,"Fun to play with others; not terrible alone, but I wouldn't recommend it, as it gets much better with others, as with most games."
20818,W
20819,game smells like fart
20820,very addicting if you know what you r doing
20821,a
20822,i like this game but i dont like thoughs dinos  that can hit you through the mount
20823,The game is 217GIGS.... Not in a million years will i ever download this garbage game ever again.
20824,This is the most ever
20825,"
Ark is a game of taming fun and it's a game of hard work. You have to survive. In this game you tame, care, and feed dinosaurs. You can use so much stuff to build stuff like wood, thatch, and Metal. Also, you level up. The more you level up the more stuff you can build and makes it easier to tame dinosaurs. There are over 230 different species on ever map. There are map you can be on, for example Lost Island. The map Lost Island is a map with a winter, a desert , a forest, and islands. If you haven't played this game before than you should check it out and check out the map Lost Island. Hope this helped"
20826,i like djur its coolll to ride casper s mamma
20827,Hope Ark 2 wont be this buggy.
20828,"this game is very fun and if you grind and try you will get somewher if you just join and beg and show no hard work no one will help you so i think just play have fun join a friends tribe optinoal and play fair and dont .get mad at the start.
"
20829,Nice game
20830,Playing on community servers is more fun than the core game itself. ARK will become an MMO game. Give it a shot.
20831,"Stupid game, has too many bugs"
20832,"fun when you aint dead
"
20833,"help
"
20834,is good
20835,"Very good ideea for a game, bu very stupid implemetattion.
On official servers you keep dying because of lag, performance is shit.
If you want to trow money and destroy your graphic card, this is for you.
If you play on officeial servers, you`r blessed with lags.
If you play on private servers, you might lose everithing becaus the admin doesn`t know how to manage the server.
Good Luck"
20836,"good
"
20837,"good poop i play but my internet sucks so it takes ages to downloud mods
"
20838,its relly fun
20839,Good
20840,"Best game ever made in my opinion, and i do have many :) can ARK 2 top it?"
20841,"goob
:)"
20842,me love this game as a member of the liking men community
20843,"This game a part time job if you play on official servers, the game is full of bugs, not very optimized for PC, and everything is unbalanced. Very addicting game. 10/10 game. Game of the year. Would recommend to play if you hate yourself. (Don't play solo.)"
20844,"Brought me right back to 60 MYA, cant relate to anything better than slamming back barrels of bear with my sloth buddies and having a pooping contest with my phiomia friends. On a side note; Flying platypus that can tokyo drift through trees and rocks. Need I say less?"
20845,"VERY FUN WITH MODS LOL
"
20846,"Friend got swallowed by the earth dino and all
10/10"
20847,amazing game. Old but Gold
20848,better on pc
20849,"I 3at a$$ 
10/10 tho"
20850,Dinosaur go brrrrr
20851,good
20852,"The trailer is extremely disingenuous. The game is fun and there's nothing quite like it but there's a lot of problems with it and you should know about them before you buy it, watch some actual gameplay footage on YouTube."
20853,good ig
20854,"If you love being trolled every hour of every day then welcome home. This game is a cancer that you never really seem to be rid of. Best thing to do, make a false persona and join a mega tribe just to have ""fun"" which consists of 95% farming and 5% raiding. Also do not have a job nor any kind of girlfriend or social life because this game turns into the only thing you think about all day everyday."
20855,Played for 109 hours on pc and i love it have literally over 2000 hours on ps4 addicted to this game its just tough for solo players
20856,e
20857,I lik
20858,Love it
20859,"I enjoyed playing this game with my brother. He has definitely gotten more use out of it than I have, but I still enjoy running around punching trees and riding dinos. It is definitely better to play with people on a private server. The online players are kind of obnoxious."
20860,"good fun, i want the ability to have more controle in the server settings, but fun."
20861,"10/10 makes me want to commit a war crime.  Great if you like challenging games, and annoying if you don't.  Will be playing with my friends more."
20862,Big man Edmund ruined my dreams on aberration
20863,Yo this games slap ngl
20864,"While generally paleontologically inaccurate, occasionally glitchy, and hard, this game is the most fun thing I have ever played. Are you bored of the island ark map? maybe try a desert, radioactive cave system, or spaceship map instead. This game has it all—dragons, serpents, dinosaurs, extinct megafauna, kaijus, robots, and folklore creatures that are all tameable. Not only are all of these mechanics, maps, and creatures available, I can not exclude the outstanding graphics from this review. The water looks real, there is a wonderful day-night cycle, and weather conditions such as light and heavy rain, fog, blistering heatwaves, sandstorms, lightning storms, blizzards, meteor showers, and earthquakes are all rendered in beautiful, realistic, graphics. Whether you find yourself playing with your best friends, solo, or in a tribe, you have never met, this game provides an open freestyle way of playing with almost no guidelines allowing you to do almost anything. And if the game was missing something anyway, modding is your solution! This is my favorite game and I would recommend it to any action and adventure lovers!"
20865,good game
20866,the game makes you very adicccccted xD but i love it
20867,"griffins are cool
"
20868,"Its fun! Love the animals. Hate starting up, but its a great team player game."
20869,If you like dinosaurs and survival games than this is the best game for that. i love all of the aspects of this game. The taming and hunting and fighting the bosses. I also like mating them together to make the babies
20870,fun
20871,great game intense good game with friends and very challenging
20872,"meh
"
20873,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD GAME ESPCIALLY WITH MODS.
"
20874,I like dinosaur.
20875,its a ok game
20876,"Its simple, rust and atlas so better than this shit. dinos dont even exist lmao, continue copying the insane gameplay of atlas and his graphics, keep trying to reach rust player base and to finish just remove this oriental smelly toilet of steam.  200h wasted of my life that I could have used to drink bottles and bottles of water.
"
20877,i leik dinosaurs
20878,dinosaurs are FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!
20879,"It never loads
"
20880,
20881,so stupid it makes me cry
20882,Best game of all time
20883,"Whenever you feel like this game is treating you Wrongfully 
Always remember you just have to tell yourself 
""Because ARK"""
20884,very fun
20885,perpeqto
20886,"wake up,die wake up again  and die"
20887,play it.
20888,SOOOOOOO FUUUUUUN!!!!!!!!!
20889,"i have 8 diffent acc and at least 10k on the first 2 an 1k on the rests its good game 
"
20890,"little buggy here and there but overall very fun and addicting, as a pvp player there are most definitely a lot of problems that need fixing but that doesnt negate the endless fun the feeling of going from top to bottom is painful but regrinding back up feels ever so rewarding. i would recommend getting some insight into the game prior to learn the game before playing so that u dont feel overwhelmed with all the things in the game."
20891,"As you see, I don't have a lot of hours on steam but I played this game for so many hours on PS4. This game has incredible music that brings me nostalgic feelings and may be the most iconic video game music for me. I love it. Gameplay wise it's amazing too! Although I wish they did some things differently I think this is the best survival game money can buy. Thank you Wildcard!

One major con: This game's DLC maps are very expensive. Wish that that wasn't the case but they still definitely are whole new worlds with lots of content so it's somewhat okay?"
20892,1.000.000 DLCs and the main game has just as many bugs.

20902,This game has been (And always will be) My favourite game. Up until i got my pc i have been playing since release. This game holds many nostalgic trips of my young life with all of my old friends. The game play is very satisfying and the memories you make playing this game are so worth the grinding. If you haven't got this game. Give it a go
20903,good game
20904,Best nolife hra
20905,THIS GAME IS GREAT i love it so much me and my friends all played on our server and made a great mutations on dinos we loved it!!!
20906,Ark is a bit of an unpolished mess and the public servers are really not that fun and the file size of Ark is prohibitively large(If you have all the content downloaded at once the file size is a quarter of a terrabyte) but the game is still enjoyable with a large number of dinosaurs and items
20907,l
20908,Good Game
20909,This is an beautiful game but it is really difficult. I recommend this game if you really like hard survival games.
20910,love this game!
20911,"goog game
"
20912,its gud
20913,"Very awesome game, very positive and challenging. Teaches us to think, strategize, adventure and develop very creative ideas. My advice, let's try to play this game. It's not disappointing. Believe me."
20914,I have this game on all my consoles I just cant get enough.
20915,good
20916,DINOSAURS
20917,"good game
"
20918,so far a good game
20919,Dinosaurs :')
20920,ark be ark
20921,"if you want no sleep and constant paranoia, play ark :)"
20922,when are they adding dinosaurs?
20923,"good
"
20924,"Deep survival mechanics, wide range of creatures and environments - all top class.
Trying to play solo as a story is less satisfying - no pointers to often well concealed artifacts requires searching the entire map (including in the deep oceans). The Dossiers and Notes scattered around help to make it seem like there is some history, but the player never gets to actually participate, except when battling some of the 'end bosses'.
I have friends with 1,500+ hours invested, but they are mostly playing multiplayer on private servers. Many of the game mechanics seem geared toward a multi-player group (in-game advice regarding Engrams explicitly states that no one player can learn all of the Engrams).
I'll be playing for at least another few hundred hours!"
20925,dino go die
20926,good
20927,"its good
"
20928,But it!!!!!!!!!!!!
20929,fun
20930,"Much survival, not much evolved"
20931,"Amazing Game! Masterpiece! would reccomend playing with mods, ik it says 16 hours but i have played for around 50-60 on epic games b4 i wanted mods and came here, a million times better with mods!"
20932,best survival game
20933,"very laggy it crush every 5 minutes , now it dont want to run at all , i really dont recommed it
"
20934,really good game all i have to say take a try :0
20935,"Absolute Amazing game, i love it."
20936,"i like very much
"
20937,i die to raptors 5 minutes in after spawning. 10/10
20938,so after playing & having fun I will say be prepared that 1 day you Log in after going on break for 7 days PVE server & all your Dino have despawned many Hundreds of hrs of gameplay wiped for no reason but atleast you have a big empty base to walk around in if that sounds like a game for you go ahead & play ARK
20939,Fun but can be very scary or hard.
20940,best

20947,"uhm, this game is just awesome. i got a fully imprinted thylaceo which is AWESSSSSSSSSSSOMEEEEEEEEEEE"
20948,"One of the most amazing experiences i have ever had, this game was able to drag me so hard that i fully stopped playing a game i have been playing for more than 17 years, and the fact that you can get your own servers and play by your rules with your friends is just a cherry on top, official servers are not that bad if you manage to get yourself into a nice guild who is already dominant on the map you are playing, or you can choose to play solo which is also an amazing experience, it has its bugs and issues, but nothing any other massive MMO game doesn't have,  plus you have one of the most amazing thing in the world, Dinosaurs, 10/10 for me."
20949,I started on a pvp server with my friends and we waited till day 200 to start actual pvp... It took me that long to learn how to actually play the game and start getting good.... good game though
20950,it is epic and a very good game with some nice graphics
20951,"This game is fun and good and has a lot of stuff to do
"
20952,"Minecraft for adults was my go to explaining this game, howerver its so open to many explanations. From the dinos to the builds and even the mods, This game does not disappoint. With a replay value on par with some of the more known titles if not greater."
20953,"Very Good Game, Especially once you get into some of the most diverse modding communities out there"

20961,Very fun. little warning to those with a not good gaming pc that this will give your pc a heart attack if you try to play this without lowering the graphics.
20962,"played more than 1000 hours on ps4/5 since scorched earth first came out. small bugs here and there that devs wont fix, but beautiful graphics and great gameplay, if your willing to grind for materials for hours on end"

20970,Best laggy mess I have ever played. Bugs and crashes on most official servers means you have to make a special effort not to lose your things if you decide to transfer maps. Breeding animals to customise their stats to your needs is one of the unique things about this game that I appreciate. That with an actual endgame (and story if you look for it) makes it unique amongst many other survival games I've played.
20971,good
20972,I love the game. It's a great game to play both with friends and alone.
20973,"I ALWAYS come back to this game. Been playing it for years and even if i take a month off or something, it always has me coming back. So that is a game worth buying to me."
20974,really good tough takes a lot of space
20975,it fun
20976,i love this game
20977,A game I always come back to. I enjoy the skirmish PvP gives sometimes and the PvE side. The community content is some of the best out there.
20978,Ark has been one of my favorite games in steam.  Ark has many different things to make it fun like mods and maps even without mods this game is great. I thing people should try this game out to see if its a good game.
20979,They fixed the infinite poop feature. literally NOT worth playing anymore.

20987,"sucks so much, stuggles to do anything. game is 10 billion years old and they still sell it for full price. if you want to loose your sanity then this is a okay game but just buy elden ring."
20988,Love this game. Highly recommend for people who like survival games.
20989,"This game is an absolute piece of shit, don't play it, it will be like a second job though if you play it you probably don't have a job, like me, but regardless, it's kinda unplayable at some points, 10/10 would buy again, fuck the hitboxes though."

21025,"Unoptimized as hell, loading the game takes a dogs age, and the graphics itself could use a major update. And no, I'm probably not going to buy Ark 2 when ever that finish and release it because it's likely going to be in the same state and shape as Ark is."
21026,"Easily one of my top games, so much potential and possibilities using the different mods settings and maps meaning you're getting so much content out of a single game.

21029,"So much fun with many, many jump scares!"
21030,"extremely well made and thought out. the only issue is security on password-protected servers; My wife and I were in game for a few hours and someone we didnt know joined the server with the name ""HELLO"" which of course we immediately handled it like an invasion by the animals on our normal camp, but its still concerning that i could log in and all of our things would just be gone."
21031,best game ever! five star from me!
21032,"I hope ARK 2 surpasses ark and delivers a much more polished bug free game, weird that so many of them still exist after all these years but given the rocky road of development I shouldn't be surprised. Still for a single player or even co op on private server with mates the game is fun to play if your into the open world survival genre."
21033,tis good
21034,its lit
21035,this game needs bettr dlc
21036,"The game is really fun, who wouldnt want to tame prehistorical creatures, its not too hard and u have a lot of maps to choose from. But the game is so poorly optimized you quite literally have to play on bad graphics, and even if u play on the highest graphics it still looks like trash. It looks so pixelated that I cant play more than a few hours at a time or my eyes hurt. Buy at own risk."
21037,its fucking ass aERF;GUOV
21038,"This is one of the worst programmed greatest games of all time. I hate every minute, and yet can't help but seek out thousands of them. Love the game. The devs should have worked harder. 11/10."

21040,fire muthafucka
21041,fun
21042,Its very fun
21043,"there is SO much wrong
shear amount of bugs
massive lags even for a good gaming PC
servers lag so much you get massive rollbacks every like 10 minutes. We have to call it in discord so we don't do something that would kill us when it rolls back.
dinos with less IQ than my grandma, and she's dead.
maps with glitches everywhere, bad texture sizing, weird mesh glitching.
I even got killed by the server for walking through the floor at one point while trying to climb a mountain.
The default jumping animation from unreal engine.
bad shadow and light casting, I saw a post talking about a bug that's there since alpha...
The weird glitch on the water when there's something reflected upside down.
SO MUCH I can't even swear the shear amount of bugs this game has.

If it wasn't for the concept of the game, the whole game would have been dead on arrival.
Luckily the Idea is good. That's the only thing that's good.
Even the UI is garbage, the main menu looks like something I could make on paint.net being totally not sober. Covered in red text, blue text. The lagging loading video when you enter a game is a .mp4 of smoke or something with extreme compression. The whole game was made and optimized with feets. I tried contacting the support, zero answer.

I tried contacting the staff directly, no answer.
If Ark 2 fails this is their own doing.
Creators do not care, its their gold cage. They don't want to work on it anymore, its just there for revenue."
21044,"TL;DR - It's worth the buy, even without the DLC's.

Been playing the game since beta (took a long break from the game after my cpu broke) and have accrued almost 2,000 hours.

There's always something to do in ARK. Varying on the type of server you join and what settings/mods they have installed it only gets better over time. Although nothing will compare to your first days of playing and experiencing ARK. That being said, the game is also enjoyable in singleplayer mode with your own select rates and mods. However, the best experience i've found is to join with just a couple other friends or strangers that you meet in game and progress together.

I would not recommend joining official servers for those who are just casually looking for a good time to grind and build but not excessively. I would also recommend these players to avoid any type of pvp server as you will instantly lose all progress you've made in a single night by other tribes. Your best bet is to join a PVE server with decently high server rates but nothing ridiculous. To give a perspective 1x Harvest rate will yield one stone if you pick it up off the ground. 100x would mean you pick up 100 stones from a single pebble and 100x that if you were to break a boulder. This becomes too easy and you progress the game too quickly to enjoy it thoroughly. I've personally found anything between 3-15 to be the best.

A side note to end: If you're just planning to get the base game, it's worth the full price. However, if you want to play the full game with all DLC content, i would high recommend waiting for a sale."
21045,GREAT BUT LAGGY
21046,Wasn't sure about this game at first but i absolutely love it !
21047,solid
21048,fun game. better than rust because monkey
21049,pretty fun ig
21050,"So ARK is a fun public or non public game. It's really cool because you can tame tons of dinosaurs and they lay eggs so you can have baby dinosaurs. you can also build so many cool things like towers, castles, and boats.
so I hope you like this game as much as I do"
21051,swamp scary redwoods scary parachute is your friend
21052,uwu
21053,"Concept is fun of ARK. But personally I do not like like the game. Just because the graphics are shit and I've also been fighting a lot with trying to start up ARK and load in to the servers. Hours trying to get in to a server without crashing. Then once you're finally in the game I notice that the servers are dead and that I do not love the way how to build/ farm and such.

In my opinion switch over to Rust. WAYYYYYYYYYY Better :))"
21054,yes
21055,great game a few bugs but overall tons of fun
21056,"This game is the best open world adventure game I've ever played I would definitely recommend to a friend. An i just recently bought all the DLC's a total of 30 dollars, but I would say it's going to be worth it. IF you want to pay 60 dollars for the game and the dlc's go ahead I would say it's worth it."

21075,"part futuristic, part primitive, great combo. Its a bit scary while getting you limbs torn off by dinos you've never heard of. You die a lot but its fun with having to figure out a bunch of mechanics you gotta figure out."
21076,"devs suck ass they cant fix their game but they fucking hire vin goddamn diesel for their next game wtf dude

21081,d
21082,It's a very good game with alot of great features
21083,"My recommendation comes with the caveat that you play with mods and friends. I did not enjoy the vanilla settings nor PVP aspects to Ark's servers, but maybe that's more your jam. Once you have the mods & settings you like with a good tribe, then this game is truly a lot of fun. There's tons of DLCs outside of the main story maps and so many cool dinosaurs and biomes to explore in each. I personally love this game for it's variety; however, that does require that you look up a lot of stuff in order to know what you're doing. The game itself could do a lot more with tutorials / help options. Using wiki and dododex are an absolute must."
21084,Nice game but not optimize
21085,ECHT EEN TOP SPEL!!
21086,This game is insanely fun but will bring you great suffering... play at own risk of sanity..

as you can see i have a lot of hours. Overall my experience was good. Although the base map is ok and it take up SOOOO much room. Its still worth it"
21095,i have offered my soul for this game and all it gives back is suffering

21142,Game is really fun and adventures! I REALLY love dinos and this game lets me even tame them!
21143,"played 80 hours straight then some flying whale with laser guns exploded everything i had. 0/10 will continue playing. So i added another 90 or so hours to my playtime, after countless shitty crashes that get me killed i think im finally ready to quit playing, and move to a different map."
21144,"To be honest its a great game they put effort into making it better they've made ""oopsies"" but in time they always bring it back it's a great game if you like dinosaurs, fantasy creatures and some weird things that they had to be on drugs while making so I'd say if you like survival games with all that stuff go for it and grab a copy!"
21145,hehehehaw
21146,Good
21147,it is a good game

should buy this game for sure"
21149,good good anakin good
21150,lovely
21151,"The game is good overall, I just wish that I didn't have such low frames"
21152,If you like to waste your time this is the game for you literally if you play official servers. I can say in my experience this game is a giant waste of time you can't get a start without someone who is already Tech tier destroying everything you have. This is a game for people who have no life and life to impose their will on others if you're that type of person be my guest and play this.
21153,good

21169,It can sometimes be a buggy game. But if played right you'll love it. The mods are also a definite + point. -points are i guess that you'll need a pretty good pc for this game to run. All in All a deserved 7.5/10
21170,DEAD GAME!!!
21171,good game and big profit
21172,game is good but too many inconsistencies between different platforms i only recently started playing on pc and it is pretty different. idk why wildcard is like this

"
21175,All raptors and troodons go to hell
21176,"Played it for a long while, had fun, but no one has time for this crap. No one has time to sit for hours and wait for things to happen. 

Also, the game has serious issues. I have not gotten it to load properly in over a year now. And I will never try again. It's just not worth it. I would not spend money on this game unless you can no life with a bunch of friends online. If you have a family, or a full time job, this game is worthless to you. 

I regret wasting 164 hours of my life on this."
21177,"its realy good
"
21178,"This game has so much potential but the technical side of things is handled so poorly. The game lags very frequently, there are so many bugs, and there are always server problems. With how long the game has been out a lot of issues should have been resolved. If they spent as much time fixing the game as they have spent charging people for more broken dlcs the game could be so much better."

21189,.
21190,Nothing but Dinos and dealth here.
21191,Just Do It
21192,"online ark is like Rust but less optimized and has a bunch of mesh glitches, but it i very replayable and for people who like playing single player it takes a lot of time. im talking like at least 48 hours if not more to complete one map if you are able to speedrun it. online ark is very fun but raiding and especially the PVP on foot is hard and buggy but generally i think it is worth giving a try and i would love to see what the new ark will bring if it uses the new engine an fixes all the bugs previously mentioned. 

what i like and dislike:

+taming and riding dinos
+fun with others
+replayable
+bunch of maps with each giving a different challenge (heat, cold, lack of resources)
+a few free DLC maps that adds new creatures to tame
-buggy meshes and pvp
-crashes
-lag 
-DLC you need to buy even though it is a part of the story of the game (genesis 1 and 2)
-a bit pay to win on some servers, as some dinos are OP and can only be optained on some maps you need to pay for"
21193,"This game is great, it has so much content and it's constantly getting new updates and expansions which keep it fresh in an experience which is already packed with things to do. 

Even then, I think I should point out the elephant in the room. There's a LOT of bugs. A quarter off my experience playing Lost Island with friends has been struggling to join. Also in-game bugs can be frustrating. Sometimes when I need to go into creative to be able to fix things because of damage a bug caused for example: I was on a Phiomia and went in water the bug where whatever you're riding on water flies across the map happened. And I got flung to the snow area of the map to the Wyvern trench. Like come on, what am i even supposed to do in that situation. And I couldn't be teleported even when my friend went into creative. There just wasn't a fix. We had to spawn something to take it back and then kill what we spawned it was a whole situation that demotivated me to continue playing. A game shouldn't do that. 

The UI isn't bad, but sometimes it doesn't feel lively enough. I feel like it could use a rework. 

 
It makes me upset that the ARK 2 announcement made me happy but also stressed that I felt like ARK 1 has so many issues that making a new game my cause the developers to shift their focus to ARK 2 and ignore the bugs that haven't been fixed for years now. I'm even scared they might carry over. 

That aside this game is so UNIQUE. There's nothing like ARK I've seen out there. And even if there was I don't think they could make it as great as Wildcard did. I appreciate this game and I know it's nostalgic to lots of people and it's quickly become one of my all time favorite survival games. There's so many approaches you can take to ARK it's insane. Just playing it gives me so much dopamine. And THAT'S how a game should be. So regardless of the bugs, ARK is still played by many because it's that great of a game. And I'm glad Wildcard loves it as much as it's community to make more content. 

So would I recommend this game? As long as you're aware of the bugs, Yeah absolutely. And I can't wait for ARK 2"
21194,ive played 2000 hours and all i gotta say is play pve are play the insanely glitched pvp with hackers everywhere also read lore its good btw my 2000 hours are on window

21252,"Similar to The Sims, I either forget this game exists or binge it non-stop for a period of around a month. Want to play a survival craft that has singleplayer and multiplayer capabilities? Want to grind out a lot of stuff to make other stuff, only to get incredibly frustrated when you die, losing that stuff? Want to spawn in to an ""easy"" area of the map, only to immediately be face-to-face to a raptor? Want to get emotionally attached to your first tame and be distraught when it also dies from raptors? This is the game for you! In a way, it is, as people say, ""minecraft but with dinosaurs and better graphics"". The end-goal is unclear beyond ""survive"" and ""get really good at it"" for a while.

What is different between this and Minecraft besides Dinosaurs and Better Graphics:
1. Clothing matters
2. Environmental conditions matter
3. Way more complexity in what you can explore, build, and do in vanilla version
4. Guns
5. The ""official"" fan-made maps are pretty amazing"

21291,"Ark is a fun game as long as you don't go in a PvP server alone. Not to say you can't have fun, but if you're like me and don't do optimized runs or have a more aggressive play style then someone's dragon is gonna burn you to the ground. I had a lot of fun playing with people on PvE servers seeing as the Environment was more than enough of a pain for players that didn't log on everyday. That's the nice thing about Ark, there are a few ways to play it depending on your personality."
21292,Where are the dinosaurs
21293,"this game so good that ark definitely did't pay me to say this
"
21294,"This is a good game, lots of fun - and frustration. Ark is a prehistoric world with an anachronistic assortment of extinct creatures. Lot's of challenging combat. Valheim is similar to this game, I think they lifted a lot of concepts from Ark, definitely in the same genre. Valheim improved on some things and made much, much worse many others.

The graphics are pretty well done, very nice world construction. Combat is good, challenging for sure. There is a crafting/building element to the game which is also pretty good. There's resource gathering and a pretty rich variety of stuff to get and craft. 

There are some game play issues that bug me, but overall that's not bad. Things that bug me with the game play are like, I can't hold a torch and a sword at the same time, or any other weapon for that matter, so at night you can only fight in the dark unless you happen to be fighting next to a campfire. And even when you get advanced crafting stuff, it always seems like a huge let down. For example, since I was sick of fighting in the dark, when I finally got a flashlight attachment for my firearms I was hugely disappointed that it was so dim I might as well be fighting in the dark anyway... why did I bother using those valuable resources if it is a worthless item?

Some resources that are really needed to advance in the game  (I only play solo, so this might be different with a group) are extremely difficult to find and are also very limited in quantity.

So I have to compare this game with Valheim because there are so many things that are similar:

Graphics
Ark: very good, smooth graphics, colorful creatures and world
Valheim: not good, pixilated, often lagging, repetitive

Combat
Ark: very good
Valheim: good, but not as good

World
Ark: nicely detailed open world, get's extremely difficult when exploring beyond your home though (at least as a solo player)
Valheim: The nice thing about Valheim world construction is that it is always different and unique. Ark world is always the same. But, the Valheim world details are not very good, and poor graphics. But it is a HUGE open world and exploration is a really fun part of the game

Construction of structures
Ark: not bad, but very limited in what you can do with structures
Valheim: highly detailed and unique buildings can be constructed, probably the best part of the game in my opinion. You can build very detailed castles which some people have made into an art form.

Resources / crafting
Ark: fairly rich assortment and challenging part of the game
Valheim: rich assortment, but sometimes I just didn't get where the game designers were going with things

Pets
Ark: you can tame almost any creature in the game one way or another. Big or small, you can tame and use your pets in the game. A big part of the game is pet management and using them as utility animals or for defense.
Valheim: there are pets, they're not very useful though

Value for your money
Ark: more expensive, but also better graphics, smooth game play - worth the money
Valheim: not expensive, in many ways not as good as Ark, but dollar for dollar worth the money (I played for about 1000 hours for a $20 investment)

Overall I would give Ark a game grade of B+ - definitely worth the money"
21295,Woke up on a beach and was spawn camped by a raptor.... 10/10
21296,i have no soul because of this game 10/10 would recommend
21297,GTEAT GAME
21298,the developers smoking cracks or some shit.
21299,"Do you enjoy working extremely hard on crafting the perfect base for your friends and dinosaurs for 16 hours straight and realizing you need to go to sleep eventually. So, you log out in your safe little house with your safe little locks and your safe little attacc dinosaurs so you can return to your game to a completely destroyed and raided home. You're not sure if it was dinosaurs or another player, or maybe the game just bugged. But that's okay, because you love building and crafting, so you just go right back to punching trees and going back to work for another 16 hours. 

Anyways, I love this game. 10/10

(Steam says I've only played 12 hours, but I own this game on PS4, and Xbox, and PC...and I play on my bf's account sometimes too. So there's a lot more hours among all the consoles. Just more evidence that this is a good game. I've paid for it 3 times over.)"
21300,awsome
21301,"Ever wondered what would happen if dinosaurs came back? Or how will we live with them? Will it even be possible for them to come back? That's the case in this game called ARK: Survival Evolved. The game is about how dinosaurs came to life and how the player will be able to survive among them. This game is available on all platforms: PC, Playstation, Xbox, and on Mobile. On pc you can get it from Steam. On Xbox, and PS you can get it from their own store.
ARK is one of a few games that have a lore that the game is based on. Ark was made as an experiment or a simulation to see how humans would live if dinosaurs came back to life, so they made a simulation of an island full of dinosaurs, then they put the player on the island. The player would then wake up for the first time on the beach, not knowing where he was. He would go on to wonder and see his surroundings. The player would have to advance his technology to be able to deal with dinosaurs. Then he would find a way to tame the dinosaurs and make them help him. You can play ARK with friends online, offline, or even by yourself. I like this game because every time you play is a different experience and a different challenge. It has a variety of maps that you can choose from for a different experience every time you play. For example, every time you spawn on a different map, you would find yourself in a different terrain every time with varias new species of dinosaurs. This is a superb game that I liked, because of the experience and that it's one of a handful of games that have dinosaurs.
Overall, I would rate this game a 9/10. It's superb and it has great graphics. Pretty much anyone can play this game, but I would recommend it to teens aged 10 and older. But mostly to gamers who like playing survival or adventure games. All you need is a decent computer and the game. Then, you should be set to go on your adventure with the dinosaurs."

21316,Its really a Good Survival game i have spent alot of time and get to know a lot of people from that game and i recommend you guys to try it its a Cool survive game next level survive
21317,"TLDR: It's a massive time sink that's very fun despite its flaws

I have mixed feelings about Ark. It is easily my most played game. (I have at least 5,000 hours between Xbox and PS4 alone). It has moments where it is the most fun game in the world. And moments where you want to uninstall it and never play it again. If you play it, you will encounter bugs; A lot of them. Official servers are, and pretty much always have been, a shit show. Unofficial servers are the place you'd probably find the most fun. The story is interesting, but very poorly implemented in my opinion (I went to Youtube to figure out the lore). Overall, its addictive and really only a good experience if you find a good chunk of time where you have no responsibilities."

21343,"this game is very difficult to make progress on most maps as you will play for 30 mins the server will crash and you will roll back 15 mins and the more frustrating part is that you send in a server report for the 27th time in a day and you can't even get as little as a hey we are working on it instead they WC ignores you and nothing changes leading you to think they have no interest in working on it i have alot of wasted time on this game but feel ive invested to much money thus far to quit all i can say about this game is poor server quality, poor customer support, and little to no interest in making it better"

21350,"pretty fun and mods make the game even better but i lost 40 hours of progress because my game just kept crashing so i uninstalled it works now thou
"
21351,great game
21352,"So, this game is really great. The only thing it lacks is some sort of goal system, be it quest/reward, or a story. If they could somehow figure out how to include that, I think it would be more appealing to a wider audience base. It would also be nice to have more challenges to overcome. Like dino invasions/attacks of some sort, or extreme weather that you have to survive in. I know some of the later maps have this sort of stuff, but some of the older maps feel very boring because of it's lack at times. The AI on dino's definitely needs to be improved sometimes, and there's other things like tail collision that really annoys me. It's not any reason not to play it, I'm just saying it would be a more well rounded game with these things fixed/added. 

The biggest reason NOT to play it is that it is incredibly graphics intensive. It was never optimized well and many computers have issues with it. Just make sure you're using something capable. Most newer cards shouldn't have too much issue with it at 1080p but if you're playing at 1440p or 4k, you need a beefy computer. 

However, the rest of the game is pretty good. It's fun, it's exciting, It keeps me busy for hours. I love building bases, I love the extravagant mod selection it has. I love the dino collection you get access too, I love that you can mod in more. I love that this game has events surrounding holidays, and coloured dino's and unique loot. I love the chibi dino's that you can have, the feeling of riding around on a T-rex making everything your bitch. I love collecting dinosaurs, breeding them for better stats(though it could be slightly better implemented). I love the biomes, and the caves. A lot of the bosses are fun, and you can go at them in many different ways. I took an army of about 200 raptors into one, all max leveled, bred for health/damage. The variety of maps that you can play is nice too. 

I do suggest this game, but be warned. It's not for everyone. It's essentially a sandbox, you make of it what you will. There are caves/dungeons to do, and bosses so there is some direction to the game, but many people never get to that point simply because they don't know what to do. The game has a lot of depth/complexity to it, and that can be an issue for some. Give it a try at least. I mean.. who didn't want a game like this when they were a kid, right?"
21353,i like dinosaurs
21354,yes
21355,"Wish they offered a meh button to choose instead of just a yes or no but I will say this, the game despite being horribly buggy and glitchy at times is a fairly good game. You can have almost any Dino/creature on the Ark that you are capable of taming (if obtainable) and build impressive fortresses of solitude or crack shacks with friends. Although I do wish this game would be optimized more and the devs showing more interest on what the community wishes to see being fixed I do have to admit this game can be fun. Most times you will get your normal toxic player/tribe come rolling through and it'll take everything in your power to not rage quit the game when you are starting out and a high lvl player comes along on a overly powerful creature you have no hopes of ever stopping and steam rolls your entire building and gaming experience but every game you go to out there will have someone like this (chuck it up to kids being kids cuz honestly, only immature people will go out of their way to destroy something that really has no value to them whatsoever). I cant count how many times my friends and I would build a nice looking base to try and have some fun while off of work and a ""alpha"" or ""beta"" tribe came along and decided that our little thatch shack could possibly have anything of value in it should be destroyed.
All in all, I would suggest this game due to some of the beautiful scenery and the fact that you literally in a sense can have an army of dinosaurs and creatures at your disposal and who wouldn't want to run around leading a pack full of Rexs and or Gigas?"
21356,"ARK: Survival Evolved is an immersive futuristic 1st/3rd person Action-adventure/base building and survival game, incorporating a combination of prehistoric and post humanoid worlds that players can explore and conquer. As you dive into each ARK dazed and confused about your origins and the origins of the ARK's, you learn new skills to survive and master each creation in a bid to find out who or what brought you to this dystopian wonderland filled with friends and foes, humans and creatures. Each is unique in their role to assist you in bringing about an end to the beings who created the ARK... Whether by air, land or sea, survive on your own or with friends in this massively multiplayer title by Studio Wildcard powered by the Unreal 4 Engine."
21357,"Dude,  you can tame and ride Dino's. What else needs to be said?"
21358,Good game takes your social life and throws it in the ocean but its cool to ride dinos and build beautiful bases
21359,no
21360,Great
21361,really fun game and much better with friends
21362,it's alright. totally not addicted or anything.
21363,"Gameplay:

Focuses way too hard on ""taming"". If you like this kind of thing it is fun, but the actual ""survival"" aspect of the game is weak. It is easy to find food/water, but you'll randomly get killed by things much stronger than you, even in the starting area, often with no option to run away.

The challenge and fun that I get out of a survival game is staying alive. If it is easy to stay alive, and you randomly die to some unfair encounter, there is no survival aspect of the game.

You also level every 5 seconds, so what should feel like a milestone of progress turns into continuous tedium.

Combat feels bad. Most things do not seem to have damage animations at all. You just see a basic blood splatter and the game swaps textures for injuries.

Technical:

Lacks V-sync, which turns your graphics card into a flamethrower. Optimized poorly, so 2010 graphics somehow tax high end modern hardware. The game doesn't allow you to maintain multiple save files for an area, so forget about playing with your friends in one game and playing single player separately unless you manually manage save files. All kinds of synchronization problems even on pings under 10. (try driving a boat as the host with people on board.) And for a game of this age, it crashes a lot on up to date AMD drivers.

Verdict:

If you like mounts and breeding things, I guess this game is for you. It is a technical mess, easily as bad as many games in early access, and it is missing features that are baseline things you should have in 2022. The survival aspects of the game are poor and the balance of the world itself is also poor. I would not recommend this game, especially at it's $60 price tag for the ""ultimate edition"".

Get it cheap and keep expectations low."
21364,I would rate this game 9.5/10 because this game on steam has a lot of different mods to have fun with. You can play with friends. There are a lot of creatures to tame even if you are playing vanilla ARK. There all caves to explore and there are bosses to fight when you think you are ready.

Is this comment going to be un heard laugh at dismissed are the debs listening why not if the server cuts out have everything that you had on you no matter where you are on the map it gets put back at your base that wouldn't be so hard would it so many hours lost of my time no yours."

21414,"poorly executed shitstorm of a game. 7 years and still getting ue4 fatal errors in the fucking title screen. joining friends on steam is literally none existant while you have the game already open. poorly optimized, graphically garbage, mechanically broken and borderline uninteresting gameplay. i love survival games with coop but this has to be the most overhyped garbage ive ever played. no brightness options for nighttime so i cant fucking see anything unless i console command the gamma up and wash the game out a fuck load till it looks like im playing minecraft on a crt with the brightness cranked all the way up and the old bedrock void fog covering my screen. terrible weather system that has no realism to it. my guy cant hold a bow drawn for more than 3 seconds, thats about how long this game held my attention and interest. i didnt even buy this myself and i still feel scammed."
21415,"Is good game, fun to play, would recomend to Dinosaur lovers and just anyone who likes animals"

21426,a very good game but if you are going to play online get ready to grind because this game is rough first starting off. i play this every summer when i get out of school. the dinos are cool and the gear is even cooler. just try it out with some people who can teach you the basics or watch some videos before getting into online PVP. PVE/offline gameplay is fun too if your into fighting huge bosses and strong monsters or if you just wanna make a house and tame. i totally recommend this game. 10/10

21434,The literal best game on steam
21435,"This is my review after 1k Hours. This game is great in a lot of ways. If you want to PvP on Official servers,  you need a group of 3-5 people who are going to play and put in the time to get resources. I suggest playing during a Double XP and Taming event. For PvE it is easy to play either official or unofficial servers. Private PvP servers are the most balanced. Official servers suck because you will be wiped by a high level dino that could be a player just passing by. PLEASE DISABLE BRINGING ADVANCED DINOS FROM LATER DLCS TO PREVIOUS ONES. Too many times I had friends want to try the game then we get wiped by a level 450 Managamr on The Island. This player does not even play on the server, they just transfer in then leave. Hopefully ARK 2 addresses this. 

Buy this game if you love Dinos, love games like Minecraft or the Forrest just with Dinos. If you have a solid group of friends to always play games with that share that same interest you will have a great time. I suggest starting on a private server."
21436,game is very fun but can get boring at times

21443,"Love just about everything in this game. It's very fun and expansive in every aspect. Only complaint is how clunky and frustrating the building can be almost all the time. If you like survival games, and dinos, ARK is where its at."
21444,love the building aspect
21445,Dinosaurs are cool
21446,I like this game
21447,its ok
21448,i thought id never be able to play to this game since i only had 4GB of ram and a really sad graphics card but playing it on the same graphics as the first doom game and forcing myself through the occasional lag has made it possible to play this cooler minecraft with dinosaurs.
21449,IT HAS MONKEEEEEEEEEEES

21458,So fun
21459,great game but best land space goes in first week servers starts up. people are greedy higher level players  try and grab as much land as possible leaves very little for new players  to start. be prepared to die a hundred times to get your first  good spot. More if you go on a pvp server if you can survive long enough to level up its a fun game.
21460,"This game is just way too big and unoptimized. I am looking at 400+GB to for this game and I don't even own all the DLC. Thats is fine if you have tons of NVME or ssd space(which is expensive) or are fine with 10-20 minute load times on a hard drive...

This game is a blast but I want to play other games and I just don't have the storage to come back to it or the patients to wait for it to load into any of the DLC maps on my solid state M.2 drives"
21461,love this game
21462,its a fun game but SO MANY PROBLEMS
21463,"I recommend PVE. You can be challenged by the game, not others desire the kill you and take your stuff. Love the maps and the interaction with other players and, of course, the dinos."
21464,"Fell off my Argentavis into a pack of 6 Troodons, proceeding to fall asleep while they repeatedly performed buttstuff upon my tribe member and I, until our armor broke along with out hopes and dreams. 10/10"
21465,good
21466,"I enjoy this game a lot though when ever I play i always use mods and it is not optimized well. But if you want a fun dino themed survival game with a nice based building system this the game for you,"
21467,"Another negative take:

[TLDR] Ark / Wild Card has disappointed me over and over, with game and mod breaking updates. Even on private / solo servers, expect progress to be lost after some time. Either wait for the completed release, or just find another game (Rust). 

NOTE: I don't play on servers, only solo. Random servers too buggy, laggy or exploited and no friends play Ark for private servers. 

Don't be fooled by the 381 hours played - 1/3 or so alone is from AFK farming, or waiting for dinos to mature. 
Still, I gave Ark and Wild Card about 250 hours of chance, only to be disappointed time and time again. 

The vanilla (base) game got pretty boring rather quickly for me, so I went down the modded route, only to find that to be difficult to pursue. 

Every few weeks, sometimes a month or two if you are lucky, a new update would come out and break a number of mods or even the base game, making all previous progress null and void. Imagine 25, 50, or even 100 hours of effort down the drain because Wild Card can't release a complete game. 

This is a trend in many other games, and one which seems to only be growing in popularity, despite it being the prime reason for gray hairs in my twenties. 
Crashes are rather frequent, even with no apparent cause. (At least in games like 7DtD, you have an active console spewing tons of useful data to indicate what is wrong with the game)

As others have stated, even with decent hardware (above recommend specs), optimization is an issue, with graphical glitches a common place. Not the worst thing, but just an issue worthy of noting. 

All in all, its a graphically stunning game, with interesting mechanics and features but with poor optimization, frequent updates which annihilate hours of effort, and servers which will drive you to the end of your sanity and drop you off into the abyss of insanity."
21468,No Apple support!
21469,"this game can be goated now that its free but it literally just needs to be smaller, 150 gb is stupid"
21470,"Its a really great game 
I have a lot of good and fun memories back on ps4 
can't wait to see ark survival 2 !"

21477,"I liked the dinosaurs and the survival elements.  I really like the raptors and the dilophosaurs.  I hope to have a raptor pack someday.  I didn't like it when I angered a brontosaurus and it killed my dinosaurs, but that was only in self defense for it, honestly."
21478,"Ark Survival Evolved is an immersive survival game situated in a mysterious, isolated realm with artifacts suggesting the presence of an advanced intelligence monitoring the player's progress as they learn of their environment, how to hunt and gather for self-sustainment, and how to tame the wide variety of animals and dinosaurs occupying their realm with you.  The game offers challenges to survival, such as keeping warm, or cool, as the weather changes, staying healthy and well fed, from foraging berries and butchering animal carcasses for their meat.  The technology tree offers phases of advancement from stone age through modern, and into science fiction.  As your character levels up with experience, you can customize your player character in many areas, such as weight carrying capacity, run speed, health capacity, Stamina, and even increasing the time to hold one's breath longer when swimming underwater.
Before acquiring Tek gear, I personally enjoy taming flying creatures that I can ride and scout my environment from a bird's eye view.  One goal I always strive for is to tame a T-Rex, the king of most predators found in the game.  One can also breed dinosaurs and raise the babies if you are interested in breeding for stronger characteristics.  ARK Survival Evolved has several free maps available to play on, and the game also supports player created mods to enrich the game.  I highly recommend the game to anyone interested in base-building/survival among the dinosaurs."

21547,"I'll make this brief. My issues with this aren't with the game play, the loop, the design, etc. But the optimization? And the number of graphical issues? Holy shit, this game is a mess. File sizes are absolutely ridiculous. 60 GB base game and 20+ GB for additional maps. Screen tearing galore and no option to turn on VSync or anything similar to stop it, and my system is decently above the only listed specs for the game. And when it isn't the screen tearing, it's the bloom turning anything even mildly reflective into an HID bulb right in your face. Ark can be a pretty game, but it desperately needs some cleaning up. I'm sure everyone appreciates all the new maps and everything that comes with it, but the base game needs a lot of attention first."

Great game to play with friends. I got this game with 4 of my friends and we had an amazing time. The first 3 months of our play-through was a blast. We tamed big dinos and killed each other for fun. Exploring caves with people  is so fun and getting the loot was the best part. We played this game having intentions of beating all the bosses. We killed none. This game is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. The only problems I have with this game is that it is very grindy. I knew that it was going to be like this when I got it, but searching the whole map 4 times to find a rex with a high lvl was just not fun. After I learned that the way to get the best dinos was searching for 6 hours I lost my motivation for playing. I did not want to fly around for 6 hours straight just to kill one boss that give me slightly cooler items. I am sad that I never got to the cool items you earn after killing bosses and I think I should have kept playing. I don't even feel like going on this game anymore to play it. I got so bored I wont even go onto my world. I thing this game is amazing and is one of my favorite games, but I just never got the motivation to finish the game."

☑ ARK: Survival Evolved"
21659,Golira :) Funny mokny. Ape throw children in cage :((((
21660,"Good game if you want to lose track of time. I have sunk over 600 hours in, and i always find new things to do and have fun with friends. I have been playing since Alpha, and am still in love with this game and style of survival games. Like rust, but with dinosaurs."
21661,Great survival game to play by yourself or with your friends.
21662,"Shit game, can't join friend's server so easily, not like in minecraft which is very easy to do, this game's engine is like 1 millions years old, it runs like shit
"
21663,"Ark is an amazing game of exploration, survival, collecting, taming/breeding, building, and creative problem solving. The graphics are breathtaking and the music is fantastic! I am obsessed with this game. Be prepared for a lot of frustration in the beginning, and be aware that you will encounter occasional bugs. Back up your save every so often and that will give you piece of mind."
21664,i like it vere much kiss kiss to devs
21665,YES
21666,I like how it is good.
21667,"i love it

"
21689,YES
21690,
21691,Very fun to play with friends! But I got connection problems while playing in public servers.
21692,Fun game overall if you use mods. If you play base are you are a crazy person.
21693,"i  bought  ark, killed some random naked people, raided like 5 homes , go back home turn on ark, good game"
21694,"Very good  game
"
21695,infuriating in every way imaginable. i love it
21696,It is a survival based game so if you like the challenge of surviving when almost everything just wants to kill you including the weather in some cases then this is a game you would like
21697,"good
"
21698,good
21699,Love This Game!
21700,"gut
"
21701,good game
21702,"Looked amazing, got it as a surprise for my fiance... but despite having well over the minimum reqs to play it, could never get it to load in. Shame, she would have had a blast riding a T-Rex around. Hopefully one day they'll have that problem fixed and I'll try getting it for her again."
21703,this is the best game i ever play
21704,"I do honestly love this game. I've played it with friends for ages. I would definitely recommend it to people with beefy computers and a lot of time on your hands.

However, it is absolutely massive to download, has odd glitches, has lag issues, and poor performance on older computers."
21705,iT KEEPS BRINGING YOU BACK
21706,so good you watch carbos have intercourse
21707,"This game has it all; humans, humans pooping, dinosaurs, dinosaurs pooping, making structures, avoiding pooping in those structures, making tools, pooping while making tools, cooking food, pooping out that food after you eat it, gardening and agriculture, using poop for gardening and agriculture, and so much more:
- mining and refining metal
- gathering resources from multiple challenging biomes
- fierce creatures to contend with, and maybe tame
- brilliant emergent gameplay from all manner of systems interlinking with each other
- constant battle to stay alive against hunger, thirst, and the elements
- massive player servers to take the challenge multiplayer with thousands of official servers
- mods to further extend things
- quite nice-looking graphics
- building infrastructure for your bases, towns, cities and truly grand projects
- acquiring the power of modern technology, but with ridable dinosaurs
- unraveling the mystery of why and how you're in an environment with long-extinct creatures dotted by huge, imposing technological structures hovering above the landscape 

if you haven't been convinced yet to go ahead and get this game, at least on sale even, you should check out a streamer playing the game and see if you've been missing out on some fun!"
21708,dinosaur goes roar
21709,"Amazing
all the way around"
21710,Fun so far.
21711,"I 100% love this game so so much. Playing with friends it is a lot more fun, tho i dont really have them so, i play solo or on PVE servers; you still get to enjoy the game!"
21712,I like the game its fun it was my child hood and now i get to play it.

21719,"Server browser lags like it's 1998.
Game's poorly optimized, stay away."
21720,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES TO PLAY THE GAME
21721,"To this day, one of the best games I have ever played. I cannot think of a better way to spend every waking moment of my free time doing nothing. Honestly, though the dinosaurs that you tame and breed are basically just glorified tomagachis, it is so freaking addicting."
21722,I like it
21723,fun game love dinos

21734,"game is too buggy to play well and they dont plan on fixing it in the future, and they will not help you fix your issues, so don't buy it on pc, just get it on console if you have one."
21735,This is the worst game I've ever played in my life.
21736,i can dig it
21737,It is a really good game. It is so well thought out and has many different features to make the game great. There is many maps with different content to play with. It is a survival game with a great story along with it.
21738,"meh, worth ig"
21739,very good
21740,"its good
"
21741,very bad game
21742,"Literally my favorite game. 
TLDR - Highly Recommended

Don't play Official PVP if you don't want to live the game every waking moment, unless you enjoy torture, then sure. PVE, Unofficial servers and Single player is where it's at. Better still, get a few friends and start your own server with a service like Nitrado and this game is the goat. 

Base game + Expansions + Several free maps = worth it, imo...and I'm broke ppl.
The maps are huge and each one provides many, many hours of gameplay and adventure. Survive the diverse biomes by building bases, taming creatures (dinos), and exploration. Spelunk, climb, dive and fly your way to learning why you just woke up on a beach in your undies and keep waking up similarly if, and probably when, you die.

Ban together with your fellow survivors and form a tribe to conquer the land, or even other tribes. Breed up powerful bloodlines and trusted companions, the more time you put into raising your dinos, the stronger they can become. 

Grow crops, keep bees, breed giant turtles at the bottom of the ocean, put a frickin lazer beam on a Shark's head. This game has it all... Including a bit of a steep learning curve, but most keys and commands are bindable, or you can just use a controller.

Go watch Neebs Gaming's Ark series or Phlinger Phoo's Tutorials and Ark series on YouTube for a good idea of some the adventures you can have."

Good game, although after 150 hours you receive mild brain damage and it occurs every 5 hours if you keep going. After 467.3 hours of this game I don't know how water works and I don't have sensation in my teeth and also my penis has regressed into a rudimentary organ with the lack of blood from sitting for 450+ hours. I also developed scales and an implant in my wrist.

Final thoughts: I don't have any"

Please fix your game. I meet all the requirements on my PC and this game still crashes every 20 seconds. I have done 6/7 different fixes to make this run including deleting and reinstalling and it is still broken. Fix the fatal error. Fix your game."
21807,"crashes too much on my linux to be fun for me

the game itself seems immensely fun 

edit after a couple of hours of ark ...

no dont buy this game :P its a waste of your money and time. hardly any coherent game design present here. might be awesome lore behind it and the premise and potential was amazing. ark looks also immensely beautiful, but its just alure. single player is so boring i wonder who enjoys it and multiplayer is so harsh even pve servers. the people i encountered in multiplayer are mostly rude and not who i want to be close to virtually or actually, only few exeptions sadly. worst buy of my life in 39 years. i feel stupid for having been looking forward to play it. how can something that amazing in style actually be so bad?

honestly - i feel deep regrets about every bit of attention i spend towards ark as a topic or game. 
ark 2 i will whole heartedly ignore. the devs who design this embarrassing mess of a ""game"" do not have any trust from me to ever create something i would consider enjoyable.

that they release ark 2 with this mess still present is embarrassing. 

only ever play this game if you have real actual close friends like family and you play together constantly then you willl surely find some fun in it together. for me this was waste of effort to make it run, time playing it  and of course the money i spent on it.

on multiplayer pve servers you get constantly killed by wildlife above your level, on pvp servers you mostly dont get killed by players, but by wildlife above your level... 

in single player it looks amazing what you can unlock and build but soon you find out that the numbers are all wrong and it is deliberately slowing you down beyond reason so you spend most of the time gathering for DAYS for a suitable home base. taming is redicoulously random and you have no ingame orientation about where to go or what to do. the manual is a joke.

some people like that ""challenge"" i just wish games would advertise it properly so gamers like me would not waste their money. 

and i thought ark would be amazing lol how naive and stupid i was :P gladly it only took 25 hours. some people take longer to unfortunately realise what they went into.

what a joke of a game ... and it looks so beautiful ... thats just heartbreaking to my gamer heart :P"
21808,this game is possibly the worst thing i have ever played. NOTHING like it. the graphics are terrible. the AI is godawful. everything about this game is awful. do not buy it.
21809,"good game
"
21810,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
21811,"Pros: Find, tame and breed dinos/creatures. Explore dungeons, kill bosses, dodge traps, gets zee loot, grow plants and enjoy large worlds. There's tons of fun to be had and it's very addicting.

Cons: They care more about the new expansions than fixing glitches which might put you in a wall somewhere and get you killed loosing everything you had with you at that time but the biggest con is this....If you don't log onto the server where you have all your stuff on a regularly basis then you'll loose EVERYTHING!! which means your buildings, tames, items etc which also means you can never uninstall the game unless you're ok with loosing possibly years upon years of work."
21812,"Love this game, Hate this game but my love is much stronger than the hate"
21813,good
21814,"I have over 1500 hours into this game.  To say it was bad would null and void my life that I have committed to it. ;)  Honestly, I have been playing it since Alpha release and there are still bugs from the beginning that haven't been fixed.  There are no other games that even compare to this one for what I am looking for."
21815,asssss
21816,amazing game
21817,this game suck ass
21818,very funni physics. so loud i cant hear my parents argueing.
21819,love game
21820,iv played this game for almost 5 years now and i only just got it on pc its fun and really great when you wanna have epic fight with dinosaurs so i recommend it to people who like dinosaur games
21821,"Pitifully my whole review will not fit, so I'll be short (kinda:)):

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]The game is very unique, great Dinosaurs diversity.
[*]Each Dino has its purpose in the game, almost no needless ones.
[*]Creatures are well-made and sounds are pretty-realistic.
[*]OST is great too.
[*]Ability to build mobile bases on Dinos is great. Even more great is that other players could be at the base while moving and not fall off.
[*]There are a lot of fun technologies and mechanics.
[*]Interesting idea behind the story.
[*]Underwater gameplay and exploration is okayish.
[*]ARK Server Manager is very rich on features and easy to use.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-=Poor Controls=-
[list]
[*]Cannot double-click in the server lobby screen to connect.
[*]""Enter"" key is not working after entering password/entering numbers ingame, etc.
[*]Cannot swap ammo type using weapons on the go.
[*]Cannot cycle through items on the hotbar using mouse scroll.
[*]Cannot cancel particular item in the crafting queue, only option is to cancel everything.
[*]Poor Inventory and storage Management.
[*]Cooking stations craft everything at the same time, wasting resources.
[i]Some of these issues ""fixed"" by mods.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Uninformative Interface=-[/b]
[list]
[*]No information about dino wild/tame level, which is crucial for taming.
[*]No description about the taming process, wild stats, mutations ingame.
[*]Non-informative stats on dinos and weapons in percents instead of exact numbers.
[*]No mention about any torpor damage on weapons in the game.
[*]No marking/description about egg sizes needed to craft kibbles. 
[*]Food cooking recipes do not store/show in a pot, even after finding said recipes.
[i]Majority of these issues fixed by mods.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Boring Gameplay=-[/b]
[list]
[*]Cannot reconnect to the server approximately for 10-15 minutes if connection is lost.
[*]Player drop unconcious after receiveing 10% of torpor damage for uknown reason.
[*]If the dino that knocked you out is weak and you have good armor, you lie on the ground for 10-30 realtime minutes staring at black screen, listening to the bites and without ability to do anything.
[*]Player is not regenerating stamina underwater. If you lost stamina, you cannot swim up. The only choice then is to find a way to kill yourself, for example taking off your scuba suit..
[*]Some dinos can push you out of map border where you die and all your stuff gets deleted from the game.
[*]Taming some creatures requires feeding them a fish corpse by pressing ""E"". Most times the fish you are holding covers all the screen and you cannot press ""E"".
[*]For the most part taming process is very primitive, knock it down, put food ""inside"" and wait for it to become loyal.
[*]Oppositely some passive taming methods are insanely hard, and even more boring, like feeding a Gigantosaur to Troodon(feeding an elephant to the rabbit lol).  
[*]Some creatures steal entire stacks of items right from your inventory and desintegrate them in a second. This feature stays despite numerous complaints and requests from the playerbase.
[i]Some of these issues fixed by mods.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Messed up Building System=-[/b]
[list]
[*]Building is very limited, blocks do not snap properly, cannot intersect, even with terrain.
[*]Building blocks connect to each other at different angles sometimes, which leads to crooked buildings.
[*]A lot of micromanagement and unnecessarily huge amount of engrams, when they could just join all shapes to material type. (Example: 7 Days to Die, Empyrion.)
[*]Building of water piping and electricity grid is inconvenient and obscure and wastes a lot of time. Cables and pipes sink into foundations, snap automatically to wrong locations. Lots of buildings placed on pipes ONLY. Such buildings are DESTROYED if you'll remove the pipe first, which makes tries to place building in a particular place a pain.
[*]Font size on signs is so tiny you dont see a thing, reported for years...
[i]Some of these issues are fixed by mods.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Crazy Grind=-[/b]
[list]
[*]Waiting for days to tame creatures, months/years needed to have powerful high-level tame with mutations on official servers. 
[*]Harvest amounts are ridiculous. Even MMO's are not such a time sinks.
[*]Even 10x multipliers are not enough, if you dont want to spend your whole life in ark and see everything, x100 or even x1000 multipliers needed for some settings, and x0.001 multiplier for timers and cooldowns.
[*]Crafting recipes for top gear(using blueprints) requires thousands of resources. Imagine tons of iron required to craft a helmet. And imagine resource grind involved.
[*]The weight and stacks are so limited, which takes away most fun of the game, adds a lot of micromanagement, grind and limitations. In fact that is a reason that half of the mods in the workshop are stack size increase and weight reduction mods.
[i]These issues could be fixed in settings in SP or on your own server.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Worst AI Ever=-[/b]
[list]
[*]Medium-to-large size dinos are stuck in every second tree/stone, and cannot break free, making even strongest predators an easy prey.
[*]Tamed dinos that follow the player just go by straight trajectory, burry into the first available obstacle and stare at you.
[*]They also get stuck in each other or the player, which leads to overlapping hitboxes and the whole party stops very often.
[*]Tamed dinos love to jump off cliffs, especially into lava.
[*]Control over ""taming groups"" is a nightmare. Sometimes tames are not listening to commands. The distance of commands to ALL is very limited. ""Following distance"" is not working properly.
[*]Sometimes tamed sea creatures just swim in random directions, and you loose them, it takes tremendous amount of time to find them one by one.
[*]Titanosaur is a huge and powerfull dino. Developers failed to fix its pathfinding , and made him IMMUNE to attacks if it is stuck. Genius.
[i]There is no fix for these issues.[/i]
[/list]

[b]-=Weak Modding Support=-[/b]
[list]
[*]No Minimap mod atm in entire workshop at all. The game itself will not give you a replacement for this torn piece of paper. Imagine top-level player flying using jetpack, hi-tech weapons, super-duper sci-fi buildings and... a map on papyrus.
[*]Also there are no mods to fix majority of issues described in this post.
[*]Some useful mods get outdated and never find replacement...
[/list]

[b]-=Bad Coding=-[/b]
[list]
[*]Countless amount of bugs. I just tired of recording them at some point.
[*]250GB space needed. It takes more space than all my favorite games combined. It has less content than any of these games.
[*]The game crashes each time there are too many eggs on the screen, having like 10-20 eggs will crash the game or even turn off your VGA without doubt. This problem persist for a long time, but nobody cares.
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
The game had great idea and it was implemented partially.
The game has good graphics, realistic and fancy textures. Animations are good too.
The game sucks on almost all aspects with coding involved.
It seems like 90% of their staff are various graphic designers. I cannot find an adequate excuse to why this game sucks so hard on features, controls, UI, AI, etc.
Overall I do not recommend this game. It is fancy, but is an absolute time sink, poorly-done, bugged, requires a lot of googling."

21839,woohoo!
21840,the game constantly wipes out any player progress on the world and deletes the character when you are loading a saved world.  the only indication that you were ever on the world is trees and rocks missing.  i resorted to backing up my world files after every play session but i'm sick of doing it.  I played the game a year ago and this issue didn't exist

The building system is no Valheim, but the taming system is quite fun and complex. always be using your spyglass to tell if you should spare/catch different animals. Different animals are better at harvesting different resources, in a mostly common sense kind of way, but some will surprise you."

21888,"Awwww the game wants you to think I've got over 300 hrs of game time... how sweet.

The reality is about half of that ""play time"" is spent on loading screens trying to get anything to do anything! I'm only now writing a review because what the hell. Got home from work early on a Friday, thought to myself ""I want to treat myself with Ark"" and here I am nearly 2.5 hrs later and haven't seen anything other than the loading screen. I -could- just stop steam from playing the game and do something else, but somehow Ark manages to hold my PC hostage. I cannot open anything else when it's ""loading"" since the screen seems to exist above any other window I might try having.

And that's me trying to load up a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. I'm not even trying to join a server.


Ark, when it decides to work, is a fun game. What more do you want beyond running around trying your luck with seeing what dinos you can tame and build up a base from scratch. Get some breeding projects going to get the coolest colour combo dinos, or just run around half naked shaking pointy sticks at rexes.

However the reality for me after my rose-coloured-glasses fell off is that most maps are buggy, there are MANY places where you are either above or below the visual ground because the mesh is half-assed. Good luck trying to play with a friend on a non-dedicated server. Rubber banding is horrible, the lag is intense regardless of setting combinations, and a myriad of other bugs which are regularly brought to Devs attention, but nooooooo let's not fix the existing game. Instead, lets release all this (buggy) DLC and oh look! Ark has a sequel now!


Fan-freaking-tastic. A full priced sequal when the existing game doesn't freaking work.

Fix the hellish load times. PLEASE. 

OH HEY! In the time it took me to write this review, once Ark so gracefully released my screen from it's black loading screen, it has crashed. So that 2.5 hours, completely and utterly wasted. There goes my entire gaming session this afternoon. Thanks."
21889,"I really want to like this game, but I just can't. As a first timer you probably roll on an official server, but there's nothing but extreme grind and even if you managed to grind something reasonable, in the morning it's gone. Since you are sick of loosing all your progress, you start solo or on a private server, but after a while you realize, the game is just empty, there's nothing, no real fun or anything just grind, which you just managed to avoid."
21890,
21891,best dino game for sure.
21892,Pretty alr game. Better with friends.
21893,"Whats my favourite thing about ark?
The continuous recurring suicidal thoughts every couple of hours or so. The pain granted mentally, physically and emotionally. 

9/10 will continue playing"
21894,so good its hard but awesome
21895,"Seems overwhelming at first, but it's actually really easy once you get the hang of it. Definitely more fun with friends, but solo is also fun. It can be buggy, but so far I've not seen any that ruin the integrity of the game. Overall it's fun, and I love it."
21896,love it

Where every so often it deletes you saved singleplayer games i mean are seriously trying to make people quit on ark. This bug makes me rather to play on a server but at least i would lose all of my stuff because of other players not some sadistic software or engine. And don't say oh you can go in your files and modify it yeah well guess not everyone the 1,000,000 I.Q points so they can't just assume they would know how to do this shit including consoles and mobile which does't allow you to tamper with internal files. Like i said i don't hate the game just this god forsaken bug that makes me want to bash my head against the keyboard and fling myself out of a 100 story building.

1 - it will eat a lot of it
2 - it will unceremoniously piss on all that time by killing you, everything you've ever loved and everything you could yet love, for a giggle

If you're ok with that then it's a great game, cute cuddly titanic lizards that you can make friends with and frolic around in the wilderness gathering resources and building ever more elaborate bases. Or if you're like my one friend, a shed. The world is yours."

22013,"30 minutes playing 6 hours waiting for taming/breeding/hatching/raising
Non stable servers with freezes every 10-15 and they made the game f2p so even more people swarm the servers that cant keep up even with the current amount of players. Worth it if youre playing singleplayer with heavily modified settings, online worth it if you host a private server with heavily modified settings. Simply not worth investing time in unless you have hours and hours of free time to sink into constantly waiting."

"
22028,"Ark is a crafting survival game with a focus on taming and fighting dinosaurs. You gather resources, level up, tame bigger and scarier dinos, while heading towards a set of final boss encounters.

The production quality of the game is pretty high, it can look good and sound good. There is a bit of a learning curve, but not more than any survival crafting based game. You have your typical chop down trees, mine rocks, build base and upgrade equipment, type loop. The gimmick is of course the dinos that litter the island that you can tame and use. Its a bit pokemon-esqu actually, as there is a large variety of them and they all have different purposes. Theoretically this all works, there is a really good foundation here.

The reason why I am giving this a negative review though is because of the tremendous amount of work I had to do to have fun with this game and it never really lasted. In my opinion the balance here is really, really off and it seems the game wants you to fix it yourself. When I started the game I had a good time until about 5 hours in when everything started to take an eternity to do. I tweaked the resource gather rate along with a few other settings and went back to having fun for maybe 10 hours. Then things got super frustrating as I couldn't progress because not high enough level dinos would spawn. Tweak settings again. Game balance drastically changes as all dinos are higher level now, need to tweak other settings to get back to having fun. Realize that some things I need are not available in settings. Begin looking at mods. Start using mods, trying to figure out which ones help. Spend a few frustrating hours with mods that either don't do enough or too much. Quit. I went through this cycle twice, roughly, with a few more started and abandoned characters in between.

I want to make clear, this isn't just 'the game got hard, so I made it easier'. The early, mid and late games, feel like different games entirely. And to an extent the game is aware that there is a problem. The game allows you to easily change its settings, from everything from resource gather rate to what you gain at level up to the level of the dinos themselves. And it also makes modding very easy too. But it shouldn't be up to me to balance your game for you! And because of the stark difference between the game stages, I could never figure out any settings or mods that work at all levels. Most dedicated players seem to mod it so the early and mid games get almost entirely skipped and then just focus on changing the end game.

Bottom line. There is a good basis for a game here but unless you are actually more interested in the community mods than the game itself, I can't really recommend it."

22040,Nice but boring when playing a lot
22041,"I grabbed this to play with a friend on a private server, which removes a lot of the gripes I've read about official servers. While taming dinos with friends has had its fun moments, especially at the start ,it has too many bugs mixed with weird decisions on mechanics that ruin the fun. New content drops seem to be far more important than fixing even simple things, like being able to stand on a slanted greenhouse without your character model stuttering around randomly. I know new content sells, but there are some long standing bugs and complaints that have gone unheard/ignored for years.

If you don't care about the list of niggles that come to mind, skip this next paragraph, but it does give you some of the spectrum of frustration that comes with the game.

Trying to tame things is a slog when hit registry flat out refuses to work. Lead a target to account for lag, then see the blood splatter and the tranq dart in the dino? Didn't count. Shoot thin air, and suddenly it hits with no spatter. Come out of a cave run and sometimes the gamma gets messed up or the textures for the rest of the world get extremely dark, nealy black. Some enemies *cough* golems *cough* can chain punt you 20 yards every hit. Loss of control actions like fear last 20s+ where you just get to stare at your screen and wait. Torpor buildup from dinos doesn't reduce with armor/level/fortitude like their damage, so when you have thousands of health and armor means you can stay unconscious for several minutes while they do <1 damage per hit. Dinos in any stance that will attack other creatures while you're not mounted on them ignore follow whistling and cannot be stopped unless you can manage to hop on their backs while they move around, which is an absolute pain with birds. Increasing speed on a dragon does nothing for its handling so you can't turn in the tiny arena with the Wyvern boss. I also died from full health in that arena for colliding with the force field's edge somehow. Clipping issues galore, one of the most annoying of which is when you get stuck INSIDE your dinos that are on follow and have to relog to free yourself. The list just seems to keep growing every time I log in.

At the end of the day, I would trade the next new season pass content for more bug fixes and tweaks to functionality to stabilize what could be a really great game."

22052,"I have about 3-4k hours playing this on PS4. My best advice is to run while you still can. Ark will haunt your dreams. You will wake up in the dead of night with a bad feeling. You will log on every 10 minutes worried that you are being raided. You will spend months raising a breeding line of dinos for some d***head to break into your breeding pen and slaughter them all. I spent my first 50 hours in non-dedicated sessions with my friend. My next 3,000 were in PvP. Then I tried a unofficial PvE server. Was really fun until I realized how quickly you beat the game as a PvP player. The server wiped when the Lost Island came out. My friend and I had tek in less than 48 hours (it was a 6x server). If you are a psycho who has nothing left to live for this is the perfect game!"

22104,"I wake up at 4 am to imprint my giga and try not to cry while watching my whole base getting raided after tens of hours I put into it. 
It makes me want to die and take all the toxic official ark players with me.
This game has ruined my life and I just get sucked back in to this toxic addictive space every few months.
Couldn't ask for a better game tbh."

"
22108,awesome open world survival game the best
22109,Love it
22110,"Enjoy, but not worth the drama playing on public servers for me."
22111,"Possibly my favorite game ever!!!! Its one that I keep coming back to, and if you get bored there are loads of mods to explore. You don't need to be into PvP, albeit rookie numbers, are on PvE alone. Dont be fooled by the negative reviews, if you like the sound of open world survival craft with the added excitement of collecting and battling dinos like pokemon then what are you waiting for! Shout out to the devs, honestly great job. 10/10."
22112,Great Game!!

22119,the best survival game i have ever played. i recommend every one to play it and i think it is so underrated
22120,overall decent game
22121,"One of the jankiest games I have ever played.
One of the buggiest games I have ever played.
One of the most structurally unsound games I have ever played.
One of the most time intensive games I have ever played
One of the shoddiest pieces of software I have ever had the misfortune of suffering.
One of my favourite games.

22126,This game makes my brain numb
22127,"I love this game.
I hate this game.
This game is everything you could hope for. But their are tons of bugs and glitches. They rolled out an update that screwed up transfers. I lost months of work. I reported it and they offered me a pile of poop to replace gold. Stupid glitches like this often. I forget to go to a spot for 5 days and I lost something that cost me 800 tek which was a lot of work to obtain. Then I spend months gathering materials for a tek base. Find the perfect location on a new map for the expensive base. A day after building it, invincible trees started growing right through the foundations... foundations are supposed to prevent trees from growing. But I can't even tear down these trees and I have already built the base. Do I abandon months of preparation and rebuild? No. I report the bug very detailed with screenshots and videos. They have ignored this bug report like it doesn't exist. Then they start preparing for ARK2. As if those of us who hate this game and have already bought all the expansions, would be willing to give them another $200 for a crap game full of bugs that are ignored. But I play it anyways. I like some of the mechanics and there are dinosaurs. Every boys dream. I'm addicted and a glutton for the punishment all these bugs and glitches give me."
22128,"I would recommend this game if you want to get addicted, frustrated, and filled with adrenaline all within about an hour. Trust me you'll enjoy this game from exploring the different free maps or paid ones to testing how to tame creatures to fighting bosses. This game is one of my all time favorites. Have fun!"
22129,"Nobody is going to read this anyways, so I'm Gay
"
22130,yesyesyeyesssss!!! such game good!!
22131,rawr
22132,yeah not bad
22133,This game continues to be a staple and example of what a survival crafting game should be. Ark is endless and unique at a level that has not been achieved by anything else to date.
22134,Dino=Fun
22135,"This is a good game if you like survival sndaboxes. Also, if you like Dianosnaur and hate yourself!

22139,"The game is still fun, and yes I am waiting on Ark 2 to come out at the time of posting this. With mods this game is insanely fun and a tip for anybody that only wants to play a specific DLC and has limited space just only install that DLC. Like I am playing on the Genesis map because I enjoy it but didn't have 400gb for every DLC to be installed. The Genesis DLC has all the assets and everything and has no dependencies nor does any of the proper official DLCs. So if you only want to play with 1 DLC then only install that DLC to save space."
22140,"I've played Ark more on Ps4 than I have on PC, but I can say without a doubt it's a very fun game. If you play with friends. On your own this game can get boring and kind of stressful, even on servers full of people! If you don't have any friends to play with it on, I would probably skip over this. Even as a dino taming simulator, it could be super overwhelming on your own! 

With friends, however, it's a wonderful experience. If you like games like Stardew Valley where you have to come together as a team to all do separate things to get your farm going, this is very similar! You and your friends will travel the lands (whatever map you pick) and find dinos to tame (or devour) to help your little clan grow! Build in dangerous areas, or a wonderful beach-house even with the threat of a megaladon coming to steal your dodos! Whatever you do, do it laughing with friends!"
22141,this game is hot garbage do not buy it will give you malware
22142,im involed for sure

22151,makes me suicidal but also makes me very happy
22152,Good
22153,This game is absolutely worth playing if your into Survival games. Definitely in my Top 5 favorite games of all time

22174,GOOD
22175,great game
22176,ARK is my go to game.. Sometimes you just come back to a game over and over because it feels right. That's what ARK is for me.
22177,VERY GOOD GAME
22178,"Great game! Even after many years it's still great, with friends or alone, and it also keeps getting updates! Looking forward to playing ark II !"
22179,Definitely love the game been playing it for years. I do not like the updates that happen so often it gets a little irritating when you don't have the best internet. The graphics and the building could be a bit better but the overall game play of the game is fantastic. Definitely would recommend to others.
22180,"Where do I fucking start...... I want to like this game but everyday, like 95% of the time this game are BROOOOOOKEN!
Dinos despawn, dosen't matter if they are wild or tamed, they disappear!! Dinos and you get stuck in Arks own environment. If you are second player be prepared to fall through Arks own platforms if the host aren't near. Be prepared to teleport everysecond in special places of EVERY MAP cuz the Host are there! Dinos and you WILL die in water or becuse of fall damage when you fall from the sky over and over and over again or the bottom of the sea over and over and over again.  Even if you are next to the host you WILL teleport to nerest danger!

Don't let me get started on how hard it is to just open the menu........ it freezes 5-8 times EVERYTIME I want to start the game. When you finally find youself in the main menu, oboy! Maybe you will get in, maybe you wont. You probably wont before the host kill your body or you try every solution you can read about!
2 HOURS sometimes, TWO FUCKING HOURS JUST TO JOIN. Is it really worth it?!?!

This game have killed more dinos of mine then the dinos in game!
I can't even write about everything this game gives you becuse it will always suprise you with new bugs/glitches and broken mechanics!
AND THE DEVELOPERS DON'T GIVE A FUCK! Just thow out new Maps and Dinos without even fixing the old broken maps!
EVERY MAP HAVE SOME PROBLEMS! I have seen them all in this game!

This game are definitely the most broken game I have played yet and I have played games ever since I was a Child, Fallout and Elder Scrolls are BUG FREE compered to this piece of shit!!

DON'T BUY if you wan't to have fun. It's NOT worth it!!
The developers have givin' up on this game since release!

This game makes me cry blood!!"
22181,"After playing this game for many, many hours, I can clearly say that modded or vanilla, this is one of the best games you can pick up at any time to have some fun. Solo or multiplayer, it's still a great game. Definitely recommend looking into the Workshop if you find vanilla to be no longer a challenge."

22203,really good game
22204,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

are you looking for a survival games with a lot of dinos? are you interested in dying a couple times cause y'know... its ark? do you want to tame a giant flock of small pterosaurs and absolutely obliterate everything in your path? well this game might be for you! as long as you dont mind the bugs of course."

22231,Good Game.

22251,"Broken and unoptimized game, BUT with dinos! A lot of them! And only about half of them want to eat you.
In my opinion, wait for a discount (because the game is still broken and unoptimized) and you'll get yourself a game you'll spend hundreds of hours on."
22252,"The Ark giveth and the Ark taketh away, like all my free time."

22288,After 4000+ hours of gameplay i have seen no improvements in optimization and every game breaking bug and glitch under the sun. Ark is an amazing concept poorly executed and with no competition and a far too lenient community eating up dlc's wildcard have no reason to do anything other than sit on their millions and laugh at you.

22290,"There's some underdeveloped elements, but the breadth of development makes up for it. Dinos with unique uses, fun animations, enjoyable battle, manageable challenges, organic gameplay, good server control... I bet this game is even better with the right mods, but I haven't felt the urge-- that's high praise, coming from me.

Great game to play with friends. Looking forward to finding all the collectibles and climbing the tower."

22309,you say this game bad? me say skill issue
22310,"Lets push a crap ton of DLC's after making our supporters pay for 4 other maps. Let's focus on catering to smaller tribes being harassed off the game with hot patches but do nothing about broken maps and the abundance of cheating/meshing, DDOS attacks, Duping, and Zergs/Alpha Tribes. Playing solo even on smalls is a nightmare and I have 7k hours on just PC. There is nowhere safe to build up and prosper even for a short time. Since this game has been released I have not seen anything positive when it comes to people literally being harassed off PVP servers. When I say there is no place safe I am not joking. I went from metal to tek to wiped 10 times in the time span of a week or less between. I really want to enjoy this game with its PVP aspect but I do not want to find a mesh hole and risk being banned just to be safe. I uninstalled for the last time due to the development timeline and overall consumer satisfaction being worse then Dayz.(They worked on tree shading for a year straight) Save yourself time and maintain the work/sleep schedule you have. DO NOT PLAY! ARK 2 is going to be the same."
22311,Its a really fun game
22312,"This game has an addictive quality though there are some issues I have with the building (fence/foundation/wall obstructions) and character animation. (lower body completely static while upper body uses the ax or pickax etc.)
I can look passed those things and still enjoy all the game has to offer.  Only have played single player so far."
22313,"everything.. trying to survic\v
e and taming beasts"
22314,"Does it have bugs and glitches? Yes. For instance, did my friend spawn 100 feet in the air and die upon landing? Yes, yes they did.
But have I gotten to ride some gosh darn dinosaurs? Oh yes. This game gets my blood going and I like it, I like it a lot.
Thank goodness it is easy to build yourself back up when you get totally toasted by a massive trex or a horde of tiny dinos. The progression is pretty balanced and you can really tweak a lot of the settings. Like, a lot of them. You can make this game as casual or grueling as you want.
I haven't even gotten to fly yet. Can't wait."

22359,"This game was torture. It feels like an early access game that has a lot of potential if they ever get it out of alpha. I found myself saying ""man, this is annoying"" every 30 seconds. 

The crafting is tedious. Weight limit, tons of tiny containers, millions of different mats to track. Everything expires super fast.  Everything expires and fuels get consumed while you're offline.  

Building is horrible. Walls will snap together but only at a 45deg angle for some bizarre reason.  I fought the horrible building mechanics, building and destroying, trying to get walls to line up and finally managed to finish a giant wall with spikes on it to defend my base only to find out spikes don't actually hurt dinos in PVE

Combat is broken. You can't melee a running dino even if you're following it at point blank.  Projectiles often just miss even when they shoot right through the side of a giant dino.  If you're unlucky, tough dinos will randomly wander into your base, one shot you, kill all your pets, destroy your base, camp your body until it times out and you lose all your gear, and basically reset your game.  

If you like the ""challenge"" of RNG and spending hours online researching every little aspect of the game just to figure out what to to then this game is for you. Having already played Valheim, Ark just felt inferior in every way.  It's a super tedious version of Valheim with more bugs and none of the fun."
22360,"Hate the game











I'll be back in 2 months to play another 300 hours 10/10"
22361,good game fun for hours but takes a while to get metal
22362,it is coo;l
22363,JUST BUY IT!
22364,"This is a lovely game. I love the idea of Extinction beyond. What i hate are the security of many structures. It drives me mad! My final sentence(s) is that maybe there should be space for an underground base and that there should be more resources. Also upgrade security! keep coding Ark II creators!
"
22365,"Parasaur falls over out of nowhere and dies, certain walls and ceilings on base just straight up disappear, dino gates crumble apart randomly.
perfect game in my opinion, no bugs whatsoever.
would recommend.

22366,"shitty game

22367,"ass
"
22368,"This game is great and very fun to play, I've been playing for years and finally bought it on pc and love the mods i can now play with. Structures+ and Ark additions are some of my favorites."
22369,"Still in early access?
"
22370,"please give me my money back and fuck your game .

22374,i like dinosaurs

22376,holy fuck walking around cliffs is nightmares always instead of carefully sliding off small cliff I end up sliding away from whole mountain and dying...
22377,it really is a great game fun to do solo and even more fun to play with friends. I really recommend this game to everyone who love's adventure and action
22378,yes also get the dino overhaul through workshop

22381,It's a incredible game with a rich lore
22382,yaaa
22383,"I want to play it. I did play it but I had to make room for other games and this one takes a whopping 125gb. The digital equivalent of manspreading. Now wanting to get into it again I have to wait 12 hours just to download it. Well at least you can spend this time to watch tutorials on how to setup this game and how to not die 200 times on a beach holding a rock fighting thirty dinosaurs. Surviving attempt 201 only to find out its farming/grinding for the next 12 hours, more tutorials while watching dinosaurs poop (something the whole game revolves around) Trying to get a giant carnivore 203 times and roaming around the map after having succeeded, nothing can kill you now, refusing to accept it was a drag the whole way. I played 41 hours, Ive downloaded it ones which took 12. Now reinstalling another 12. I've almost spend the same amount of time downloading it as I have played it. Fuck you developers for not compressing the download. Don't waste your time unless you got a few friends already playing."

22419,gaba go
22420,"Wildcard refuses to balance and bugfix this game. They just keep adding crap to the game that isn't fun, like a boat eating whale, theri, and troodon. They also made ptera kibble very difficult to obtain for hidden tribes, and gave heat vision making it impossible to have a hidden base.

play this game pve/solo, or prepare to have months of your time wasted"
22421,died to dinosaur 10/10

22471,"The game is good, very rough if you play officially, but good, and still has a lot of mistakes. Sometimes you can lose hours of effort and nerves due to the bug.Even though I like ark very much, I have to evaluate the game negatively. 
Why? My rating has several reasons.

Let's start with the nice side: The appearance and difficulty of the game have remained virtually unchanged after several years and with several DLCs. Ark offers official servers, but also ""custom servers"" or a single game.You can move freely on the map on dinosaurs. You don't have to teleport ... Oh GENESIS, doesn't belong here (he earned a special paragraph below). Number of dinosaurs and their detailed processing. That has a huge plus. In fact, it would seem that this game is really amazing and flawless. However, despite all this, I like ARK, but evaluate it negatively (there is no other option).

And now the sad part. The complexity of this game does not take into account weaker computers, which is a sad. Unfortunately, the game did not deal with bugs after a few years. (I have the impression that there are more of them).  I recently wanted to tame Giganotosaurus. It took me a while for Giga to fall asleep (single mode). After two hours, domestication was 20%. Suddenly, the tame meter disappeared out of nowhere. What happened was my first question. The dinosaur no longer even showed an animation that it would eat ...After about 5 hours of trying to solve it (but in vain) I decided to kill 150 GIGA (the biggest mistake). The dinosaur died and ARK died with him. So I start the game and we go looking for another GIGA. But the map didn't want to turn on. After a few hours of solution (without results and from the support that will write to you, it will erase the world and solve the problem) I was forced to delete the map, which was played for 150 hours + due to one error with domestication dinosaur (it will no longer leave nerves alone).
And now the famous genesis- I returned these DLCs to the steam after 15 hours of playing. The environment is beautiful, new dino, as are the ""challenges"", if I may call them that. But what bothers me a lot is the teleport. There is no longer free movement of dinosaurs to new locations (mountains, jungles, desert, ...), but you have to teleport to this location. Why? Why the developers destroyed the freedom of movement on the map and largely restricted it by teleporting.

If the rating was between a recommendation and I do not recommend. So I'll pick her.
Unfortunately, all the nice moments in ARK have dark sides. Which I think prevail.
I hope that ARK 2 WILL BE BETTER and there will no longer be such serious bugs and I also hope that people with weaker PCs will be able to play a game that is very nice on the one hand."

22485,"This game is really cool and I would like to play it, But when I bought it I cannot play it cause of the MacOS bit was in 32 and I'm on a update Mac. Can you please update this game for the new Mac update?"
22486,"when you first spawn in you think ""Well i wanna build a giant metal house that has 80 guns on it"" You can do that but you would die say about, hmmmmm, 300 times before doing that, yes its a hard game, its fun, say hi to a baryonix while you're at it, till you get all the stuff just to die due to a pack of 6 raptors that are each high level, but other wise its a good game, enjoy!"
22487,Rust has better pvp but thats it 9/10 fun w/ friends
22488,"Without including DLC on a non-dedicated server with some friends, Ark is fun up until the late game. After a certain point, the game is just doing (literally) nothing and just waiting for progress to be made. To get dinosaurs powerful enough for completing a map, it takes an INCREDIBLY long amount of time, almost all of which involves pressing 2 keys and waiting 6 hours, 50 times?
Ark has a great concept and can be very fun and fufilling as both a sandbox and survival. But, at the point I'm at in the game, I can't say I would recommend Ark. And that's not even considering the bugs or unfair features like alpha enemies, which rely entirely on chance to spawn and if you aren't powerful enough, can completely destroy hours and hours of playtime. 
I'm going to continue playing Ark in hopes of eventually having more fun past the endless taming and breeding of dinosaurs I'm stuck at now, and I do hope that it does get better, because as it stands, I find the game interesting regardless."
22489,"This game sucks so much ballsack it is so laggy and any server you go on there is a bunch of kids that fcking talk so much shit that its coming out both sides. I do not recommend this game because the creatures are so focused around PvE that when you PvP with them they are so fcking broken. There is always a meta creature and everyone abuses it and fcking WildCard dont fix shit. There is so many glitches that people actually use them as base spots and there are little rat holes that people use that are not even supposed to be there, but again WildCard sees this and they decide to not fix. The concept of the game is good it is just the quality makes you puke"

22512,"This game is highly addictive! I've only played it alone or with friends as pve. I've never played pvp, so no opinion on that yet. Playing it alone isn't really fun for me, feels like you're alone in a ghost town. It feels uneasy at times. 

It's not really user intuitive, so it takes a bit to learn the mechanics and how everything works. Once you get down the basics, it becomes very intuitive feeling and super addictive. 

I generally have found that me and my friends start to lose interest just as we're getting close to getting the tech gear stuff. IDK if it's because it's such a huge jump in what you have to grind for and find and by that point who cares if you get tech gear cause you've literally tamed just about everything... I've noticed this is the point that we all start to dwindle off until a new map release or event. 

Definitely recommend if you're prepared to have a slow start but then loose the next 3 months of your life to ark fever obsession :D"
22513,this game os soo good form dinosaurs and to tamimg dinosurs for ride
22514,Nice games. A lot of crafting that can learn. And a lot of places can be explore. It was fun to spend my times.
22515,Love ARK. Been playing it for years. I sometimes go long periods of time away from it but I keep coming back. It's just great fun to play. I could live without some of the updates but it's not worth complaining about.

22534,"What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said. It has dinos, that you can tame or even raise. Bought this for xbox yrs ago before pc life. Pc side runs much smoother and with some quality of life mods, takes away the chore simulator side to it. Have only ever played the pve side to it and it can still be hectic yet you won't come online to find all your stuff gone."

22543,"One of the first games I ever bought when I first started getting into games. I haven't played in a while as of the time I'm writing this review, but it holds a special place in my heart. I love collecting resources, I love taming creatures, I love farming, and I love building. This game has everything wonderful, plus dinosaurs!!  Plus, you can customize not just the graphics, but how easy or difficult the game is depending on how you enjoy playing games. You can make the wild dino's weak or tough, make resources plentiful or scarce, make yourself OP, balanced, or weak as hell, you can mkae taming a huuugggeee time commitment or stupid-easy. It's all up to how you have fun! The game can be glitchy or laggy at some points, which is a bit upsetting, but overall if you have a good computer you should have minimal issues."
22544,GUD
22545,Everything
22546,"I don't have as much time on steam as I do on my Xbox. This game is something that you can come back like every two months like Minecraft and just chill and play it for like a month without worry and have fun, since there will be more and more stuff when you get on."

22548,no
22549,A very off and on game for me. I'm either not playing at all for a while or I'm full sending it.  It's a lot of fun if your in to this kind of game. Lots of amazing boosted unofficial servers with great communities if your a weekend player or only have a short time to play each time.

22560,"Obviously I love the idea of this game or I would not have the sheer amount of hours that I have (Although as i will state later on, many of these hours have been spent troubleshooting a plethora of game issues on or offline). So to start let me fill you in on what this game does right. First we have a massive (and i mean massive) open world filled to the brim with foliage, dinosaurs and neat human structures. The dinosaurs in this world are amazing not only in the sheer diversity of different species but in their interactions with the game (each dinosaur comes with some usefulness to the survivor and can be bred out to make even more powerful dinosaurs for the player to use). The survival and crafting/building aspects were all a huge positive in my eyes as well. In saying this, in no way, shape or form do i recommend this game to anyone in the state it has been since launch. 6 years in beta, multiple paid DLCs and yet here i am still having the same issues that were seen present at the beginning of this games launch, issues that completely derail a players experience in a survival world (not just fun little quirky bugs as all of us see are in all games). Barely playable at best, the so called ShooterGame (as task manager calls it) can't even get the mechanic present in its name right. Hit registration (or the action of the server identifying whether or not your melee or ranged hit lands in game) is quite honestly one of the most laughable aspects of this game. Want to tame that dinosaur but have a finite amount of tranquilliser? Should have brought 10x the amount you need as only a fraction (sometimes literally a fifth of total shots) will register, even when the dinosaur starts to resemble Hellraiser (the game still shows all the unregistered dart hits as if they landed). But mind you this has been present since launch of this beta. And oh i do say beta with a grain of salt as many aspects of this game run like its in alpha or worse. Issues like rubber-banding, connection time outs, rollbacks and player data corruption takes what this game aims to achieve and craps all over it. The sheer amount of hours i have had to spend doing the 10 minute loading to login to a server because i have been kicked out, only to be told that I am already playing in game and can not connect is astounding. I do not jest when i say with this bug alone, nearly 500 of my playing hours come from troubleshooting this issue on my end. Unfortunately this issue has no resolution even in its 6th year of being present, except for waiting 5-10 mins each time this happens for the connection to fully time you out. I don't think i need to stress that in a multiplayer PVP survival game where your character remains in game for all of this time period, that this is not acceptable at all. Fighting other players and lose connection? You are dead and you lost all your stuff on you. Fighting a boss fight and lose connection? You instantly die (as well as all bred tames in said boss fight) and lose all your stuff on you because you crashed. Just tamed some new sweet dinosaur? Nope crash and its been killed while you try to desperately reconnect. Now lets talk rollbacks. See a nice dinosaur and want to tame? Take hours preparing to tame it? Build a brand new base in a sweet spot? Prepped to go into a boss fight? too bad, rollback baby. All that hard work and time just got used to wipe the servers (official and unofficial suffer this the same) arse because its gone and crapped itself for no good reason. Oh here comes rubber-banding though, don't worry guys/gals/other! See that player sneaking around your base and run up behind him to barrel stuff him?  Nope, you may see him at the end of your barrel, but they are actually 7 feet to your left or better yet, already behind you. Now lets talk data corruption. As if all I said previously had never even existed in this game, this issue of data corruption would still see me writing a poor review. Even if you suffer through all the other previously stated garbage this game has to throw at you, you still have a good chance (in single-player or multiplayer) of losing all of your character and/or world progress for no reason other than 'oops we are not sure why'. Seriously.... even famously bugged games like cyberpunk 2077 were more together than this and they got pulled from the market for a bit. Maybe they get away with it because its a ""beta"" (after 6 years). All in all for online it is not good as most of what you could call skill in this game gets replaced by brute force tactic due to these huge ongoing issues. Last point I have off the top of my head that really solidifies this as a no go for purchasing is that single-player has been bugged since the launch of Lost Island map (possibly even genesis 2 map release), to the point where I can not even begin the game offline without an instant crash. So for any of you thinking that you would avoid the majority of issues by staying away from servers, do not worry ark has unique game breaking issues for that too.
Side note for anyone discounting this review due to my computer specs: of all my friends that have played ark, I do have the most basic setup, but then again (even with their 2060 video cards) I lasted the longest playing this game. All of my friends could not stand this game even with great rigs, not because of them not liking the idea of the game but feeling that the execution was just downright shameful for the points stated above.
Other noteable issues:
-stupidly big download for game
-longest verification time for files (due to size of game and verifying files happens often with ark)
-meh graphics
-Poor frame rate
-meshing issues
-online cheating issues
-extremely long loading times to get into single or multiplayer or to really do anything
-server population right now is extremely spread out leaving very few populated servers (30-40 people seems to be the high end for populated servers)

Edit: some people will like this game as there is a reason some still play it and it is not completely dead. However these people are either die hard fans or are like me and keep coming back because we just want it to be good, but also do not want to feel like idiots by having spent money on an unfinished game + DLC. I really did want to get my moneys worth but in my own opinion, this game is a nearly unenjoyable time-sink and every time i come back I am left with the same bad taste that I was left with the last time I took a break from Ark.

Second Edit: Seeing as the game has decent reviews right now, I decided to read quite a number of them. All in all, a majority of these positive reviews are 1-2 line bullcrap about ""hmmm dino gud, yes game gud"" or other i love dino comments with no real substance about what the game puts you through as a player. For the love of God, don't bandwagon with these clearly sarcastic reviews by buying into that nonsense. If you really want to spend money that bad, go buy some gloves and slap some sense into yourself."

22567,breathtaking graphics
22568,"Wonderful game full of dinosaurs and slow paced, but still enjoyable progression. I would suggest playing single player if you dont have hours to dedicate to a play session, or if you can't dedicate at least an hour a day to the game, and use mods when you can. all the new DLC (like genesis, for example) were originally mods that got recreated, but not improved, by the devs."
22569,best game ever
22570,One of the best games to use mods in and it is also very fun to play just vanilla.
22571,"Incredible game. Was absolutely addicted to it. Then got pissed off with the glitches and crashes so i took a break. 

Decided to get back into it and reinstalled it a couple months ago.

Can't wait for it to finish downloading so i can play again!"

22583,"The game is so badly programmed, the hardest enemies spawn in the 'easy' zones and don't play abberation unless you already have riot armour because the ravagers and raptors will instantly kill you, it is truly a terrible game and I wish there would be a remake made instead of ark 2"
22584,Very friendly game. I play it everyday. Love the nature

22593,"this game is 125gb large. how on earth can you make a game so poorly optimized that it's 125gb large. also, if your friend has the game from another store and you use steam, you're out of luck in playing together on a private server. trying to play with your friends is an infuriating experience. optimize your game maybe?"

22597,NICE GAME
22598,Great fun to play alone or with friends. If your starting out I would avoid player heavy servers as it can be frustrating seeing you die over and over and anything you built destroyed. Try easy map area first on a solo game. Multiple dino's to tame with varied levels and much to build/make. Excellent crafting system. Highly recommend that you install on a SSD especially if using MODS.
22599,goodgame

22606,"DYNASAURZ!! 

I've had this game for a few years now and it's come a heck of a long way since then. I appreciate the streamlining of the gameplay and making things a bit more accessible for my poor neolithic brain. That being said, there does seem to be some minor glitches to work out and I feel like newer players may still be a bit lost on how to get started and be dependent on the wiki or other more-experienced players for a while."

22611,"I would only recommend this game (strongly) if you can get a bunch of friends together and get a private server, I would absolutely recommend this game.

This game has a unique term called ""getting ARKed"".  You will experience moment where not only do you get screwed over, but PROFOUNDLY so.  Fortunately, there are some great mods out there that make the pain much more bearable if you're just looking for a game where you can tame dinosaurs, build a base, and just have a great time.

When I started in a private server, with added mods, I had about 250 hours of some frustration and TONS of fun.  This game is a blast, and the modding community can help you curate your experience either by yourself or with friends.

Just do some legwork first beforehand to look up a few things about the game, and look into getting a private server first before you jump into the deep end of public (official) servers."
22612,"-Amazing game, Been playing for about 3-4 years now and i love it..
-It's addicting.
-Has great graphics.
-Challenging at times .
-Great modding community.
-major and minor bugs here and there.
-Huge time sink. (This can be abated by playing on private servers with faster tame time, gathering multipliers, etc.)
-Sometimes Realizing that I meant to log off four hours ago .
-Honestly the satisfaction when you pull off that perfect dino tame.
-10/10 DLCs
-There are absolutely no instructions internally in the game. So your first hour of play may be AWFUL. Once you figure it  out... the game is epic.
-At the end i would rate it 9/10"

It was amazing back then and still amazing now.
There is no other equivalent survival / building game out there.

22692,gud
22693,"This game is all about survival and evolving. I recommend this because it's dinosaurs and other incredible things such as building your own unique base on the mountains. You can as well adventure in the unknown world, you can tame dinosaurs and ride them to the end of the world, discover caves and find awesome and powerful loot to help you in your own journey."
22694,my pc is suffering but i dont give a fuck
22695,simply awesome    play it with friends tho   solo is boring
22696,"I would play this game more if it didn't have a overwhelming presence on my ssd. I would use a hard drive but then things would simply never load into servers, especially with mods. The server browser freezes upon opening and barely works, forcing you to use external websites to browse. Oh also if you play on a cluster, be prepared to download all the maps. With the base game and dlc maps, the game will reach upwards of 300GB on your [strike] hardrive [/strike]..ssd. Though it can be admittedly fun to play for a while, it does get stale pretty quick; Leaving you wondering why you bothered installing this game for 8 hours straight. WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND!"
22697,"Do NOT play Official PvP/SmallTribes servers. Devs/Enforcement do not care about the game. You are quite literally not even safe in your own base/cave/forcefield without the fear of being aimbotted by a fucking railgun shooting 5 shots a second.

Devs really killed official pvp, unofficial pvp servers actually have active admins and enforcement. And those admins are actually aware of the state of their servers and balance items.

Wildcard devs continue to let unhealthy items and dinosaurs plague their game like cancer.

Fuck wildcard"
22698,"The game is very fine to play with friends, but kinda repetitive and Boring if playing alone. I would recomend Joining a server."

22705,"I love Ark. However, it has a ton of issues...
Very glitchy, maps load slowly sometimes, some of the achievements I worked toward did not pop (even though I know I have 100%ed them), sometimes I return nowhere near my bed... etc.
BUT! If you can ignore the problems it will be a blast! The dinosaurs are amazing! Love being able to explore, tame, and hunt with different breeds. 
Haha... I have literally bought this game on Xbox, PS4, and pc. 
-Again, it just sucks if you want to 100% achievements. I have done all of them on everything and am at different percents on each different device because each ones on each thing have there own glitch.
Another one being, on my ps4, I located all of the explorer notes three time and it will only pop the achievement for 50% and lower. While on pc, I got them all easily and it all popped. 

LOVE ARK! Playing with friends is a blast! Although, most of the time I play alone."
22706,big fun
22707,"I highly recommend this game to everyone! There are so many things you can do with it! Its a survival game, has amazing building mechanics (one of my favorites), is a shooter game, and so much more. I have been playing this game for years (on console and finally bought a computer last year so its gotten even better.) I would love to see more people come and enjoy how fun this game is! If you get this game, watch some videos on YouTube on how to play. I have learned so much since I got the game back in 2017/2018. Love love love this game!"

22730,"i like that theres dinos
"
22731,Pretty good I guess.
22732,"I have purchased ARK since the previous year but I have paused playing this game when it's time for school. Now, I have adjusted to the complex Online-Learning system and as such, I have now spared some time trying this awesome game. So far, this is one of the best dinosaur games that I have played since childhood. Humans and Dinosaurs together in an Over-world based game is one of the best things that has existed on this planet. Being able to interact with multiple dinos is the  exciting part, especially taming those that had been popular to the public such as Trikes, Sauropods, and especially Rex. Added with the huge map, there are still things that I have yet to explore even though I have invested a lot of time in this game.

One major setback is how resource extensive this game is. Used up around 200Gb+ with only the island map being played (but with other dlcs purchased). For it to play on higher visuals, it costs a lot of CPU and GPU power just to have that best graphical game play. Overall, it is one of the best games that I have played.

Just a reminder that you'll have to invest most of your time just to tame one dino :D."
22733,"best headache of my life

22734,"This game is based on one simple premise:

Everything Hates You."

22737,"Great game; lots of fun especially with nice people on nice servers. Servers however are horrible, I've been playing the game for years, and there is a LOT of lag almost the entire time; it comes in waves. But still a very fun game."
22738,great game
22739,"Needs better QA before release.  Another hard-core sandboxer.  Overly complicated and kind of juvenile.

Community is still shit."
22740,lit.
22741,Its okay.
22742,good
22743,"Epic game, lots of death if you're careful you can limit this and it can be a great experience."
22744,"The game needs optimization, and they should let pc to have a mode of the mobile version, because it’s really good in a lot of aspects.
Anyway, the pc version by itself - totally worth the money, but if it had better optimization and interface, it would have been worth even more, because sometimes it feels as if the game was not finished development.
The game is addictive, seriously addictive it’s almost dangerous. I really enjoy it and I can play for hours without noticing. So much detail and relaxing experience, yet challenging and fun. It has everything.
But I’m serious when I say it’s addictive, not in a funny way, so be aware, and make sure you take breaks and limit your playtime.
The creators of the game are highly creative and talented."
22745,"Terrible graphics, terrible optimization, boring af alone. Not even the mods can save this game."
22746,"garbage game
"
22747,never gets boring
22748,"Ark can be a lot of different things depending on how you choose to play it. I choose to play it on a private server in a very chill PvE-centric way. There is something special about this game, and there's really nothing else quite like it. It's one of the very few games where I see a place and I want to BE there. I'm pushing 40 and this game brings out my inner 7-yr-old that still just loves dinosaurs."
22749,"funniest game yet, pvp, memes, and chill lmfao
"
22750,Games not bad but 225gb and thats not even with the dlc's installed.. holy shit. maybe ill reinstall it down the road when i buy a second SSD
22751,"fun, but like. Dont get ahead of yourself because trust me its as frustrating as fun. Would only recommend to play if you got friends to play with, but it can still be fun solo. Just my personal opinion. Ark is said to have alot of bugs and glitches but honestly i have played ark for 250+ hours on pc and ALOT longer on PS4 and i havn't really encountered any. Great game. Would 100% recommend and would also recommend to buy ALL DLC's if you like the game. Sicne that just makes it 1000000000000 times better. anyways 11/10 probably one of my 3 favorite games."
22752,gud
22753,yes
22754,"Hmm, yes... Dino"
22755,"this game is alot of fun to play with friends and you can also experiment with mods and commands.
has a very good story and has lots of interesting lore"
22756,its igrat geim
22757,"What can I say I ride Dinosaurs and trash shit, what more can you ask for"
22758,This is my favorite game and I like where it is going for sure. Yes of course there are some bugs but that is with any major game like this. I think the creators get too much beef from others that do not know what it takes to make a game like this. I just want to say thank you and keep up the great work.
22759,"Why is this game rated 82% positive, who cares if it has dinosaurs, who cares if it looks nice, who cares if they release updates a lot, this game makes you say ""bruh"" a lot, the sheer amount of glitches that exist in this game is crazy. This game is known for its crazy unplayable bugs. I have 50 hours in this game, which is not a lot but it is still something, and this is due to the amount of time it takes to load in this trash game, why are the loading screens so long, how is it even permitted to publish a game this unpolished.

There are 400 000 reviews at the time of writing this, and you expect me to think that 82% of those 400 000 who bothered to review the game have NASA computers, like what! You can watch online tutorials or reduce your graphics, but this game is unplayable with most last-gen PCs (Since this game came out when the last-gen PCs came out). 

I know! I figured out why 82% like this game, it's because they saw the dinos and were like ""Wow, I can tame that!"" and just thought a game that incorporates taming is a masterpiece. Why is this game so popular is the real question I should be seeing in the reviews. Additionally, online servers are also unplayable, you cant start because you constantly get killed and even if you get a solid start there always comes someone with nothing better to do, and this person destroys your base, for fun, because he has nothing to do, because he is awake at 5 in the morning when no one is online and destroys peoples bases, not for loot, not to prevent potential competitors, but for fun. If you build a base it will get destroyed overnight without a dought, this game is not fun, this game is trash.

If you are wondering ""why is he being so mean to a game he bought"" or ""why even buy it if it sucks"" and the answer to that is the scam that they are advertising, this game looked so promising in videos and in the trailers, but it sucks. 

I am going to not recommend this game, save your money, patience and time.

But hey if you like this game then please continue liking it but I personally think it should have more negative reviews and it should not be as popular but if you like it then you like it, and good for you (not sarcastically)."

22775,"Though the game is allready some years old. I finally bought it and started to play.  Single player to find out how everything worked and played with the settings etc.  It is a very nice survival game with not a real goal just survive and build a big base :D   Killing world bosses solo with the current level , nah not gonna happen . so when the base is large enough and I got enough of it , i just start over on a different map for example.   

The whole tribe system is something I stay away from. first because Don't like voice in game anymore ( played over a decade of WoW with voice ) and I do not like raids anymore and totaly don;t like PvP , so building together a large base and a great team to defeat the bosses and clear the island, building everywhere outposts etc  and then jump to the next map to do it all over again is the fun I like.

Anyway I do recommned the game as it is a fun game with lots of customisation possibilities."
22776,i love ARK
22777,"This game fuckin sucks, 3 hour on ark but 0 gameplay since i cant even join a server. Just says timeout connection. please tell me how to fix this before a hole appears in my monitor"

22783,"Good game. I had fun playing it on a server that one of my friends owns, it was modded so my entire Ark experience was a modded one so please take that into account. Also I played as a PvE player, personally I don't have much interest in raiding and getting raided by other players. 

I was very impressed that you can tame, breed, and ride just about every creature you find. I had played Conan Exiles in the past and it was a big surprise to me to see how far Ark went in that regard, Conan was much more strict, I loved the collections of Dino's that I built up and bread. It does bring up some balance concerns with how strong they can get. I don't think anything natural in the world can take on one of my fully bread Dino's, whereas in Conan with one of your strongest bread animals boss fights would still be quite the challenge. Ark also lets you have large amounts of Dino'a follow you at once, which is far more than the 2 in Conan, but this also makes me concerned to what might happen when 2 PvP players fought against each other. It sounds awesome but from how optimized the survival games feel these days I wonder how the frame rate would be effected. Maybe it holds up better than I expect but it sounds like it would be cool in theory but a disaster in practice. 

Building was another aspect that I got fairly into and to be honest I think Conan was ultimately superior in this category. In Conan I was able to build vastly more interesting bases than Ark with the different building materials included in Conan's DLC's. What Ark does do better in building is allow you to place buildings in more locations, in Conan you are more likely to get the ""invalid placement"" error. The Conan issue is easier to be fixed with mods in my experience. 

The last main point that I want to touch on is an issue with all survivor games these days. They feel so old. they really could do for a massive overhaul in optimization, and add new mechanics to keep the game more modern feeling. One of my friends honest to god guessed that it was made in 2008, nearly a whole decade earlier than when it was actually released, because it actually feels that old in terms of mechanics. 

Ark 2 is slated for later this year (2022) and hopefully it will be even better than Ark 1. If you are looking to start an Ark 1 playthrough I do recommend it, but with friends, it'll be fun, but maybe wait for a sale, since the game is 5 years old at this point and Ark 2 around the corner."

22804,"So previous review still stands to an extent, especially for any servers with actual PvP which I can only imagine is absolutely heinous. However once I tamed an Argentavis and started getting loot on a server where things were made a bit easier things got more fun later on. It's addicting, possibly too addicting and other than the fact I've wasted hours looking for an otter that never showed up on the lost island it's been relatively fun so far once I stopped being annihilated by even the weakest creatures and started taming things.

Buggy and full of obnoxious gotchas, the game is fun if you're willing to suffer absolute NONSENSE losses all the time. I had a character leveled up and when the server went offline for a reset, all my stats went down more than 30% and I was missing half my stuff I got today. Yet my characters level was the same. So excuse me what?

They put buttons in the middle of places that say upload character and then it DELETES ALL THE STUFF YOU CARRY WITH NO WARNING. Like what does upload to server mean? Is there no user friendliness involved here? They don't seem to maintain anything properly or test the game for bugs before they release updates.  If you want to play a game where it's like Valheim with dinosaurs and other monsters and combat where half the time your arrows do nothing at all before you lose everything because of a server glitch or something then... Well, have fun!

But really, everything I do on this game I feel like their buggy software is programmed to take away and that's not okay. It's not even a game I'm fighting with, it's the bad software. To think I had issues with the software I design from time to time -- This takes the cake. I would never have greenlit merges to the code that made the server shutdown sequence eliminate progress players have made and forget custom settings. Oh, you have a setting that lets people get extra points per level here? Why not go and just delete that when it resets even though the server is set that way. Great idea right? Let everyone log back in with 30% lower stats because you never test rebooting a server with custom settings. Obnoxious. It's not even close to a ""get good"" situation which some of the ""I died to a monster"" situations are. (Even though a lot of the time the combat feels clunkier than a first generation Elder Scrolls game.)

If you know how to avoid all these bugs, I bet you can have fun now and then. But it's really, really, super obnoxious to new players."

22828,"Before you even look at my review just know I've played this game far longer than Steam says I have. I also own this game on Xbox and recently decided I would like to play it on PC. I will say I'm definitely no expert on this game and continue learning more every time I play. That being said... 

Overall I enjoy this game. There's so many different dinosaurs to see with their own strengths and weaknesses. A very diverse map and plenty of grinding to accomplish your goals. 

The issue I have with this game is there's a big learning curve. No tutorial to help new players just starting out. The settings for single player servers suck and it's hard to figure out what settings are ideal so it doesn't take hours to tame a dino but at the same time isn't too easy it's not even fun doing. 

I'd say this game is worth getting and playing but I'd really like to see bigger improvements to the game as far as tutorials, single player settings and better default server setting recommendations based on how difficult you want the game to be for you. There's still so much more potential for this game and I hope it continues to get better."
22829,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR NON-LOCAL MULTIPLAYER

The gameplay has greatly improved and it's super fun once you're in. That being said, my main reason for playing was to play with friends and family over long distance and I've never played a game that's so difficult to actually initiate playing with others. One day you're joining each other's sessions, the next day the join ""fails"" for inexplicable reasons. Sometimes you're loading into a server and then it just ""fails"" when things seemed to be going well (after researching this common issue, this is actually called ""timing out"" as apparently you take too long to load in).

If you're playing single player or local multiplayer, this game is amazing.
If you're trying to play long-distance, the server hosting and joining needs a massive overhaul or to be removed. 99% it, or don't offer it at  all"

22856,"You won't find any other game like this. Yes it has many bugs and is poorly optimized, but honestly, it's really fun to play. I wish the building was better and the dino colour and pattern variety is bland. This game needs better multiplayer if you just want to play with one other person because it has the mechanic of not being able to go a certain distance from the host, which is the most annoying thing ever. It can be better.

Try the game out, it has some story to it. Go explore and build an army. Beat the bosses and finish the game before ARK 2 comes out and hopefully it will fix many things. This game isn't bad, it could be better but it is very addicting."

22867,Not reccomended if you have the attentionspan of a 5 year old.
22868,"There are 2 types of Ark players because there are 2 ways this game can be played. Type 1 Survival: You harvest resources and try to survive in a hostile environment. I never played that way. Type 2 Sandbox/Simulation: You pay for a material and artistic content, aka 3D textured models and atmospheres. I always play only for this reason so the review will talk about that.
I'm writing this at 9 hours here but I had the game on PS4 in the past. The reason why I dropped it in the past was because typing the admin cheats (only way to play the game as a type 2 player) was exhausting without a pc, loading screens were long and the graphic was crippled. The reason why I bough it a second time once I built a pc with a 3080 is because now cheats and stuff are much easier to handle, because I play in max settings on an HDR4k Oled TV and because I still love creatures just like when I was a child.

Let's address the game.

Content: 
Its most shiny part. Creatures are infinite (they are literally hundreds) and you can't even memorise them. They are dinosaurs and mythological creatures. There's everything a lover of creatures would want to encounter and ride. Yes, you ride them. Just think how cool that is! It's a dream come true, a game where you can ride (also in the sea and in the air) literally everything. Dragons, Manticores, Wyverns, Worms, Snakes, Dinosaurs, Griffins, cute creatures, nasty creatures, sea creatures... And all is set in tangled forests, islands, grassy lands... There are jungles, vulcans, seas, structures, shores, mountains, snowy lands, deserts. I always dreamt to be in natural environments such as these and ride any sort of disparate creature AND NOW I CAN! So, this part of the game gets a full 10.

Graphic:
I noticed a serious improvement passing from a PS4 to a 3080. I'm playing everything maxed and I must say that it's much more immersive. Still, there's a lot to say. Everything seems to have been cured equally, this means that plants and the main character are basically at the same level. Debatable decision. I'm a 3rd person fan so I started playing with the character in full view. Big mistake. As soon as I experimented the 1st person I understood that the game looked so much better and much more immersive. That badly shaped human in front of you is just not meant to be, while the rising plants and volumetric grass are. Creatures also look better than humans. As a 3rd person fan i'm not really hurt by this because what matters the most in this game are the creatures and they can still be ridden in 3rd person despite having the character in 1st. Very good. I support this choice. Textures are very nice, even though models and shading systems look old in 2022. I often try this trick to check graphics: I play a game for like 1 hour (something I'm modding or that I'm trying on my new pc) and then open a recent game immediately after to check the impact. Ark looks... Let's say... Up to expectations. You don't really cringe if you are in Max Settings, but you see that many things aren't perfect at all. The overall look, though, is still very pretty. Sometimes creatures could have been coordinated better so as to give more artistic value to these lands. The result of not taking this into consideration is that many places look anonymous or drab. You often see dinos walking against trees or areas that are completely empty. So, yes, it looks good on a high-end setup (pc+tv) but it's not really the most shiny aspect of the game. Still, I want to underline, the elements are SO MANY (especially vegetation and distant lod, including grass lod) that my 3080 handles it by overheating the pc very fast. In some cases I had slight frame rate drops, and there's almost nothing that a 3080 can't do (I talk as someone that has modded Skyrim and The Witcher as much as he could). 

Gameplay: 
As I said, I don't actually play any game mechanic. I'm not interested in having any challenge. I saw the worth of the game in terms of the material/artistic content it could offer and I'm exploiting that as much as I can. As a type 2 player, on Pc, inserting codes isn't messy and exploration is gratifying. What I really can't find is the option to play couch co op (local) in split screen. I could on PS4, why can't I here?! I would like to be able to do that.

So, overall, it's a game that offers a vast content and the purchase is worth it even just for that. Highly suggested to someone in search of a natural paradise (or hell) to seek a refuge in. As for the game mechanics I'm not the right person to refer to, but they don't look attractive, nor stable, nor easy to handle. They actually look pretty boring if you ask me. I hope the next Ark is built more around type 2 than type 1 players. I think that its real worth is in the content rather than in the mechanics."

22876,"Good game, can be frustrating with some bugs but often get patched by committed development team who have a love for the game!"
22877,"It would be a good game if the dev's would spend more time fixing game breaking bugs then making new content with even more problems.

I mean for example a glitch that causes you do die instantaneously for no reason (in a safe location, on solo and multiplayer games and maps), random teleportation to the host, not to mention the fact that most firewall software will react poorly with the games anti cheat software causing connection issues, as well as the game taking 300GB worth of space (including all DLC, about 220GB without).

now don't get me wrong i thing this could be a great game, at the moment i have over 350 hours in ark but i can also say with conviction that half of that time was trying to fix/ work around bugs and glitches that affect the core game play"

Unbelievable grind fest, like you may as well build a house IRL, it's about as much effort as building one in this game.  Brutal, unforgiving combat; it seems like ""skill"" is completely irrelevant at level 50 or lower, where most aggressive dinos will just kill you in about 3 hits, nothing you can do about it.  And then all the toxicity of an online-mmo adds up to present a game that its truly only for the most hardcore player, and even then, you've gotta be a masochist who loves to run back to your body over and over again."

Personally haven't had many issues with bugs but I know a lot of other people have. Lots of the mods are good too, as they add more creatures, weapons, buildings, maps, ect. I would recommend looking at the settings and raising a few before you get started. I would HIGHLY recommend this game for people who like survival games and dinosaurs."

22934,"Amazing game even after all these years, its fun to mess around on with friends, and there is over 10k mods in the workshop to choose from. Definently worth the price!"
22935,good

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Ark: Survival Evolved is a 2017 action-adventure survival video game developed by Studio Wildcard. In the game, players must survive being stranded on one of several maps filled with roaming dinosaurs, fictional fantasy monsters and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] The gameplay is awesome in this game. You get to live in a world with dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. You can make your own base, and tame any dinosaur. Every dinosaur has its unique uses and you can even have some as pets.You start with spears, bows, you know the typical survival games. When you get farther into the game, you get guns, and futuristic type weapons and armor. You do fight against bosses as well. The game has a good amount of content as well. If you get the DLC’s, you will visit new and unique worlds that have awesome creatures that fit that world atmosphere and setting.

[b] Graphics - [/b] The graphics are okay looking. They are not bad, but are getting to the point of aging. The trees are dense and the map can look really dense and immersive. The optimization could be better in some areas in my opinion, but it's not terrible. If you play on low settings, be warned that it looks really bad in this game. I recommend a high settings preset.

[b] Multiplayer - [/b] Ark: Survival Evolve has a good multiplayer system. With a dedicated server, to make your own with friends. If you make a local server, you and your friend can only separate for so long before the game stops you from going any further. I don't like that system, because it feels like they are pushing us to buy our own server, or just join randomly which is a shame. The PVP is pretty fun in this game, but you can find PVE servers which is a good thing.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

23014,Ark: Survival evolved is totally worth it for both single-player and also multiplayer experiences.

"
23018,"IT'S JUST A GREAT GAME, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH."
23019,its alright i guess
23020,Best game ever!
23021,"I spent 300+ hours playing this game. The game is amazing! If you love expedition and building bases, try this game. I grew attachment with my dinos, each biomes got different difficulties and game play. This is so fun playing with friends. I even got a real life architect friend who built our bases HAHA. From small dinos to Giganatosaurus is a great challenge! Once you're done with the lore, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ark: Crystal Isles DLC, you can breed Wyverns and Big Ass Snow Owls! If you like Monster Hunter, I think you will like this too."
23022,"If they'd cleaned up the obscene quantities of glitches this could have been one of the most loved games ever.   As it is, as long as you don't get on official servers it's still a lot of fun.  Between my daughter and I we logged 2000 hours, but I had to get us a private server so I could keep the jerk players off and use admin commands to fix everything whenever glitches took dinos/gear away from us unfairly.  

Again though, 2000 hours...there's something to be said about that."
23023,"Just don't.

I may not have thousands of hours and years of experience, but I've played enough and watched enough to know that this game is not worth your time. You get sucked into it just to get deleted by either a hacker or a megatribe. If you insist on playing, NEVER play official. Play unofficial or singleplayer. Official is riddled with cheaters and megatribes, which makes the game boring and a waste of time. 

Unless you have a lot of skilled friends or really like dinosaurs, save your money."
23024,good
23025,Games awesome once you get the hang of it!!!!!1

and this game more peeps = more fun"
23040,vcx
23041,My world just erased overnight. I'm pissed.
23042,games sucks way to buggy official never wipes so theres no playing that too many cheaters and meshers and they wont ban them but they ban normal players like me :/
23043,"good

23044,"It's a buggy, unoptimized mess. A very fun mess. Do not buy this unless you have a high tolerance for glitches and gamebreaking bugs."
23045,Good lmao
23046,BOB
23047,"Let me Explain. If I would not recommend this game then why do i have nearly 1000 hours in it? This game is Extremely Buggy,   and Addicting. If you think addicting is good well let me tell you. It. Is. NOT. If you play this game then your entire life will be sucked away. I can't say much but I HATE THIS GAME. The problem is I can't end it there. I love this game. It is THE MOST fierce Love hate relationship I know. Don't buy this game if you want to have fun. Buy this game if you want to not be able to leave and slowly have the fun deteriorate forcing you to play with completely game changing mods to have any fun."

23056,"The best dinosaur survival game out there.
You can do whatever you want, travel across multiple worlds, and tame almost every single creature of each world.
Biggest issues with the game is it is very much a make your own adventure game. A giant sandbox of creatures to tame across multiple well worth the money expansions(except maybe Extinction because of its fairly restrictive map).
It being a make your own adventure game is the biggest reason why I don't see myself playing it very much anymore. I miss objectives, reasons to tame certain creatures, reasons to redo bosses(do them once and there's zero reason to ever revisit them), or simply a story to complete across the expansions. I hope ARK 2 add this.

Most of my hours come from ARK's breeding feature, where you take creatures far beyond what should be possible, in terms of stats. And the worst part is it's honestly necessary to do to be able to deal with the game's poorly coded/designed bosses. There's no real difficulty with the actual bosses, except the fact that you just need a ton of stats on your creatures and great saddles. There are no gimmicks to each boss(unless you see a fire breath attack, dealing DoT damage, as a gimmick. I see it as poor difficulty design).

I played majority of my hours on private servers and I would highly recommend you find a good place to play, with an active community or simply play with your friends alone, rather than attempt to play on Official Servers. The gathering rates, breeding rates, taming rates, are terrible on Official Servers, and the amount of inactive players and their left behind structures will drag down your performance and enjoyment.

I recommend the game to any fan of dinosaur games as it is by far the best out there, even if it strays away from the primitive dinosaur only side of the game quite fast after the base game. First expansion goes straight into the realm of fantasy, with Wyverns, Deathworms, etc. but if you can live with fantasy creatures, even better."
23057,"The first time I played multiplayer I was placed into a cage, called multiple slurs, and tortured. 

6/10"
23058,THIS GAME FUCKING BLOWS
23059,its a fun game you can play with your friends

23062,nice game

23064,pretty cool
23065,Great game
23066,"This game is the bane of my existence. No matter how hard I try, I can't get laid. It's all because of this game. I know it isn't helping me in any way, but I can't stop."
23067,dsds
23068,"good.
wildcard neglects all the bugs and keeps adding new features.
theres nowhere where i could find a place to purchase the DLCs separately from the whole pack, and genesis1&2 cost as much as the package with all the rest of the DLCs.
but good."
23069,"Jesus fuck it is BUGGY as hell and it'll make even the best of computers laggy, but it is such a fun game. Like all survivals, there's a big learning curve and is unforgiving in the beginning but play with friends for an enjoyable experience. Actions have consequences so if you play recklessly, expect that it can and probably will go wrong. 

Private servers are significantly better than public-- they get toxic fast."
23070,A fun game I enjoy hopping back in to every now and again when I want to suffer at the teeth of dinos! xD seriously a good game though.
23071,I got f-ed by a reaper and gave birth 10/10
23072,fun game
23073,"everything dieing is obnoxious, not hard. i can't find a mod to fix this. i don't want a creature that will die in seconds for a dumb reason, like decided to stand in fire, and did not get off until dead. did not get out of river even though being attacked by fish. did not even fight back in that case. stood too close behind me while i was mining, and died. there is no save system, so, there is no undoing stupid deaths."
23074,It’s a super good game but it lags my pc out so much i can’t play half of the time
23075,Tame dinosaurs...what else can I say...
23076,"Ilovebenis
"
23077,"You have big dino, and small dino they both eat you, you get frustrated go sleep, then wake up and play again
Buy it!"
23078,it is an action pact game that you can play were you can tame dinos an pvp people
23079,"This game is a rlly fun dino taming,fighting multi or singleplayer game i'd recomend it to al of u no cap"
23080,yes
23081,"Quite the fun game to play with some buddies! I've never played on live servers so I can't really speak for those.. but if you download a few quality of life mods and make up some fun server rules with your buddies this game is a blast! Huge fan of the dino breeding and getting really cool colored dinos, brings shiny pokemon vibes when they hatch. Would definitely recommend for anyone that enjoys a more casual base building survival style of game."
23082,Relly nice end for the most part well done game. Offers the player to not only play PvE but also PvP
23083,rawr
23084,fun
23085,if you love dinos this is the game for you
23086,"Best survival game I've played - Breeding, Building, Exploring, Story and Boss fights."
23087,on singleplayer your data will get deleted a lot
23088,lol
23089,cool tbh
23090,"I've played this game A LOT and is still playing!
I mainly play on private servers with mods and its packed full of content and things to do.
The workshop is amazing, and the makers of ark who buy rights of workshop makers to implement their own work is awesome to me.
Sure there are glitches or bugs, but what games don't have them at all?
Loading a server with mods (depending on how many) can take a few more minutes than you'd like, but if your PC is old or lacks decent specs, i can imagine why. It does run high though, i normally play in very low graphics but that doesnt take the detail out of the game much, but helps with framerate when you have 100 broodmothers firing around O_O"
23091,GG
23092,good game for some reason
23093,+
23094,"absolute trash game, there are some things i find fun but every time I try to go back to the game it decides that it will be the best game and kill the player nonstop. waste of time and money. this game it really worth nothing cus you just cant play it and have fun. there is no such thing as play ark and relax cus you are always at the edge of your seat worrying about 1 single raptor that decides to follow the crap code the devs wrote and get stuck inside the players hitbox and kill them, wow thanks game! thats fair! DO NOT BUY."
23095,good game
23096,good
23097,bought the game to try the mods 12 hours later still havent played even for a minute if u got time and a live to waste than i would recommend...

23107,ark is a really fun game but if you want to fight some of the alpha bosses its a bit time consuming just trying to get mutations for melee and health but I do recommend this game since its really fun other than the waiting
23108,Love it.

23127,great game no lie not enough dodos tho
23128,"The game is alot of fun but there are a few things about the game that make me have to give it a negative review. one thing is the player tether.....you have a certain distance you can go from the person who started the server. yes you can increase it but then you have a chance of the game bugging out. Case in point, playing on my family's server on crystal isles, I was flying a dragon looking for metal. All of a sudden it came up saying ""you are too far from the host"" and teleported me back to the base where the host was but not the dragon. It was just gone from the game. Also Some area's of the game the redwood forest for once, I was flying right next to the host of the server and it kept saying ""out of range of host"" and teleporting me directly under them. I am hoping that part 2 is much better then this, but after years of this game being out and still finding these bugs, I am losing faith that ark 2 will be any better."
23129,Fun with friends
23130,"This game helps me disassociate, i need to go outside....but i have no time, only ark...."
23131,is good
23132,Absolutely sucks. Mid tier game for sure.
23133,Many hours on ps5 so much better on pc mods make this a trully amazing game where you never run out of things to do.
23134,very fun
23135,Its Amazing
23136,Its so fun and addicting 100 % recommend
23137,"it is a nice pvp and pve gave and if you play on steam you can play with mods
"
23138,with mods this game is godly
23139,yes
23140,Prefers to make more DLC than actually fixing the game. Definitely one of the worst game companies out there
23141,Fun

23152,"iZ GOOD! iZ HARD! dINO'S KILL ME ALOT! I get strong and murks them! I hit them in the head and then give them stockholm syndrome. Then they die anyways. 11/5 would not reccomend skipping it unless you don't enjoy pain you sick masochist. Also, fun with friends. :)"
23153,Great Game. I started on the scorched earth map and it is hell to start up and get going but thats the fun of the game 8.5/10
23154,piim
23155,it good
23156,NIce fucking GamE!? The Genesis Expansion pack story goes on to say that the simulation has glitches. The story evolves around glitches. The glitches are the Explorer notes in normal ark they give you a XP boost and some lvl. I think the game developers made the game then made the story line because the bug amount that i have f***ing seen is tremendous the last bug that i had was of me taming a Blood-stalker then getting attacked by a sarco then out of nowhere i just die my friend  that's crafting at our base just dies and when we re spawn none of our body nor our loot is there Whoosh gone :D. My tame no where to be found. It was a disaster. I think the Genesis developers are just meta gaming and put many real  many glitches in the game.
23157,"Love the game.  Has great variety and your whit can make you last for another day.

23239,gresat game
23240,good game to play with freind from 2 - 5 people but any more and it gets so unorganized its hard to keep track of things but otherwise its great.
23241,verrry cool
23242,
23243,its one of the best games ive played so far tbh its pretty chill playing solo online or offline and its better when you make a server for friends and you can all play together theres so much to do with every dlc its a different adventure
23244,sure
23245,"Good game, fun, great to play with friends, the bosses are to over powered tho, it can take years to prepare for and beat them, i would recommend playing on modded servers instead of the official ones."
23246,This game is amazing if you like to tame dinosaurs and battle with other players build bases and fight bosses this is the game for you! If you also like to sometimes see the derpiest things happen that are unrealistic and hilarious then get this game it is super fun if I'm being all honest.
23247,100 hrs and only tame liked 5 dinos good game tho

23251,"People cry and people cheat consistently , you will be better off making your own server and playing with friends. The multiplayer is so bad it will make you addicted to the pain and suffering rather than trying a new game. It will be more fun if you experience the game with people you like anyway. Its a great game, if you just want to have fun you are not meant for PVP servers."

23278,Prefect with s+ and dino storage
23279,"What an utter dumpster fire of a game. had to clear a third of my hard drive to make room for this hard drive hog. Bought this game with the intention of joining a session friends were on. Tried searching for it under map, name, mods unofficial session all that, everything they told me to do. Their session never showed ONCE after searching and waiting searching and waiting and searching and waiting...

finally decided to try some rando 'official' server... and i die within seconds of spawning in one of the 'easy start' areas. Hit respawn, and appeared in some random area nowhere near where i died, without any of the grossly littl;e resources i did get, only to get attacked and die before even fully spawning. Dino just saw me and ate me before i moved FIVE FEET.

The hunger and thirst meters deplete WAY too fast, so youre constantly bashing bushes just to get enough berries to NOT DIE... but none of it matters.

Unless you're a masochist, don't buy this piece of sh**. I probably logged too much 'play time' just trying to find my friends' session to get a refund...

23293,bdxbxcbxcb
23294,"Wasn't great, but might be better with friends"
23295,"I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves dinosaurs and a rust-like survival game. The PvP can get a bit heated at times, but both the PvP and PvE are very rewarding and fun. If you plan on playing official servers, make sure to have a decent group of people, because the grind is insane. If you can find a server with even a 5x tame or gather boost, I recommend that highly.
If you're looking for a decent unofficial PvP server to get started on, I've been playing on Korangar on and off for a few years, and would definitely recommend. It's died down quite a bit, so you don't run into a ton of people and you can play how you'd like.
I haven't beaten the game, I've never been able to stay dedicated long enough to complete the bosses on one world, much less the expansions. Regardless of that, it's the game in my library with the most hours, so I obviously have fun either way, and you would too."

23306,aaaaaa
23307,"So yeah, I like this game. I got it back in 2014ish, and I hated it. It was brutal, graphics were piss poor and I had no idea what to do. It was my first survival game. I took on many titles, then came back to this one with a few friends, rented our own server and I ""got good"". I fell in love with it! We built a castle on the beach, with a drawbridge, had dragons and trex as guards. It was beautiful,...then we went to a new map, and it sucked. Everyone died all the time, we hated it and went on to new titles. But...but...I tried a new map and it was right back to endless taming and building. So if you get this game, and do not like it after a 10 hour ""trial"", try a different map, try mods, do not play alone. Find a server or join some friends if you can afford them, and fucking enjoy this game."
23308,fun

23341,amazing
23342,"Great game!
"
23343,"I've got over 4,700 hours in this game at this point and figured Id write a quick review. 
This game is not for those who are frustrated with having shit go out of your control is random ways.
However, if you don't mind losing your shit sometimes even in single player then you will adore this game.
It has an immense amount to offer.

Pros:
-Great Story that you have to find yourself to follow, so its not pushed in your face if you don't care about it.
-Tons of creative ability.
--Breeding/Taming/Mutations are a blast
--Building with some of the many mods is also a blast
-The devs love their modding community. This means we get a lot of nice maps and sponsored mods.
-Lots of maps even for free.
-Both tek and primitive item sets and ways to play
-Amazing graphics
-Fun progression and grind
-Official PVE was a delight when I used to do that. We worked together as a community in the game.
-Fun boss fights and the Islands Tek Cave in the volcano is fun to complete for your first ascension.

Cons:
-Ark will F you constantly. 
--Random Dino attacking the thing you're taming because for some reason it hopped off a cliff chasing something else and thought your tame looked like easier prey than the thing it was chasing and F'd the effectiveness to the point you need to either put the thing down and try to find a new one or let it wake up and waste more hours of your life.
--Falling through the map on Aberration because you had the audacity to ride a Basilisk over some terrain decor.
--Why am I falling from the sky when I logged in and now dead on my roof?
--Icthyornis stole all my prime again on the way to my tame.
-Graphics come with a huge performance cost and lesser rigs wont be able to run this on max.
-You know what? Just Pego's and Icthy's in general. CON.
-Later DLC's made for group play and not necessarily solo so much


I should mention I have played since early access. Back when my favorite dino the Allosaurus was added and for some reason had the ability to spawn inside bases and I happened to build on top of one of their spawns. It was chaos on official but this game has brought me countless hours of joy and I honestly couldn't recommend it more. I stopped official play when Extinction came out and have solo played since then and am still enjoying the game.

IF you don't mind a game that has no regard for your sanity.
Then load this up!!!"
23344,in my opinion its on of the best survival games
23345,ah yhes dinos
23346,"I have played this game for WAY too many hours. It is definitely time well spent. Is there still issues with the game? Sure. But is it fun? Yes. I would suggest not playing without at least a couple of quality of life mods. Especially when it comes to building. The vanilla building is terrible. And definitely adjust some sliders unless you enjoy waiting hours to tame something or hours just to build a tiny hut. Like any survival game, it can be frustrating to start out and learn everything. There is a lot to learn. But the beauty of the internet is there are so many videos to help you get started.  And  btw, this about PvE because I don't play PvP. Ain't got time for that.

Ps... wait to buy it on sale since Ark 2 will be out soon and they will be ending the events at the end of this year (2022)"
23347,no
23348,"best

23349,Dino game go burrrrrrrrr

 And now its free. Of course it is."
23352,nigger game cant even start
23353,"Pretty ok game. Lots of bugs, bad pvp, and decent PVE.

EDIT: Oh my god mods make this game so much better 8/10 rather than like a 6.25/10"
23354,"Corrupted System WildCrad fell down , stupid game really , it was good back then now its shit , you get meshed + you get aimbotted stupid"
23355,"Very fun, must have a decent PC to run other wise it is a bad experience"
23356,
23357,"This game is bad, just dont play it if you want to play online. But if you want to play singelplayer then it is alright but online is just shit. If you dont have the newest dlc then you are fucked. You can just install mods and still get it. But it is not worth it. You have to put a lot of hours in to the game if you want to play on offical servers, but you can play unofficial servers but nobody plays them."
23358,Its fun
23359,jkdkjlms
23360,"i would recommend this game to othere people as it might seem like a bad game at first but once you get it you can see that it is the beast open world dinosaur survival game out there and the fact that it allows players to choose what game mode to play as it has the normal mode and you can get mods to spice things up and the constant updates on the game shows how much the developers care about the game and it's community. The price might seem to much but with every event in real life (or in the game) the price drops significantly (example. I got the game on ester when it was for £9.99 ) 

THAT i s why i recommend this game to otheres  especially people who enjoy open word dinosaur survival"
23361,good
23362,super fun till you get wiped off the face of the earth with no chance of survival...

it's too bad that Console and PS4 players can't enjoy mods, I hope that will change soon

And with Ark 2 coming soon it gonna get even more hype! :P"

23377,fun
23378,"If you like grindy difficult games, you'll love ark. The maps and dungeons are beautifully designed, the tribute/boss system is great, i have like 5000+ hours on ps4+pc and i still havent beat the game. It's very unforgiving and there's alot of live and learn situations where you'll lose almost everything, but if you persevere (have a backup base, raise babies as expendables and keep your parent dino's safe, use sleeping bags often, and remember where you died.) You'll have a more enjoyable experience the next time you spawn, there is still bugs and lag, the game is known for it, all the grinds of finding rare perfect tames, breeding dino's for stat increases and color combinations, building huge bases, and looking forward to all the crazy bosses and dungeons keep you invested for months.

I've never had more fun in a video game playing Ark pvp official in beta, i spent the first couple weeks solo just knocking people out on the beach and jailing them in my base, cuffing them and keeping them alive for real life days, saying good morning to my prisoners and having my parasaurs poop on them, it was amazing. Unfortunately pve is the way to go nowadays since the meta is known and theres alot of cheaters now as like any pc game that eventually gets ruined by hacks/cheats."
23379,no this game sucks
23380,good
23381,A+ 9.2/10
23382,Dinosaurs are badass and there is always new ones being added. Ignore all the glitches and clipping through walls. shooting rockets through dead dino bodies and you have a half decent game.
23383,It's a fresh take on Survival games. Always had me on my toes.
23384,iz gud
23385,fun game
23386,Good PvP game.

23404,fun sandbox
23405,this game hurts to play
23406,"The game's just plain awesome dude. Obviously there's a huge amount of bugs n shit that need to be fixed, and the updates need to be slowed down because holy shit, but otherwise I genuinely love it. So fun, stressful asf but that's what makes it thrilling, etc. You can feel adrenaline playing this game and I recommend it, even as a person with anxiety, it's still my favourite game to play despite how scared shitless I can get over losing just one otter named Brownie.

Overall, great game, needs some improvement though. But I love it. <3 :)

23416,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, go below, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
23417,I love the dino hunt
23418,the game is good
23419,Good Game
23420,game is a game that is a fun game
23421,it is fun there is toxic players but play this if you can hanndle a lot of toxicness.
23422,hg
23423,"its very fun with friends i recommend it 
"
23424,"I love survival games. This game goes into detail
If you played rust, you get used to the game pretty quickly
It is interesting that this game combines the primitive with the technology
It is an evolution from stone tools to alien weapons
It is true that the game is quite difficult, and it is difficult to understand when you are a new player, but it is the most fun to discover the difficulties of this survival"
23425,buggy mess of a game with the most consistent inconsistent timeouts when joining a friend.
23426,"I've been searching 2 days for one fucking animal for some shitty material, my Megatherium decided to just walk out of there and hit the ground face first. Some bats in a corner devoured me to pieces and that was another day well spent on ARK"

23431,"Game is riddled with cheaters using minimal to high level hacks such as aim bot, Esp, speed hacks, god mode. Wildcard do not have any plans or motivation to stop these issues. Ark had its day probably 5-7 years ago but now its a complete waste of your time when cheaters come and wipe everything you worked so hard for. If you want to PVE then yeh great it'll probably be Ok for you, but pvp is a no go."

23439,"So, I'd pick it up IF IT GOES ON SALE. $9 for this game is about right. As far as a rating goes, maybe 5/10. 

There is a significant amount of content that feels patched and stitched together, instead of having one cohesive game. Even some of the settings and configurations for the game don't have a consistent pattern. There is also a lot in the game that isn't explained or described intuitively - not that you can't figure it out, it's just not very intuitive and usually requires looking up a guide online to save an hour or three of your time.

-----

To elaborate:
The building mechanics are, well, not broken, but not exactly polished either. On more than one occasion I've found myself frustrated with the fact that nothing will snap together correctly, and (as far as I can tell) the game will randomly decide if you are in a shelter or not, often leading to rain coming through your ceiling (this may have to do with the poorly built snapping mechanic for construction). Walls snap to stairs, but the stair height from one level to the next is different than the height of the wall from one level to the next, leaving odd looking gaps when trying to build a second floor. 

Dinos, while really neat, are often just as weird and ""unpolished"". I've seen dinosaurs get stuck on thin air, which required rebooting the server to fix. Dino behavior is almost always aggressive, as it should be, but leads to unintended (and often annoying) behaviors with tamed ones. On multiple occasions we have had dinos that ignore commands completely and get themselves killed trying to attack something too large.  

The survival mechanics are there, but feel stitched together. Characters overheating is a constant issue, though maybe I just haven't figured out that mechanic yet. That said, 10+ hours in, I feel like I should be able to - relating back to my statement about the game not being intuitive.

Lastly, the UI elements and interaction menus still need some serious work. There are a lot of situations that could have been solved with some default actions or a simple ""E"" prompt to interact. I have no desire to have the ""change pass code"" function be the default action if I'm a half-step further away from my container than usual, and there isn't any reason I need to see the health, owner, tribe, and status of a container on my UI unless one of those things would interfere with normal usage. I also don't need to have the ""LEVEL UP AVAILABLE"" at the top of my screen if I have an icon on the right that indicates that same thing - again, leading back to my statement of how this feels patched together.

-----

All in all, it feels like a game that never really got out of the ""experimental"" phase. For $9, it's not a bad buy and will keep you preoccupied with all of the content that it comes with."
23440,"Great game, but way to many bugs and jank. Don't expect to have a smooth play through. But besides that, it's fun."
23441,"Amazing game, lots of things to do with great graphics and many animals."
23442,this game is nice you have a lot mods to choose from and tame a lot of different dinosaurs. I would suggest playing this game because its a lot of fun.Its expensive but i recommend buying it on sales.

I recommend searching for other dinosaur games if you wanted to play as the dinosaur, though."
23449,"it is goo

23450,"i played a lot more if you consider my old account and my playstation since i started like almost 5 yrs ago (2500+ hours) and i still love this game and if u get bored of solo go on pvp servers or the other way around
it has a lot of very different and fun in their unique ways dlc's and its even better with friends, it has countless creatures and dont forget about mods... they can change ur game to a hardcore realistic survival one or to an insane expirience with planet size god-like creatures."

23452,IT S SO GOD GAME
23453,This game is the gr8 game of all time i no cap
23454,its awesome
23455,very fun
23456,This game is perfect. There is absolutely no bugs in this game. Would recomend
23457,"I have played this game for quite a while now. I think that I can give an honest review.

So the platform is quite unstable and has a problem with crashing the server and you will lose dinos and gear if you are killed when it happens. This is a major down for the game. "" ON PUBLIC OFFICIAL SERVERS "" On private paid servers like PING. Awesome play time with zero lag.

Public PVE maps. Well they can get crowded and you might have a hard time finding a place to build a base. Some are quite toxic about you joining the server and will set pillars around your base so you can't finish building. But then you will find some that will help you all the way to the top.

There is absolutely no end to this game. Between building and catching dinos and breeding them to make more powerful dinos. You will not get bored. However remember that there are decay timers on structures you build if you don't log on in a certain amount of days it will go away.

Even with all that being said I have logged over 3600 hours of game play on this game and I just can't get enough. Even when you just get bored of a map. That's okay, pack up and change maps lol.

Have a great time and I hope you enjoy your experience. I know I did."
23458,nice game heavily pointed towards dinosaurs taming to survive. Hard on easy settings :D .. 7000hrs Diablo --4000 in PoE ...
23459,great game
23460,I enjoyed the game. It was really fun to tame and battle dinosaurs. The game can sometimes be frustrating especially when your dinos die but overall its a great game.

23583,"Definitely a game that require lots of time on your hand. Especially if you play multiplayer where the game continues while you sleep. so the more you sleep, the more the game pass. this is like a second life haha. I love all the dino taming, breeding and raising. making your own base is also fun but frustrating if some enemy comes and destroy what you made. but singleplayer makes you lonely. not to mention the time taken to do everything. I had a lot of fun when i played though i had stopped playing since i don't have much time on the hand. but if i do, i'd definitely come back and play for weeks haha."
23584,Better than porn
23585,good game with lots of creatures to be tamed
23586,"I have like 200 hrs on this game on my playstation and its an absolute 10/10 once you get into it. And thats the hard part. Everything can be extremely confusing and the first few hours are painful. But after that, its great. Theres always something to do and the complexity of everything can be extremely fun. 
Clear recommend, give it a chance!"
23587,you gotta be kidding...125GB game itself but you need extra space around 150 GB to download map and other pack. Drive sucker!
23588,"I love it. I love it soooo much. Was never much of a dinosaur gal before, but this game increased my interest in them tenfold."
23589,Such a good game just taming dinosaurs and taking on bosses with them is just so fun i would 100% recommend this game to people who are looking for something to buy
23590,"good game haven't played it nearly as much as other people but if your into games that have a lot of grinding the you haven't played ark
"
23591,i love the game ive put countless hours into it and i continue to put more into it but if you have a bad computer or hate that the games takes forever to load id advise not getting it. its a heavy game thats not optimized well even if you turn everything to the lowest setting but is a fun game with all the maps you can choose from and all the dinos i find myself starting over a few times to experience it all again or going for bigger and crazier projects

Direction. The first 5 minutes of game play consisted of picking up berries, running around and my dude defecating accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Thanks. Now how do I play this game? No direction on what to do. No prompts. No map markers. No objectives. At least tell me the keybindings....Luckily, I got frustrated in the first 2 hours so I was able to refund it on steam. Don't buy this game."

23671,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
23672,Really good game.

23682,"Cant stop playing this shit, I love it."
23683,"I really enjoy playing this game. It's open world you can build just about anywhere, and come on it has dinosaurs, so you can't beat that."
23684,"Its a great game and very immersive, ive had allot of fun playing it and always come back to it. Even after many years!"
23685,this shit slaps
23686,some tribe traumatized me the boled me and made me have sex with 17 dodos then some how after being in there basment for 17 hours i gave birth to a giganorantasauris then they let me free and killed me 2 seconds after i was free from theyre torment just to give me false hope im writing this wile dodoes are inpregnating me and ther weirdes part is im a boy
23687,"I dont want to keep this too long, but i feel like there are a lot of things that have to be said about this game.
First off, on this account i have around 6.5k hours, 2.5k on another and 1k more on epic games. All of that adds up to around 10k hours of gameplay in: modded, vanilla boosted rates and mostly official 1x

If you are looking for a game to just play with a group of friends on a private server, this can be pretty fun to get into and build your own little world.

Just be prepared for:
-an incredible amount of bugs and glitches
-high performance requirements
-a lot of lag
-the game crashing more than once in an hour
-a lot of boring farming
-around 300GBs of space, going up to even 450GBs if you plan on playing with mods
-more unexplainable stupid things happening during your gameplay

In fact, i wouldnt recommend playing it at all if you are planning to go on the official 1x cluster, because the game is simply broken and the developers dont care at all about the state of the game.

The official 1x cluster is basically just a lot of cheating, meaning you will get aimbotted, enemy dinos are moving and turning too fast, people go through walls to get into your base, there is an incredible amount of resources and the ""ingame currencies"" going around due to exploits that let people duplicate items. Every patch or release something else gets messed up and becomes broken, new dinos that are released are either too strong or too weak and stay that way for weeks since the developers are too lazy to fix anything quick enough. 
Sometimes the developers disable the server transfers if they messed something up and then roll back to an earlier state of the server save, reverting anything you have done during the time of disabled transfers. Very recently there have been cases of tamed dinos disappearing randomly on every server and they took a few days to revert the issue.

If you happened to travel anything to those broken servers that was important to you, the server would be reverted to before you traveled your items there and they were deleted basically. Happened to me too. Lost a lot of stuff on that already. 
Their ""upload"" and ""transfer"" system between servers is utterly messed up and under-developed.

This is a great transition to the next thing that is making this game absolutely unplayable: The developers themselves.
One of the developers called ""Dollie"" has around 100 hours in ARK on her steam account... the game she is supposed to develop properly.... how can she have any idea of how their implemented creatures and items will work out if she doesnt even play the game herself to begin with and doesnt know the meta? There have even been cases of head developers and people that work in the support abusing their admin powers ingame to help certain big tribes and spawn in items, blueprints and even dinos for them. So much to the ""fairness"" and ""state"" of the game. 

Speaking of big tribes, which are called ""megatribes"" since they have built up on multiple servers, basically owning them and consisting of hundreds of people. These megatribes form alliances which then consist of thousands of members and then end up going to war against other alliances. All while cheating and exploiting.
If you are a new player that wants to have a fresh start on a vanilla server 1x, these will be your biggest enemy. If you happen to spawn on one of their servers, there is a chance the tribe has blocked every single possibility for you to get off the server, meaning you are stuck there - forever, if you cant run around the map to find another way that they havent blocked off yet. Which is pretty hard to do when you are on a level 1 character that has no movespeed or health and there is aggressive dinosaurs running all around the map. You will have to simply exit to main menu, make a new character on another server and hope that one is easier to escape or not taken at all. Until you eventually take your character you spent hours to level up and accidently go to another server that is blocked again, making you lose your high level character. Sometimes they cage you and keep you in their base forever.

If you happen to get into one of those megatribes and you spend hours and hours of obtaining your personal items, riches and raising your dinos (which each take at least 3 days to raise on average with you having to come online every 8 hours to ""imprint"" them and make them stronger.), the game might be fun for a little while. But let me tell you this, there are three ways this can play out:
1. You get insided, basically someone in your tribe made a deal with another tribe and turns off all your defenses, making you an easy raid for your enemies and you lose everything that you built up.
2. You get raided by cheating people, that shoot through walls and keep killing you, keeping you on a respawn timer while they can start taking down your defenses, taking their sweet time while you keep getting aimbotted and killed. Or they just go through walls and ceilings, the map itself to begin with and turn off everything from the inside while you cant do anything. Maybe they simply get inside, steal all your loot and dont do anything else. So you are left with a base but nothing to defend it with. TL DR: Lots of cheaters will raid you
3. The developers themselves wipe you. Yes you heard right, they will come, randomly, because they heard some rumors about you cheating, got sent edited screenshots, or a single person in your tribe did something to break terms of service.
They will join your server, go to your base and they will type one command. You will die, losing everything you have on you and then your base will start to despawn and all your items and dinos with it. There have even been rumors about people/big tribes paying the developers to wipe an enemy of theirs.

^I have seen all three possibilities happen and it has happened to me. And i have lost a lot of items i spent hours getting and dinos that i spend multiple days raising, having to hop online every 6-8 hours to ""imprint"" them. Because on the official 1x clusters only 100% imprinted dinos will be useful. Some dinosaurs take 10 days to raise. You have to take care of them for 10 days every 8 hours and they can simply die from a cheating player or you lose them due to the already mentioned issues with the ""upload"" and ""transfer"" system.

And the community isnt better either, as you could see from the so called ""insiders"" that will destroy your base from the inside. If you trade with other players from other tribes and servers for valuable items there is a 90% chance you get scammed if you arent careful and have no information about them.
Sometimes your server will also get ddosed by your enemies and it will become unplayable with an incredibly high ping, maybe even crash and stay down for days on end without the developers booting it back up.

Big tribe wars are basically a big waste of time. You get on a server after pressing the join button for 3 hours straight since the server has 70/70 people on it and then play in extreme lag, rubberbanding back to a positon your character has been in 2 minutes ago. And if you are close to raiding someone's base by destroying their defenses, they will ddos the server, make it crash and roll back to before you did the damage.

If you try to report the cheating tribes/people by making a ticket on the support site there is probably a 1% chance that anything will happen. I have created countless of tickets myself adding proof through screenshots or videos to it. The only thing i have gotten back is a copied text saying they will do something but cant give info on the situation. (Nothing happens)

This is still only a fraction of what i have seen and experienced in this game. For your sanity, your health, your friends and family its probably the best if you just keep your hands off of this mess of a game. Play it with your friends on a private server and be ready for the worst to happen."

23697,"Overall a very fun game to play and with this stunning graphics also the community supports are great with lots of mods over all a ""Good Game""."
23698,very fun game check it out
23699,"Let me preface with this; My machine has no trouble with any other game I've thrown at it; and over the years I've sunk over 1k hours into this game, from early access to last year. But I literally can't anymore, even when I want to. 

- Game now takes up 303GB. 
- Crashes consistently. 
- Runs like garbage. 
- Takes ages to load. 
- Updates frequently and bloats game size. 
- Has at least several bugs that have been around for years now, which hinder gameplay to varying degrees. 

The fact that the application name in the Task Manager still says ""Shooter Game"" should be enough to steer anyone away from this, what is clearly an unoptimized, poorly made money grab. 
Wildcard constantly pushing for more and more content which is just bloating the game further, rather than refining what they already have."

23770,"Ark like any good parasite enters to you through pleasant sensations, but the more you play it the more it absorbs you,
everything is out for you, the animals are jerks... the weather is hazardous to say the least, but amongs all, the worst of it
is the players, players will do everything to make your life miserable, from kidnapping you and making you eat shit (literally)

we have lots of cool animals, but also bullshit animals that never existed that are the most op in the game and hard to get too, dragons... griffins... laser t-rexes.... forget about the dinasaurs we will add anything , anything a player could dream of because of money.

but lets not forget about the parasite, ark the parasite will do anything in its power to make you forget you have a life out of it demanding your constant attention to watch over your dinasaurs, babies of your dinasaurs.... your base.... 

only for it to be all destroyed randomly by the alpha of the server the day he feels like whiping everyone because Ark is also a sub dom power play...

Bugs wich are very present are not an issue in the game play at all

23881,This game had a lot of potential and when i started playing I had lowerd my expectations to what I tought was the lowest posible. This game doesn't fail at disapointing you. Farm 40 hours and get killed by level 2 shitozavar and then get told by your level 97 friend that you are doing pretty good for a new player while you have just made your first sword and he has a fucking sniper. AND on top of that the server that I MYSELF paid to host doesn't in the stupid server list no mater how i search for it. Don't try to give an advice about this because the server just dicides on its own when to show and when not to.
23882,"maybe

23897,good game
23898,"I think this game is good, you can explore the world, tame creatures that don't exist in the real world. And if your a fan of dinosaurs (like me) then you will have a great expierance and this is without the mods. Mods are even better you can; be a dino, have good gear and even more, also its really easy to get mods. This is my I think its good"

Let me save you the trouble, don't spend your hard earned money on this when there are plenty of other titles that, when they SAY they work on Linux, actually DO work on Linux. Play Turok instead!"
23905,"This game is so much fun, I have been playing it for 5 years starting on console xbox, also one iphone that is free. I took a break of 1 year so I came back and started playing on pc that is why I only have 70 hours when righting this but in total I have 67 days 16 just on consle"

Unraidable bases due to server rules and not to mention the dead player count on most servers. Server cluster = 10 servers at most at 1 time playing is 100 people lol dosht game

23938,this game is awsome but the name really means spend 4 to 6 hours making a base and getting stuff to be raided when your offline
23939,ok game
23940,"dont play this game, it takes your life away"
23941,op
23942,"Getting fully immersed and committed is the only way you're really going to enjoy this game as its mechanics make you wanna find the nearest alpha predator to gobble you up and just end it all. If you stick with it, it's very rewarding, especially with friends. 

ARK II on UE5 with improved mechanics will be everything that I've wanted out of the original. Let's hope they follow through!"
23943,"Just play Conan Exiles.

It's a buggy and unoptimized mess not worth the almost 200GB storage used up, and not worth the strain on your GPU & eyes--outside of that, the quality of the game is hilariously bad as well.

After playing my GPU has been making incessant coil whine outside of load, this game has questionable stability."

23954,"Very good game, it doesnt even let me in the servers poggers game"
23955,Games very very very fun when its a new concept to you but as you play you realize that the gameplay is honestly not that good and the PvP is horrendous in its current state.
23956,"I love being able to raise baby dinos, PVP can be fun but also really annoying. Overall, Love this game"

23964,"Starts out challenging, then you can get better at NOT being dead. After a long while of rocking it, it becomes as challenging as you can possibly imagine. There's almost no end to the variety of hardships and personal conquests. I'm hooked, for now - and only as a single player. Perhaps someday I'll increase my sense of insecurity and play in a world with actual people that want me dead."

23983,download the pugnacia mod its really fun
23984,good
23985,"I've played a total of 2k hours on this game between ps4 and pc. I can positively say that this game has come a far way since first being released! When first playing the optimization was horrible and having an amazing pc was really the only way to play. Now that the optimization is a lot better, I'd recommend it to everyone! The base game is impressive but if playing on heavily modified settings completing the game goes by quick. If your computer  can handle the mods, I would always recommend some of the harder mods after getting to know the game. The community around ark is also great with wildcard using community mods to turn into official mods/maps. You can meet a variety of people on this game which is another plus to it. With so many mods you can really make the game whatever you want! [b]Highly recommend this game to everyone 10/10![/b]"
23986,if there isnt a monke on the map delete  the  game
23987,Not Bad.
23988,"I love this game. it is so life like with the dinos, the building you will have to get the crafting things to build first. i would give this game a 10 out of a 10 in a heart beat."
23989,"This game is good and hard, but there is a very steep learning curve and the game doesn't do a good job telling you how to play. There are a lot of hidden systems. The internet is your friend. 

I recommend NOT trying multiplayer until you have a good understanding of the crafting and taming systems."
23990,!125 gb fuck off

23993,"i love this game, its so nice. I love getting jump scared by 3 rex at a time and 2 giga`s just walking across my base
"
23994,"This game is beautiful, I cant say better things about it. I only have one recommendation to new players and that is don't boost the server extremely, a little is fine but try to enjoy the game with the difficulty that comes with learning. It made my experience with the game a lot more fun."
23995,i like this game a lot.It is very nastolgic as i played it a while ago when it came out on console
23996,gud
23997,its a good game when u play solo or with your friends

24028,Very Great game really fun and is more fun with friends on a server!
24029,"did a lot of mining, building, crafting, and surviving"
24030,its fun
24031,good game
24032,"Great game, just the worst lag of any online game I have ever played and it's not my internet causing the problem. I have moved to a third gentwo server that has kicked me less than 5 minutes after loading and the server disappeared from the server list."

24042,"After dumping 28 hours into this hot steaming pile of trash, I can safely say out of the multitudes of survival games I've played (Conan Exiles, Space Engineers, Minecraft, etc etc) This is by far the worst game in the entire genre. The only thing it has going for it are the dinosaurs/prehistoric/fantasy creatures, and even the incompetent dev's botched that."
24043,"this game is so god damn good except don't join official servers because the whole map is covered with bases
"
24044,Good
24045,caca
24046,though the game is laggy its best if you use the no sky effects if you have a not much storage device. but overall its amazing!
24047,dinosaur
24048,Very fun games with friends I recommend. Also on Host/Local you can make it to where its not too grindy but not too easy for a fun chill game. the pvp is fun and sometimes the dead bodies glitch and deform its funny af. but this game has a lot too it and multiple fun maps I recommend Gen 2 its sick looking anyways cya have fun.
24049,taken up 300gb on my pc so far
24050,shit game
24051,MOSCHOPS ARMY
24052,Im the reason why the dodo went bye bye.
24053,this game is so good that i wipe the xbox disk for toilet papper
24054,If im gonna be real the game is a lot better with mods its fun very additive but the main game its self is a bit challenging so if you like to wait 1-2 days to tame a dino send it its a mid game give it a try but if you read reviews first either play with mods or dont
24055,Makes you think.  Great graphics
24056,poop monkey
24057,sui
24058,Great game if you're doing private servers. Regular servers kinda suck though.
24059,"This is one of the worst games ever made. I keep on telling myself that I will never play it again, but I always do. There is NO escape."
24060,Me like dinosaurs
24061,dino fun make me rage but dino nuggies help no rage funny fornite game
24062,"Love the idea of a survival game where you can tame creatures and use them for certain tasks.
But, this game takes up a lot of room in the computer and the servers take for ever to get into. 
The game at least has a bunch of mods in the workshop so that would be a plus if it didn’t make the game a lot slower than it already was. Other than that the game is only fun either in single player or with friends in a private server due to how chaotically PvP everyone is with tribes that already dominate the servers.
Now that Ark 2 is announced, I don’t really have much hope for it but hopefully they cut back on how demanding the game is towards the pc and have some good changes, but most likely it’s either gonna be as bad or worst."
24063,VERY GOOD
24064,"It is a very fun game with really cool dinos and creatures

Downside of online play is that the tame limits are all maxed out, so new players cannot tame any dinosaurs."
24070,Rawr
24071,"You either ocasionally play this game or waste your life away grinding the game, it gets worse with pvp putting in the extra base defense, 10/10 buy this game, why buy a $20 game you'll play for 3 hours and rather spend like $100 on every dlc that if you have the right motivation can spend thousands of hours on!
"

24073,i love it
24074,very guud
24075,great game to grind with friends
24076,500 of my hours are just trying to get the damn game downloaded correctly
24077,it is fun
24078,good game takes a while to load
24079,nigeria
24080,fucking game
24081,"Ark is one of my favorite games because you cant really get bored of it because there is SO MANY things to do like beat the bosses, tame all creatures, max level your survivor and so much more. The way to make it more fun is to play with your friends, make a pvp server and make WAR. Problems are it needs a LOT of storage.

Hopefully this will help you make an opinion if you want to buy it."
24082,how do i open the inventory
24083,it gud
24084,this game is very good because the dinos have very big boobs and it inspires me to keep playing and taming a harem of giganotosaurs (they have the biggest boobs and boob damage btw). UwU
24085,this is a vary good starting out survival game if you like dino's and storyline thats all basically:)

24094,"Ark is a damn good game, especially if you have some friends to play it with.
Love the co-op, don't like pvp anywhere so... but the dlcs?

If you want to overspend and waste your money, get the Ark DLC's.
Steam and the Developers will be happy you are such a sucker!"
24095,"This game is big shit. Instead developers fix bugs and lag they non-stop making new DLCs. This game is made only for PvP. If you want to play single player or multiplayer with friends this game is not for you. Every second spent in this game goes to hell, because of some t-rex or carno appeared from the sky."
24096,"really fun game i really recoment this game
"
24097,"yes
"
24098,Dinozauri
24099,Great Game! Love the DLC's a bit expensive but they're fun extra content. Been playing since 2015 casually. 3k+ hours Definitely my favorite game!
24100,fucking glitch
24101,"I put some really stupid hours into this game over the course of 3 servers and 1 year. Good times and bad times.

Always did PVE, just what I prefer in survival games. But it was still pretty fun.

I don’t know if I’ll ever come back to ARK. I still love it’s music and it’s lore but it’s gameplay is….something. Outside of the taming I find some other survival games do better at the whole survival thing. Once you get TeK it can become a joke.

I didn’t like Genesis at all, either part. I find it’s a joke and it ultimately ruined some stuff for me.

So why do I still recommend it? Because, it is fun. Especially if you’ve got someone with you. The early stages of this game are the best bits and the boss battles are actually pretty cool.

Running and hiding from a T-Rex is one of the funnest experiences I’ve ever had in a video game, especially when it was at night."
24102,amogus
24103,joa
24104,Out of range of host is shit.

Ark is just so much fun and full of potential that I can literally just sit around searching for dinos all day. Not to mention that the story and DLC are absolutely amazing aswell. Honestly Ark is probably one of, if not my favorite game."

You may enjoy rubber banding on a private server with your friends and being teleported to the admin every time you/they enter a cave but nah.. the game is horseshit.. P.S the official servers allow you to use mods that take away the leaves/bushes and see the bottom of the ocean as clear as day so not much in the way of hiding from other players..

24206,"Played hundreds of hours across multiple accounts. Uninstalled it long ago due to its many issues...

Recently gave it another try after multiple years. During the 2 days I played I lost progress due to bugs 3 times.

Keep out if you value your sanity."
24207,fun game with friends. we went monkey hunting!
24208,i really enjoyed this game and its mechanics such as breeding and taming. bosses are a fun addition and i really reccomend this game to others.
24209,"First of all, this is probably the most frustrating f*cking game I have ever played, I also have over 2,000 hours so clearly treat em mean, keep em keen! Play it and say goodbye to any free time you once had."

24220,This game is the most interesting and most annoying when it comes to dinosaurus
24221,"Been playing since 2017, must say a lot thing changed, and its into both good and bad, overall this game is worth to try if u love dinos"
24222,"this game is good but it is a waist of time,every time you get a good dino you will lose it and if you build a base a t-rex will just eat you and your base is gone.And for me this game gets boring fast in the trailer it looks great but the game is not that good.I mean it is fun to mess around with your friends but if you don't have anyone to play with it is just boring this is my opinion but if you like this kind of survival games then you might like it but for me i don't like it"
24223,"Open world concept, minecraft meets WoW meets Jurassic world great game, a real video hog though (you can scale back these settings if you desire)"

24230,ARK is a game that you wiuld play with your friends that have it but you would never recommend it. It has lots of bugs that wildcard needs to fix such as meshing but overall its a game that you will get bored of but still play it.
24231,"good
"
24232,it is a game that every one should have because their is a Dino in it but only one because any more would be too much
24233,"I disagree that it's a first person shooter, I think it's more like a first person punch trees and smash rocks."
24234,"This game may be the most buggy full release game of all time, but the beauty of the game completely makes up for it. you wake up on a beach full of dinosaurs, with nothing but your underwear/ and bra. You survive among the dinosaurs and even tame and ride them. And then become the most powerful being ever with space man armor. Just the idea of that makes this game amazing. And the fun you can have with your other naked friends, adds on to the awesomeness. And once you finally beat the Overseer, and you get to look back on all of what it took for you to get where you are now, and all the dinosaurs you have befriended. You will really begin to appreciate the beauty of it."
24235,"Goddamn game has screwed with my PC and has made my Halo multiplayer, as well as all my other multiplayer games laggy as hell, and total Horse S***. to further the problem, I already uninstalled the game and am still suffering from this crap. Can I get some veteran opinions please?"

I had to adjust the gamma immediately after starting because you could barley see ( suppose to be the day time)  I had to go online to figure out what to do as there is 0 explanation, turns out the gamma needs adjusting,  Then when playing the game I have to go online to find out every little thing i.e. need to eat but cant eat certain things, need to cook but don't have space for campfire, find space but cant light the damn thing. Its one thing after another. I'm shocked anyone payed more than $8 for this game. Its looking really grim"

24294,I almost like everything about this game. Other than the fact that sometimes I get very low spawn rate of dinosaur and it gets very laggy most of the times but anything else I would really recommend this game. Another thing I'd like to mention is the launch of the game and starting the game like playing the opening of the world is very very very long like 5 mins minimum and if your unlucky you get about estimate 10-15 mins of waiting for the world to open. This game is a nostalgia for me since I used to play in the mobile app and now I'm in pc. That's it I really recommend this game.

Worth It

""So, I'll make this simple: never, under any circumstance, miss out on this game. The Graphics were good especially if you can run a good high to medium settings. Gameplay-wise was exciting and it goes really well with the music and audio effects to the point that it made me stay up late during my working days. When you get down to it, there's really still much left you can say. Occasionally, you'll play a game that's so good, that you're done after a couple of days. This isn't the case with ARK: Survival Evolved. It's just...soo good. In conclusion you should differently get ARK: Survival Evolved!"

All around, there's something for most everyone to enjoy. 10/10"

Unfortunately the developer has built a financial model under which they prioritise hype and new features instead of fixing fundamental underlying issues.

If youre into glitches, look no farther.
If you love to get propped up by excitement then experience soul-crushing disappointment?
THIS is your game.
Suggestions: 
Drop a sleeping bag every five feet as you travel. Trust me, youll need it.
PUT ALL POINTS IN CARRY WEIGHT. The other stats DO NOT MATTER at all.
DO NOT name or get attached to your dinos. They will die. All of them. 
Do not be too proud of your base or constructions. They will be flattened.

My friend (who got the game with us) just sent me this text:
""..Im sorry, but Im done. I just cant stand being sad everyday of my life. Its not worth it.""
Sums it all up right there.
I look forward to the day when someone does this concept right.
....because it sure as Hell was not here.

Edit: I have played another 80 hours because I really want to love this game, but I understand now that its because I love being able to play multiplayer with my family and friends.

I want to like this game so bad, in theory it's my perfect game. I love the survival, I love extinct animals, I love building.

Unfortunately it's plagued with lots of problems, and they will never be fixed. The game is still being updated, but they only seem to be adding content (which seems to be sponsored mods), and no longer improving the game. Most of the updates seem centered on fixing exploits for official multiplayer servers.

cons:
- lots of glitches (such as getting stuck)
- unintuitive and hard to use UI
- excessive graphics processing, too high contrast even with all effects off
- build system is extremely finicky 
- unintutive mechanics, e.g. taming (you have to read the wiki)
- new content is mostly new maps, or locked to new maps
- the teknology is kind of stupid, and the built in ""primitive+"" game mode is abandoned
- server configuration is a mess (and much of it can only be done in ini)
- annoying holiday events
- lack of new construction or character customization pieces
- difficultly randomly ramps up hard (random predator / alpha spawns)

I played this game years ago, and jumping in, it still feels exactly the same. The core mechanics,UI and graphics have not seen any improvements over the years from what I can tell. Instead of improving the experience by fixing these core systems, or even adding depth to the game by adding new building parts or mechanics, they seem to have only added new maps or the occasional new creature (which is often locked to these new maps). 

They've recently announced Ark 2, which means they certainly wont be doing any more updates to the core of this game. And maybe Ark 2 will fix everything, but how long will it take before it has nearly as much content? And what's the chance they will fix the mistakes they made with the first game?

If you can get it for $10 and have some friends to play with it might be worth it for you."
24459,yes
24460,"This game contains many realistic and unrealistic elements, ARK is one of the best PvPvE games you will ever play. The dinosaurs are modeled well, despite some being very unrealistic. For the most part, ARK is very realistic to what life would be like in the actual dinosaur era! This game is worth every second of play time. I will forever treasure and love this amazing game."

24473,"It is very laggy and could be optimized better. There are glitches that will cause you to lose everything and instead of fixing those issues, the devs decided to make a second game which will mostlikely have a lot of the same issues plus new ones."

24502,"(Disclaimer: I am playing on a private server and everything is amped up for easier play. Also, no PVP)
If you like dying constantly and in a myriad of ways then this game is for you! I'm the kind of player that likes to be ultra prepared before undertaking any in game tasks but in ARK that rarely matters. You get killed often and the gameplay is difficult, but challenging so it keeps you busy. The gameplay is also fairly varied. You have a choice to play along the paths the devs have set up or you can just enjoy the giant open world of dinosaurs (even though most try to kill you). There's crafting, taming, breeding, etc. so something for everyone. The graphics are very detailed, but if you don't have a system for that I might not recommend getting the game because it is half its charm. Also, the game is VERY glitchy. Not in the sense it crashes, but in that you get stuck, the dinos get stuck, the building is very finicky and the shooting is not always accurate and unfortunately lots more. But weirdly enough its kinda of just an ARK thing and sometimes can even work in your favour. So in conclusion, definitely a game I'd recommend, though because of general lack of direction and information, make sure you have the wiki open at all times. Frustrating, but rewarding and has a steep learning curve. But as you can see from my 200 or so hours playing, loving every minute of it (except breeding. That's the WORST)."
24503,PVE servers are terrible. There is 5 sec stop when you are doing something and everyone is pleasing fuckong pillars everywhere. Idk if that's only on epic games because I'm playing there or is it on Steam also.
24504,uyyt
24505,super not good game
24506,"I can see why people would love the heck out of this game but it simply wasn't for me. There's just something about it that gives off that ""wannabe survival game vibe"" that I personally can't get on board with. 4/10. Same with The Forest. It's only good if you plan on dicking around with your friends but then again, EVERYTHING is better with friends."

24526,"I'm a sucker for this game. I keep coming back and rebuilding. I have never completed the game so i think I might be addicted to being a low level noob struggling to survive. My only complaint is the fact that structures decay, but I also get really peeved at people leaving millions of pillars making it impossible to start in a new spawn. I've found some really nice people on here but there are equal amounts of real bellends. I love building and I love breeding mutated dinos. I wish they would solve the lag issues on servers but hey ho."

24618,Sometimes glitchy or crashes if you have too many dinos. but otherwise good quality
24619,"ARK as itself is very enjoyable concept and with good PC it's really incredible game like no other. Even with new DLCs every year. It can take away all you time but that's also somewhat dragging it back... ARK will consume your time like it's nothing... you gonna start playing at 4 pm and end at 4 am and that's just the beggining. So if you don't have as much time for ARK you shouldn't bother with PVP multiplayer and stay with singleplayer. The main problem about ARK is the requirements... ARK can smelt your PC to the dust if you don't have good enough PC. If you have potato PC you should not bother with ARK because it won't be even enjoyable.

Overall i rate ARK 8/10 just because of the all memories. Hope the Wildcart developers won't forget it when ARK 2 comes."
24620,"Played Ark for years, there is nothing like this game, it's definitely a unique experience!
*PVP servers are a nightmare because the game meta is broken for years now, constantly adding new features and never optimizing or balancing the older ones. And impossible for new comers to catch up or even exist at this point.
*PVE is broken because structures, dinos, etc will be all over the server causing insane lags, pretty much unplayable.
*Solo might be a really fun experience if you enjoy singleplayer games"
24621,its ark
24622,yes
24623,"STOP ANY COHERENT THOUGHTS IN FAVOR OF THIS GAME RIGHT NOW

By no means should you ever even consider buying or playing this game. This game is a terrible mix between stupid, incredible fun with exploration and dinos to complete destruction of everything you love and have built up to. Anything you do in this game can be thrown away in an instant to a random spawn. It's all up to chance. The game never spreads out its annoying traits throughout the game either. You will have the best time you've had in weeks without a single hitch and then the moment something goes wrong for you, the game continuously stacks everything bad that could possibly happen to you within that one moment. 

And don't even CONSIDER this game if you get easily attached to digital pets. Because the game will take those from you in an instant with no hesitation. There is no sense of safety in this game until you get to the point of level 150+ dinos and getting the best equipment in the game. And even then Ark will find a way to screw you over. It always does. Don't let it fool you. Never let your guard down. Never play this game."
24624,ARK is the best survival game hands down.

Oh and if you ever want to fight a T-Rex but instead of a T-Rex you get a T-Rex in a T-Rex sized Iron man suit. Like Hulk Buster but its a fu****g T-Rex. Yeah I said T-Rex 5 times in one sentence. THAT is how good I am. 8.78/10"

""Everything i said below still applies, plus the whole bug where cold areas are pitch black at high noon is just unbearable.. Dont waste time or money on this game and if you do, dont review it badly because theyll never leave you alone till you change it.""

original Review:
Even on sale, not worth it. Buggy AF especially for a game this old. undo months of game time in one glitch, bug, or blatant AI failure. Way too complicated to back up a game or create a server considering the instability. Played this forever on epic and heard the steam was better so bought it on sale. It is absolutely worse. 0.2 hours over ""applicable refund time"" so I'm stuck with it. Most of that was spent in failing load screens or black screens that never went away. Non dedicated servers are completely unstable. 

And on a side note, If I could I give an entire extra thumbs down justfor this tether distance nonsense. 

Don't buy"

24711,One of my favorite games of all time (:  having my own server is such a comfort to me; I've been playing this game for years on Playstation as well.

24716,its good game
24717,"To start this game is buggy. Undoubtedly and honestly it is. To some that's enough to have them quit the game and I say fair enough to that. For me though, this game offers enough to look over that. The fact its nearly 300gb for me on disk is a good indicator of what this game is to me, just a mind blowingly indepth open world masterpiece. 

This game offers a level of play that I've never encountered in another game. Everything has detail, everything has its own little mechanic that once learned you can take advantage of to make your life on the ark just that little bit easier. And all those little mechanics add up to make a big difference, the difference between a good player and a bad player. And yet amazingly I can see a player with no experience being able to jump in and still not feel overwhelmed because the mechanics only are there if you look for them. It's not a case of OoH u DoNt KnOw How To Do ThIs oBsCurE tHinG So U DiE. 

On top of the mechanics is the lore in this game. It doesn't actually present its self unless you look for it and I love that. Rather than it being shoved in your face you see tiny hints around the map, so tiny someone not in the loop would never notice, but if you do know, then it'll make you smile (insert pointing Rick Dalton meme)

A few other things I like are: I think the graphics are pretty good considering the size of the maps.

Nearly everything is configurable if you are playing single player or running your own server 

The mods list is never ending

And dinosaurs... duh. 

It's good..

24788,"This is one of the many games I enjoy coming back to, I tend to play single player and with the right settings and some good MODS you can have hrs of fun, I do also play with friends and family on a non dedicated server which we all enjoy playing on. It is one of them games that you will always come back to, if you enjoy crafting hunting PVE also you can make the game as hard or as easy as you want. I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys survival games and crafting."
24789,good
24790,A great game to play with friends!
24791,.
24792,i bought this game a month ago and now it's free. when i bought it the game was on sale (50% off). why make a sale if the game was going to be free in a month? and also it doesn't run very well on my pc but i've already played 13+ hours and therefore can't refund. im sad
24793,"you can get dinos ride them have wars but sometimes its really glicty and i got revomved from the tribe i made
but i is really good game i recommend getting it:)"
24794,very good for the money i paid

24798,"Grind 50 hours, get raided, proceed to cry. Repeat 10/10"
24799,I loved this game before but then i got a bit bored but now that the new maps and updates are out its the only game i want to play all day and i'm playing with mods witch is even better it's so fun you should get it for yourself or your family taming the different breeds of dino's is amazing and its multiplayer its amazing i love it.
24800,"Great game to play if you enjoy survival games. There are a few bugs and the game engine isn't optimal, however it is a lot of fun especially playing with friends. If you are new to the game - look into changing some of the base settings and scale them up a bit. It can be a very grindy game on base settings. Also don't be afraid to add in some quality of life mods, it can keep the game fresh and more enjoyable to play!"
24801,good
24802,"You know that one game that manages to always pull you back? Yeah, that's this one for me. The game can get repetitive at times and it still has its fair share of bugs and poor optimization but, what game is ever 100% perfect? It's frustrating and annoying at times but, a good survival game should be, its a challenge, in the best way possible. If you're looking for a game to sit down and get lost in a world and escape reality for a bit, this is the game for you."
24803,Ark is a game where you get to punch trees like that game everyone playes. i think its called Minecart. you can explore a world in minecraft full of random things like bamboo. ark is ok though
24804,With under 200 hours on this game i am loving it. I am on my second play through and i can't wait to get to the final boss fights.
24805,very fun but takes a while to gain resources (And I have mine on 3x gathering)
24806,awesome game
24807,NO DEVS
24808,"Dogshit game quoted by redlanes ""you stare at a dino's ass for 7 hours for an imprint boost"""

24810,great
24811,The one thing I have noticed is that new players find it very hard to progress in the game. Most get annoyed after dying a few times and just leave the game. This game is actually really good if you put some time and effort into it.
24812,good
24813,"I have never played a more frustrating game before. 
I got to level 16 and yet almost everything kills me. I've filled the map with green rays marking my corpses, which I cannot loot because then I get killed again by the same dinosaur that killed me in the first place. I've tried to play with the settings when creating the game. The result is that now I cannot damage the dinosaurs AT ALL. No matter how many times I hit them and no matter with what. They also cannot damage me, which would be something if they didn't constantly harass me and literally push me around everywhere so that I can't do anything. 
I've tried to exit to the main menu and see what the problem is this time, and the game crashed. I've had a very hard time even closing the process so I could access Steam again. I can't understand how this game has so many fans, it's broken and totally unplayable to me.

+ the graphics look good if you disregard the terrible way everything breaks and the robotic animations
+ you can tame dinosaurs

- no story
- no real tutorial 
- no health bars on dinosaurs
- almost everything kills you. the only pelts you can safely get are the dodo pelts, which happen to be very cute and die a very violent death by your hands,
- actually hitting the enemies you're attacking is challenging, because you need to align the middle of the screen with the creature you're trying to hit, and also be close enough. otherwise you'll just be swinging in their direction without doing any damage
- the creatures who can and do kill you can also attack and destroy your base, and clip through the walls to get to you even if you're inside your shelter.
- if a creature doesn't kill you, you can also kill yourself by mistake when hitting a dodo with your bare hands. hitting a tree is fine though, and does less damage.
- you need to hit a tree with your bare hands in order to get wood. this makes absolutely no sense.
- whenever you destroy something it breaks it huge geometrical pieces that sink into the ground after a while in a very realistic way (sarcasm)
- the game is basically one huge grind with you going back and forth between your storage crates (very small storage crates) and whatever resource you need.
- I haven't figured out a way to sleep so I can fast forward through the night when I can't see anything
- weird eat and sleep mechanics. I think I managed to drink some water, but I'm not really sure how. there isn't really a drink animation, so I've either tried to hit the water or harvest it. I also can't tell if the icons on the right should be white or grayed out when all's good.
- every time you die and get your stuff back you get another extra copy of some cosmetic items I don't know what to do with yet. so I now have 4 of each in my inventory and I cannot destroy them, so my only option is to drop them somewhere on the ground. 
- also, each time you die your corpse stays behind after you loot it. I now have 5 versions of me dead and decomposing somewhere on the island, contorted in weird positions of course (and some partially levitating). 
- you defecate randomly from time to time. no warning, you just let go with a prrrrrtttttt. And you can pick it up afterwards. This is just... nope.
- the screen goes blurry from time to time and my character drops like a ragdoll in whatever place she's at (even if she's in the water) and can't move for a short while. I *think* she's sleeping? what's weird is that the sleeping bag can't be used to sleep in it so I can prevent these strange fits from happening. I can only seem to use it for fast travel..

I managed to get one achievement. Survive a full day and night on the Ark. I did find it weird at the time that only about 55.9% of the players had it. Now I know why,
"
24814,"amazing
"
24815,alchile si esta bueno
24816,Absolutely amazing game. i never get bored with it because it definitely keeps you on your toes.
24817,"This is one of those games that I wish I could play again for the first time. The experience of exploring and building in a massive world full of awesome dinosaurs is exhilarating. Fortunately, there are a lot of maps and expansions to play on with each providing a different experience that lets you capture that first time feel a bit.

It's a game best played with friends, but you can definitely enjoy it solo. However, it can be a punishing and frustrating game. For example, you can spend the first several nights building a basic shelter and perhaps even taming a few dinosaurs, only to have it all destroyed because a Spinosauras spawned too close to your base. However, eventually you will learn how to keep your base safe and tame even the most dangerous of dinosaurs (with very few exceptions). There are a lot of customization options though to cater the gameplay to your preferences. For example, you can easily increase resource acquisition, speed up taming times, strengthen/weaken wild dinos, etc. Additionally this game is very moddable which makes the game significantly more replayable.

The game does have some flaws though. It has plenty of jankiness, especially in online play. Some examples: logging into a server to find you dinos somehow wandered through your solid walls and ending up in random places, sometimes getting killed in the process. The building can also be annoying, with mods being all but a requirement, so if you're coming from a game like Valheim don't expect the same building experience. With some mods though and a bit of patience, you can build some really cool bases.

One final warning: this game requires a LOT of hard drive space, especially if you intend to play the dlc or bonus maps. It can easily take 200-300+ Gigabytes of space. 

In summary, if you enjoy survival games, then Ark is an easy recommendation."
24818,great game
24819,big dino balls
24820,"You will forget to sleep trying to do that one last task before you log off.
Once you make the long trip for that special resource you will die and loose it 2 minutes from your base.
Official PvP servers are not causal or beginner friendly. KILL, KILL, KILL
Don't be afraid to explore the workshop and get some mods for single player or any unofficial server."
24821,"This is game has made me lose hours in my sleep, nutrition in my food, i lost my wife and kids due to hours and hours of non stop playing building bases getting raided repeat... i was arked-in highly watch out extremely contagious and may cause loss of sanity and after all that hell whole you will receive withdrawals, wanting and long to come back everytime you quit for my 233rd trip to the rehab clinc, they told me i was a lost cause they tried all manors,beating, electrocution, drowning, around the clock torture to cure this horrible disease but through all of my struggles it still is my favorite game rate 20/10"

24840,probably one of the most frusterating games to get a dedicated server to run with.
24841,best game ever
24842,"Gameplay allows you to build what you wish, tame what you want, etc. I adopt for primarily single-player. Some maps involve more mission-style play and story line. I have a lot of fun with this game. I highly recommend."

24848,The game is fun and when I was little I always dreamed of having a game like this.
24849,Very fun game with friends would recommend
24850,I have played a lot of ark and it is annoying to go to sleep one night and then wake get on and see that someone from a different sever have just killed all your tames and destroy your base.But it is still a lot of fun to play with friends and mess around on that's why i think it is one the best games i have ever played its in my 5 favorite games to play.
24851,good
24852,It is very grindy.
24853, Instead Of Dropping New Maps Pls Fix this shitty Game from the Glitches And Meshes ... The Game is Just full Of Hackers ... apoclapse servers is Just Shitty At this Point Full Of Hackers / Laggy asf ... And The Admins take 3-4 Days just to get 1 Massage / lets talk about Gen2 this map is just op spawn with a tek suit farm for 10m and u have a tek base the same with the dinos the noglin the astro that op shit can wipe a base easily / the game after gen2 isn't Fun Anymore
24854,"Dood, its fun, get it. Get Terraria first tho, you can play with me and my friend"
24855,this game is hell on earth but like with cool devil
24856,Great game i would suggest it due to its endless possibilities when playing this game on steam
24857,Its alright i guess
24858,this game is awesome. it has so much to offer and you never have the same 2 things to do at once. honestly its a very engrossing game that can hold your attention for hours on end. i find my self always finding something new or learning a better method.

24872,u wont run out of stuff to do like ever
24873,"I like this game a lot but there is some problems such as is you go out of bounds you lose all of your things, this could be fixed by spawning you and your items back at your bed or spawn point and your dinosaur where it last was before you rode it. and the dodo rex should be able to be able to be tamed forever without a time limit possibly by making the item that spawns it but more expensive. Also since you have already added some tamable mythical creatures so why not add something like the Nekomata or Komainu since they are both YōKai from Japanese folk law. Anyways, i like this game a lot and would recommend it to other people. Sincerely, ArcticFox"

24894,"This is a great game.  I've got much more in than 260 hours.  Crafting, dinosaurs (that you can tame and even ride!), base building, huge tech tree and skills, great teamwork potential.   My favorite way to play is both solo and with friends on a private server.  

I've seen people complain about the PVP aspects where you can lose your things.  If PVP isn't for you, play solo or co-op PVE mode.   The game can be as casual or as involved as you want it to be.  

Highly recommend it!"

24927,"It's a very fun game that can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. PvP is kinda broken, as other people can destroy your base, kill your pets and steal your stuff while you're offline. In terms of PvE though, the game's great. At first, it's pretty grindy and can get boring, but once you're past that, you're guaranteed to have lots of fun. Not to mention the mods, which are very fun as well."

24945,"I have not been able to take my eyes away from this game, and I haven't even loaded in yet!
The Devs have done such a perfect job of encapsulating the best loading experience for the player.
It gives you little tips at the bottom of the loading screen, giving the player just enough content to enjoy their time spent looking at it, as the imagination is the best playground and using these short sentences the player can imagine how great this game would be! Not to mention the logo looks great in the bottom right corner!
Truly a perfect loading screen, and I can only see myself draining more hours into staring at it!"
24946,"Most would look at this game and believe that all there is to it is what is obvious.  Level.  Build.  Tame.  Then go fight a boss.  And while that is the real meat and potatoes to all of it, there's other bits that really bring out the flavor.  I have raised a village from the ground up.  I have owned a tavern, jousted on the backs of all sorts of creatures.  Hosted pit fights with both men and dinosaurs.  I've destroyed others while also being crushed myself.  Hell I've even developed a currency system out of chitin and colored gems that a server full of folks genuinely enjoyed.

What you should take from this game, if anything, is it's incredible potential to bring people together.  Both for the better, and well... the not so better."

24975,"I have only just moved to PC with this game, but have hundreds of hours on it on PS4. The downside? You'll be addicted if you love survival games. You may end up with hundreds of tiny dinos and pets if you're anything like me, and you won't apologize for it. This game will always have a special place in my heart! 10/10."
24976,"Ark is a great survival game, when you know how to play it properly. Don't shy away from using any guides or tutorials, they'll only make the experience more enjoyable. That being said, the game allows you to ride DINOSAURS, already a plus. It is also generally fun anyways. In conclusion this game is great, and with multiple DLC maps, there is never a lack of things to do. Along with the extensions, the game has a very populated mod community, which provides even more content if you somehow get bored."

I've had some of the most fun ever playing this game and that doesn't stop me from acknowledging that this game sucks, I would never recommend it and if you ever get into it I'm so sorry this game has the highest of highs and the lowest of lows."

Seriously this game is great! Last I played there were still some bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking, and they are always adding more stuff. Not to mention there is a huge MOD community out there with plenty of fun things to add in!"

25044,Super bugs and game crashes wait for you. Also expect intruders using god mod to wipe your dinos if you don't set your server to Private.
25045,"Ark Survival Evolved is one of my favorite games, and 100% my favorite survival games. The two most important things to know about this game are:

 1.) You will die. A lot. Then you will build a base and get stronger armor and your own dinos. And you will get your sh*t wrecked by even bigger and tougher enemies. And this will make you rage quit, and then come right back. 

2.) This game is full of wonder and adventure. Exploring each map, meeting each different dino, uncovering Lore notes and discovering just why you are here. It will keep you on your toes looking for more. Each map is different and Unique and full of surprises and challenges. 

You can play this game solo, but its 100% more fun with friends, even if its just one or two more people. The modding community is great and so very creative and just when you've grown bored of the base game, they've got something to reignite that spark for you. 

Also, your settings for the maps are wildly customizable, so if you've lost your patience with dying 25 times, you can go in and adjust the difficulty of the map with things like your resistance, enemies resistance, spawn rates, and how good your loot is. Ooor, you can turn everything up and challenge yourself further if you feel you're doing pretty good, its all up to you. 

Fair warning, this game will burn your free time. You will sit down to play for just a few hours and before you even know it poof your weekend is gone lol"
25046,good
25047,"very good game, it has some bugs but still one of my fav"

25056,Nice
25057,"A really good game which you can play with friends or alone, i recomend it for everyone even tho the start can be a little confusing/hard but it's fine. I juste don't recomend to get attached to your dinosaur too much at the start or you're gonna have a lot of sadness to pass through, even tho the game is good and would be recomended for everyone."
25058,yeet
25059,"Ark is a game that i have played for years,  not only on PC but on Ps4 as well. From the first day i played it to still playing it today i am always amazed as to how much of an adventure i will have. Knowing that around every corner something unexpected could happen. I will cherish this game forever and i would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone if you love survival games. If you have a group of friends you would like to survive with it will make the game a whole lot more fun but you can also play solo, which is what i do most of the time. It is fun either way."

Ive seen games with shorter development have less issues... and ive had this game since before it went gold but i just cant recommend it when there are this many bugs...
The concept of the game is cool... tools to start gathering and then tame animals to better assist you in doing so is so cool (especially when its prehistoric animals (pre dinosaurs, dinosaurs and more ""modern"" mammals)"

25082,fun little low fps dinosaur game
25083,rawr
25084,"Well...

What more can you say, it will drain hours from your life.  There is alot to do and even more to learn through out the maps.
Other than a few technical issues occasionally. It can be a very enjoyable game, alone or with friends.

Biggest issue with this whole series is lack of care from the creators.  No game needs to be 300+gb.  The game would be better if they optimised this and lowered the size of the game.  Or even the option to not install every expansion.  This would make the game more attractive to new players with smaller HDD's"
25085,nvm mcrincraft is bnad lol

25092,Best game I've ever played. No cap.
25093,This game enslaves you. do. not. buy. it.
25094,"adventure based survival games are one of my most frequent favorites, so i suggest this to all the adventure based survival people out there!"
25095,I love this game. My friend and i have a base together on the crystal ilse map and it is great. The community is great as well. This one person game me the best dino in the game because i was new. But right now I have a bug where I cant see the offical  server i'm playing on.
25096,"very enjoyable. solo or with friends, i've always had fun. adding mods from the community workshop also make for an interesting time"
25097,"I enjoy this game quite a lot. Sometimes I get a little bored playing alone on it, but it is better than the 20 second delay every time an official server saves the game. Playing on official is a game killer for me. Anyway, it is a a fun game with dino's galore!

[edit 4-22-22] 
Playing on official really is annoying when it comes to lag, but I have been overlooking the 20 sec to 30 lag on there every 15 minutes. I came to expect it, but I really wish they would fix. :( Anyway, I have been enjoying it when other people are in it, and the fact that I can't manipulate the playing field. Playing on official keeps me in my place. That''s a good thing, heh.

[edit 8-24-22] 
Wait for Ark 2. This game is not worth the headache."
25098,Best Game with mods and by it self

25103,"Great game, very hard to run though"
25104,"Ark is a very fun game i have only recently downloaded it and was very confused at start but after watching 1 basics guide i have already gotten the hang of it. 1 reccomendation is to sort the server by ping, if you play on a high ping server it ruins the game. apart from that very fun game and i will be grinding this a lot :)"
25105,"Fun, but only if you like grinding. Not only that, but it runs badly and takes up far too much memory. Also eats wallet. I can't recommend in good faith."

It just kinda throws you into battle without explaining ANYTHING and then it's not easy to figure out!

I've died soooo many times simply because I can't figure out the stupid cooking pot. I crafted it, placed it, got food...but I can't light it!!!! SUPER FRUSTRATING GAME! Don't really want to play anymore. Glad is was only $10."

25168,We rent a server with my family and play PVE mode together.  It's a lot of fun and a great way to spend more time together. An additional note: renting a server takes a huge amount of processing off of your PC and allows you to play at better quality with a less powerful computer.
25169,"Coming from someone that is not much of a modern gamer, this game has caught my attention. Truly a phenomenal master piece. You are free to do whatever you wish in this game. From building, to crafting, to hunting, to taming dinosaurs, to deep sea diving, to flying, to killing, to talking, to creating. Whatever you wish to do that other games doesn't have accessible, this game has in abundance. Blows games like call of duty, grand theft auto, and league of legends out the water! All the games listed has limitations that shouldn't be limited in 2022, and that makes Ark is just the perfect game to play in this time in life. This game is still ahead of its time, i am shocked it isn't as popular as all the latter games. This game is perfect for people that tests the limitations of gaming. PVP or PVE, loads of hours to play and much more to achieve than the regular game. Can be relaxing and adrenaline pumping all in one session. Beautiful game, hard to beat this concept of gaming."

25212,It depends on the person if u have a bunch of spare time n like grinding n dinos it might be good but if u dont then noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo also pvp kinda sucks

25215,great game but as boring as minecraft
25216,"[b] Highly recommend this game.  I have an additional ~300+ hours on the PlayStation 4 version. I mostly play single player, but it is much more fun and less time consuming to play with friends. Try to get it while it's on sale, it's definitely a huge bang for your buck. [/b]

You will learn how to play through trial and error(or just search up a YouTube tutorial on the basics, lol). If you like the accomplishment of working toward long-term goals, this is the game for you. If you care about your tames, then sob when they get stuck in a river and succumb to a pack of prehistoric jellyfish, this is the game for you. If you need instant gratification upon opening the game, or dislike grinding, this is definitely not for you. Get used to dying, it is inevitable. 

This game requires a massive amount of time and patience to progress through, but trust me, it is worth it in the end."

25247,"Best dinosaur game of all time.

... Also biggest hate-love relationship of any game I have played ...

You can really lose yourself in this world, extremely immersive. Beautiful world, dinosaurs, exploration, undersea stuff (One of the best underwater experiences in any game to date), RPG mechanics, building... Like legit has everything...

The frustrating parts were bugs and glitches, many of which I think are resolved now, but caused many ragequits / loss of hours and hours of progress etc back in the day. There are also some really *really* annoying dinosaurs, and the settings could use some tweaking which brings me to my next point..

The ""hardest"" part was tweaking settings so it felt balanced but still challenging, removing or lowering spawn rate of a few super annoying dinos, updating the loot beacon drops (thank you beacon app), changing XP rates, altering when engrams are unlocked, adjusting player stats... But after going through and tweaking everything to be *just right* (for me), it is hard to find much to complain about.

There are a LOT of hours of fun here, just be prepared to not leave the house for a few days."

25305,"I do like this game, but my god the file size with all maps installed is bonkers.  Don't worry, you can install/uninstall them piece-meal.  On the other hand, the reason the files are so big are the graphics.  If you have a high end computer the graphics are gorgeous.  If you don't, you can crank the graphics way down.  It will definitely change the overall experience, but hey, you can at least run it.

There isn't a lot of direction in the game.  There aren't quests to guide you, it's more of an upgrade route to follow.  You want to kill/capture that dino?  Get a better weapon/gear -> better materials -> better (more appropriate) weapon/gear loop.  The xpacs offer some rewards for completing specific things, but it's skippable.  I prefer games with quests over blindly exploring, but you will usually find something cool if you just decide to go in a random direction to see what's there.  Oh and death.  Lots of death.  Unless you change the difficulty/health/lighting/resources.  There's pretty much a slider for everything. 
 So you want a punishing game?  Got it.  You want a casual tourist game?  More or less got that too.  Plus there is a creative mode.

Crafting.  I play this game solo, so I've made resource drops a bit faster for my own sanity, but not too easy either.  I don't really have an issue with the crafting itself, though some materials will tie you in knots trying to get enough of them to do what you want.  My issue is with the building.  W.t.f. game.  Why can't I lay my foundations where I want them.   Why can't I clip walls where in any sane world a wall could actually be.  You can build some pretty amazing stuff in this game, but if you try to do it, you too will know my pain.  I've uninstalled this game so many times just because I got mad when I couldn't build a flat platform without doing some crazy trick using pillars and ceiling tiles and fence foundations.  There's guides for this sort of thing, but I wish the devs could have devoted a bit more time into solving some of these quirks.  This is going to be a non-issue for a lot of players, but if you are into building you are going to have to look up tips to find out how you can create what you had in mind.  There's also codes to spawn whatever you want, so if you don't want to spend hours regathering resources when something didn't work they way you thought it would, you can just spawn it in for yourself.  

They actually add new dinos and new maps at a good pace but it might not be enough though to bring you back to the game if you don't enjoy repeating what you've already completed on a different play through.

I can't recommend multiplayer unless you are on a private server (which I've never played).  I've just played where one player is the host and another player joins the game (which was me).  It was ... frustrating.  There is a somewhat short tether distance where if you try to walk too far from the other player you will hit an invisible wall.  If you are at or close to that wall when your friend walks the opposite direction, it will drag you.  Drag you off cliffs.  Drag you into the swamp (lots of things want to kill you there).  Drag you into lava...  Your character is overloaded and can't move?  Don't worry, your friend can drag you back to base!  I just hope you survive the trip.

Overall yes, I enjoyed it.  Yes I would recommend it.  It IS more fun with your friends, but you might also need a lot of patience for it.  GL"
25306,it good game me like dinosaur

25311,Dinosaurs
25312,"can't refund because i spent over 2 hours just setting up a server and trying to connect to it, just to realize this game still looks like CS 1.6 and performs like a bad PC port. Clunky controls/movement, obnoxious as fuck head wobble and ugly as sin UI sprinkled with bugs that's been there since early builds apperently.
I can't believe this is considered a finished product after all of these years."

25333,"A game that is not worth buying, problems and updates every day, and the size of the game needs a completely empty computer, and the memory size is 1 terabyte, and all the game has errors, and in every update there are more problems and errors"

25343,"You can make a dino strip club... If you're prepared to lose 300GB of space.

Don't get me wrong, this game is wonderful. Big open worlds with tons to explore and a plethora of creative freedom to be had alone or with friends. I actually made a dino strip club once... Yeah you can actually do that. If you have an idea of a thing you want to build or create, you can probably achieve that in Ark. From building amazing fortresses across beautiful landscapes to taming a super wide range and diverse amount of creatures, this game offers plenty to keep the game fresh and inspirational. Genuinely one of my favourite games to play.

The downsides are:
1) It is unnecessarily massive. At least 300GB by the time you get extra maps etc... To the point where some people want to play it but can't due to its ridiculous size.

2) Some of the bosses are mental. You'd need at least 50 people and a ton of dinos to beat some of the bigger bosses. Realistically you'll end up spawning things in or using console commands in some way.

3) Finally; progression is slow in the long run. To genuinely unlock tekgrams etc you'd need to beat a ton of bosses on hardest difficulties which requires more hours than we're currently able to live for. So again, you'll likely just unlock things using commands.

I've played this game for almost 400 hours now and still get inspired to do new things all the time. I just hope one day they can focus on the gargantuan file size."
25344,ok
25345,dinosaur go rawr. very good and fun open world game
25346,no more dino only robo glitching
25347,good soup

25355,yes
25356,fun
25357,"Ark Survival, a game that contains a vast amount of bugs yet hard work is still being pumped into it. Starting out, the game isn't all that easy as you're just thrown in to fend for yourself as countless obstacles meet you. Finding out how to play isn't difficult with some tutorials or going through trial and error. I personally haven't played anything else other than single player since official is much harsher. Overall, the game is fun although it takes up a lot of space (along with the DLC's), can be laggy from time to time, and being more and more like a job to some people than an actual game."

25401,"The ARK has evolved into a gaming masterpiece since its days in early access. The maps are massive, lush and beautiful. The crafting is fun, and I personally find harvesting cathartic. The creatures in this immersive world are filled with life and purpose; with a majority of them serving as tamable vehicles for harvesting. If you were one of those kids with dinosaur sheets on your bed that dreamed of becoming a Paleontologist, this is the closest (I know) you can live out that ignorant fantasy.

Unfortunately, these creatures have the AI and will of a Terminator once they agro. You pray for glitches, you hope the creature traps itself on a rock, a tree, or some clueless dumb leaf eater decides to walk out the bushes and sacrifice itself for your escape. These creatures want nothing more than to tear your eyes out and laugh as you desperately run miles through an endless terrain searching for your corpse before nightfall, only to find your merciless cold blooded killer waiting for you to try and snatch your body from under its feet. That was fun right? ""We have such sights to show you"" - Hellraiser

If you have ever had the pleasure of playing the ARK, Im sure your more than familiar with how local players say hello. I do have to say, it is truly amazing that a game has the ability to cause so much PTSD, your questioning the legitimacy of your social relationships outside its coding. You don't trust anyone in the ARK! There is no room for weakness here. If you want to survive, you turn off all emotions in/out of the game because that is the savage mindset that knows only victory. You think those 30 sentry guns, Giga, Rex, Wyvern and rock golem stand a chance against bob, nooo! Bob is f-in crazy! If you see an idiot picking berries anywhere near your base, you implement operation psychological warfare. You recon, patrol and when he least expects it, you roll up on the most badass tame you got and say ""Hey friend, my name is friendly and I'm here to help."" 2 weeks of futile promises and grooming, you raid that berry picken hippies base at 4am Europe Time Zone, because you know he has to attend his Aunt's funeral at 8am. MUHAHAH who has the bullets now berry! Right? Wrong! Berry was a recruit sent by the Alpha tribe ""Script Kiddies"", u know that invisible base that has a no fly zone that manically grows overnight.

Then one day, you log on and you see it, the blue screen;  casually asking where you would like to spawn as if you never been here before. As you spawn in and walk twords your bases location, your heart, mind and soul is preparing for what you already know has happened. You hallucinate smoke coming up over the hill where your base wont be. It's gone. Everything is gone. All your tames were killed and probably eaten. The game became a job and your 401k ended up in the hands of a sadistic 15 yr old named ""Haha"" LVL 1, from Tribe ""thanks for all your stuff"". You are now an idiot.

After mending your relationships, you realize for 1500 hours, you got years of jokes about the time you traded your life to live with extinct animals and the ability to quietly assure yourself you know more than the Chicago Museum tour guide. A true savage never leaves the jungle ;)"
25402,"the game is very fun, though unforgiving. it's a classic survival game; meaning that you collect materials coming from the environment and animals that surround you. you are able to tame the dinosaurs and animals around you that will serve you in different ways wether that being farming, attacking or travel. there are a wide range of dinos that you will encounter as you make your way to the top. these will challenge you and  help you. overall i believe that this game is very good, though it needs some changes (that will probably not be coming out due to the new game ""ARK 2"")."
25403,good game to play
25404,"what feels like 8 years after early access, still runs like a low budget early access game"

"
25444,"This game is in my opinion overpriced. Too large to download. Gives you a headache if you don't have space. Also took me about 1 and a half days to download, it isnt my internet cause that is flawless it is 200 mbps and steam still has a way to screw it up downloading ark. I am using an external hard drive to download it . So overall too fricking expensive. 99$ for the 2T game drive and the price of the base game... I bought all the dlcs too :(. I mean i LOVE the game but the whole downloading process is way too difficult and kills my want to  download it."

Would you like to shoot your bestfriend with a bow and arrow? Maybe grief him/her with som tranq-arrows? What about a spear to the face? Or maybe you just want to kill them with a shotgun? Then this is the game for you!"

25456,VERY GOOD
25457,"I can earnestly say that 80% of the time I'm fighting the game itself instead of enjoying the gameplay.

The majority of the struggles I experienced would instantly disappear with a crafting UI rework. You will develop a workflow to crafting and building, only to have it smashed to bits as your crafting list gets shuffled around every time you learn something new. The folder sort seems the best choice, which is tragic because instead of hovering and pressing a single key in the list (usable! fast!), you are now double clicking in a sea of scattered category folders. That sorting isn't any better. Want to build a Wooden Triangle Foundation? It's not in the ""Structures > Wood"" category. Nope, it's in the ""Wood"" category! But a Wooden Wall is in ""Structures > Wood."" Got it? Want to build a roof for your house? I hope you can read, because the icons for ""Wooden Ceiling"" and ""Sloped Wooden Woof"" are identical. How about a hatch vs. a window? Well, the ""hatch"" icon is a rotated ""window"" icon - hope you know which one is which.

Notice how I haven't said anything about the joys of dino taming or the beautiful combat - because there are no joys or beauty, just Unreal Engine glitching out at you while you attempt to shoot tranq arrows at dinos that haven't caught up from their desync. You'll see them bleed, but nothing will actually register. Sometimes? Then, after 10 minutes of chasing them, they will glitch inside of you as they pass out, pinning you in mid-air, ripe for the Carnotaurus that just spawned in front of your face. Sometimes they skip the fanfare and go straight for the glitch, which is preferred, because I would rather suffer instantly than have it drawn out over 10 minutes. Sometimes?

All in all this game is fine and fun, but sometimes it can be so brutally, infuriatingly punishing in undeserved ways - especially if you don't know how to ""play the game."" I suggest you join an accelerated server (3x, 15x) and get to the meat, because learning how this game works is a process of never-ending, consummate suffering. I'm perfectly happy being Bob the Basic Bitch Builder, because the very idea of learning anything else in this game is stressful. Here's to ARK 2, glad they got Vin Diesel aboard I guess?"
25458,"it's alright, i guess..."
25459,This game is a game that has a lot to do and which brings hardcore gamer's and casual gamer's to come and play this amazing game about what life on earth would been like so long ago in the past in the best way they can while also making it entertaining to the players.

25475,Uh awesome game?
25476,it is very fun and entertaining highly recomend
25477,"OK. This game is amazing, BUT everything about the gameplay sucks. The devs only want money, that is why they constantly have more DLCs. But they neglect the actual game, the mechanics. Instead of trying to fix the performance issues or add things to the old maps, whick people love, they only pump out more DLCs. Here are a few things I find problematic:

- The flight system is too clunky and awkward.
- It is too easy to cheat when playing singleplayer.
- Even though it is a survival game, it feels more like a simulator, because you can change anything at anytime, basically cheating.
- After getting a few mounts, the main aspect, survival, falls apart and it becomes an RPG.
- The devs have had many YEARS to fix the performance issues, but it still runs absolutely terrible.
- The AI of tamed dinos are horrible. They will constantly walk off cliffs and die. Even when you walk slowly, dinos that follow you constantly move in circles behind you, instead of just following your path in a straight line.

So to summarise, this game and mechanics are amazing, but the gameplay is bad. The performance and AI is  bad and it is too easy to cheat, whick makes it feel more like a simulator."

25506,fun with friends
25507,"Ark is a great game. The PVP can be really nasty but that is kinda the point of ""PVP"".. It is really fun and exhilarating... Where I feel the game shines is in its PVE server... Each map has different bosses to work your way up and beat and some maps even let your character ascend higher than the initial level cap of 105 to the level of 180!.. It feels rewarding to reach higher levels to unlock things like tek gear and mechanics... I've played Ark since BETA and this game has changed sooo much since then.. I really enjoy it and feel there is enough content to keep you playing for a while.. dino breeding to take on boss's with 3 different difficulty levels makes you want to max out the stats of the dino's your breeding... its great..."
25508,h
25509,GOOD
25510,Love the game play but HATE the server lags!
25511,"very gud gam men go ple or di en tu daiz, bai viruus."
25512,Great game and they try to keep everything up to date
25513,I forgot it extinct now
25514,very good
25515,this game is good for all skill levels and hardware types.  There is a lot of content and tons of things to explore and find.  They add events and it is enjoyable to play with friends or alone.  The game setup is a lot to take in and you can just skip to the default especially if it is your first time but as you get more experience you can adjust things to take the monotony out of gathering resources or give yourself more carrying ability to just move things along. I like the challenge but I could do without so grinding or slow resource gathering.  I started this game on PS4 and now i much prefer the computer.  I pass this game on to everyone who like survival/ crafting/ open world games and dinosaurs are a big plus!!! There are some crazy concept animals and the seasonal events keep me coming back for more.  Stupid thanksgiving turkeys killed all of my dinos last year but ate them kicking and gobbleing this year!!
25516,very cool
25517,great game
25518,"good game, kinda

25530,"I've only played a few hours, but I can tell you that it's a lot of fun. Whether you play alone or with friends, you can always count on that alpha to sneak up on you. 

Do note that if you install all the DLCs, it requires a whole lot of space."
25531,is good
25532,Best game for a big group of people. Might be difficult to manage on your own as a single player
25533,pretty good game
25534,you need lots of time to play this game if your new i would recomment to start playing unofficial servers
25535,No
25536,A hoard of raptors ganged up on me like I owed them  eggs
25537,Best game ever but Studio Wildcard is suck.

Played ark on my Xbox one then Xbox series X and again on pc. This game is really fun especially for dinosaur lovers like me and many others. Mods make it a little easier at times. Game can crash if your running on high settings but my PC is pretty beefy so i don't have it happen to me. The DLCs add even more fun/play-ability. Exploring different maps and taming different creatures is a blast especially with a group of friends. Some bad things i can say are: Game play can be repetitive, there are no secondary saves so you are stuck with the singleplayer world you have. PvP is a mess unless you know wassup. But its super easy to sink hundreds of hours into it as i have over 1000 on my xbox. Would recommend
"
25540,ITS A VERY COOL GAME

Only to get stuck on a rock, have all my weapons break, and be forced to fight a large bird with scissors which were then stolen. It was only a miracle that I got out of the rock and made it back to my base. 10/10 best game would fight with scissors again."

25636,very good game to play with friends
25637,"It is a fun game and I do recommend trying it out. It feels like Minecraft and Terraria combine in one mix with a reality mod. It is like the Real life mod in minecraft but just better. Also, riding dinosaurs and robo dinos? Seems very awesome."

25654,"Ark, a true love hate relationship on steroids! You learn to except bugs as features in the game and find yourself every night looking at the clock questioning how its 2am already. No matter how much abuse I have taken in this game from PvE or PvP I still come back begging for more! I would happily buy this game again without hesitation, nearly 900 hours in game and I still haven't managed to catch every dino!!!"
25655,very good game !!!!!!!!!!
25656,its really fun
25657,"Lost 20 tamed dinosaurs, got killed at least 50 times from fish, and saw a friend of mine get killed by a swarm of leeches. What a fun game ;) I totally recommend it B)"

25669,its so good
25670,its fun
25671,"The game is great conceptually, however I wish the game was just better in some of the framework elements."
25672,UMM ITS NOT WORKING WHY THE FUCK
25673,Awsome game just buggy
25674,"I've tried it for half an hour.

Technical problems:
The game first tried to run in windowed mode and 1600 by 900 resolution instead of 1920x1080. Changing to 1920x1080 did nothing at first. I had to switch back and forth.

Game mechanics:
There is no handholding or introduction to the environment. You have to figure out everything on your own. You wake up on the beach and... Nothing happens. No voices or quests or anything. There are no tooltips to indicate what items are interactable. You cannot see the level of enemies and whether they are friendly or not. A level 32 dino killed me in a starting area marked Easy. I became hungry and started suffering because of it fast.

I paid very little for the game and I am not going to refund it but playing it? Only if there are mods to fix what I cannot stand. A very strange game. I guess it is what Survival means after all but I don't like it."

25717,"good
"
25718,"absolutely the most infuriating game i have ever played in my entire life, pc version much better than ps4 version- i've put hours into this on ps4 and finally upgraded to the pc version. do not get for console.

i cannot describe the pain, frustration, and pure rage i have felt over this game

definitely worth playing"
25719,yes
25720,best
25721,it is a great game
25722,Would recommend the game but it honestly in my own opinion is too late to buy the DLC'S as this studio is making a ARK 2 i have all the DLC'S on playstation and would recommend that you do get them its just a little too late in my opinion to buy them again and also if you decide to join a PVE server there are some people who love to cause trouble and make your life a miserable mess for absolutely no reason
25723,very fun reccommended
25724,its a fun game
25725,I can eat my feces that automatically makes the game good
25726,Brillaint game i love it so much cant wait for ark 2 if it is coming
25727,good
25728,best game mods do anything so fun
25729,"I got perma banned from global servers. I make mesh base because I have a job IRL and wanted to save my stuff....

25730,It's good
25731,SUPER FUN Takes a little to stay a live i would recommend a playthrough to watch on youtube before starting.
25732,"Its a fun old game that gets an game 2 later this year, and i will 100% buy that, but i think this is a good simulation to whats its gonna be."

25740,good
25741,the game is cool
25742,This game is very fun and i recommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games or dinosaurs!
25743,Dodo is best armor in game
25744,"so good
"
25745,yup
25746,"This game will always be a masterpiece! I have so many good memories and experiences from it. From leading the most amazing alpha clan, with wonderful people, on PvP servers back in the days. To PvE with friends, and doing all the exciting and silliest things ever possible. Can't wait to see how Ark 2 will turn out. I hope it will be equally amazing. I love the more primitive aspect of this game to be honest, but also the freedom to go high end tech if one wants.

Endless possibilites. Lots of freedom to do whatever you want, and sink a lifetime into it
It's been an honor"
25747,"
"
25748,"Fun game lots to do, and lots of fun to be had"
25749,yes dino
25750,great game
25751,".
"
25752,Dinosaur go roar.
25753,"it good trust me 
"
25754,"the only context in which you can say ""I LOVE BREEDING"" and be considered normal"
25755,I played way too mutch of this game on xbox 700h+ and than i decided to buy it on PC and i must say the game is pretty f*cking good.
25756,"I have now put 1000h into this game on Xbox. And so i decide i would give the Steam version a whirl. i haaw been a nice surprise to see how much better this version is, compared to Xbox. Objectivly seen it is a bad game with a ton of bug and glitches but i enjoy it."
25757,"First off I will go over the Pros:
Challenging game play, in depth crafting system, bases are pretty sweet to make, Dinosaurs, absolute blast to play with friends.

Now for the cons: 
Dinosaurs. Nothing sucks more than being level 5 with nothing but a hatchet then getting your cheeks clapped by an angry raptor that you cant outrun and didnt have the bola's on you to stop it from moving. Big ouch. Also Brontos stomp on everything. Pain. The learning curve takes some getting used to and solo play can get a bit boring but this is definitely a title to play with friends and mod. The mods are great so definitely use em."
25758,this game made my cat grow wings so yea i would recommend it
25759,YES
25760,"I enjoy to play this game
"
25761,Awesome !
25762,Gut gam
25763,Controls are an un-intuitive mess and it runs like a pig.

25766,gg
25767,Worth to buy during sale if you tried it on Epic and like the game.
25768,great even on pc which i still cant control the survivor
25769,the game been crashing all day uni and re installed which takes 50 years multiple times and still crashing
25770,very fun game to play with ur friends and pass some time the modded community is active with very good mods really usefull mods that change the game for the better very recommended if u have friends to play with
25771,"I have played this game for a long time now, and I have enjoyed it quite a lot! Dinosaurs and other prehistoric-related things have been a big interest to me for a long time, and Ark has just always been a really good way to have that. Ark is just an insanely huge game with all kinds of things to do, which is really fun as a prehistoric survival game. There are plenty of bosses, advancing, and story to go through with this game and is one that I always come back to for more!"
25772,i have no dislikes for the game it is a great game with pvp and pve so its for all
25773,10/10
25774,Doedicirus go brrrrrrr

25781,the most fun survival game i've ever played
25782,expect to die repeatedely in most servers you join but once you get past that and the usual toxicity of the people in each server its very fun game!
25783,Only play if you have a really well built pc/or have a custom built pc thats strong enough to run it.
25784,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
25785,it broke my external drive
25786,"its free until june 19th 2022, get it and play free maps and mods with friends!"
25787,"Gooooood Gammmmmme 
"
25788,I know way too many facts about dinosaurs now.
25789,"Pretty good game, I guess. You might get a few hours of enjoyment out of it as long as you stay away from the beach and out of reach of those dang Ichthyornis."
25790,good

25796,Dino game get it good UwU
25797,"this is an amazing game if you like breaking your monitor, falling down mountains, dying from cold with a torch out, playing for 5 hours to tame 1 dinosaur ark is a great game if you hate yourself and like breaking things. this game gives you depression and PTSD."
25798,tabien
25799,"I love this game. The PVE of the game is just amazing, endless content, like 10 maps with different dinos and bosses. The PVP is only good if u play with friends and have a lot of time to play (i mean, like 16 hours per day)."
25800,it smells

25802,"amazing 100% my top game

25804,very fun.Dino
25805,"very cool
"
25806,"fun
"
25807, best game ever
25808,"This game can be both fun and frustrating at the same time.   Fun meaning the initial stress of building up and surviving in the game map can be intense with the excitement of your first tame and riding it.  Frustrating due to huge game size, crashes, getting killed multiple times when first spawning in, and waiting for mods to install if you want to play on a unofficial server.  

1 - My advice is your playing solo game selection is to load 1 mod at a time and keep it to under 12 mods.  Also, never rely on game to keep your save intact.  I've lost 25 hours of building because game crashed and corrupted my files.  Personally,  made a shortcut to ark > shooter game > saved.  Depending on what your doing in game (building, dino leveling) created two seperate folders to manually backup the game files every 30-60 minutes.  Better to lose 60 minutes than 50 hours.

2 -Use local files scan to check games files often. (It will take awhile).

3- Play with buddies if possible or a descent tribe on pvp.

4- Play on xbox game pass to try it out or wait for a good discount before buying."

25819,VERY FUN GAME!! LOVE IT 100%
25820,"If you like dinosaurs, survival, building, leveling up, fighting and riding dinosaurs and bosses you'll like this game. You can customize your game however you want with settings and mods so if you don't have a lot of time just bump everything up but you won't want to change it otherwise cause unless you have a group of people stuff takes FOREVER! Also make sure you have tons of space on your harddrive cause this game is HUGE especially with any of the DLC's"

You will die, the game will cheat you until you die, and you will love it. This game will take away everything you love and you will love it for it. Do not play this game unless you want to feel pain and pleasure like you walked into Satan's realm of concubines."

25851,"It's super fun and addictive, for one! There's lots you can do, and now with the DLCs out you have even MORE crazy creatures you can tame, and even more areas to build up in! Of course, such a giant game doesn't come without it's bugs, but they certainly don't take away from the game in my own experience-- And I am still a freshly cut noob in this community!

It's, in my own personal opinion, one of THE best, and most creative and fun survival games to date!"

25855,"Guide to ark.

1. Buy game
2. Download game ( its a BIIIGG one )
3. Play game
4. Land a custom ark ( There a bit more easy then story arks )
5. Dont land redwoods 
6. As soon as you land into a ark assess your surroundings, if you see a carno just accept your death or RUN!!!
7. Get a rock and hit a tree minecraft style.
8. Hit a rock with ur rock to get flint and craft a pick and axe.
9. Craft many bolas to trap raptors that come to munch you.
10. Use a bola to trap a pt and use a bow and arrows ( which i forgot to tell you to craft earlier )
11. Get to level 16 ( i think ?? ) to unlock the pt saddle
12. Take to the skies, explore, steal a wyvern egg, start a  family, do what you want.

Hope you enjoyed this review/ guide, BTW it is a wonderful game, no complaints :)."

25899,game used to look just ok and now looks like dog shit. The devs should have worked out graphical bugs by now but i guess they have given up on their one popular game.
25900,Has Dinos
25901,Its a incradible survival game
25902,"The game is really fun, exciting and very beautiful. It has a story with several bosses, and a lot of different dinosaurs to play around with. There is a lot of technology to learn as well (Weapons, defense item e.g).

Why the negative rating?
Well, to put it simply.... the game runs like horsepoo. You would expect an old game to be stable, but ARK lets you down. There is endless bugs and even game breaking glitches. Some of these glitches and bugs have been here for years. Why have they not been fixed? Because the game developers simply don't care about the game itself. They have made quite a bit of DLC's that cost A LOT for what you actually recieve. The devs, have become a lot like Microsoft and EA, money over satisfaction."

i play on ps4 thats why the play time is so low"
25920,nice :d
25921,"While it had and still has some performance issues and some odd decisions (especially later on in dlcs)
There's nothing quite the same as riding dinos and more with your friends. And exploring the map, while danger lurks around the corner.

Personally i loved the idea of aberration and rock drakes, and never understood why some disliked the map.
But also Valguero is amazingly lost world in vibe and the Deinonychus are fun as heck"
25922,"Ark is a fun single or multi-player game that has contains so many opportunities to advance and provides so much time to complete the game.  There is really no end to the game unless you count defeating all the bosses, there are lots of things harder than defeating the bosses.  Adding on to the abilities of the game itself, the mods are some of the best mods I have seen for any game.  Primal fear is such a well produced mod that looks like Wildcard made it themselves.  Ark is often on sale during holidays, I have seen it sell for under $10, and I would 100% recommend purchasing Ark if its on sale.  Just be aware you might need to lower graphics as it can be a very needy game.  If you play on official PVP servers then be aware that you have to play like 12 hours a day just to survive for a week, there are so many mega tribes in ark that will kill any solo or small tribes.  Most solo players only last by uploading all their loot into drops or obs.  If you don't have time to play multiple hours a day, then you should stick to single-player or servers with just your friends."
25923,"the sheer capacity and weight that this game has, made me and only myself want to not only vomit but defecate, I also recall the character shitting on command, which made me want to defecate and not only that but also recall mild motion sickness the sheer capacity that this game holds is remarkable.

25980,"it is fun
"
25981,Nothing can beat how much fun I've had in this game.
25982,I think its amazing because of the mechanics and the maps. I had to install a mod called play as dino v2 because i dont want to make saddles for dinosaurs and I really reccomend Ark for Dinosaur lovers.
25983,Yeah it's a game.
25984,its fun
25985,"I've played this game quite a bit over the years and if it was not for the poorly optimized gameplay and disk space required for such an old game, I would have played this game way more.

This is probably the least optimized fully released game I've ever played. The developers spend their time releasing paid DLC's rather than optimizing the game.

I would have added if you have a PC with insane specs that you should be able to have a better experience, but why should a user's rig determine if you would enjoy a game or not?"
25986,If you have a fetish for gangs of raptors sliding in between your legs and fucking you over and over again like I do this game is for you
25987,fun game

26051,"Great game to get lost in, specially with friends!"
26052,It's one of those games that is really good when you play it the first time because you get to figure everything out. The downside of this game is that once you know everything it's not as fun as the first playthrough but its still ok
26053,its a very good game that is very underrated pls download it so there can be more people in the servers

26064,"I only have 14 hours on steam but I have well over 2000 on xbox. This game has its flaws but it is one of my favorites. I do recommend at least starting with PvE. PvP can be really rough and is where a lot of the complaints come from. At the very least a very fun game to play single player or PvE with friends. If you enjoy PvP (Which I do and play many game similar to this) This game has very a lot of grind. But I have never come across a game with a better rewarding feeling. Grind a few hours of raid supplies, Then you gain days or weeks of work and gear. This game is also amazing if you love dinosaurs which I am kind of nerd when it comes to dinos so I love that to!"
26065,I love this game! There are some glitches but hey i deal cause im enjoying the dinosaurs and treasures!
26066,Its a generally fun game but if your not playing on a server its a pain to play with others. Like when you play in a co op with your friends but there is a tether distance and you cant do anything as a non host. If they fix that the game would definitly be better for casual players but other than that a enjoyable game.
26067,pretty good game if you're alone with no friends lol

26113,"This game allows me to relive those halcyon days of my autistic obsession with dinosaurs with a bit of Minecraft and Turok-esque flare thrown in for good measure. I actually first bought this game when it first released in Early Access back in 2015 but I could never play it because my PC was garbage at the time.. I didn't sincerely get a legitimate opportunity to play it until about 2019 but I even held back then because I didn't feel like allocating the MASSIVE amount of space required just to install the damned thing. 

Now that I got a rig that can handle it I cam finally play out all my childhood fantasies of taming dinos with rocket launchers n' shit."

26133,"What can I say about Ark? Well..

Ark is a special game for me. It was one of the first survival multiplayer games I ever played. I started back when Scorched Earth had just come out and was still on my old account. But, just like even now, I loved every second of it.

Ark has a way of mesmerizing people who play it. Despite it seeming to be outdated at times graphically, it runs extremely well. For a long time I switched over to Conan due to the RP mechanics and items it had. But, with a little bit of modding, you can get those similar adjustments. (I highly recommend Castles. Keeps, and Forts but to each his own). In spite of Arks numerous flaws, I cannot help but find myself attached to it by the hip.

I have 150 hours on my original account. 447 at the time of this review here. Plus an unknown amount on PS4 (which I played with my girlfriend before her computer could handle PC version). I cannot recommend this game enough for those who enjoy this genre and the elements presented. If you like dragons, dinos, and guns? It's all there for you. If you wanna be a viking and rough it out there with no weapons that are space age? There is stuff for you too with primitive and such. It's a blast.

9/10. Mad you don't have more in-game cosmetics and RP elements built in, but still love you and your awesome dino's all the same. Will most likely plug many more hours into it (hype as all hell for Fjordur).

Meet you on the seas, vikings and warriors alike.."

26142,"Really addicting game, and fun to play, there are quite a lot of bugs that are still present from back when I used to play Ark on PS4.

You do need quite a modern system to be able to play this game smoothly at a reasonable FPS.

Although it does take a good PC with a lot of storage space to play, it is still worth trying out.

26180,"Lets talk about this game.. This mess of a game... I love this game! I love the taming, I love the adventures with friends. And I love that there is so much to do in this game. It is a time sync from hell so if you don't have the time I would not even bother enless you are playing on a private server. There is a lot of things you can do in this game but it will also frustrate the hell out of you. And to top it all off it you play on a pvp server. You will be flying around and bases spawn in late and suddenly you have 12 heavy turrets pointing at you. 

Despite all of its negatives, it is a game that I always find myself coming back to just simply for the adventures and the fun. I know people that have over 8k+ hours in this game and they wouldn't take back a moment of it. Avoid pvp when you first start playing enless you have friends to play with. Matter of opinion ofcourse.

Good luck survivors! And may the odds forever be in your favor."

This game says theres crossplay between pc and xbox but its the most difficult process i've seen in any video game. I still have yet to figure out how to just make a game with me and my friend to just have fun and mess around on. I looked on google and it said a dedicated server but when I try to make one the game closes and it brings up a line of code. Please fix this feature and just let players make a private server for them and theirs friends, and make it simpler than whatever you have going on now."

"
26229,This game would be the best game if it worked well
26230,"It's a good game, with two probably fatal flaws that are dealbreakers for most people
1: load times on a HDD are absolute ass
2: The game with no DLC is 100GB, and with all of the DLC added up is almost 400GB. (which is ludicrous to say the least)
3: Outgoing Reliable Buffer Overflow, You will see this error a LOT if you play on non dedicated servers and have to have your player data reset.

If you can look past these just buy it already, if not, well either find another game or buy a really big SSD, at least the download is compressed to only 1/10th the size.
Note to Steam: Give us neutral reviews already...
oh well I marked it negative (thanks steam) so I guess I have to nitpick something.. hmmm idk how bout the water being unrealistic levels of reflective, with a really bad implementation of screenspace reflections, ok I hit my nitpick quota goodbye, gonna sink my next thousand hours into minecraft but with dinos."

Whether those issues arise from incompetent development, executive decisions to focus on new content instead of repair or just an abject failure to adequately provision hosting, by now it's largely irrelevant.
At the end of the day, the game is broken and the developers don't care. They already have your money."

26254,"Do not Buy this game. Its so buggy and it will cost you everything. You spent a week getting ready to tame a dino. the game will bug you will some how die. and your dino will die before you can get back to it. the game will time you out. and the smallest of creatures will kill you. or itll read your still in game, and your tame your ridding will sit there and die. tames can move for no reason, so expect them to run off sometimes and just die getting ganked in a wall. Building is broken unless you build next to no walls. so you better be with a squad cause if you are a solo or duo you cannot build in the open or itll get raided pvp. and pve people will block off every good spot to build even if they are not living there. they will block off all the loot drops so only they can get them. This game has so many broken bugs since day one it blows my mind. night time is pitch black. so you have to not play for what ever the amount of time night is which is so inconsiderate to people who cant play non stop but thats not even a huge issue. its the amount of bugs. rubber banding is horrible. you can get warped backwards into a dinos mouth and die. you can try to close a gate on a mount and die cause it nocked you off instead of closing the gate. you can be on a water mount and get timed out so you float and drown. all these will happen 100% so unless your cool with actually wasting days worth farming casue of bugs dont buy this game."

26310,I love this game... from 2019 january
26311,Loved it gives a lot of game time and is an overall fun exploration and survival game just watch out for the deaths theres a lot of them
26312,"Played Ark on PS4 for a couple years but recently upgraded to a gaming PC instead on opting for the PS5. The mouse and keyboard controls took a bit of getting used to but I'm almost there. 
When you drop into Ark for the first time, it takes a bit of getting used to, I'd say more than most games. But after some rude awakenings such as, getting killed by a turtle you just punched and starving to death, you start to get the hang of it. Ark offers many worlds you can explore and build on. The crafting inventory is vast and overall the game provides just the right difficulty with a bit of comedic relief when you drown a friend! 

I'd give Ark and 8/10 and a must play for those who are into open world crafting and survival games. Nothing beats trapping and taming a wild lvl 300 Giga for the first time."
26313,100% love this game.  Prepare to lose all your time on it! Super addictive!!
26314,"An survival game with DINOSAURS!!! This game was the reason i build my first gaming pc. It is one of the best survial games. Go from thatch walls to metal walls, slingshot to advanced rifles, dodo to an gigantosaurus. It is a rich game with a lot of content,  great maps. You can choose to play on large servers or create an local map or server on your pc, like i did. Great game to play with friends."
26315,fun indeed
26316,Perfecto
26317,"started playing 5 days ago, i'm an atheist, but i would like to take this opportunity to thank baby jesus for this game."
26318,"buggy and janky af. bug where dinos dont want to follow me, even after endlessly toggling their bust ass menu. crafting list doesnt want to show when i hover over most of the time, etc. not to mention horrible jump physics and the fact that you die from 5 feet in the air? like come on i can punch dinosaurs with my bare fist, WHY DO I DIE FROM A 5-6 FT JUMP. has good potential but they really need to just fix this game and make it....... good."

26330,"the game is good on its own with lots of gaming content, but with mods addede it can be even more of a blast its one of my favourite games ever"
26331,"it's a very diverse, cool game. only downside is that it takes up so much space. 

many dino's to tame, many caves/dungeons to explore. 
many many mutations to get, and then you have the modpacks on servers,, they add so much QOL and other things, it's insane how well put together this game is."
26332,funnnn
26333,"Actually have over 1,000 hours total from Xbox, so i can definitely say I hate this game with a burning passion, and will never stop playing it ever."
26334,I guess its a good game. Before you know it 10k hours of your life will be gone.
26335,"It can be buggy but it brings so many worlds to explore, excited for ark 2"
26336,"good game,good dinosaurs,good times,"
26337,get it now
26338,Pretty fun game. Some of the complaints I have go away when trying similar games such as 7 days to die and Conan exiles. Cant wait for Ark2!!!
26339,I shot dinosaur and it fell over and I forcefed it drugs so I could make it my friend so I could run arround killing other dinosaurs and beating up everything.
26340,fun
26341,dinos and guns and stuff
26342,L game
26343,It is okay.
26344,this is such a fun game to play single-player and multiplayer but the only downfall is how much storage it takes up if you don't have that much storage
26345,",mb,j"
26346,love ark it has its ups and downs but i love the game
26347,"I have always liked this game, ever since the beta came out. Sure there are a few things wrong with it but that's the case with every game.  I always have fun when I play."
26348,"This game is GREAT, it is better than your average survival game.  Only thing is make sure your settings to load world are good or you'll be like me, which i have lost 2 saves every morning.  But other than this it is a great game.

26356,dinos and wack lore
26357,aaaaa
26358,It's unoptimized and difficult to run at times. It's still really fun tho
26359,In a nutshell I'd say Ark is great. Waking up on the Island the first time is thrilling. But lol this game does not care if you live or die. I recommend playing in pve or host a world for friends to explore and get ahold of the mechanics. Official servers usually suck with whole/vital portions of a map blocked off.

26374,this game is actually quite expensive. you even need to pay twice: once 30 bucks for the game and then another 2.5k for a pc to run it on lowest graphics
26375,wertgsdfgdfvdfv
26376,A Perfect Game
26377,.
26378,Overall good chill and laid back game
26379,A bit buggy at times but not many games can hold a candle to this game. Official server settings are brutal for someone who has a life. But the accomplishments can feel very rewarding because it is so hard.
26380,SOooooooooooooooo good
26381,"Dislike: All the bugs that the game has despite being out for so long
Pros: Love all the dinosaurs, and the SP aspect is fun too."
26382,great game if you have 10 or more friends for pvp
26383,"You have fallen through the world and died, would you like to respawn?  Well, too bad.  You fell through the world on respawn and died.  We are listing this as a suicide.  Why did you kill yourself like that?   Don' kill yourself when you fall through the map again in 15 minutes."
26384,Love the fact that you have to train and can ride dinos.  Fun game but can get aggravating when playing solo.
26385,This is the best game ever!!! Not just the fact it has dinosaurs it has really good graphics

26406,"This game is great until you play it. UI is absolute garbage. I have everything up to Genesis Season 2 and have been a big fan for over 3 years now, having started on console. Sadly there are a few aspects of it (UI, construction, level scaling, loot, crafting, Dino commands, etc.) that desperately need to be fixed."

26450,yup
26451,"A few years ago I was Globally Banned for a tribemate meshing on Gen 1 when it was first released. I had only joined that server to defend it in a raid which was over a month before the ban. I refuse to buy this game again and so am only allowed to play on Unofficial Servers. I will NOT be paying for Ark 2 Either!

Love the game! The ""support"" department could use some more brains..."
26452,Radical Dino Game
26453,"Very toxic game
"
26454,mid
26455,bad game
26456,"Fun and challenging game, great for single player mode (I avoid PVP) and some PVE servers are a lot of fun."
26457,"its oryte,yeah pretty oryte hey"

26463,Great game to play with friends and Dinosaurs
26464,"absolute garbage. on the lowest settings it only maxes out at 12 fps, the main menu is so glitched I have to reinstall it multiple times to click the play button. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"

26470,"This game is very fun to play, it is one of the best survival games out there (in my opinion) and it gives such a good vibe playing this game. Ark is very fun playing alone, but with friends, mmmh. It gives such an experience. This game is mostly focused on surviving on an island with enemy dinosaurs, but those enemy dinosaurs can be yours. I would recommend this game to everyone. If you like dinosaurs, play this game. It is my favorite game right now and i really enjoy it and I hope you do to! :D Have a nice day."
26471,cool fun game to play with friends make a tribe and clap heads but theres dick heads on pvp that troll and spawn kill with their lvl 999999 rexes
26472,It is a really nice Game.
26473,awesome

26479,"I am enjoying the game, because I am playing with friend who knows and understands the game.  Be prepared to watch a lot of videos to help you.  There are tons of parts to this game.  Glad it is not my first game."
26480,"Its a great survival game, but with dinosaurs!"
26481,funy dinosaur game
26482,"Another game of several that, at first, I truly didn't understand. It took a long time before coming back to it and now I am really glad I revisited. I feel like I have only just scratched the surface at 10 hours and can't wait to actually do some Dino taming and whatever else is in store."

"
26486,pretty good

26489,So good
26490,W
26491,just wow
26492,dinosaur
26493,"this game is pretty shit its not supported very well anymore but its still fun as hell and really adicting i have dedicated 6,300 hours of my life to this game and pvp on the offficial servers along with my own server"
26494,Spend 5 days taming something for it to die in 10 seconds
26495,"Survival + Dinosaurs. Whats not to love? Huge time sink if you play on official servers with default settings, but if youre into that, go for it, and if you arent, play unofficial or single player, where you can tweak the settings to what you desire. Bonus of unofficial and sp, theres a large active moding community adding new creatures, machines, resources, etc. The fun is endless, the struggle is real."
26496,"Dinosaur ate my ass 10 minutes in, would not recommend."
26497,"I have played this game for more than 3-4 years now, with literally 5888 hours on the game. I took months break every now and then, and mainly played on unofficials. I just joined ""smalltribe"" server and instantly i was ""login lock"" while i was fighting these guys who i was saying "" ive found post about dev selling cheats for 100-200 a month"" i am not too sure if they were the dev team but they were able to "" login lock"" me. today is 4/7/22 DONT PLAY ON OFFICIALS there are tons of hackers and if you get unlock and landed on devs team servers you will get abuse."
26498,Good Game
26499,"This game needs to go on sale right this instant! I am so tired of waiting, I simply don't have enough money to buy the full game. Please go on sale I needz its folk - Marios black friend :steamhappy:"
26500,cool
26501,ye
26502,good
26503,"As any game does; it has issues. However, It is fun and creative. Better in a group but do not rely on the progress of other players. There is simply too much to look at and investigate. Much better experience when everyone works together though. Ark 2 is coming soon so I hope they address some of the simple quality of life updates and glitches."
26504,"Game is cock and ball torture on steroids, like some real pain Olympic level stuff we're talking about here. If you like games where the devs ignore the perfectly fine mesh system in unreal engine and write their own shitty mesh system that results in 80% of the player base to glitch into and raid/build from under the map you'll love this."
26505,"best game ever
"
26506,"Laggy servers, can't play official and they don't list unofficial servers with population. Shit game."
26507,I hate this game.
26508,Killed my first pc but overall great game ngl
26509,"AMAZING never had as much fun being fucked by a game
"
26510,"hehe dino go brrrrr
"
26511,great game worth the money especially with friends or by yourself if you wanna grind or get a full experience
26512,Jogo e muito ruim
26513,I love the game. Yet I hate how many times my dinos have died due to a glitch where they cant get out of an attacking creature and my dino is just stuck and dies
26514,"you have a lot of freedom and choice in this game, you can play single player and multiplayer, and you get to tame dodos :D 

no but this is a really cool exploration game where you can either tame an army of dodos or spend 100 hours of your life guarding a base on a pvp server (there are pve servers to)"

26522,"Ark: Survival Evolved is a survival game, like about a million other works floating in Steam.
To the extent who is not familiar, the idea is to collect raw materials from nature, which can be used to build houses, traps, clothes, equipment, weapons and know what else. Hunger, thirst, cold and heat take turns whipping and needs should be taken care of.

Ark’s endeavours to stand out from the grey-brown survival amusement mass is twofold. To begin with of all, the island is without a doubt overflowing with horrendous numbers of distinctive ancient animals, from little dodos to gigantic reptiles. They are not as it were threats and sources of assets, but too potential partners. On the off chance that you'll be able crush sufficient, you'll tame your knight Tyrannosaurus rex or a few other monster reptile. Another realization is that whereas the amusement begins with the sticks and spears swinging at the feet of the dinosaurs, the game really happens in the future or something.

The thoughts are great and Ark could be a versatile and comprehensive amusement on paper that gives a parcel to do for those who like it and, in theory, make it into thousands of hours. As a very good idea, you could point out that the parameters of your own server - or if you play alone, your own game - can be adjusted exactly to what you want. On the off chance that you don’t want to spend tens of hours collecting sticks and twigs from the woodland to urge to the circles and laser rifles, you'll turn the pace of dispersion of involvement focuses and assets and ended up a demigod in less than a unit of time.

At the heart of the amusement are too the involvement focuses and the levels you collect through them. By gathering assets, building things, and battling other island tenants, an involvement scorecard is filled, and once you race, you get one or two more focuses for one of your qualities — counting starvation and thirst — and a number of capacity focuses to open unused formulas.

Some time recently you'll have fun, you've got to persevere hours of deadness. The issue is exacerbated by bouncing to a server that already has more experienced players at much higher levels, with whom there's nothing to do unless you get benevolence from neighborly partners.

Pros.
- Wide-open amusing world.
- Completely lootable combat and player raids.

Cons.
- Colossal time sink.
- Grindfest.

Overall.
Ark may be a amusement with sufficient good ideas and great execution. It moreover includes a companion, which demonstrates that on a long surface you'll be able get a part out of Ark. On the other hand, so are handfuls of other survival recreations, numerous of which do much superior than ordinary. You'll not be able to ride in them with a dinosaur or shoot a laser weapon, but not one or the other can you in lifestyle on the off chance that the enthusiasm for the amusement passes on from destitute arranging, destitute instructing, and bounty of issues right from the beginning.

Actually, I don’t see exceptionally numerous reasons why you ought to not select Ark in the event that you're fascinated by a great survival adventure.

26523,fun
26524,Good game
26525,Lots of variety and with Steams Mod ability you can make it a little more you. a good survival game for sure
26526,IT Very good
26527,"Game is good but when you invite someone or try to join their game either the server doesnt show up at all, the entire game crashes, or it just doesnt work all together, thats with the non-dedicated.
When using mods some find they work but when i add mods into the active bar, instantly after i press play for singleplayer the game crashes, thats just with one mod."
26528,The game is good with friends or if you are looking to pour hours into something.
26529,poopoo
26530,"mods are great and even vanilla is awesome, even better with a few friends along with you but def try it out!"
26531,Very good for high-end pcs but i can only run on high graphics so its still decent ig maps are kidna expensive tho

26534,you can ride dinos
26535,"If you have played minecraft then this game takes it to another level. Remember, this is not an easy game, there are always predators ready to kill you when you spawn. This game is great with friends, lots of content, never ending adventures if you keep exploring various maps. Each map has unique locations to make your base, explore new biomes, do boss fights, and even PvP if you want to experience a battle between tribes. There are official servers which are mostly full but they keep adding new servers to play. They are also working on new creatures most of the time as we speak. 

Some maps of this game are really old like Island which are not highly optimised but they still work decent on a GPU like GTX 1060. Don't think that the game is really bad optimised because considering the time this was released, there weren't many games like this.

So many new maps and we can't forget that Ark 2 is also in development which is based on Unreal Engine 5 and you will be able to see Vin Diesel in it.
Super Excited for it to launch, go watch the trailer if you haven't.

Note: Would not consider buying this if you don't have a decent GPU. It's a heavy game."
26536,"ark is a very good game, its worth the space it takes PRO TIP: Delete games on steam you dont play it may show they take no storage. But in reality they take a ton have fun taming these amazing creatures!

26551,"This game is custom adventurer's paradise. Don't like something? Change the settings. Want More? Get a mod. Easy to customize almost anything your heart desires with a huge community to support you. As great as it is, there are always downsides. Survival in ARK means eating and drinking and pooping and managing those things to your benefit. Taming Dino's is great. Combat sucks. It's basically clicking till something dies. Building is awesome, though hauling materials to and from your base is tedious. The game is truly great with the right settings and utterly horrible with the wrong ones. I wouldn't play it without mods, especially structure and cosmetic mods, and not without adjusted taming speeds etc."

26565,this game very naice
26566,There's Dinosaurs
26567,Very Good Game.  PLAY IT OR ELSE YOU WILL REGRET IT (unless you have no space on your computer) :D
26568,"It's not optimized as well as other games (the Recommended specs should actually be the Minimum in my opinion). It's buggy in places but in my experience these are very few and far between. It does not hold your hand, not even a little bit. These are perhaps the only ""bad"" points I would perhaps mention to a prospective buyer. 

HOWEVER!!

The sheer size and scope of the developers dream is missed by a lot of players. This game is massive! Admittedly, I only play in single player. This is fine for me and is completely do-able. Yes, you can solo the ARK as many YouTubers can show you. The single player experience can be tweaked to accommodate almost any player. From the younger to the mature, from the casual to the hardcore, from the fast pace lovers to the hard-slog purists. It's all possible from the game settings menu.
For a Single Player experience just click on Host/Local and this will take you to your game settings for whatever play style you want. It does require some research as to what each setting is/does but once this has been sorted, and you have the settings tuned nicely to you, you will have a game that will keep you entertained for several weeks on a single playthrough (if you are a gaming God & dependant on settings) but more likely for months and years.
It is a sandbox game, with a storyline, that has been done in such a seemless fashion that you can play it in a purely sandbox style but you can also follow the story. No other game I know of , and in my opinion, has managed to present a true sandbox game, with a story, and it remained a true sandbox. 
Then there is ARK: Survival Evolved.

So, should you buy? Well ARK 2 is on the horizon. You could wait and see if it is optomized any better but then it will probably require an even beefier pc than it's older sibling. I believe ARK is worth every penny even at full price but seeing as it has been around for 6 years you should be able to grab it at some point for a reduced price. If you do decide to try it, I wish you many, many hours of thoroughly enjoyable gaming."
26569,Lots of mod content and the base game has plenty to do eve if you don't apply mods.

26580,"Honestly, Ark could use a better crafting system and explaining the mechanics better. Also some of the mods, that are generally small, could use better coding so it doesn’t crash the game. Though all-in-all, not awful, not a bad game. Though if you’re not used to survival open world games, definitely don’t use it for a first time experience."

26585,"Returning to this game after a couple of years. Adjusting options before starting the game. The game is constantly crashing at the options screen; if I just do nothing and let it rung, it will crash within ten seconds. This has happened a dozen times and I am not yet through all the adjustments I want. I had no issues two years ago, but now it is not boding well."

26620,"Don't bother with this game.
Long story short, laggiest that exists, shitty community (people are griefing even in pve servers), FULL of bugs and exploits, people can go trough walls and into your home and the worst part of all, the GM are the worst Support I ever talk to in any game / product. You lose your character due to shitty bugs and the queue for a GM to talk to you about it is 2 and a half MONTHS, wtf ! 
Also, they don't trust you, you need to take SCREENSHOT for absolutely EVERYTHING you do in-game because you must have ""proof"". And sometimes, even proof is not enough, my tribe lost 946 dinos (all event coloured, good stats, level 377+ etc.) in 2 minutes due to bug, we were online and they were ""decaying"" and took screenshots and everything and the gm simpliy told us they will restore 10 (TEN) dinos and they will be non-even non-bred and level 150. F**king joke of a support."

26662,"This game has so much potential to be a good game but the developers continue to just release new packs while never fixing the glitches and the base game. Movement needs to be revamped badly as it's so easy to get stuck in many places. Also the leveling system is awful in this game, you can be fully armed and get beaten to death by a high level player wearing nothing and wielding nothing who just uses his fists on you, and you will have listened to hundreds of hours of audiobooks already before you get to high level even when you are grinding and doing exactly the things that help you level up fast as possible, and if you are on a player vs environment server then everything will be built over to where you can't obtain any resources or do anything and if you're on a player vs player server your entire base and all your dinos will be wiped out by random Chinese players most likely while you're offline and you'll have to rebuild again from primitive and this will seriously thwart your efforts to level up."

26685,"For the people looking for a review of the single player experience and not downvotes from players with thousands of multiplayer hours...

This game has no tutorial, has no guiding goal, one of the worst user interfaces I've seen in 30 years, some of the worst optimizations I've seen (125 GB! Down from over 300 woohoo!), a useless long nighttime that forces you to change the brightness settings to do anything (?!?!?!?), and forces you to figure out what gives you XP (chopping wood.. wow) in order to grind it like a bot to progress in this game.

It probably is a good game later on. I just don't have the patience to go through something that's so poorly designed."

26800,"I really want to like this game.. But it is not worth the headache. Im sure this negative review does not matter much, as the game is so old and they have already cashed in on the community, but I wanted to share my frustration. This is one of the first PC games I purchased years ago, and I had only played like 3 hours. I recently talked my friend into buying it w/ all the DLC so we could play multiplayer. My other friend bought a server for us. Only to find out, I cant join any servers due to Fatal Error Line 516!!! I'd understand if this was a rare and random occasion, but upon troubleshooting the problem and finding no solution, I found that this kind of thing has happened many times to many ppl in the past. They, like myself, probably gave up on this broken game. Wanted to get Ark 2, but I dont think I can trust these Devs to not repeat this same fuckery, so I probably wont. Long story short, good game but poorly managed with many issues.
 
*Editing 2 months later. Still no solution in sight. If I could light this game on fire without damaging my pc, I would. There is no reason a game should be this difficult to troubleshoot, and no reason a largely PvP based game wont allow me to join any servers. I will not be buying ur new game, Ark 2, becuz u have shown me what u consider a ""final product"" and u have also shown me ur lack of support for gamebreaking issues! I made a support thread on your official website 2 months ago!!! Garbage!!!

*Another month and no solution. My support tickets have been met with automated systems sending me troubleshooting links that I have already spent hours tearing through potential solutions. I need a real person to give me definitive solution and it seems they are unwilling or unable to do so. Im sure Ark 2 will be as good a game as this, but know before u buy it that if u encounter a game breaking issue like mine, u will probably be given a big middle finger. They already have ur money, these Fukks hold all the leverage at that point. Good luck gamers, companies like these are ruining gaming."

Nothing can beat the feeling of diving headfirst into a fresh map, struggling together with friends against overwhelming odds, and thriving.
This has perhaps been the most fun I've ever had playing a video game, and by far my favorite of all time. 
Unfortunately, it suffers immensely from requiring an ungodly PC strength and more than your fair share of error message know-how, but with some elbow grease, you can get the expected result, eventually."

You have to have 250 - 300 gb to download the game and anytime the game updates it will have to re download the entire game and verify all those files which basically means you will need 600 gb free to play this game if it updates. To top it off the game is very poorly optimized.

26900,"This game is the sunken cost fallacy. It is unplayable without mods and finding a server with just the right amount of mods is very difficult. Usually I've joined friends who set up servers to the general expectations of the friend group. Also if you don't have at least 3 other guys who want to play this game don't bother. Finally, there are bugs in this game that have existed since launch. The developers do not want to fix any bug ever unless they have to and have banned people before who genuinely want to help the devs fix bugs. From dinosaurs that you're supposed to spend hours trying to tame falling through the map, getting stuck, or randomly dying you'll deal with a lot of bugs that make you want to quit. If this game goes on sale for like $5 and you have some guys who want to get it or already have it maybe consider it. Otherwise know that the devs took a dlc out of a season pass and renamed it as Atlas to try to take just a bit more money from their player base. Why do I still play it with nearly 2000 hours then? Sunken Cost Fallacy."

If you want a game more focused on releasing new maps instead of updating major issues go ahead. Lag? For sure fam Ark has your back with lag. 
Oh and the amount of storage you need to have this game is trash.  
Oh and if you have a life outside of Ark might as well not play because that Gig has a 13 day raise timer. Taming without a special isn't worth it either.

26968,"Ark. Ark, oh Ark.

This game. 

There is so much I can say about this game.

It's a piece of crap that's currently taking up almost 400 gb of storage on my hard drive. It's a glitchy mess, I often have to verify the game files to work with it, and there was one time I had to uninstall and reinstall the whole 400gbs of this mess because oh, something happened, I suppose. It's often hard to play with friends, because you have to either host your own ""non-dedicated session"" (which doesn't work half the time), find a server (which, well... it's a public server. things happen), or buy your own server. It's hard to work with, DOESN'T work sometimes, and it requires a lot of patience.

But man if it isn't worth it.

At the time of writing this review, Steam says I have over a thousand hours put into this game. Which... yeah, makes sense. It's an addictingly fun game with great graphics (most of the time) and a great environment to play in. I generally play alone or with a small group of friends, and I've had more fun in this game with my friends than I have in any other! Yes, despite the headaches and the bugs and the mess. It gives you the freedom to build whatever you want, tame whatever you want, to adventure as far as you wish to go... and, most of all, it lets you get attached to these fake creatures. You can get attached and love a creature, and then Ark can violently rip that attachment away from you because Things Just Happen Sometimes. It's simultaneously the best and the worst thing this game can do to you, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.

Yes, this game is stupid, and terrible, and it sucks. But, more than anything, it's amazing, and beautiful, and heartwrenching, and fun, and absolutely worth it. It's one of my most favorite games ever, and I will never not support it. I wouldn't buy all the DLC and play over a thousand hours of just any game, after all."

26986,"Really good game. I have been looking for a solid survival game for a long time. You can play this co-op with local players or online. There is a good balance of combat and building. The progression of skills is good. This game is super fun and customizable. You can make the game harder if you want to. 

The main drawback of this game for me is how often it updates. It is incredibly frustrating. It feels like every time I want to play this game, I must wait an hour or more for updates to finish. 

I have not played online, so I couldn't say what that is like. I appreciate the ability to play locally or single player. Massively multiplayer games are not usually something I enjoy and a lot of survival games are only multiplayer online. 

I recommend this game highly. Crafting, taming, exploring, combat, adventure - this game really has it all."

26995,"Ark: Survival Evolved is a survival game, like about a million other works floating in Steam. 
To the extent who is not familiar, the idea is to collect raw materials from nature, which can be used to build houses, traps, clothes, equipment, weapons and know what else. Hunger, thirst, cold and heat take turns whipping and needs should be taken care of.

Ark’s endeavor to stand out from the gray-brown survival amusement mass is twofold. To begin with of all, the island is without a doubt overflowing with horrendous numbers of distinctive ancient animals, from little dodos to gigantic reptiles. They are not as it were threats and sources of assets, but too potential partners. On the off chance that you'll be able crush sufficient, you'll tame your knight Tyrannosaurus rex or a few other monster reptile. Another realization is that whereas the amusement begins with the sticks and spears swinging at the feet of the dinosaurs, the game really happens in the future or something.

The thoughts are great and Ark could be a versatile and comprehensive amusement on paper that gives a parcel to do for those who like it and, in theory, make it into thousands of hours. As a very good idea, you could point out that the parameters of your own server - or if you play alone, your own game - can be adjusted exactly to what you want. On the off chance that you don’t want to spend tens of hours collecting sticks and twigs from the woodland to urge to the circles and laser rifles, you'll turn the pace of dispersion of involvement focuses and assets and ended up a demigod in less than a unit of time.

At the heart of the amusement are too the involvement focuses and the levels you collect through them. By gathering assets, building things, and battling other island tenants, an involvement scorecard is filled, and once you race, you get one or two more focuses for one of your qualities — counting starvation and thirst — and a number of capacity focuses to open unused formulas.

Some time recently you'll have fun, you've got to persevere hours of deadness. The issue is exacerbated by bouncing to a server that already has more experienced players at much higher levels, with whom there's nothing to do unless you get benevolence from neighborly partners.

Pros. 
- Wide-open amusing world. 
- Completely lootable combat and player raids. 

Cons. 
- Colossal time sink. 
- Grindfest.

Overall.
Ark may be a amusement with sufficient good ideas and great execution. It moreover includes a companion, which demonstrates that on a long surface you'll be able get a part out of Ark. On the other hand, so are handfuls of other survival recreations, numerous of which do much superior than ordinary. You'll not be able to ride in them with a dinosaur or shoot a laser weapon, but not one or the other can you in lifestyle on the off chance that the enthusiasm for the amusement passes on from destitute arranging, destitute instructing, and bounty of issues right from the beginning.

Actually, I don’t see exceptionally numerous reasons why you ought to not select Ark in the event that you're fascinated by a great survival adventure.

I've dealt with DLC maps acting like you don't own them when loading into the server and bringing you to the store page leading to hours of looking on forums for a solution. The gameplay is generally badly optimized, settings will change sometimes at random, the grass ended up looking like an 8bit shimmering mess. Countless weird situations in combat and building mechanics that make it seem like a game that has been out for this long should have fixed."

Being that PVE servers get very crowded anyways why have them bring more and more dinos from other servers, it's the cause of much more lag and difficulty playing the game.  Other than that this is one of the best games I've played.  Love the dinos, going out to tame and build your base up, raising dinos for boss fights, it's just an awesome game. Really love cave diving, and the water side of the game looks amazing as well."

Don't buy it, unless you have 2,000 to 3,000 hours to spare you'll never be experienced enough to actively play the PVP side of the game, its just too in depth. I probably have around 5,000 to 6,000 hours in this game with PC and PS4 combined and I continue to learn new things every time I launch it.

27059,"Good game, buy it and all the DLCs."
27060,ive had it for a while i like it but the severs take for ever to join i sugest you play single play but otherwise my fav game
27061,fun game worth the price
27062,"It is a very fun game, and war servers are cool too, but the only thing I dont like about this game is that the DLC content costs almost more than the game its self, and ARK is not a cheap game so if you want to get it and get the DLC content you will end up spending over 100 dollars."
27063,"This game is amazing, but lots of jerks online."
27064,very good game
27065,this is good
27066,Good fun. My daughter and I have played many hours together. I have not had too many bug issues. The building can be super frustrating trying to figure out just the spot to stand to get a roof to go on etc. I would recommend this game if it is on sale. I have gotten the game and all the expansions (except the most recent) on sales and have been quite happy with it.
27067,cool dino game
27068,Very enjoyable game. Really enjoy taming the different dinosaurs and it is really fun game.
27069,"dinosaursss
"
27070,gg
27071,"its a good game 
"
27072,"i would say this game is complex it can be fun, and challenging, it can also be very frustrating, it is mainly an open world survival game where there is always some thing to do, better stuff to get, and plenty of adventures to have, it will challenge your creativeness, and your ability to do without. it is also known for having bugs though honestly they aren't as bad as they used to be and most are fairly minor.

however as a somewhat experienced player i would recommend new players to start in single player with a few friends, or play on a private server as official servers can be quite toxic, however i will warn you this game is not for the faint of heart it is designed to be challenging and even brutal, though it is also very configurable though i warn you many people take this feature to extremes, personally i believe the default single player settings provide a fairly balanced experience while remaining challenging as the designers intended, though i would recommenced using pve for your single player as well you might want to increase the tether distance which is honestly silly as increasing it has a negligible impact on resources for the host."
27073,"DO NOT BUY IT
The idea itself is good and unique. BUT , the optimization is really really BAD, the graphics are terrible even on max settings, and the idea of mixing modern allien tecnology with dinosaurs, it just makes me to VOMIT."
27074,i cannot recommend this game. i love ark but the size of the game has gotten outta hand. the steam store says 60GB but its really 397GB. since the last free map came out its almost unplayable. the last free map broke the dino spawns Ive seen over 100 rex's spawn at once. the spawns are so dense it will crash youre PAY server. FIX IT WILDCARD!
27075,very good game
27076,I hate vultures
27077,AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
27078,
27079,"So I've accumulated about 4,000+ hours across PC-PS4. And by now I'm certain I can give an honest review about this game. 
It's amazing. If you like taming dinosaurs, exploring with friends, riding dragons(wyverns), and getting your entire base destroyed in 3 minutes then you'll love this game. If you're afraid of the Official PVP side of this game, but still want some PVP action, go ahead and try the Unofficial PVP servers. They're a good introduction to what PVP life is like. If you do however decide to try Official PVP, be prepared to sink at least 5-6 hours daily, and thats on the low end. If you got the time, and the patience to learn everything, and dealing with getting wiped here and there, then you'll absolutely love this game. 

P.S  : Don't trust other players. Ever."

To be honest it's just rust with dinosaurs and a story but I think ARK is better than Rust 

Note: The game becomes a 11/10 if you play with friends and that is the best way to play it"
27095,been a awesome game can't wait to try ark 2
27096,"good
"
27097,"The game-play is great and it is really fun, but the servers are extremely full and lag is a big issue. I only play because of all the time invested to be honest. If they fix the lag, it would be one of the best games ever. Every 2-5min it has a 30 sec lag, and I have a monster pc so that is not the issue.

27153,Dino's go ROAR!
27154,"I keep coming back to this game. 

In PVE, it's really chill and similar to a sort of Minecraft experience.

PVP is generally completely toxic, with one Tribe becoming the Alphas - This is usually based on who has the most bedroom dwelling no-lifers who basically live on the game.

Progressing on Public servers is so slow that I find it hard to believe that anyone would waste their time on there. Unofficial servers all the way.

9/10

"
27155,"Running a Server is a nightmare, game is buggy as hell, grindy (but the bad grindy not the good grindy), unoptimized and only fun when playing coop on a private server but that's impossible to do without buying some dumb online server provider because running one on your own server is horrible because the server software sucks"
27156, b2qWESA
27157,its very funb like mminecraft.
27158,"Yes it has a lot of bugs, yes it's lacking optimization, yes the Official server playerbase sucks both on PVP and PVE, but trust me, join their discord and go to the PVE Servers channel. There, you'll find loads of big and small unofficial communities for ARK. They will change your mind about this game in a positive way. I have read many negative reviews for this game, and they ALL have ONE thing in common: They criticize the game after the Official PVP and PVE servers. Look, I'm not gonna deny it, Official servers are absolute bullshit, the player base is toxic as shit, and there's literally no game there for newcomers. What I don't agree with is that they downvote the whole entire game for that. People, official servers are not the only ones out there. Unofficial servers, dedicated servers with your friends or even solo, these make up the good part of the game. Please do not criticize the game if you don't like PVP. A lot of us dislike it, including me, so just don't play PVP. PVE exists, play that instead, and remember to never hop onto officials. You'll find the game much more enjoyable if you play on the mode you like best. If you also dislike PVE unofficials, dedicated servers with friends and solo, then yes, feel free to complain about the game. If you're scrolling though reviews, please avoid the ones that solely talk about the PVP aspect of the game. Bugs are very common, yes, but I do believe that if you get a good enough grip on this game, they won't bother you nearly as much. I highly recommend you try this game out for yourself, and don't let the negative reviews ruin your first impressions. You can always refund it if you don't like it."

I didn't checked ark box cuz I am reviewing the game and it has more bugs
"
27175,good game
27176,"This is probably my favorite game at the moment. I play solo PvE and I LOVE building and having bases in the different biomes.  I feel accomplished when I learn to tame a new dino or I get great stats on a baby dino. 

You can play your way and focus on what you like doing.  It's a big game with big maps and the possibilities are tremendous."
27177,You can play this game until you Tyrannosnore at 3am
27178,very fun
27179,"The game is great but the minimum requirements are a complete lie, my graphics were as low as they could go,  and I got about 20fps. Not to mention I had to close the game every 45 minutes because my computer was near exploding. I would've given it a negative rating but I have it on console where I can actually play it."
27180,I cant get into maps
27181,been playing since the beta test came out. been on and off the game over the years but i would still recommend it
27182,i love gensis 1 and 2 its a great game i havent encountered any bugs yet overall i would recommend
27183,"A game for elementary school kids or unemployed adults. This game is not Pay to win, it is exorbitant Free time to win."
27184,It's fun and demanding. I like the dinos we can tame and the ability to build.
27185,"great game in all aspects , building, mating, fighting, making friends good survival game"
27186,many hours sunk into ark and still enjoy it to this day
27187,This game is amazing and is a very adventurous game that allows you to do what you want. Would recommend 10/10
27188,gud game
27189,"4800 total hours.  host your own server, get some mods... great.
"
27190,"good game, many bugs tho"
27191,i didnt like it
27192,"good game
"
27193,this is a good game
27194,This game is a virus to your hard drive and soul. Do not waste your time. Just trust me.
27195,"Used to be a good game, with every new DLC ( which were not very good investments ) there was an entirely new overpowered meta. Not to mention that you can't obtain these new broken features without paying for and downloading the chunky DLC in the first place. Instead of fixing the game, stopping cheaters, meshers, etc, the developers of ARK have decided to push out more downloadable content, more paywalled creatures and maps. All of these things almost seem like they are completely designed to make the game miserable, boring, and frustrating to play, which has already driven majority of the playerbase off years ago. Not to mention the fact this game is littered with glitches that seek to ruin your fun. If you want to play on any multiplayer server, be ready to time out and disconnect at the worst times possible. Be ready for massive frame drops, be ready for poor game design. The game is NOT fun on single player because it was designed to be a multiplayer game, but every update would just scare more and more players off. Overall, this game is massively mediocre, had so much potential and was completely thrown away."
27196,Fun survival game with many things to do and i really enjoy base building while material gathering is a annoying task it is worth it!!! anyway just love for this game

27219,"its a really fun game, i love playing it with my friends, its a really grindy game but it is worth it, i got it when it was on sale for $10 USD. the dinos look amazing (and the tech rex, look strait at its face, it looks derpy) i like all the diffrent variety of options for weapons depending on your likes, same with armor. (untill tek armor stage, it kinda has everything in one) the arkpocalypse servers had a reset, and i had a lystro, he survived a raid, an angry bronto, and another angry bronto, assisting in killing it the second time (same bronto) i took him with us to face the meteor shower... we crashed when it started :\, but anyways, i think the game has alot of bugs, alot of bugs, but i think they make the game funnier, example: we once saw a dodo ascend to the skies, for absolutly no reason, that was super funny, anyways, my recommendation for this game, buy it and have a laugh (buy it on sale its kinda pricey)."

27307,I hate this game. Would recommend.
27308,Fun
27309,"Love the game, just try and ignore the bugs here and there. Find ways to work around them. For example, mods."
27310,Will always be an amazing game.
27311,"Great game, Interesting story. I feel like the best aspects of the game is the ability to play solo and modify the single player file. Online multiplayer is toxic unless you play on a private server."
27312,It's ok I guess
27313,Gud Gem
27314,making a army of raptors
27315,fun and grIndy at the smae time
27316,great game but lag
27317,noice game
27318,noice
27319,it realy fun
27320,its great
27321,Addictive and different from most games. Love the freedom and endless possibilities of dino taming and breeding.
27322,
27323,i like the dicusors
27324,Amazing!
27325,Great and interesting gameplay with an amazing story. 10/10 game
27326,fun to play with your friends it is a good game good challenges
27327,if you dont want to have a life i highly recommend this game!
27328,"Cant even play it properly on single player, and my gaming laptop was able to take APEX Legends. Somehow THIS makes it literally bluescreen??

1/5. Worst 31 bucks wasted."
27329,"its a game, like yus fire if you have a good pc but if you cant just dont even try T-T"
27330,"Ya get the cool dinosaurs and then ya go oh boy oh man do I like these cool dinosaurs, I sure am gunna ride em' cowboy. Then some other not so cool dinosaurs eat you a few times. Then some butt licker comes and kills all your cool dinosaurs and whole base you spent 300 hours on alone while you're offline and then you get a lil mad and a lil sad and never play again. 6.9 out of 10. Nice."
27331,dont do it.
27332,fun game
27333,great game but the modded is better
27334,"fun survival game very challenging, but it will destroy your social life"
27335,good GAME
27336,"I tried, alright? 74 hours is not a small amount of play time. It's not fun to me. It's a tedious and frustrating experience where every hard earned win is quickly squandered by a quick and punishing failure. It's not satisfying to spend 2 hours crafting basic gear only to die to a level 130 raptor coming from behind you and killing you in just a few hits. 

But, I'm the odd one out, so perhaps all of this is fine to most folks. I'm sure you can enjoy the game then. But for me, and anyone like me, I cannot find any fun in this game. I know it gets better when you unlock more of the fun things to do in the game, but starting out, it feels so punishing and deadly that you just feel stuck, unable to do anything to progress without being killed and wasting more and more time trying to get back to the same place you where before you died."
27337,I Have played this for almost 7 years on console and on pc i recomend it a lot but i am disapointed in Ark 2 it is ways too soon
27338,"Worst game to ever be sold on steam for real money

I refuse to believe anyone at Studio Wildcard or whoever the hell makes this atrocity actually give a shit about this game"
27339,the best
27340,"this game makes me want to die and yet i can't stop playing it yet it causes me pain help 
edit: IM STILL PLAYING OH GOD PLEASE HELP ME IM DYING YET IT JUST KEEPS SUCKING ME BACK IN"
27341,yes
27342,FFFFF
27343,"fun sometimes
"
27344,Good game
27345,Been playing this game for as long as ive been playing video games seriously and I have absolutley nothing bad to say about it
27346,خح
27347,Fun alone but much better with friends.
27348,"how to say family in whistling language ?
this game is good 
few bugs yet in game 
waiting for ark 2"
27349,"m, bjnh kmjnu"
27350,This is an amazing fun game with many fun mods!
27351,I CANT CONNECT TO MY FRIEND
27352,Ark is LOVE Ark is LIFE
27353,the game is complex and fun at the same time you can play around with many settings in your own world kinda like minecraft with RTX on
27354,No developer supports their modding community like Studio Wildcard & partners. That has been a big reason why ARK is my most-played game of the genre.
27355,Nice
27356,very good
27357,this game fire honestly
27358,this game is very bad it removes the ability to get girls
27359,this game is a glitchy mess. do not buy for your own sake unless your computer is designed to fight god.
27360,"fun, would rate minecraft out of arkness"
27361,good soup
27362,The worst way to spend your money is to buy this game you literally cant play together because of the host's dedicated distance which you can adjust but the cave glitching I cant have dun with my friends in a game i paid for. the only way you can neglect that is if you spend more money on your own server.
27363,its a not bad game exept it can be overwhelming to new player cuz there is soo much and not really a tutorial
27364,Very good adiction is fun
27365,69 nice
27366,"With the vast array of mods out there for Ark, this game can be modified to anyone's play style."
27367, this game is very REALISTIC besides the floating trees and dinos clipping thorugh the map. also gigas are passive tames get mejoberrys and feed them for free giga tame
27368,nice
27369,"goated, you can fling poop in people"
27370,
27371,Dinosaurs! need I say more?
27372,I really like it :)
27373,h
27374,"very nice game. WildCard needs to fix bugs. I was mining metal, one minute later I teleported across the map. All in all, ark is an ok game that id recomend to any open world fanatic."

27380,"Great game...farm , build , tame , fight , die , farm farm farm Raid people who killed you then raise an army of 10th generation Incest dinosaurs only to be raided yourself after all that hard work repeat whole process lol
Not the most forgiving game but if your happy to be doing tedious tasks (Farming/Breeding) most of the time it will pay off when you go for a big adventure , up against other players or even to try take on some of the end game bosses all in all you will be put to the test whatever path you choose :)"
27381,dinos are hot
27382,"very good very nice

sometimes maybe good,

sometimes maybe shit"
27383,good game
27384,"Played ARK since basically the beginning. Survived all the growing pains and mistakes from SW and still love the game. Just like most survival games, the better experience is on private servers where you can control player interaction and enhance your game play with mods. Despite some continued issues and glitches, ARK is a fun and challenging experience both for building and creature interaction."
27385,"awsome
"
27386,haha funny dinosaur game
27387,"noice game
"
27388,i havent slept or seen my family in days
27389,Its good but play it with friends.
27390,hhhhhhhhh
27391,cant have sex with dino
27392,It is a sand box game with all sorts of dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures that you can tame and ride. In the end there are big bosses to fight. Microraptors are the worst though.
27393,"Has the potential to be a good game but is currently a waste of your time. Game itself is great, you can spend a full week Farming resources, building a base, taming some useful dinos and exploring the map. However you will wake up one morning exited to log onto the game only to find that someone that doesn't even live on the same server or even the same map as you has jumped over to your server and destroyed your base, emptied all your items onto the floor to despawn and killed all your tames (Most of which will have taken hours to tame) they will do this with creatures and items that don't even exist on your map.

If they created an official server that doesn't allow people to just hop over from another server and destroy everything then i would definitely come back to playing this game and i'm sure many more people would too, Raiding and fighting other tribes is part of the game, but only fun if you can see and interact with your enemies. It has the potential to have a map filled with different tribes all competing with eachother but this cant happen because your not only competing with the tribes living on the server with you, but also with tribes of 300+ people on other maps that have been around for months and exist only to hop between maps and wipe out tribes that have no defence against them. 

I'm not saying remove the ability to transfer between maps, But you could easily create an official server that is isolated from the rest and does not have this feature enabled. It would make the game actually fair and worth putting time into playing."
27394,good game BUT EVERYTHING IS KILL MY MACHOPS:(:(
27395,best game over i have played for 115 hours and other players should try it out  and i would say u should try singleplayers first and then with other players
27396,dinosaurs.
27397,Good graphics and very good story
27398,yes
27399,I have not played this alot but dino cool and dodo not cool and that mean good game

Me, an intellectual: ""It's a Ark thing"""

27405,"The Forest might be the most hyped survival game, but I appreciate ARK more due to its updates."
27406,no
27407,ssss
27408,this game should be free
27409,"Got this game to play with friends and my SO. Turns out, the devs made the Xbox and Windows 10 versions incompatible for crossplay with Steam, effectively preventing me from playing with anyone I care about unless I shell out more money for one of those versions. This is an intentional cash grab and a blatantly manipulative tactic. Additionally, it splits the community and threatens the game's longevity across all platforms. Don't support a scummy, greedy company that makes decisions like this for a quick buck. They're lower than trash and don't deserve your money."
27410,have you ever bin arked before if not its time to learn
27411,ha dinos go brrrrrrrrr
27412,"Good game fun really hard recommend if you like a challenge with big rewards.

27414,"really good gam e 















This is a really great game

"
27415,"1000 hours ayyyyyyyy

great game
"
27416,"Awesome game if you stick with single player mode. The start is very rough and unfair actually but it's fitting. Ark was my first survival game and i love it. I originally got it for free on Epic but I enjoyed the game so much that I bought it and all of its DLCs on Steam. Also building mods are awesome. I love the building aspect so so so much. It's not very well optimized in terms of performance and eats up 400GB and also has a lot of bugs. I didn't play much on the Steam version unfortunately because it takes up too much space but I just remembered how much I enjoyed the game. I was obsessed with dinos as a kid and this game rekindled my love for dinosaurs even though I'm a 23 year old man now. The dinos and the building feature are the best thing. Also the DLC maps are great and the storyline albeit basic is cool too. It's like Minecraft but with dinosaurs. I never touched Minecraft because it's a kids game although it was interesting with the creativity and building stuff but it lacked dinos. I'm so happy a came across ARK. 
If you love Dinosaurs or prehistoric creatures overall and creative building then this game is the game for you. 
I feel like a little kid with the same passion for dinosaurs back then whenever I play this game.
Edit: I made a minor mistake forgetting to seperate two words in my euphoria, sorry reddit mods)"
27417,Best dino is sarco
27418,good game all round and it is very fun. the gameplay is good but can be a bit laggy if you have big downloads or stuff happening in the background.
27419,kinda like call of duty meep
27420,fun game
27421,"это та самая игра, где с первой попытки сможешь только поставить ступку и пестик"
27422,"This game is great...when it actually works. I haven't been able to play this game for months and I don't know when I'll be able to play again. The game is so fun to play, but so frustrating to configure. The udpates are usually when things go awry. If you can get this game this game to work, you won't regret it (at least I didn't)."
27423,really much potential into this game.. when only support and devs would hear the community
27424,"I personally like the game because of the survival and exploration aspect of it. my main problem are the bugs that this game presents and had for years at this point, and wildcard's reluctance to fix them. I'd say only buy if it's on sale for 10 or under, so u wouldn't lose much to try."

27440,"Glitchy, Buggy, and runs like crap, even on a high spec newer machine. Pair this with the fact that its grindy in the worst, most pointless ways and you have a steaming pile of Dino excrement. Map feels claustrophobic despite being huge and the A.i is laughably bad. I would avoid this even on sale. A GENEROUS 2/10 because there are Dinosaurs, and Dinosaurs are cool. Your money is better spent elsewhere."
27441,This is an all round good game. Almost never gets boring and their is so much to do
27442,realy good game
27443,I had so much fun

27446,best game
27447,"I like that the game never ends .
You can have killed the bosses on all 3 difficulties but you can then start building more or help others that have just started playng.
It is the best survival that have been ever made and the DLCs are just more things to do."
27448,"Started an army of dinosaurs with my friend because my first dinosaur named ""Blue Ben"" (the tribe was named the tribe of Ben). He died and yeah, an army was formed. Died many times, survived by the width of a hair many times. Overall, a fun game!"
27449,fun game
27450,Ark is an amazing action and adventure game I reccomend to anyone who likes survival games!
27451,just gotta play with someone that knows what there doing
27452,suck
27453,good
27454,this game is aids

"
27471,amazing games only problem is how when the game updates it doesnt delete the old files of the game so the files just stack on top of eachother.
27472,great game
27473,good game
27474,"The game is very nice, even though i can't dowload it lately because of the weak PC, i still know how great and beautiful this game is. I've been dreaming about it ever since the ragnarok map. And finally bought it, hopefully will be able to download it sooner or later. Thanks for this great game"
27475,server unstable
27476,The diversity of creatures and terrains on each map is arguably the best part of the game. If you get burnt out of one map you can start fresh on a new map without feeling like you're doing the exact same thing or taming the exact same creatures. I've played the game for a couple years and still remains one of my most played and addicting games.
27477,"garbage, after downloading this game i spent hours trying to get it to launch. though it says i played it for 1.2 hours 95% of that time was spent loading the game only to have it crash. actual play time is more 10 min or so. long enough to know a garbage game when i see it. 

first off it drops you off randomly with no tutorial at all. before i could even figure out what the control, and menu set up was i got chased down and killed by a dino. over and over again. controls are not intuitive. will try to get a refund from this. unfortunately I purchased it more than 14 days ago with some other games, so i may not be able to."
27478,ive played for like 5 years (i play on ps4 aswell)? maybe? i really like this game it gets fun when you get good at it and play with friends
27479,Addictive
27480,It's an amazing game really fun i recommend it to a lot of people
27481,Best survival game!
27482,i love this game so much its a amazing game aswell to stream if your down for the grind the community behind it its amazing aswell
27483,good
27484,Not a bad game by any measure especially with mods and tweaks to the balancing. But the workshop implementation needs to be improved. Servers with mods require you to download them yourself because you'll time out trying to download them in-game. This is a really simple problem. Not sure if the fix is simple but something needs to be done about it.
27485,cock
27486,It was worth the hours
27487,Good
27488,EVERYTHING!
27489,"Isn't optimized the best. But if you have a computer that isn't absolute rubbish, turn down the settings a bit and it should run fine after a bit. Pretty fun game! Don't go in the water though. If I had a nickel for every time the water in that game has traumatized me istg"
27490,This game requires a lot of dedication which is what I love about it
27491,Amazing
27492,good if you like fighting and raiding
27493,its is very fun i like the mods and is over all a super fun game people make super cool things like builds or mods even so hopefully they keep adding on to the game
27494,I play this game its great.
27495,"Fun game :) I never thought being turned into dino poop so often would be so entertaining. Most things I have to look up afterwards just to learn about what they were, so I know a LOT more about dino's now than I ever learned as a child."

27499,mmm yes dinosawrs

27501,"If you love dinosaurs, you'll love this game. Huge learning curve though."
27502,The game is endless and so many features  that any player can explore and steam adds a whole new chapter to the game through mods
27503,"Constantly getting killed at spawn, finally get a base setup then die again straight away.
Game takes too long to progress, if you are able to spend hours a day play this game then maybe you might get somewhere."
27504,Great timewaste

27508,"Good game, addicting and time consuming. However there is really no other survival game on the market that can compare or offers true fluid game play. From character creation to movements, nothing comes close. Whether its to enjoy some quiet time and be a bob or chaos and pvp, you have it all."

27512,"Games fire, what can I say."
27513,"This game is immensely fun and has a lot to it and if you enjoy this type of game you can 100% sink a lot of hours into it, the only drawback this game has is its insane amount of bugs but sometimes they can give you a good laugh and enhance your experience even and sometimes they can take away hours of progress and ruin your experience :(

Despite the bugs Ark is still a solid game. 6/10

Edit: Game has been cleaned up a lot since the last time I played it and I enjoy it a lot 7/10"

27517,"This game is amazingly fun and I love the concept. It has its issues. They're pretty significant issues, but they would not stop me from buying it again if I got a chance or from recommending it to others. It's a fun, unique survival game that's actually a really fun concept. I think in the end that it was too ambitious for Wildcard's abilities at the time. While you can play official if you so choose, I highly recommend either getting your own server (as low as $13 a month from someplace like Nitrado) that you yourself can administrate or find a good server that's privately owned with active administrators. That's, IMO, the best way to experience the game since the major issues can be overcome with access to an admin account."
27518,"After playing more than 100 hours, we got a nice base and many high level Dinosour. But our tamed dino suddenly disappear after 7 days no online."

so basically yeah

my guy had steroids for no training hes has more muscles than me irl and my friend is bragging about this game so thats another reason why i left a bad review"

Things I liked: 
*Taming the dinos has some interesting challenges and was quite a bit of fun.
*Using dinos to collect resources is pretty cool.
*arrows are automatically picked up when you walk over them

(some of the) Things I didn't like:
*The building in this game is about the worst I've ever experienced in any survival game because you have to prefabricate everything.  Also having any reasonable amount of building resources is way too much weight to carry.
*Setting dino behavior is very clunky and hard to do quickly which can result in large losses of investment in dinos due to them engaging in combat and not taking instruction to leave
*No matter what I was wearing, it didn't seem to affect whether I was freezing to death on a tropical beach while standing next to a fire.  Similarly, I was still too hot after removing all clothing.  Clothing does not appear to influence environmental temperature effects.  
*The default rate of food consumption has you eating an entire steak every 30 seconds.
*Weapons generally suck (mostly because ammo is annoying to make) but maybe that's to encourage training and using dinos in combat like pokemon
*tab defaults to opening the f****** command prompt instead of the inventory like it does in literally every other game of this type
*Dying in this game might be the griefiest experience I've ever had second only to Rust, but at least in Rust you can hoverloot to get your stuff back quick enough to make a play.
*Dinos grief your body pretty hard
*on the rifle, the scope sways but the iron sights don't.
*can't use the scope with tranq darts
*stone is best collected with an axe (wtf?)
*if you have any horizontal velocity when sliding on steep terrain, the game yeets you sideways down the slope so you can't just slide, therefore taking lethal fall damage.
*jumping and landing on a tranqued dino can render you unable to take any action for extended periods. 
 The only fix I found was randomly hammering on movement keys and flailing the view around.  Maybe it's because the game puts you in a falling state or something idk.  In any case, it's infuriating.

Bottom line: if you're here for taming dinos and are willing to put up with glitchy BS, you've got a shot at liking this.  Otherwise, steer clear.

27604,"Arguably one of the most fun games I've ever played. The feeling of exploring into uncharted territory where there could be new or dangerous creatures to find is like no other and building bases around the different maps and Arks is very fun. I played this game with a friend on a private server, there were some bugs, it did lag at some points, but the graphics are amazing and i would recommend this game to everyone. On a side note, exploring the ocean gives the exact same vibes that playing Subnautica does, because the oceans can be quite deep and dark and you wouldnt know if something big is swimming right next to you, however it is full of rare resources and creatures."

27619,"Ark Survival Evolved is like the dinosaur survival game you wanted to play as a child that was way too into dinosaurs, it adds a good amount of fantasy creatures as well but also has lots of well know dino's like the T-Rex and Raptor but also adds some lesser known like the Megatherium or the ""giant sloth"".

Overall as a whole game without any mods from the workshop, it's an amazing game.  Normal = 8.8/10

With quality of life mods Ark is even better, some mods I recommend are: Dino Storage V2, Awesome Spyglass, Super/S+ Structure(s), and most of the bigger stacking mod.   Modded = 9.8/10 or basically 10/10"

27667,"This game seems to have a little something for everyone. Survival for those who like survival games. Having to watch hunger bar, hydration bar, be mindful of elements. Building for those who just like to build awesome structures. With many add-ons that make building easier without using as many resources to change around bases. Even using cheats to just spawn in the resources and build the best thing you can. If you are one who likes battling in games, there are a variety of dinosaurs, wild animals and even wyverns that you can try and take down. For those with the PVP itch there is also that route as well. There are many different ways to go with a game like this and I think any path you take will lead to an enjoyably experience. I highly recommend this game for any genre you are into. I can't guarantee you will like it, but I can almost guarantee there will be an aspect of the game that you can enjoy."

27671,"No idea what I am doing in the game. Started on island and instantly died, ate a berry instantly dead. Why isn't there a tutorial for this game at all? Managed to some how craft a pickaxe, hit rock, did nothing. Don't know where my stats are for this  game, second time in dying from hunger because I don't know where stats are to check (again a tutorial would be helpful). This game legit makes me feel like I am stupid (perhaps at this point I am starting to think I am because I can't figure out a game by myself). It is far more confusing to me than it is fun.  I am not having fun if I have no idea what I am doing.

Re-purchased the game and I still struggle with everything. I don't know what I am supposed to make next or what I need for what. My character either over heats or is freezing which makes her health go down, then I have to make more meat to keep up with it. I don't know how to regulate the body temperature.  I dislike this game more and more every time I play it. Mostly I get told to google or look at guides which is not helpful when I learn by doing it not just by reading text."

27701,"Game is good. Smalls and official is dead rn, only good official server is arkpoc and thats got a bunch of cheaters so :/"
27702,"8/10 Its a game to enjoy in single player, or in servers. Sure, its a shooter game where you can shoot/hit things but, you can tame the dinosaurs and ride them, build bases so large and decorative (or so strong it will take a lot for anyone to break in). However with the mod community anything is possible (Keen Examples are immersive taming, better dinos, structures plus, and any well made fan maps). My recommendation for anyone wanting to mod this game, is better dinosaur AI for more realistic/immersive play through (for all those who are brave enough to play this with Virtual Reality). Sure there is one out there in the workshop, however sadly its been long abandoned. Otherwise! For new players playing single player. I recommend a higher number on taming so that it doesn't take like forever or hours to tame a dodo, Always spawn on easy areas to get used to the game, and to keep the mindset of if it has sharp claws and sharp teeth its probably going to be aggressive try to kill, and eat you... Thats All"

Wildcard does nothing to curb it.
Then Wildcard announces that after this years events there will be no more events of ARK.

27726,gg
27727,"This game is in a weird place for me. On one hand, it's the most played game on my Steam library. On the other, the vast majority of that time was just waiting. Waiting on the game to load, waiting on joining a server or singleplayer game, waiting on mods to install, waiting on taming dinosaurs, smelting/collecting resources. A lot of the game is just waiting, if you can't tell. A lot of the actual gameplay doesn't come down to skill, moreso it just comes down to ""Who has more numbers than the other,"" numbers being health, how much damage you deal, how much damage your armor deflects. When the game shines, it's a bright, amazing, glittering gem, but other parts of it are horrible, such as the aforementioned waiting and the numbers game. 

Most of the time, the game fully expects you to have a massive tribe of people online and playing every single day. This is not how I played it. I usually play singleplayer, but occasionally I did play on small servers with a few friends, though most of the time I just kinda did my own thing. This is absolutely not how the game expects you to play and it is extremely punishing if you try and play it this way without boosting your stats in the settings screen before loading your game. Even then, there are points where that's not enough.

The game itself is chock full of bugs, ones that can render your saves gone forever, or your dinosaurs and/or gear lost under the map or just deleted for no reason. Just died and now you have to run back and try and find your ascendant gear? Tough sh​it the bag with your loot is under the map. Try and transfer your character or dinosaurs to another map or server? They have ceased to exist.

On big servers, more often than not they're absolutely dominated by a single tribe who, upon someone new joining the server, will immediately zero in on your location wherever you spawn and kill you immediately. Some servers have foundations or pillars placed all over the map, to block any resources or dinosaurs from spawning, to completely prevent any new players from making any progress whatsoever.

What IS good about this game, though, is the exploration. Seeking out new areas, new dinosaurs, new resources, new anything, was some of the best time I had in this game. Delving deep into caves and climbing the highest mountains, that's where this game truly shines, and the beautiful environments surely don't hurt the game in this regard. Riding my Tapejara, or my Tyrannosaurus, or Yutyrannus, or whatever mount I decide to choose for that excursion, and exploring these sprawling maps, filled with grand vistas, is genuinely the best part of the game in my regard.

Taming of the dinosaurs can be fun, when it's more than just the normal ""shoot it full of drugs until it passes out then shove food down its throat"" though this can also be annoying, such as having to passive tame a constantly moving, fast as all he​ll that, upon realizing you exist will kill you without so much as a second thought, is not at all fun, is annoying as hell, and is simply bad game design.

Due to the innate randomness with both spawning into a new map as well as where and how the dinosaurs spawn, you can often wake up on the beach to a raptor or a Carnotaurus staring you down, waiting for you to get done with the waking up animation. If you manage to get past that, the beaches are INFESTED with Ichthyornis and Pegomastax, both of which will steal your stuff with absolutely no counter, especially if you're a fresh spawn, desperately trying to get enough food to survive and struggling without little thieves swooping in and stealing your precious few berries. Once you've got your base all established and got yourself a few dinos tamed, all it'd take is a randomly spawned alpha raptor or Giganotosaurus to notice your little hovel and your Parasaurolophus and Triceratops and think, ""They'd make a nice meal,"" destroying potentially days or weeks of work in one fell swoop, with, again, absolutely no counter. This random spawning can often be a good thing, too. Spawned in somewhere and get ganked by a pack of raptors? That's ok, I can just spawn in a different location, or perhaps the same spawning area but maybe it'll spawn me further away from the predators. It also means that you can't just go to the same parts of the map, expecting the same dinosaurs. You'll get dinosaurs from a group of ones that can spawn there, yes, but never the exact same dinosaurs.

The Arks themselves, the maps the majority of the game takes place on, are described in lore as artificial environments, with their own active, living ecosystem. It never seems like that, more like a giant sandbox with dinosaurs haphazardly tossed in with no regard to predator/prey relationships and other parts of an ecosystem that make it, well, an ecosystem. This is, of course, explained away by the lore, but Wildcard had a big chance to make this environment into a living, breathing world and simply tossed it away. You never see herbivores peacefully grazing, you never see carnivores relaxing after a hunt with their kill. Would it have been more work? Yes, but people like me would have massively appreciated it.

Speaking of lore, you will not at all understand ANY of it unless you spend the hours seeking out those survivor logs. Of course, you are incentivized for them, as they provide a substantial boost to your XP gains, which in the later levels can be an immense boon, as it takes so much XP to get your last few levels.

The modding community in this game is immense, and still very active, which I believe has helped keep the game alive all these years. Modders are constantly adding new maps, new animals, new weapons and armor and structures, or changing what is already in the game. The devs themselves are very open to mods, featuring the most popular mods and even incorporating some of them into the base game, mainly new maps, though they have introduced some features from Structures+, as well as a total conversion (which has since been left to gather dust by most of the community as well as the devs).

As for the technical side of the game, it's a bloated, unoptimized, uncompressed mess. Base game, with just DLC, is more than 200gb. A heavily modded game, such as my own, can easily reach 400gb or more. The game takes far too long to load into a game, even longer if it's modded, which can be the difference between getting your entire base wiped or repelling raiders if you have to sit through the loading screen while you know your base is getting chomped away on by a raider's Giga.

I've gone on far too long, it's best to wrap this up now before I continue. Overall, this game is, again, in a weird place for me. I wish Steam had a ""maybe recommended"" option, something between yes and no, as that's what I'd rate this game as. As it stands, I'll leave it as a no, but I encourage you to make your own decisions about whether or not you want this game. Search out information, watch videos, see what you think before getting into it yourself instead of just hopping in blindly."

If you let go all these notions and just jump in you will find a lot to like. From sprawling open worlds to living out your Dino Rider fantasy with your friends. Ark delivers big time and after a few hours you will be hooked on achieving the next big upgrade or Dinosaur tame.

If you like survival games and especially if you like to play them with friends, Ark is a must play."

27745,"i played this game from 2015 up till 2020 and im getting back into it agein in all my accounts i have about 2300 hours, i find more joy in this game then any other game in the world less people play this game then they used to but it is still worth the money, with ark 2 coming out i am super hyped even tho i wont be able to play it for a couple years do to legal issues.. but 10/10 recommend this game :)"

27796,it is very cool
27797," Ark is the epitome of 'so close but not quite there' at nearly 2k hours clocked I can honestly say I gave this game many, oh so many, runs but at the end of the day instabilities ruin the game for me. 2015 launch, with them leaving early access two years later and there has been a consistent trend year after year of ""let's put out more content instead of fix our bugs"" and let's face it, they've certainly had the time to do so.  

That is not to say that the game isn't enjoyable and that's probably the most infuriating part about it, ARK is a masterpiece of the genre at its heart, especially if you avoid the toxic and quite frankly awful public servers and run your own for a group of friends.  It's a shame that the stability isn't there to back up the game play.  

If you're looking for a storyline that's easy to follow, or even makes sense in how you discover things about the world, this game isn't it.  While the story itself is incredibly interesting, actually getting all the pieces is a guessing game of stumbling onto caches of information and journals left behind by survivors before you and beating bosses in seemingly random order and then going back to read them when you finally get enough pieces for things to make sense.  Again, so close but not quite there.

I love this game, I've had many hours of fun with friends on this game, but I've had just as many hours of frustration, troubleshooting, crashing, rebooting, and restarting and it's finally come to the point where I just can't recommend it without also warning against playing it all in the same sentence."
27798,"Good game, was better in early access without all the wyverns and sci-fi stuff. liked it better when it was realistic (except the timeline LOL)"
27799,good but multiplayer sucks ass

27805,"[h1] Where I am at with ARK now:[/h1]
I run a free to play [i]Unofficial[/i] ARK cluster [b][i]3x (NA PVP & ORP) Rochester NY Cluster[/i][/b] maintained by donations from the community playing on it, on hardware I own and maintain [b](not rented)[/b]. [b](Discord link at bottom)[/b]

It is basically vanilla with server side plugins and me as admin/judge to keep people grounded in having fun.

The hundreds of people who have come and gone on my private cluster have enabled me to purchase and maintain an HPE Gen 8 rack server with 128GB of ram, 2 cpu, 4 top speed SSD, windows 2019, upgrade all my network hardware to handle packets at a commercial level and even maintain a vastly higher internet connection. And I learned tons of valuable knowledge along the way, both in the hardware, network and software management. 

All because those who play on my server are looking for the experience I provide in this particular game. Hundreds of people who see beyond the problems always present in this game and wanted to play it in a way you can't on official. They gave generously making this possible for all of us on the cluster while letting me learn and I couldn't be more grateful. It was a fantastic transaction and I look forward to ARK 2 to continue this.

[h1]My initial thoughts (from early days)[/h1]
When I first played this I was dragged into it by friends who thought Dinosaurs and a persistent world in a game were some badass thing. At the time I tagged along because I figured it would be fun for a week or two but honestly dinosaurs never did it for me.

I didn't like that my work stayed online and was only protected by what I could provide to get me through the time I was away, [i]it never did by the way[/i]. I didn't like that my character and Dinos required upkeep. I didn't like that some people only played to grief or troll. 

I did (do) like the PVP when it wasn't offline, absurdly lopsided, mean spirited or done using every bit of cheese meta currently available. 

But somehow, year after year, I keep coming back to this game.

[h1]Taming[/h1]
I enjoy the process of taming Dinos and breeding them, seeking out some with better stats or colors I thought were neat, then using the math to breed all that together. I'm not good at it, but its fun. Finding someone good at breeding in this game is like finding a valuable scientist whose knowledge will open whole new areas of exploration. Once someone starts breeding you the right Dinos both PVE boss fights and PVP become vastly more enjoyable! 

But taming isn't just shoot and wait. There are many different ways to go about it, some requiring buildings, some requiring other Dinos and others requiring more patience than I care to develop in myself. But its always fun and a mini game that other developers would have tried to sell you as a standalone!

[h1]Building[/h1]
Building in the game is almost a science at this point. I build boxes and rectangles, I am boring and bad at the game. 

Then I find a teammate who makes elaborate multistory buildings using techniques I still can't barely comprehend with defenses built in such a devious way that having them around is now a necessity not just for survival but also to be aesthetically pleasing. 

How you place storage and work areas is important, where you put spawn points and how you position defensive dinos matter in a big way.

You start at making grass huts that raptors rip open to eat the juice inside of [i](you and your egg laying dodo)[/i]. You can't wait to get a metal base with an auto turret to blast all glowing red alpha raptors. Well, eventually you have a base made of space age tech with doors made out of force fields that open for you and can have unique passwords, and dinos that could kill every raptor on the island at the same time, yet you are still somehow farming dodo eggs lol!

[h1]The world, graphics and gameplay[/h1]
The amount of life in this game is mind blowing. Literally hundreds of unique creatures with so many unique abilities I couldn't possibly list. Each one has its place in helping to make your life easier or safer. 

I prefer to play ARK in the winter months in NY state. The maps fauna and atmosphere combined with the beautiful graphics can be like sunlight on your face. It may be snowing and gross outside, I may be yearning to go for a 5 mile trail run (screw that in the snow lol), but in ARK it feels warm and on my server I can put it down and come back at my leisure. 

Speaking of graphics, its basically what they show above, the creatures and environment are stunning and legit look as good as the images. Take the time to look around and admire the detail put into this game. 

I know many people play with it set to ""potato mode"" so they can pvp more efficiently...well I cannot relate to that. Turned up to 2k ultra, 144hz refresh on a 1080ti looks absolutely stunning and runs above 60fps easy. See the last paragragh to get a feel for how I feel playing this game and its graphics. 

Gameplay is not a grind if you do not want it to be [i](at least not on my servers)[/i]. As you progress, those things that were hard (eating, water, shelter, other consumables), slowly becomes easier and easier as you obtain dinos and unlock technology through level progression. 

You upgrade your skills and become hardier, faster, tougher. Where before filling up a starter dino with hand tools took 20 minutes, terrified of being eaten by predators. You eventually have dinos of your own that can be commanded to protect each other and you while you clamber along on your herbivore collecting 1000x more than you could at the start in the same time. 

But that doesn't ever start to feel meaningless! Those materials can be used to further progress you to a point where endgame content is achievable. Boss fights that progress a loosely told story, unlock high technology and mysterious new maps to explore where death and loss is around every corner. 

This sense of danger is half the fun, you know you aren't invisible and the things you have aren't permanent if you do not take care. You could lose that prized named Dino you've had since day 3 if you aren't careful. But while that may be sad, it is extremely fun. 

[h1]CONS (I have few)[/h1]
Ark has its problems. If you play on official you almost certainly need to find your way into a ""larger"" tribe connected to the ""humungous tribes"" and get ""your tribes map"" on a protected list. If you get too big and they find you, no amount of guns, bullets and dinos will stop them for long. 

BUT! Imagine this, a robot 5 stories tall colored outrageously in a field (and a 2 mile high floating Obelisk overhead) fighting what amounts to a hairy Godzilla whose can be seen half way across the map and all the while you and others are harassing that captured unique beast with flying creatures and defensive structures built to slow its advance. This legit happens. It is amazing.

On official servers the latency can become pretty bad, but not unplayable! You'll be picking enemies off their dinos as they try to weaken your defenses and dropping them from the sky as they speak in proximity to you how much they love you. 

Cheaters exist. But Wildcard has put an amazing effort into halting their capability. I'm not saying it doesn't occur any longer, it does, just that WC has come a LONG way in dealing with it, even if its not perfect. Much of this has to do URE4, so much of it couldn't be changed without fundamentally changing the game. 

So, many of us hope that ARK2 using URE5 will solve some of those problems while building on what they currently have. Unlike most people I don't think WC made a busted game. I think they made a platform that too many people were not willing to experiment with or go outside what was simple in order to experience it in a more enjoyable manner. 

[h1]This is both an AD for my cluster and an honest review. I love ARK.[/h1]
I want you to come see for yourself:

27806,great game good fun start on pve to learn then pvp if you want after but is a well made game has its on glitch as they all do but fun still

27808,This game has a lot of problems but dear god did i love every second of it. 350+ hours on xbox one.
27809,dino nuugget good very nice
27810,I hate this game.
27811,"i think this game is really good. but! dont cheat, it gets boring trust me"
27812,good game.worth getting
27813,dino cool :)
27814,"Played this game for many hundreds of hours spanning multiple years and steam accounts, and havent even begun to scratch the surface. While PvP is what people are mainly after, the PvE aspect is unbelievably good if you know where to get set up. If you have time to kill, this is a game you have to buy."
27815,HF
27816,"This game is extremely fun with friends, if you have a group of friends looking for a game to waste hours and hours on then this is the perfect game. However do not expect this game to be exactly flawless, it has multiple game breaking bugs but i guess that's what ARK is known for now."
27817,"good
"
27818,"ARK: Survival Evolved is a fun game for everyone who likes to pour many hours into one game alone. Graphics look gorgeous, and the models and creatures are fun to stare at (If you can get over potential inaccuracy to what we know of them in the real world.).
While starting a new world can always end up frustrating and tedious with multiple deaths, once you get your bearings or even when playing with friends, it quickly turns to a fun experience with lots of taming, dino fighting, cave exploring, breeding, up until eventual boss fights. The build system isn't my favorite in games, but I'd be lying if I said one couldn't make some stunning builds, and then color them into lots of different colors as well for anyone's liking. And if you're bored of all of that, even then there's still lore to find and read up on to understand the world(s) you're playing in.
ARK is a fun experience and when one world gets boring, get your friends and yourself to ascend to a new one. Truly, I feel ARK never really gets boring."
27819,good soup

27833,good graphics and just a good game at hole
27834,Cool
27835,i like the armor u can get
27836,One of the best survival games.
27837,"I love this game! But, I don't think it's very beginner friendly anymore. Thankfully, I started playing right when the game came out, so it was still possible to find some place to build on PvE servers and NOT get instantly hunted and killed by bigger tribes on PvP servers... Still a really fun game though! As long as your computer can handle it. It's quite a chunky game.

If you're playing alone or on a server where you can change the settings, I definitely recommend increasing the taming speed by a lot, unless you intend to spend 5+ hours taming a big turtle, or multiple days taming one of the rarer dinos. It's part of the experience, I suppose, when you have a lot of people in your tribe and can ""take shifts"". Otherwise, its almost impossible to do as a single player unless you are very dedicated and don't need sleep lol"

27854,"bought this game just because I had some buddies that were playing...little did I know that I would get addicted so quickly.  I will say that ""vanilla"" ark is nowhere near as good as hosting it yourself and being able to change things up.  Highly recommend checking out lots of mods to improve the game.  Trust me, youll be busy for hours in this one and time will fly.  This is like a base builder with pokemon...but they are all dinosaurs. 2legit2quit."

27872,yes
27873,Dinosaurs are pretty cool
27874,very good when playing with friends!
27875,It's hard and fun all at the same time. Gives you mixed emotions about throwing your computer or playing harder to level up. XP Admin doesn't mean nothing when it comes to this game :D which makes it even better!
27876,Ok
27877,Ark is an amazing game and I cannot stop playing. I just got my new computer and ever since my friend recommended Ark to me I just couldn't not try it. Ark is a game where you can tame amazing dinosaurs and the graphics are fantastic! So you should definitely play this game if you want an amazing experience!
27878,fun game
27879,Shit game but im addicted
27880,"This game so far is pretty decent. It's fun learning to capture dinosaurs.  Building bases is pretty annoying at times because the build system is so wonky. It's also pretty grindy gathering materials if you are playing without mods. The game has nothing to help you learn to play so be prepared to do research on YouTube. Still there is a certain element of danger early on that makes this game intersting. It is NOT fun when your weak and dinos walk around ruining your day by eating you. So learn to tame dinos early and learn how to use what dinos for what tasks. Learn how to set up dino groups to make using them much easier. Don't be afraid to make cheap thatch fences to keep your dinos in a certain area and use their auto harvest functions.

At the end of the day though, you will need a nice strong group of killers to go and roam the world with. Taming them is dangerous so when you find an area build a small stone hut with a bed. Then build several taming cages. Some build cheap ones but I like building big ones that are easy to run in and out of. Sometimes the best cage is the one where you are in it but they are trying to get in while you tranq them up. I just use stone door frames 3 levels high and 3 foundations wide so I can stand in the middle and be safe.

GLHF!!!"
27881,"Buggy, difficult, scary, tiring, waste of time, could not recommend a better game. I adore this game, even if it has done nothing but make my life harder. Play it and suffer, in the best way."

27884,dinosaurs r sick asf good game

27887,great game
27888,"You are going to have love/hate relationship with this game. One time you will feel so good about what you have achieved and another time you will be questioning your own life decisions. PvP is for people with no life so don't go there (unless you don't have life as well), it is very easy to spend HOURS in this game without even noticing. Bugs? Never heard of them :D.............TONS and TONS of bugs. This game is one big bug fest. Dinos are just stupid af. They just walk into a wall (or through), fly in the air ignoring your whistle or just going absolutely mental and fly all over the place. It's pretty tho, dinos and textures in general look pretty good and that's where PC specs come in place. I have RTX 2070 and Ryzen 7 3700x and I am playing on medium settings, sure I can do high but 40 FPS is not what I am looking for exactly. With medium I get around 70 FPS, it strongly depends on what is happening around you in game.
Overall it's great game, just don't play it if you value your own life"
27889,Fun addicting
27890,dinosaur survival shits dope
27891,GOOD GAME
27892,"Do you like punishment and kicking yourself in the balls? Do you like a game that allows you to mesh and aimbot? Do you like grief and losing everything over and over again with more to lose every time sometimes just because of a glitch? then you'll love ark, btw what the fuck does vin diesel have to do with dinos?

This game is rust with dinos and just a little less REEEEEEEE and a little more ""I spent hours imprinting that Capped giga just to lose it to an error for transfers"". 

All jokes aside, this game is like a crack addiction and a great way to break up with your mrs. remember.... nothing is more sexy than a grown man using a female character to dress up and role play as a woman while grappling bob squeakers in the face to steal all of their shit.

Get your gamer mechs on and space is the limit..... ok maybe folk lore is the limit.... hang on..... are dragons dinos? oh well otter madness leads to bosses and pressing J in breeding areas makes everything in tribe want to get closer. Just remember to look out for your team mates and set their dinos to aggressive.... or better yet, scout out a server for you by setting them to wander.

Pro tip.... quickest way to level gigas is their special ability to handle fall damage. when they lose their health to fall damage it doubles your experience. you'll be surprised at how quickly the Giga dominates everything around it."

Btw get this version, console sucks thb, especially switch version witch has not seen an update since release like 4 years ago."
27946,It is fun
27947,"UNDER DA SEAAA
"
27948,"Great game, toxic community, lots of bugs but its normal for a game of its complexity
"
27949,"grape
"
27950,"its very poggers
"
27951,"i mean, its a abseloutly fantastic game, grafics ect. tho it always goes into freeze frame at exactly 1 hour into the game or just at the beginning of it"
27952,it is so much fun
27953,aa
27954,my favourite game I have ever played!
27955,Biggest issue with the game is the poor support and the treatment of the players by the company that makes the game.
27956,best thing ever
27957,"This game is huge. But I still like it. Played it on console for years and just added it to my PC. 338gb total used in disk space. Sheesh. But it works to my surprise. I use a mix of high/ultra/epic settings and it manages to get 50fps on my 1195g7 CPU that uses iris xe 96eu gpu. And thats surprisingly well for a game like this. All of the maps work and everything else. So if you're looking into the game with similar CPU/GPU then here ya go. And this is a ""lower end"" PC."
27958,good survival game but do recommend a good gaming PC to use
27959,"Its got a lot of stuff takes time to get used to if you're new to playing wont lie man it will be hard at first but when you start to get the hang of everything it can be fun and the dinos in the game they all got cool and difrient abilitys.
"
27960,its a nice game for friends to chill and have some fun
27961,good
27962,BUGGY
27963,"This game is actually bloatware, could wildcard please learn about basic compression?"
27964,"DOESNT HAS CROSSPLATTFROM WITH PS4/5 OR XBOX!!!
only with epic games and steam played together BE CAREFULL"
27965,i think the spinosaurus are the cooledt pet in the game due to the fact thjat it has a big back
27966,"very fun
"
27967,Rex go brrrrr
27968,Noice.
27969,"love this game 
"
27970,"aRK IS a stunning, and amazing game to play for dinosaur lovers! Would totally play. I've been playing for a long time, and my total hours is 216. Thats dedication!"
27971,if you like dinos then this game is a must have i have had this game for about a week and i have spent 22 hours on it and every second i enjoyed

27973,"A great survival game, you can play for 400 hours and still not explored a single map! so much crafting, taming, breeding, mutations, technological upgrades, weapons, and more! worth  every single dollar! get ready to lose your life to this game."
27974,Me like dinosaur. ME CAVEMAN
27975,Dinosaurs
27976,bad sry Michael
27977,"Just like a YouTuber's that review this game says.... You log into the world for the first time... see the beautiful world for a moment.... then you die. You relog in to the world a bit more cautious, walk 10 feet and... then you die. Dying is inevitable... if you don't like dying don't get the game! If you don't give a flying broom handle if you die, get it! It is challenging and fun. I have a con about this game that eats my shorts completely and its the building. If ya ain't on level ground, it sucks butt to try and build unless you watch 50 flippen youtube videos on something that should NOT be this difficult as to build a dang foundation. Fix it please! Other than that, I love that i can tame dino's, fly, swim, ride on the dino's. i want to say its kid friendly but i wouldn't suggest anyone that doesn't like to kill animals or they might also need to turn the volume off because of the horrific sound of killing one. i think the engrams are nice to look forward to opening. Being a chic that likes to build in the games i wish there was more to make the houses look nice and just enjoy being there. I love fishing and the quiet. I like that there are ways to write on things and change colors on dino's. It is a good survival game. Some find it boring if they are not in PVP mode. However if you like a laid back experience do PVE. As a heartfelt person in games i love naming the dino's and feel sad if they die fighting for me. It is an enjoyable game!"
27978,One of the best games i've ever played. If you are wondering do you wanna buy it or not BUY IT.
27979,lots of fun
27980,Games alright. Played it a couple of hours.

27989,its is a good game i recommend it
27990,dogshit
27991,tickle chicken best gril
27992,Die once = forget about respawning near your friends. I've spent two hours of my playtime just trying to get to others just to get killed and spawn on the other side of the map. Absolutely horrid early game.

27996,best game ever
27997,"GOOD
"
27998,LOVE THIS GAME
27999,It has been a lot of fun adventure with the frills of surviving. With breathe taking views.
28000,I played Ark first on the PS4 and it was one of the first games I have played religiously on my new PC. I cannot wait to put in more hours and the experience is truly so much better with a mouse and keyboard and my curved monitor; so immersive. 12/10.
28001,"ive played this game on xbox for a while now (i have about 60 days) and ever since i watched the pooping evolved guys play modded i wanted to do that, and now i can ,it may be just because of nostalgia but i love this game and so might you"
28002,i want the woman model to put her boobvs in my mouth
28003,"If you like grinding and crafting games, base defense, and fighting games you will probably like ark"
28004,"Really recommend this Game. Its really enjoyable to play with friends on a server or solo.
Even the PVP is very Fun and entertaining."
28005,is good
28006,"Fun crafting, base building survival with the ability to tame dinos."
28007,I like the realism of the worlds and the veriety of dinosaurs to tame.
28008,very addicting
28009,Best. Game. EVER.
28010,this is actually just a terrible game i dont want to play this but someone is holding me at gunpoint to play this game with him help sos
28011,"Got mauled by two raptors right off of spawn, can't say I didn't enjoy it."
28012,good
28013,"This game is amazing if you're into open world exploring, building, and of course, taming dinos!  Easy to get lost in this game for hours at a time.  Plus, beautiful graphics!  It's a win/win/win."
28014,gud gam
28015,its fun
28016,best game ever
28017,Good game over 5k hrs on xbox

28022,"1000h+ in across pc + xbox.

28032,.
28033,.
28034,its a a good game
28035,"This game is a lot of fun with friends. It isn't too bad alone, but friends make it way better. If you enjoy the survival/ horror genera along with exploration and building, then you will really like this. It can be scary at first while you run around as there are different creatures that are quite unwelcoming. Once you know they are there and how to deal with them, the fear level decreases, but it's still good fun. I especially enjoy this game with mods. There are a lot of cool mods that extend the game play time, and improve on the time. Tl:DR : Play it with friends modded. Good luck and have fun!"
28036,Game u love to hate
28037,hehehahahehehaha HEHEHAHA
28038,love it
28039,good game second one coming out really exited
28040,nice
28041,"The only way to describe this game is it is my favourite and most hated game. if you like survival games and dinosaurs/mythical creatures you will love this game. 100's of creatures to tame to help you along the way, 100's of items, boss fights, tribes, from stone age to future items, this game has it all."

28051,fun with friends.
28052,"This game is literally filled with toxic little midget people. Truly the worst experience most of us will EVER have. Everything wants to kill you. Once ur sucked in, its a prison sentence. Please put me on death row. 8/10!"
28053,"Takes some getting used to - but the fun part is discovering all you can do. My first 12 hours of gameplay was frustrating sometimes, but this game is actually pretty fun and rewarding once you get the hang of it."

28100,"fun

28101,borat: very nice

28111,good gane to dumb people like a me
28112,"If you don't know about Ark fore shame on your parents and if you're an adult gamer and don't torture yourself with this sato-masochistic game...then you probably have a healthier mental state than most, and should immediately download this game."
28113,"great game
"
28114,A piece of shit game with lots of shits.
28115,the greatest game of all time.
28116,I cant get bored of this game especially when played online with tribes...
28117,This game is in my top 3 games of all time. I would recommend this games to everyone I know
28118,"Yes, the game has bugs. Yes, many times shit does happen.. But it is a good game with a lot to do. Ultimately a sandbox game with dinosaurs. Build a mega base, breed super dino's, rule the Ark,"
28119,"i love you

28128,ITS FUN
28129,Dont play on an Apple
28130,dinosaur game
28131,yes
28132,"Despite its shortcomings, ARK is a very enjoyable game with a lot of content to work with. On top of the modding community behind it, its a overall solid fun game. Obviously can't discount the bugs and anything else wrong with it but it doesn't detract from the game itself too much for myself."
28133,Only game with dinosaurs that's not trash...this game is still trash tho.
28134,totaly obsessed with this game at 2666 hours logged......still managing to have a life outside of ark would recomend 10/10

28146,
28147,great game
28148,"In a word: Glitchy.
However I enjoy it enough that I can get past the majority of the issues. I even uninstalled it for a long time before trying again. It isn't as quaint as the glitchy-ness of Bethesda but the potential of the game is such that I can get through it and still have fun."
28149,"Its a great game to play with your SO. 
My Gf loves it, and she isnt into games all that much."
28150,"Hi I'm playing Bark I have a problem every time I try to log in to the server it seems to me worked contact with the server

28163,"Very time consuming but fun
"
28164,"i Just want to play my dream game that its ark survival evloved but i got it for free for 3 days and now i dont have it :| u just did something bad dude 
"
28165,The game gets a lot better when you have your own server and don't have to wait hours to tame something.
28166,fun but not the same
28167,This game is fun for a bit it sometimes gets boring after a while but it is worth the money and I would recommend it. Idk like 7/10
28168,Heat
28169,I would recommend this game to others because the base game and mods are good in my opinion.
28170,"I've played this game quite a bit in my own time, but It's much better to play with friends. However, it is completely impossible to play with friends currently as non-dedicated servers are utterly broken. We've done lots of google searches, so many different methods of trying to fix things and connect, and nothing has helped. Also we found out that the non-dedicated servers feature of this game has been broken for years. Currently, despite how much I like this game, I cannot recommend it purely because it is near impossible to actually play with your friends on your own server."
28171,"I got Ark a few years back and reinstalled it on my comp recently so I could play in private. Imagine how excited I was to discover that the host non-dedicated servers feature is broken. And according to all my google searches, has been broken for at least five years."
28172,"amazing and challening 
"
28173,"Ark , in my opinion , is one of those games that you either love it or hate it. Your game play style will have a factor as well.  The game is on it's final year and it still has a few bugs. However , that to me gives the game it's charm. You can start each game with a purpose and a plan , only to be wrecked by a random T-Rex.  I very much like the building system , and I love making bases. Hope this was helpful."
28174,its a good game
28175,it is a awesome game
28176,"With over 500 hours into this game and renting 2 servers on Nitrado, you could def say that I love this game xD
There is so, so much to do on this game. Exploring, hunting dinos, taming dinos, building."
28177,its a nice game with a lot of options
28178,why is this game so low quality yet so fun?
28179,Very hard if you don't know this game like the back of your hand but really fun overall.
28180,"good survival game, very fun to play with friends"
28181,It is very fun but very adictive so have fun and play at your own risk
28182,good
28183,the best game of the world
28184,yes but yes
28185,Best game of all time. There is a lot of freedom in this game.
28186,worst optimised game ever but its basically digital crack

28188,dont just dont
28189,is a rilley good game
28190,good
28191,"i bought (or downloaded for free, i cant remember) ark when it was released, played for an hour and a half because my pc was shit, now i have a better pc i decided to play, oh wait its not in my library. thanks"

28198,"Really great game to play with friends, lots of unique dinos and different terrains to conquer."
28199,good
28200,"After playing this game for well over 1400 hours on xbox right up to Extinction I decided to revisit the game on PC with S+. Between S+ and Gen2 I ended up putting another 800 hours in! It was honestly a brand new survival game with alot of brand new elements being displayed making it much easier and more enjoyable to play with removing much of the needless grind from the game and replacing it with amazing features that should be naturally in the game. If you haven't played in a while, if you want the grandfather of all survival games to charm you one last time fire it up with S+ and buckle in for the most pleasurable survival experience your likely to have."
28201,"good
"
28202,I love dino.
28203,it  fun
28204,You owe it to yourself to at least give this a swing in single player. Rawr
28205,i got wiped after 320 hrs
28206,fucking hate this game dude. stupid crocs can kill themselves
28207,"A mixed feeling because the main reason I recommend this game is not for the base game but the amazing modding community, and the unofficial community, because lord knows official is sulfuric acid."
28208,Best co-op survival game so far but still need a lot of change to optimize the game ( mostly the memory )
28209,asda

28211,"Prepare for an addiction that no amount of lost progress, bugs, and general frustration can overcome. Its like crack, but with dinosaurs. 10/10"
28212,sus
28213,Great game
28214,"Bugs Bugs Bugs. Game concept and plot is great, but repeatedly I have had 30+ hour save files disappear and I wish I could say i am an isolated incident. The bug report discussion thread even on steam is miles long and constantly getting longer"
28215,Dinashawrsss
28216,great game very hard to do anything but great game lots of fun especially with mods this is a 10/10 game
28217,"YES
"
28218,"Good game, but really buggy. 
Do not hope for some patch to fix the problems, the game as been out for years and is still the same.

The officials servers are a mess. With no wipe the big tribes destroy you in seconds of you starting. 
Play in solo or on a private server to have fun. 

I repeat, it is a good game, you can have fun in it, I would still recommend buying it (When on sale if possible).


Also F*ck the Alpha dinos. I dont know why they exist."
28219,.
28220,great game
28221,Literally the best game of ALL TIME!

28226,dadawdafawagf
28227,AWSOME
28228,nice
28229,"Highly recommend!  I have only played this game for a year and half.  It is difficult to get the hang of things but soo worth it once you do.  Play alone or with friends, a must have experience in general.  Youtube and dododex,com will be your best friends when learning new things about Ark.  Be safe and have fun Arking."
28230,"good game or sumting
"
28231,i love this game. This is more than just a game its a lifestyle at this point. beyond just taming and fighting bosses there is the story to get into for the different ARKs there is the breeding for mutations and the colors with all kinds of different things going on you never know what your going to walk into. Then there is always the modded servers. :) ....BBBBUUUUTTTT PUT THIS ON VR AND I CAN PROMISE IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER!!!!!!
28232,Holy Crap this game is amazing
28233,i played this game on ps4 since 2017 and i love it ive been playing for a long time but pc ark aint too bad
28234,"I'm gonna try to keep this extra brief compared to a normal review of mine. I love survival games. I had heard many things that started to turn me off from the idea of this game, enough to have it in my library for months without opening it once. I thought that I had a very thorough understanding of what to expect from this game. When I saw the character creation, and how you look, it was almost the final nail in it's coffin. Through some miracle, or maybe from being in state of delirious sleeplessness, I hit ""randomize"" and kept playing. Almost everything that I had heard that made me not like it was wrong. This game is amazing. Don't let other people's first impressions or time earned miseries spoil this for you. If you are like me then you will find this very worth playing, and I'm still just getting started."
28235,I've never loved and hated a game so much at the same time
28236,"good game

28237,playing this game is like making friends its hard doesnt make sense and i have too much time to myself 7/10 makes me want to implode bought it on sale for 20 bucks used to be sixty glad i bought it on sale

28251,I love Ark. I started playing it on the launch date of the PS4. And since than I have learn coding on a small scale from renting and owning unofficial servers. Ark is a great game. It will and has become a legend. I hope many old players come back to the game and those that have not played the game yet. It is worth the experience to try it out. This game has made me a fan of base raiding sandbox games. And I look forward to many more like it.

28257,"GOOD GAME
"
28258,"Yes, the game is buggy sometimes, but when you compare the negatives to the positives, I can't recommend this game enough. The graphics are amazing. The open worlds are so much fun to explore. Wildcard does an amazing job of listening to the community and making us feel like what we think really matters. Being able to play single player or with a group of friends is awesome."

28267,"if you want an open sandbox where the other players will most def ruin your progress, or possibly even help, mostly just pillage and torment though. the dinos eat you every 5 sec and if thats not enough, on some servers you cant build in caves, so every base is in the open like a nutjob. happy hunting"
28268,"I can't tell if I love or hate this game, but either way I recommend this game if you have a MONSTER pc unlike me."
28269,it's  fun and if you get bored play spme mods
28270,"--- Past Experience ---
I initially put in some hours years ago (when it first released) and found the PVP aspect on official servers to be annoying as well as the difficulty to tame, breed and raise some dinosaurs. while it felt realistic, it wasn't for me. 

--- Current Experience ---
Lately I have been playing on a PVE server with some friends and we have fully enjoyed the more casual experience PVE offers. We are enjoying more content and aspects of the game more freely. I would recommend for this reason.

--- Game Improvement Ideas ---
Below are just some additional thoughts I have on the game. I think they could add to the core experience, but I also know that mods could support these features and would lower the need to add to the core experience.

I do think that after all the years Ark has existed, a majority of its playerbase is focused on PVP content, Because of this, most of the content added is focused on the PVP aspects of the game. Since the game has both PVP and PVE game modes, I am disappointed that Ark has not created NPC bases to learn the raiding aspect of the game in a PVE server (singleplayer or multiplayer). Several dinos are more focused on PVP aspect and feel unnecessary in PVE. Having NPCs that are running around taming creatures, breeding creatures, exploring hotspots, resource gathering, and using dinos to mount would add more immersion to the experience. I would think NPCs would be diabled on official PVP servers, but for a small group of friends who prefer to Free-for-all or team up into a couple small tribes, they could benefit from an NPC feature as well. The base building for NPCs would need a systematic approach to create simple to intricate bases to attempt to raid. NPCs could even attack your base over time especially if you are nearby, or they see you as a threat. Threat would be determined by the amount of structure your tribe has, the quality(material) of the structures, the location of your structure, structure distribution across the map (NPC may discover several smaller bases and raid one or more if there is threat that you might have too much control.) NPCs also can only assess threat they can see. Some NPCs could passively scout and leave a base untouched, while other NPCs might try to interact with your base and try to open windows, doors, storages, tool stations, crops and more. Their aggression would be determined by their Tribe aggression and the Threat you pose to their Tribe.

 I think it would be a fun addition to the game to add base blueprints. This would be another system NPCs could use to guide them to building and upgrading bases or traps. The blueprints would create an overlay to show what type of structure is needed. it would be similar to the visual when placing a structure, but it would be more transparent and more grayed-out so that the placement overlay can be easily seen. Unique base blueprints would have a position requirement. They would need placed at a specific place and would ""snap to"" its world position. This would allow players to have blueprints for traps and unique blueprints for rat holes, caves, or other specific locations. Could also add a Surveying tool to the game with markers so that you could locate the exact bounding box area you want to include in a Base blueprint. once all the markers have been marked by the optical surveyor, You use a war map to create the blueprint. The optical surveyor could be made using a spyglass, compass,  electronics and metal. This would essentially be a multi-item tool.

I also think the game could benefit from a Quality of life update: Create books using 10 notes, 3 hide, and 5 fiber. This would allow players to create and write in books. The creator of the book can lock writing and/or lock reading with a pin code. Books could be useful for leaving information for your team mates, or for Role-playing where recording events creates history and unique items in the game that are priceless. These can be duplicated if you have an empty book. The time it takes to copy the book depends on how much text (in pages) have been used. A wooden, stone, metal, and tek Bookshelf could be added to store books. A Lectern could be added to place a book on for reading. This could be useful for a War room, where the lectern has a book of information about a base, what tames were found, potential weak points, location, etc. This could be useful alongside a war map to better update your tribemates with details.

Another Quality of Life update is improving the folder system. I think folders are great to use, especially for creating load outs (if you don't have the new Gen 2 load out structure). I think folders should also have a filter mode, so that it will automatically add any item it already contains. For example if you have a Resources folder on your inventory and you gather some wood and put it into the resources folder with the filter mode enabled, then any wood collected after that would be automatically added to that folder. hovering on a folder should also show the overall weight of the folder (just like Operating system folders show their overall size). The tooltip could also show a summary of the first 5 unique items (based on their folder sort). If the folder only contains one material, than the summary would show the total weight and count of that material. You should also be able to rename folders. Folders should also contain a single ""withdraw slot"" within the folder. Dragging an item there means that you want the folder withdraw mode to withdraw that item. if there is more than one stack, you can withdraw multiple stacks. right-clicking on the folder would give you the option to withdraw one, all(count), or withdraw amount (stack, half, other).  

Lastly, the Quality of life updates should also contain the ability to use note on an item. The first line of the note would become the item's name. and the second line would become the item description. This would be helpful to name gear if you plan to use it for certain load outs, or to give to a friend, or to indicate ownership. there might be other names as well (such as for fun after dying an item, or for role-playing)."

28284,Ive never hated a game so much as I hate this one. That being said. I would spend every dollar i have to play this game and will continue to buy the dlc the second they come out. Its so annoying and hard and the public servers are brutal. The game is buggy and you will spend five minutes asking the screen if it will not be a bitch today. My favorite game hands down 1/10
28285,"The game is good but if you don't have PC you shouldn't get it, it's quite laggy on my gaming laptop still good nonetheless."

28291,"I love this game so much, but it can be super frustrating with taming things and making non dedicated servers for your friends, like there is no need for the dedicated server button option because you dont even use it when making dedicated server LOL
Taming is decently realistic, its usually worth taming the larger more lengthy tames and it makes you feel accomplished, and it sucks when that one random rex comes along and eats your tame alive, but for me personally this game is so worth getting, and it gives you many different feelings such as, accomplishment, pride, fear, disappointment, and everything in between"

28309,its fun and even better with mods

28311,im fixing this game.....
28312,"Crashy, but Im willing to buy a whole new computer strong enough to play this smoothly. That's how much I love this game."
28313,"I was so sceptical of this game when I began, the game does have some light heartedness to it and some parts of it are quite fun. However, I cross the line at being stun locked and killed slowly over 4-5 minutes, that is absolutely ridiculous. And I respawn at my bed, of course it's a raptor just waiting for me. I cant stand game likes this, making survival like this is not fun to play.
This game is so unfriendly to beginners, almost everyone is super experienced and it's just SO difficult to get into it in the first place.
Despite my love of dinosaurs, this is not worth it.

Don't buy this game.
"
28314,Possibilities are endless.
28315,"This game has gone through ups and downs. but its at a point where no matter what itch you're trying to scratch, theres something in ARK.  There's pvp. there's pve. there's dinosaurs. crafting. exploring. there's team dynamic. solo stuff. there's base design. land. air. sea.  Its fun. its interactive. and easily one of the games I've played the most in my Steam library."

I haven't played it since 2018 - Learned that it's released on all platforms, Not cross-platform UNLESS you have the Xbox and Windows 10 versions. PS4 version and Switch Versions can get F'd along with the Steam Version.
I think that it's a little ridiculous to make your customer dig around online through different forums and crappy IGN knock-offs.
Save your time & money. 2/10 I was able to be blue and run fast while hitting dinos with a club."

28419,I have put thousands of hours into this game between PC and console. It is definitely worth the money you will spend as just to play the base game and progress through the unmodded content will take you hundreds of hours alone.

Its such a shame that it has so many issues and the devs dont seem to want to fix these problems after so many years. I wont lie i have enjoyed massively the time i have managed to play the game but its also devestating when you cant get back in to play when so many hours invested.
 I have more than the recomended spec for this and still struggles to get it to work. I would love to change this review if things got fixed but with the advent of Ark 2 coming out its doubtful anything will happen"

28488,It good
28489,"good game idea, but really shitty graphics, change ur fov up and its a fun game especially just starting out single player"
28490,There is just so much to this game. Some of the graphics and multiplayer aspects are outdated but its still a fun and adventurous game. Would recommend if you are tired of toxicity or other people in general. Much more fun with friends but hard to set up.
28491,yes

28504,i need steam points
28505,its good not as good as fortknite fortnkite alpha game 11/10
28506,good game
28507,Good Game really fun to play and explore around alot of storage though only downside
28508,Takes up more space than my homework folder
28509,nice game just have a decent computer
28510,Best game ever in steam
28511,dino
28512,i dont know i get angry i play when my base gets destory all dinos die i cant stop playing
28513,"Really, really good game if:
- You are willing to grind
- You have a somewhat decent PC
- If you have friends (this one is kinda hard)"
28514,"i have had this game since ea. ever few years ill hop back on to see how its doing. tons of new stuff but same bugs and headache as early release, fix your game its been years now......"
28515,Great Game
28516,"this is a great game its community can be toxic, but is positive most of the time and the mods are fantastic.

 its still buggy tho"
28517,VERY GOOD
28518,"This is one of my favorite games, though it does take a lot of storage space."
28519,"fun
"
28520,This is a true survival game. I enjoy playing with and without others.
28521,"good fidnsaounsour game, loved it so fun to play with my grandson which is 8 years old when we firest played this in 2018, i love this game!"
28522,"Right in the 90s kid feels. Like your own private Jurassic Park you can catch em all in. I have played since Beta*  and I am still not bored. 

*took a break from all gaming because PC broke just before 1st UK lockdown or my hours would be higher."
28523,Great Game. This is my first survival game.
28524,"Even vanilla it's really fun, especially if you like dinos! So far, Valguero is my favorite map in the game, and definitely looking forward to Fjordur. It can get a little stale playing single player after a while though, and some servers are absolutely brutal."
28525,its an amazing game you should play
28526,WAY BETTER THAN RUST
28527,"So long as you play on a private server, this game can be fun. Public servers are terrible full of trolls and jerks.  

The free for all nature of this game on PVP sucks and PVE just ends up with people claiming all of the map.

If the maps were large enough to separate tribes and movement from one area to another actually took time, new players could actually play the game without worrying about a flyer easily finding them and swooping down to kill them."
28528,Awesome game
28529,nuts
28530,"Yes, i hate it."
28531,nice
28532,This game is super fun and it is easy to download mods and make the game even funner. You can tame dinos fight bosses and build the base of you dreams. And if you are looking for a challenge you can customize you world/server how ever you want. And on top of all that You can play with your friends in a world with just you or you can play pvp.
28533,Always something new to find.
28534,Its a good exploring game. Don't like dying due to the raptors but it doesn't happen often.
28535,OooOOoOoOOoO   ScaAaAAary DIIiiInNoOooSsAuRSSsS
28536,is fun with friends and also mods good game

28539,I love this game
28540,yesh!!!
28541,"Just difficult enough playing solo. Would love to play in groups on server, but they all lag so bad.  I do enjoy playing solo and find the grind enjoyable."
28542,I recommend Ark Survival Evolved. It is a perfect game APART a couple of glitches in PVP
28543,Get for PVP and CoOP
28544,If you like survival based games this one's pretty ace - would avoid on Switch and make sure your PC is up for it though as it's a pretty beefy game to run
28545,Goog

28573,This is such a fun game with so much things to do. It is a great game to play with friends or to play on a pvp server. There is so much things to explore. The graphics in this game are pretty nice but just note you need a really good pc to run this game and it is really badly optimised! Overall it is a fun game and I could play it hours on end!

28593,"Fun survival game with guns and dinos, how could it be better? Building can be a royal pain and the gamma/lighting seems a bit off but it's fixable with in game settings.  Only played PVE so far but it's fun to watch your dino army grow."
28594,it is fun
28595,Loving this so far!
28596,"one of my go to games with my roommate and boyfriend, literally the best the time running around and taming dinos. Plus my boyfriend is obsessed with Dinosaurs so he gets excited to point out all the Dino facts. 10/10. still one of those games that are what you make it, but ive had the best time"
28597,"This game reflects the greatest strength of humanity, our wits and tools. 
No human would stand a chance against a lion, we have no fangs or claws to attack with and our soft bear skin is very vulnerable. put a spear in their hand they might stand a chance. 
you have to use your tools to overcome challenges such as (building a trap for an animal you want to tame but its too dangerous to confront) or (building a shelter to keep yourself safe from the elements)
there are many different worlds AKA (ARKs) to play on with different creatures to encounter. different Biomes to explore. Some worlds have heat waves you can die in these as it is so hot your health and water will continue to drain untill its over. Other worlds at night it gets so cold your health drops so fast you could die before you can get down the snowy mountain into a warmer biome.  Another world has radiation zones that you need hazmat suits to explore. Another world is all massive underground caverns and the surface of the world is scorched aflame by day and over run with aliens at night. these are just some examples of challenges you will have to over come. There is a storyline, for the game but its not an RPG sinamatic its a little more sandbox with story sprinkled in. There is no skill tree rather you gain abilitys through tamed and or bred mounts, weapons, tools, gear. If your new to videogames in general you may not want to start with ARK because i do recommend a little research before playing. the game can also be buggy i myself have a perminant bug in single player that i ""fixed"" through settings. its the nodes wont respawn bug, i set resources radious for structures and players to zero and resources respawn period to zero to get them to respawn, things like that you might run into if you play single player you will have to look up a fix for glitches or bugs you run into. now you can play on offical wildcards servers can be laggy because lots of people and their structures and animals. i played offical on Xbox for years and loved it and also hated it at times because people can inside you and steal your hard earned animals and gear so do not expect people to welcome you with open arms into their tribe they will be sus about you at first untill they feel your not out to take their stuff. its better to play this game with friend in my opinion its more fun goofing around you can fight and kill each other lol also more manpower means faster gathering, building more guns to help you kill world bosses.  you can run your own servers as a dedicated or nondedicated you or your friend can control server settings and use admin commands spawn in anything you want. Yes this game is buggy in SP and laggy on offical but hey what can i say i fell in love with this game and recommend to all! what you can do in this game is limitless me and my friends built an arena where we have gunfights capture the flag i mean dodo lol fun times."
28598,too many bugs
28599,good
28600,It is really fun especially with mods even thought I have only played for 8 hours on this computer I have played the game in total for over 300 hours in total on my xbox and over 500 total hours on my old computer. I definitely recommend it.
28601,I liked the game for the freeness and large map that it gives.
28602,Very Good

28605,"Is this game sexual abuse? 
Is this game supporting equal genders? 
Is this game legal to play?
The answer is yes, just play guys! Can you imagine when you can ride on a big big daddy dinosaur like that, voila, ou lala, there is no time to wait, just buy it and play! The daddy dinosaur won't wait for you for that long. :# ♥"

28617,"good or is it
"
28618,"The game is PERFECTO, this is all you need to know guys.

Never regretted the cost for any content Ark has to offer."
28619,"Great if you have thousands of hours to waste and don't mind game-breaking glitches that can reset all your progress and never get patched. Slightly less great if when you don't play a game for 4 days consecutively you forget everything you were doing and want to restart. Ok if you have a life and standards and are just depressedly putting up with this game because it's kind of fleshed out and unique. 

Way too expensive and notoriously buggy to recommend.

28621,"Dino see, Dino tamed."
28622,This game online is only great when you like to no life 1 game all day everyday. Else its not worth it. You'll just get wiped if you're offline for a couple days.
28623,"i suffer with depression and agoraphobia and more and i have looked for a game to disappear into for ages , ive found it lol . great game to just amerce yourself into and if you have friends that will join you , who needs a real life not me x"
28624,"its noice
"
28625,Mint game just meh dinos die in 5 mins
28626,"I would most certainly recommend ark for creative pvp type people, you can discover the amazing prehistoric nature and battle to get to the top."
28627,I need a better PC for play this game because my PC crash when I open this game. :c (Don't buy this game when you dont have a good pc or your pc dont have the minimun recurses)
28628,"I tried several times to get into this game. It is fun initially but super grindy. I made a custom server with tweaked settings to get around the grind and it did feel better that way. The main reason I can't recommend this game is due to bugs that have been there from day one that still haven't been fixed. My frustration is really centered around the dinosaur AI. It is atrocious. You get super hyped to tame a dino, which takes forever if you don't tweak the taming time, only to have it get stuck on a rock or random object. This may not sound like a big deal, but eventually you will have several dinos following you and inevitably one will get stuck somewhere without you noticing. There isn't really any way to track where your dinos are at as far as I know and therefore you have to search for them like a set of lost car keys. Usually you'll find the corpse or get a message saying your dino has been killed by some other predator. Really kills the gameplay."

My opinions seems to be shared by the people I play with as well. This game is amazing but it's hard to say why. There are few spectacular things about it and yet the sum of all it's parts add up to far more than it should.

I doubt the result is what the developer wished for, but the outcome far better than a great game."
28647,Excelent Game
28648,not bad

28650,"my total hours are from single player/ private server viewpoint, i love Ark and its Buggyness except the fact that u need 320gigs of free space to install the game not 60 and with every free map they add might as well add another 50gigs to your hard drive space needed and possible more if the free map also adds new creatures so when ever they feel like buying me a extra hard drive to run there game ill play again"
28651,Good Shit
28652,Bugged at times but enjoyable
28653,Love this game.
28654,Best survival game out there.
28655,"When you were a child did you ever have dreams of walking with dinosaurs.....well how about riding a T-Rex while firing a rocket into the side of some guys base because he stole some of your metal.....and even then what about breeding giant wolves that could clearly eat your character within seconds? wanna deal with the annoyance with raising them from babies...well its hell....and you'll love it....

28663,great game. ive been playing on and off since 2019. its a great game if your into pvp and no lifeing games that are fun. i havent tried pve but i would say its kinda fun to build and tame sometimes but i do rly enjoy building in this game. but if you like rust ark would def be a good change. worth buying some of the dlcs
28664,Great game if you dont have a busy life or girlfriend lol
28665,VERY SCARY aND GOOD
28666,Awsome Game!!
28667,This is a good game. It takes a while to get going but once you have the basic items it gets easier. You have to work at the crafting so its a bit of a grind. Taming dino's takes a long time but is worth it in the long run.
28668,its a fun survival game can but it is fun with friends

28670,"If this game looks cool, don't go out and buy it just yet. this game in singleplayer is more or less hot garbage, as many things simply aren't possible and singleplayer itself is bugged to hell even more than the regular game.

My recommendation is to get a group of friends together, and either play on a public PvE server (PvP in this game is so broken, full of cheaters, and other BS it's not even worth touching) or make your own using Ark Server Manager (youtube it, fairly easy process). This makes it so you control every aspect of the server, and can even use cheats to make up for the *inevitable* bugs that will kill you, your tame, and probably some of your items just to give you that extra middle finger (as this game does).

BUT, if you do this, this game is quite fun, infuriating at times, but overall super fun."

Jump back in, punch a tree, kick a dodo...... get physically destroyed by a Rex. Jump in again cause damn this game is fun,....... get obliterated by a Giga. 

Man I can not wait till I can fight the bosses!!

Just finished the tutorial and I wish I had more hours in before this review. Since people really want to know if they should buy it too just shy of 2000 will do. All I can say is yeah, not bad sofar. 

Would recommend."

28704,game too fun
28705,I have played this game on PlayStation over 5600 hours and now on PC approximately 600 hours so far. I am completely addicted to this game. Have been since I laid eyes on it. So much to learn and yet simple enough to play. The hunt for the perfect dino is exhilarating in my books. Taming and then building. There are tips and tricks to making your builds look remarkable. There are some great server owners out there who love this game as much as I do. So much to do and it just keeps getting better. Even with all the little hiccups... Its just an amazing game.
28706,we enjoy the game but the raiding while you just getting started is no fun

28726,its good.
28727,its a really fun and cool open world game with dinos. you can invite friends to
28728,"I'm going to be honest here: I haven't played this game in a year or two, so I don't know what it's like out of early access. I will say that this game is very difficult and unforgiving, especially if you are playing alone.

By yourself, this game is a slog and requires slow playing so that you don't accidentally die due to being underprepared. One small carnivore will eat those naked cheeks of yours easy. Even with friends this is a difficult game in a normal server.

However, if you are playing this on a modded server, able to speed up the rate of experience, taming, and other necessities in game, it is incredibly fun. The game progresses normally and yes, if there are dedicated players then you can beat the game fairly quickly as production ramps up towards the end, but if you played normally, this game would take far too long with far too little enjoyment.

Normally, this game is frustrating and slow. Modded, this game is a joy to play with friends."

28734,game doo doo
28735,"yes
"
28736,is good
28737,I think it is a really nice game. It just gets really upsetting when you make one of your pets aggressive but then all of your pets are aggressive and attack a stronger dino and it kills them. But it is still one of the best games and a LOVE drawing some of the dinos.
28738,Honestly this game trash
28739,im addicted to this game
28740,"Awesome game, can't wait to put more hours in. Never liked this on console but PC is a whole new ball-game graphic/gameplay wise."
28741,"Super addicting, lots to do. something for everybody. you can build, tame, hunt in ocean, space, land, kill everything, boss fights.. everything"
28742,shit
28743,This game is amazing. The controls are a little hard at first but all the maps that come out look awesome and each one looks different than the others so you never get bored.
28744,haha dino go rar
28745,"A super fun game - difficult to start from scratch, but once you understand the basics, it's such a fun time. I don't normally comment on visuals, but this game looks absolutely stunning. I run this game on macOS using a Windows 10 VM, and it runs well enough to be playable even with high graphics settings."
28746,Good
28747,Poop
28748,"0.5 stars out of 5.
I love this game. It's one of my favorites.
However I can't recommend spending money on this game because I feel it is unplayable without mods/cheats.
With mods and admin commands it's great.  Hours of fun building bases and riding dinosaurs.
Without mods it's 99% frustration.  Can I interact with this thing I'm pointing at with my crosshairs.  Nope.  Interaction often happens with some other object.  Usually something off screen.
Can I place a structure piece here.  Game says yes then places it somewhere else often deleting some other object in the process.
Can I snap an object to another object.  Often the answer is no and for no reason whatsoever.
Can dinosaurs fall through the map and become lost.  Absolutely.
Can I and my dinosaurs get stuck inside an object with no way out except to delete the object losing items and resources.  Absolutely.

Luckily, cheating fixes everything.

There are other annoying things that are just part of the game.
Checking your surroundings to make sure it's safe?  Yes.
Mini-boss dinosaurs spawn in within aggro range and attack even though you've been checking to make sure it's safe?  Yes.

The game looks Great.
Riding Dinosaurs is fun.
Building is awesome only if you are running mods/cheats."
28749,HOLY SHIT THIS GAME IS ASWSOME I LOVE DINASOURS!!!!
28750,uh good

28764,"Very hard game at first understanding the ways of pvp servers but would reccommend to just about every gamer that loves raiding, pvp fights along with passive farming along the way to get to claim to be the ALPHA tribe. Very fun game all around"

28774,Good Game with dinosaurs and monsters and shit. Recommend it for real Great game.
28775,Toxic game and waste of time. No real way to enjoy the PVP aspect without giving your life away to the game. If you are offline for a half hour be sure to know your base and everything you spend time on will be in flames in .5 seconds.

28795,"Really addictive but super fun with friends, sometimes grindy and will make you mad"
28796,"I really tried with this one. I tried to get past the horrifying meat abomination character you play as. I tried to enjoy collecting dinosaurs. I swear I tried. It's just so, so boring. As a newb, you can't do anything on a public server, and as someone without a crew, solo or private servers are a tedious slog. No thanks."
28797,"yes very good 
"
28798,pp
28799,"Honestly, this game used to look like it had so much potential. I would have at one time even given it a recommendation. However, the devs really messed this one up. It's a glitchy mess that barely runs, even on a decent computer. The servers constantly crash, and yet the devs seem too focused on making new content (and now even a sequel) to polish the game that's already there. If I had to score it, I would give it a 2/10. It has some interesting ideas, and some pretty cool designs, but is basically unplayable, and I'm not saying that to be dramatic. This game is actually unplayable."
28800,"Ark is a pretty fun game. I know it’s meant to be played multiplayer, but I played through the base game and the first 3 dlc’s singleplayer without too many issues. Gameplay is really fun, though it can get pretty tough at times, to the point of wanting to rip my hair out on a few occasions, but it’s worth it. Story’s pretty good, though a bit hard to follow with the way it’s told. Masterful music, the fights I got into felt intense, and the bosses were epic. Keeping exotic pets was also fun, though the game’s reliance on them is a bit annoying. My only real qualms are that later in the game, certain things take unholy amounts of resources to make, and also I dislike the fact that ark takes up 1/4 of my disk space without any DLCs."

28803,its a very great game and its very time comsuming and it make your day go by really fast and it very enjoyable and it helps ease the mind and it allows you to play with your friends

shit game do not buy."

28862,A masochist's dream. Finding fun in this game is like rummaging through a box of razors for a chicken nugget you dropped. Generally not worth the effort given the rampant glitches and sheer amount of time required to progress.

28865,"I have around 10k hours on Steam and Xbox combined, I would recommend this game if you are looking for a game to throw your life away with. Everything you do is an endless grind. Spend years to build up defenses and bloodlines just to have another tribe cap your server while Dosing it and cheat by using the never ending bugs. Every update wildcard comes out with is decorated with an endless cycle of new bugs and glitches. Instead of fixing these bugs wildcard simply ignores them and pumps out new DLCS. Ark was once a great game but is now littered with hackers, meshers, and dupers.


take this as a grain of salt, this is just my experience. stop crying in the comments lol

28876,good
28877,"
Worst game ever created. Not even worth this comment.. Absolute complete and total TRASH, I would wipe with printed code if only this was programmed but instead Unreal Engine blueprint Garbage, made with click and drag asset packs, all incompatible and has every error you can imagine. The gameplay basically consists of navigating Epic faults and shortcommings on an ""engine"" that should never exist, spawned off a trashy shooter game. It employs it's game bugs as if it's the game-play challanges which basically makes it an absulutely miserable experience to say the absolute least. This game will cause sick stress, nerve racking situations and most importantly the biggest waste of time and life. Everything is meant to take years, only to loose in all in a second from endless game glitches and bugs. This game should seriously be reprimanded and removed from Steam and society altogether because the practices used in this game are very, Very sick and evil. This game has ENDLESS ways for ""penalizing"" your character with SIEZURE-INDUCING red screen flickering which WILL DRIVE YOU MAD!! Be prepared to play 50% of your game with a literal BLACK SCREEN since it ""features"" night time! and another 50% of your game with a flickering screen and miserable audio clips of your pathetic character dying. I get that its meant to be challanging but this is just wicked marketing of Unreal asset packs, and the ONLY challanges of Extreme time consumption, vision limitations, slowed movements and you will mostly die from glitches. ""blueprint devs"" should seriously consider quitting instead of causing distress to market absolute and complete miserable trash on the market. raise the bar dont lower it. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC"

I only have one complaint, out of all of the possible problems that a game could have, the only problem I have is with the updates taking so long. Recently my internet is so slow that I fear i could log in to refresh my base and i would be waiting so long to update that it would decay. Other than that, this game is worth so much more than it is praised for."

28951,Have been playing this game pretty heavy duty since nearly the very beginning.  It is the only game that has consistently held my attention for this kind of a span of time.  On rp servers its even better because there is more to do.  There are a lot of things that could be done to improve it but they have done a pretty excellent job overall.
28952,i would say this is a very funny game and i can really recommend it for everybodey.

28959," [h1] It's a great game with a lot of freedom. [/h1]

Just got to say I have played the games at least double this time on PS4 as well.

[b] Stuff I like: [/b]
- In-depth base building
- Exploring the worlds/maps (aka ARK's). 
- Dino taming and that almost every single dino has a specific purpose
- The game is hard by default and as a new player you have no idea what to do
- Progression from early to end game in a way makes sense and doesn't feel like a burden
- The lore is interesting and well written

[b] Stuff I don't like: [/b]
- Too many unforgivable bugs
- Weird snap points and angles limits your building possibilities
- PvP is a nudge too hard-core for my liking
- The game has become worse with the years. The first map is no doubt the best one, with challenge caves and a nuanced landscape. The last map is too big, to the point that it feels empty. It could've been 1/4 the size and still give as much to explore, just that you wouldn't get bored of it.
- Tech ruins the game. Especially on the last map, where you get a free tech suit, which is just mind blowing stupid. This counters more than half of my pro-points above. Progression doesn't make as much sense, as you can fly already. Exploring doesn't feel as engaging, especially as there are no challenge caves. The game becomes too easy, as you actually can tame an end game dino (Reaper King) at level 1.

There's a lot more that can be said and improved. I have good faith in ARK 2, where they can start with a fresh new primitive approach and get back to the roots of what makes ARK so much fun!"
28960,"In my opinion, ark is a fantastic game for people who have a soft spot for dinosaurs. it does have some bugs and it has a lot of grinding, but every game has its own ups and downs. Ark is a progressive and adventurous type of game and i would recommend it to people who like building, taming or just the dinosaurs."

This game is very fun, but grindy, and buggy, and annoying, and difficult. But I love it!

It just gives you that sense of wonder at the dinsosaurs the first time you play.

29018,"Best game involving survival skills and strategy as well as multiplayer gameplay. Plus DINOS, who doesn't want that."
29019,"What an absolute dumpster fire, with no concept of risk vs reward, it literally well get you spending hours on line for very little all easily taken away.  But alas the players have developed mods that make life easier and the game enjoyable, but why is it always up to the players, wheres there cut ? 
if it wasnt for them much like myself im sure there are many that wouldnt play."
29020,pog
29021,"I have been playing with my out of state family, it's a great way to have fun and stay connected. It's also the only thing that can get my teenage nephew to talk to me  beyond the usual ""uh-huh"", lol. I'm really enjoying the interaction although there are some issues regarding size and stability, it' still a great game!
Unfortunately, it's been so unstable lately that I can't even get into it to play with my family or at all. I really wish they'd work on the stability issues so their game would be playable rather than focusing on shiny new dinos before they've done the real work. 
Currently I can't actually recommend this game due to it's lack of playablity."
29022,This game is definitely worth a shot. Ark with mods is so much fun!
29023,i think this game is realy fun u get to fly leavl up and just have fun

29058,"got 500 hours on ps4, this game is great"
29059,"Grind is horrible, performance is horrible, combat is horrible, story is, uhh, non existent i guess? Bugs have never been fixed, this game is pretty much abandoned, balancing is horrible gameplay is pretty bland and often times horrible (you can actually never unlock all the buildings) .  There's just really nothing to like in this game other than, well, dinosaurs."

29090,"Have a lot of playtime, but the experience is absolute garbage, 90% of the time the game is either lagging, or you are experiencing some of the many bugs this trash game has. On top of that most of the time you wont be able to get into the game or join your friends with the simple ""Host Timeout"" that has no explanation. The main emotion I feel when playing this game is anger or frustration, with very little joy, fucking dog shit cunts at wildcard should quit"

29125,Hmmm what to say about ark it has a lot to do you do have to grind quite a lot but you get used to it and in my opinion is overall a good game
29126,"you may say that other games are better, have less bugs and glitches, and overall a better experience. HOWEVER, do those other games have dinosaurs????? didn't think so"

ngl as not many people say this u will DIE a lot in the start up (like the first 10 hours) if u can get passed that and get ur first flyer ur set for sucsess"
29141,Try it and join a tribe as soon as possible. Good Luck
29142,"Fantastic game made better with the mods and maps. Great fun just on your own hunting down creatures to tame, farm, build, grow your ever expanding dino army or hang out and grow a mini community with friends.

It can be glitchy at times, and the updates may eat your bandwidth and harddrive space BUT I still say it's worth it. It has become one of my go-to games when I want to just chill with friends or go on a virtual adventure."
29143,Very nice game.
29144,Its buggy as hell and poorly optimized but dam is it good. I traded my girlfriend for this game.
29145,
29146,good
29147,"If you want to get into this game, please don't its just pure pain. 
All jokes aside, it's very fun to play with friends and even on your own with enough dedication.

29159,"It has dinosaurs



 idk what else to say"
29160,"This game has taken over a thousand hours of my life.  It is a poorly coded beautiful mess that I can ride dinosaurs and have them die to random crap, sometimes not even visible or even avoidable random crap.  My friends and I have come to refer to this misery as being Ark'd and honestly, it makes me rage quit the game only to boot it up days later.  Repeating a never ending, vicious cycle."
29161,too addictive
29162,"great game if you like building, customizing and grinding"
29163,Not a bad game
29164,"TOTALLY ADDICTIVE, AND ENORMOUS FUN TO PLAY."

29192,Hands down one of the best games I've played.
29193,"Real survival from zero to hero.. Real graphic.. Always play without mod to feel its experience.. If i'm bored play this game then i play another game and bored again, this game will be my choice again.. Until now i still not finish learning, too much to learn.. Dont play this game if u just play for easy game.. i wish one day someone from Malaysia will open unofficial server with more asian player in it.. Well done sir!!"
29194,"Over the course of playing this game for over 700+ hours I have learned that it's fun, it's amazing, it's kool! (with building mods almost a must) however... why it took up 500+ gigs of my hard drive space when only playing single player and co op with a boyfriend... Barely building anywhere outside of the starter location in one world, after many updates and patches, instead of copying over the old files it would simply keep stacking files upon files nearly killing my PC SSD because it got completely full from ONE game. I have uninstalled it and will never play it again. For those who have the game and notice your HDD or SSD is filling up rediculously fast, I recommend reinstalling the game after a few updates to keep the game from inflating to INSANE amounts, sucking the life out of your PC. Q.Q I will miss playing this game with my boyfriend, but I would miss not having a PC more."
29195,"Love riding the dinosaurs around and building homesteads, graphics are beautiful"
29196,mmmm tasty game
29197,lovee the arrk
29198,fun game. deff gonna go with pve it gives me more time to relax and tame.

29205,VERY GOOD!
29206,"ITS ARK
"
29207,"At first, You feel like a target, the dinosaurs come thick and fast and you have to run to survive.  Then you work out how to build and get yourself safe.  After some time levelling up you become stronger and can actually fight or capture and tame dinos.  You are always at risk, the excitement never goes away!  Make friends as soon as you can, they will help you mostly, but beware of sharks too."
29208,really fun but have friends unless it can get boring
29209,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH


IT'S....

COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkk............................."
29210,fun
29211,I love this game very dearly as one of my friends have a passion of Dino and Dragons. At first it didn't really perk my interest.... I thought this game will be have bad graphics and not a lot to do. When i gotten the game on sell and play with my friends. It became SO MUCH FUN. Yes this game is made from 2015-2017 and a little buggy at time. But mostly you forget that when you play games with friends! PLUS this games gives you multiple different islands to choose. AND DRAGON TO TAME I MEAN WHAAAAAA..... ( Not to mention i die a lot by these dino lol). I recommend this game if you like to built and tame different kinds of dino and others. As well playing with friends or other people in serves! :)
29212,Very fun game. Watch youtube if you just started or your stuck stuck
29213,it sucks at sucking is what I would say if it didnt suck. it doesnt
29214,"I always see all these amazing screen shots, and people praising this.  Then I go try the game, and punch trees.  Then I die of hunger in a few minutes, which is kind of problematic, because it doesn't leave you time to do anything interesting.  Even veteran streamers run around like mad chickens trying beat the timers and still get anything done.  Game is rather uglier than the screenshots also.  I conclude this game's intended audience is sadists.  LOL.  I guess it takes all sorts.  The dinosaurs are cool, though."
29215,.
29216,"Dodos = good.
Everything else = bad."
29217,"I only play PvE and while one of the most frustrating games I've ever played (so easy to die or lose quality tames/loot), is also quite enjoyable if you're into the survival base-building thing. Tons of opportunity for customization and exploration, and of course, dinosaurs."
29218,is good
29219,Very good
29220,fuck this game. It is fun tho.
29221,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
29222,love it fav game of all time but also rage inducing
29223,Really fun game
29224,Very good adventure / survival game I didn't care much for the story mode they added to the game but i still enjoy the challenge of solo survival in the game. Not just to the beautiful landscape that the creators and modders have come up with over time but the different dino ideas as well . It's also a game I keep coming back too. So it is definitely worth some of the cost but at the same time a lot of it I wouldn't say is necessary to get but unfortunately is required to even play some dlc's or map content
29225,Great game to play solo or with friends who like adventure and a challenge
29226,"This has got to be hands down one of the best Survival Dinosaur games ever! I am completely obsessed and this is all I stream right now on twitch (@Mr_Kinkade) Between the Dinos and building there is so much to do before actually ""playing the game"" even after you have beaten the game (did you really though?) there is still so much to do with breeding dinos and building and fishing and building underwater!!!! This is a must have for any builders and survivalist out there!"
29227,i laik dinosawww
29228,I loved the graphics and the first time i played this with my friend the whole thing felt extremly magical.
29229,Good fun . I play with family on our server . it is so much fun .
29230,wadwa
29231,"It's a love, hate relashionship..."
29232,"This is hands down the best game to play with friends, i have had a blast with my mates so far and i cant wait to see what the game still has to offer. 

However i do recommend hosting a dedicated sever as it takes the barrier around your friends away. 

So YES BUY THE GAME ITS AMAZING"
29233,it was poggers
29234,"Absolutely love this game! I highly recommend it for people who enjoy slower-paced, self-directive games."
29235,Very fun game
29236,"tldr; I am not interested in PvP. My review is based on PvE on a private server with a few friends. It has become my all-time favorite game and I would recommend this to everyone.

So I tried Ark some time ago and though it looked great and was fun, I decided it was not for me. There is a lot of DLC and game settings. Default game settings in Single Player, at least for me, was too challenging. I'll get to these later. In the past month my friends hosted a private server and began playing with them and Ark has become my favorite game of all-time now. 

So, why did my opinion on Ark change? Well for starters, there is no hand holding in Ark. Just starting the Single Player instance was confusing in terms of which settings to use, which map, which ""game"", etc. When I hopped on my friends private server, it was like a totally different game. Since none of us really have a lot of time to dedicate to games (this is a lie because I put in 275 hours and could not stop playing - be careful!), different rates were modified. On both a private server or your Single Player instance you can modify things such as max dino level, experience gained, amount of resources harvested, how fast you can tame and breed dinos, etc. You can modify these multipliers to fall in-line with the experience you're looking in terms of a challenge and time constraints.

[Here is what I think Ark does really well:]
- Graphics -
While not the best, I found the graphics to be nice. The lighting is superb and when the sun is rising you get some really beautiful scenes.
- Challenge -
One of the best games ever in this regard. You can literally make this game as easy or as difficult as you would like. There is an endless amount of configuration combinations to try. This may be confusing and burdensome to the new player though so make sure you research settings before starting.
- Base building -
It is not the most robust base building you will find. Not even close. But, it is very fun and rewarding. I spent most of my 275 hours gathering resources to build my winter base and then a castle up on the mountain. It never got old for me and enjoyed everything including the little quirks Ark provides.
- Size (maps are quite large) -
There are a few different maps to choose from. I have spent 99% of my time on the map Ragnarok. This map is absolutely enormous. Without a flyer you will need to be planning your adventures. Even with a very fast Wyvern it took me ~8 minutes to fly from one side to the other. 
- Biomes -
Some dinos persist throughout the map but most do not. You find dinos where you would expect them; dire bears in the cold, turtles near beaches, and sheep on the highlands.
- Player progression -
Ark allows you to invest points into things such as health, speed, carry weight, etc. as you level up. There is also an ""Engram"" tree. Essentially, it is just things you can unlock to build as you level up. Be forewarned that on default settings you are limited in the amount of Engrams you can unlock.
- Providing a ""living"" world -
There is a spot on Ragnarok where there are a bunch of penguins. I returned some days later to tame them and they were all gone. You will find predators leaving their spawn points to chase other dinos. As new dinos spawn in after death or ones leaving, some areas change a bit. I once found a beautiful Tek Quetzal in Murder Snow that I wanted to tame but it ended up flying off while during my attempt and I did not find it again for about a week and it was somewhere very far away.
- Taming dinos! -
The bread and butter of Ark. While the process is somewhat silly and dependent on your game settings, it is incredibly fun. I quickly progressed on our server and was able to find max level bears to tame and breed. Over a couple weeks I had very strong bears that could take on almost anything with ease. Such a fun and rewarding experience.

[Here are some things I think Ark should improve:]
- Dino AI/behavior
The dinos are stupid. Both wild and your own dinos will constantly get stuck on things. They will get stuck inside of each other. They will sometimes do things they should not like attacking something while set to ""passive"". Though it can be frustrating at times it definitely does not ruin the game and maybe even adds a bit to the game since you're constantly redirecting your dino armies.
- Flight danger -
This is probably the biggest downfall in Ark, to me. On our private server, once I got an Argent, the game was simply too easy. This happened in the first 4-6 hours of playing too. You will never encounter danger when flying and makes 90% of all dinos irrelevant. The only time I ever died in 275 hours was when a lightning Wyvern surprised me while getting milk and killed my Argent. To anyone reading this, I would highly recommend to disable flying or make a personal rule you don't use flying mounts. It completely ruins the game.
- Sounds -
The game is pretty boring in terms of sounds. Mostly annoying dino sounds while they eat or poop. You will never feel immersed in this aspect.

Lastly, we decided to start on a new map with no modifiers at all, and no flying. We spent and entire night and accomplished nothing due to the sheer volume of predators killing us. I personally had the best time ever on a game but some might not like the challenge. Just think about the modifiers before starting your adventure and adjust as needed :)
"
29237,"Good
"
29238,"Tamed too many dinos, too many raids and been raided. Shit game, but fun times so good game as well but also shit xD"
29239,"Insanely good game that is made 100x better with friends. Troll other players by destroying their builds or killing their hard earned tames. A game built on the pure satisfaction of not dying for the millionth time to a Dillo as you sit stark naked on the beaches, or finally taking down that Rex and forever using it as your meat gathering slave. If you're that dino-kid that never truly grew up, just download it already."
29240,"its really fun survival game but u have to know what ur doing at first but when u get dinosaurs there really cool
"
29241,It fun and building is great.
29242,Be aware. You might have trouble doing daily adult stuff after you start playing this game. Like sleeping such.... be warned.
29243,Low graphics but if you know how to play it and you have friends its really fun!
29244,"Be prepared to die, a lot, if you've never played before. There's a steep learning curve, but it doesn't last long. UI may seem clunky at first, but it gets easier to navigate the more you use it. Lag is prevalent on all PvP and PvE servers, so something you'll just have to accept and deal with. That's all before even getting to the tribal warfare, server's that never, and I mean NEVER, wipe, constantly inconvenient dino spawns, offline raiding, and just general internet people BS. 
However:
If you stick with it, the game does a great job of following the dopamine reward track in our brains. Each encounter with a new challenge, each death, each level, and so on, all feel like you've actually accomplished something. There's a little there for everyone, from single player to online, cheating on un-official servers, to quick leveling and base building, oh and lets not forget: YOU CAN RIDE A F***N DINOSAUR. Just make sure that you're prepared for some other a-hole to come around when you're offline and kill it just because they can. 

Seriously though, if you're looking for something to sink some time into and actually enjoy the fruits of your labor, it's a good game. Not for the impatient, weak-willed, or gullible. The people who play this game and the gameplay itself make it clear that your mistakes should be learned from. 
But I mean come on, who doesn't love watching hundreds of hours of work as a solo player go up in smoke just because some home-schooled 11 year old caught you off guard on a laggy server? 

Play at your own risk, but enjoyable overall if you like a challenge."

29310,"I think the first couple hours suck. No chance at all.
Then slowly but surely the victories begin, discoveries are made 
and beast are tamed. After you get a base or at least a spawn point (bed) down
things turn around and the adventure begins. Building and taming are my 
biggest pleasures, but exploring and trying to acquire Artifacts are also cool.

29322,AWESOME!
29323,funny game so +rep
29324,"Fricking dinos, I love them"
29325,"After playing for 320 hours i realized that in fact this game has faulty logic. An example you may ask? Yesterday I was riding my favorite dinosaur named Edward (lvl 300) he was a dodo and was abnormally sized for his kind. I would say at least 20 meters tall. I attacked another dodo which was much lower level in fact but this same dodo managed to murder Edward. I am so mad that my little Edward was massacred by a dumb chicken who was only level 500. Another example is when I was playing on my favorite map Crystal Isles when my little boy griffin named Gardudd and I were flying through the sky just then, a nuke hit me out of the air and I fell to the ground. This caused me much pain but I lived but sadly for Gardudd he died... Just as I landed on floor and broke my bones, my character shit furiously (like 5 times) which is so disrespectful considering that Gardudd's favorite food was shit. So overall, I would say that this game can improve overall 10/10"

29356,This game i would recommend to other people because you can play with friends make friends and play solo. This game has a great story line and the bosses are fun to beat. I also like the mods and how well they work with this game. The only bad part of the game is updates. It might not be for everyone but when i have updates it takes for ever to update.

29371,Fun game to play PVe and a lot of cool players in PVE.  the dinos are really pretty looking and a lot of fun  and some are really challenging as well  which makes it a lot more fun. Now this game is no were near perfect and be leave me it has a but load of issues but if you can work passed that and take it for what it is you will have a good time. not a PVP fan so it has always been very hard for me and this game makes it that much more worse i hate pvp in Ark and a lot of toxic players i recommend staying away from pvp but if not what ever floats your boat and give it a try

29380,Great time vacuum. I like to play offline to make my own mega base. I don't have time to keep up with the constant battles that occur on a normal server.
29381,Not exactly fond of dinos i bought this game when it was on discount. Some time passed when i finally installed it. Thou it has end bosses and all i find it more sandbox game like most of the games that call them self sandbox. I loved every 600+ hours i played so far. When lovered prize this game with the rest of DLC maps is one of top 3 options to buy if u want live open world with 10k+ hours of content.

29386,How this game has very positive reviews is way beyond me. I bought this back in 2020 Tried it then. Horrible game. Tried again in 2022. It got worse. How do you have 9 DLCS and haven't fixed anything. Game runs like shit. If you try and play on any server with other people every area of land is building blocked by ladders or someone has walled off half the place. That's if you even see it as this game is so buggy half the time you cant. I feel as if my computer has developed cancer from having to open this horrid game. I believe this is the worst game ever created. Studio Wildcard Please kindly consider switching fields of work as this game is an embarrassment. I hid it in my library to make sure to never even think about giving it another try. -420 out of 10.

29403,I love this game so much. It allows you to tame and ride dinosaurs and do so many other cool things. It is so advanced that you can even tame Dodos and breed them to get eggs which can hatch (all creatures can breed/lay eggs I think but the Dodos are a good mention) or you can use the eggs for different things. That is just a taste of how advanced this game is. If you want to try it; get it. It is so worth it.

29425,"At 263 hours, I can say that the price is justified by the number of hours I've played. I will likely play this again in the future if any of my friends get the urge. Even writing this review made me itch to start it up. 

[b]Who will like this game... based on my own personal play-style...[/b]
► You enjoy survival games and building an aesthetically-pleasing base. In that order.
► You like Conan. Similar crafting. Similar base-building. Very similar set of bugs and issues. Servers operate roughly the same.  
► You have a few friends to play with. Two or three is enough. It gets exponentially easier the more people you play with.
► You wanted to play a game with dinosaurs, [strike]but The Isle disappointed you[/strike].


[b]Why did I stop playing?[/b]
☼ Breeding dinosaurs became a huge chore. The game encouraged giant bases (incredibly lag-inducing) of pure breeding grounds to get the strongest dinosaur or a certain color dinosaur. The timing of everything made it necessary to play daily at the bare minimum to min/max what creatures you wanted. You needed to log on at specific hours of the day to feed the dinosaurs, claim the hatched babies, and feed the babies before they starve. 

Basically, it became a dinosaur-breeding game only, which was still fun for lots of hours until we all stopped caring because there's only so long we can worry about running a whorehouse for dinosaurs as adults with jobs. 


[b]Suggestions for similarly-minded players...[/b]
Play this on a private server either with only your friends or specifically search out a private server community with good admins and reasonable rules."

29427,It's alright.

29437,"Fun game if you like to be tortured. This game will make you question all choices you made in life and absolutely make you want to chuck your PC out the window. The dinosaurs are very strong and have no issue killing you. This game will peg you harder than a sadist dominatrix using a barbed spiked dildo. After spending your first 15 hours on this game because you cannot stop playing, you'll be left with a gaping crater where your poop chute used to be. Absolutely fucking hate this game, but like an abusive boyfriend, I just keep coming back because I love it so much. 10/10, would recommend."
29438,"""ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" was my first words when i loaded in"
29439,"You experience official servers to basically learn how to play.  It's on the unofficial servers with mods that really makes the game what it is.  Now don't get me wrong, official servers are a blast too.  That is provided you don't get some jerkoff ""alpha tribe"" that basically does nothing but beat you down.  Been there, done that.  The unofficial servers though.   That's where the game truly shines."

You will either: hate this game and trash it online even though you still play or you will become addicted, sinking hour upon hour on taming dodos and trolling noobs and destroying your relationships with everyone you know!

29472,A go to of mine.
29473,"After 1,120 hours on this ""game"" i have decided to make a review... i'm gonna start on how terribly optimised it is cause its pretty bad as you'll need a pretty decent PC to run graphics that don't look like severe diarrhoea, however this game is also amazing in so many different ways, beautiful maps, challenging caves, plenty of things do to, with a complicated and long but very interesting story. If you like Dinosaurs and a CHALLENGING survival game then Ark is for you."

29476,dinosaurs is all I'm gonna say
29477,"Great game and extremely easy to get lost in playing for hours. 

However! The base rates and difficulty of the game can feel like a dark souls degree of difficulty, even if set for single player mode in a private server. Definitely pump up your taming, weight and other levels so you arent babysitting an unconscious dino for 30 minutes to a couple of hours just to try and tame one thing"
29478,A
29479,"good
"
29480,is good
29481,Game is ass
29482,If you love survival games this is it then; this is what I think of and what all other games seem to be trying to compare themselves to in this genre. Theres nothing like waking up buck naked on a strange island and building up a base and skills to take on the wild environment all around you. Plenty of replay value and new maps to keep veterans on their toes. this is by far the standard for survival games now.
29483,"For those who don't have the money to buy this, I recommend asking for a friends card or for those under aged like me, I recommend asking for you're mom or dad to gift you the game. Or you can just gifted the game by you're friends, if they are kind enough, and if you know how to ask nicely. Lol. Anyway. Its a 8.5 score for me, I may only have 13 hours at the time of me writing this, but I do recommend it. It is fun, it has a lot of extra stuff you can add. But you do need a lot of space on you're computer for it. That's really one of the only BIG down sides for it. I recommend the 30 dollar, not only because it is cheaper but most people do not have enough space for this game. Even then this game is still decently sized."
29484,"You should not play Ark: Survival Evolved. It's fun for a while, but the truth is this: The game has more holes than good graces, and the developers, Studio Wildcard, are permanently leaving several mechanics and technical issues broken. They have never endeavored to fix long-standing issues in single player, preferring only to bug fix whatever exploits people found in multiplayer. The thing is, although this game might give you a couple hundred hours of fun, Studio Wildcard does not deserve more money for the frankly poor job they've done of crafting a meaningful experience out of what should have been a rock-solid no-fail intellectual property. They are honestly just really bad developers, and if you judge this game on the merits of its single player experience alone, it is a 3/10. Don't let my hours played fool you, I have 500 hours on ps4 as well. All of it on single player, because my internet is not capable of playing online. But even if you did play online, it's a highly toxic environment rife with exploitation and people glitching themselves into the ground so they can kill you from a position of invincibility."
29485,1
29486,what the fuck is happening
29487,"very gud, it is."
29488,This game has entertained me for many hours.  I have played pvp and pve and enjoyed both.  I  like playing with a lot of mods and building options to build nice bases.  Love taming all the dinos and raising them to battle the  bosses and go  caving.
29489,good
29490,"yeah boi
"
29491,much less fun on pc than ps4 (common issue for me) proably just because that was my first time experiencing it but if you havent played it and you want it go for it

29497,IT ISS SO FUN
29498,Can be fun just a bit too grindy and unfair to solo players (gen one and two missions and general pvp)
29499,when will the devs add an option for us to breed with other players?

29507,Awesome game!
29508,good game
29509,devs have given up on this game if you dont have an aim botter or friends that hack its not worth the play time just to grind and get meshed
29510,ive always liked ark on xbox and i have had my PC for almost 6 months and i just now downloaded ark for some reason i forgot about all the mods that you can do on ark on the pc i havent played anything since i downloaded it lmao

29523,"as much as i love this game and i mean love it i could never recommend it to someone as it is with out a doubt one of the most buggy,grindy,time-consuming mess of a game i have ever played and to be honest i can forgive all that. but what i cant forgive is how it is brought to its knees is the mega tribes that disregard tribe size and jut make new ones to ally with that expand across countless servers and spoil the fun of the game for anyone else. if that could somehow be fixed then yes i would recommend this game."
29524,w game tbh
29525,great game but draained my labtops battery quickly.

29533,It is a fun game if you have the time and effort to survive in the vast world of ark and the money to buy the maps but i think it is a good investment
29534,dynasowr
29535,Just generally fun and the mods are amazing
29536,"died more times than when i played sekiro but then i stopped dying, became more gamery and the game was pretty fun. grinding to beat bosses and sweating breeding became like second nature. only recommend for people who are built different"

29549,Another game not as many hours as terraia but its still a good game
29550,Very fun game has lots of places to explore and cool creatures to discover. But it does sometimes get boring alone so playing with friends makes the game funner. Ark also has many cool mods in steam workshop I recommend trying out.
29551,Very fun to play. Large variety of maps and creatures to choose from. My one issue is the loading time. It takes a really long time to load in my world.

29560,Good game but Wild Animal Racing (W.A.R) is better
29561,"offffffffffffff
"
29562,"It's a fun sandbox survival kind of game. Building is a bit tedious and not as fleshed out as I would like, but overall a good game."
29563,"the game is fun... when it works. i love the idea of this game, i really do but the bugs, glitches and just annoyances in it are to big to ignore. the building is just the worst with snaps that are so awkward that you spend 5 minutes just trying to get it to snap and the variety on what u can build is limited to squares, triangles and the occasional circle. im sure a more avid gamer could make something incredible but if ur just casual its not grate.

i love the creatures. in not gonna say ""oww there factually inaccurate"" coz TBH who cares but the spawn rates can be funny, especially when u get 5 dippys on top of each other and sometime ur creatures will just  glitch out and disappear. i first played this game in early access and honestly it feels like it should still be there but their already working on a squeal

this is just my opinion but honestly it not a game id recommendin its current state"
29564,fun game I have 82hours and not bored
29565,"This game is addictive, fun, challenging, and overall great!"
29566,"I absolutely recommend this game as it teaches you the basics of survival by throwing you in the deep end on any of the maps, It's fun to play overall and I really enjoy it."

29568,Play with your friends thats it don't bother playing on PVP servers.

29586,"great game. Played since it went early access in 2015. Pvp is not really my cup of tea because of the crazy commitment it takes. But as a single player I've had hundreds and hundreds of hours of fun in this game. All of the moments including taming the first super powerful creature, the first major loss of a dino, surviving the harsh biomes in whatever map you are playing on. Its a staple game in the open world survival genre. There are most definitely negatives to this game like the un-optimized graphics, and some seriously annoying bugs & glitches, but overall this game is excellent. 9/10 would recommend"
29587,good game
29588,"A great game, great graphics. Easily spend hours without even noticing. Vanilla ark is pretty boring and hard but common mods like S+, Stacking items mods, and quality of life mods make the game bearable.  After defeating bosses for story line there's not much to do besides join a pvp server but i have not done that bc i am a baby so i've only played pve.  Would recommend this game as it's a great game regardless for any RP/Dinosaur lovers/open world game lovers."
29589,good
29590,Very Good Very Nice
29591,"Ark is super fun game where you control the loot, xp, dino levels, etc. Online servers can fill like Rust but with Dinos. There is nothing scarier than having to run for your life. The beginning of the game is challenging but as you progress it becomes easier and fun. 8 out of 10"

29616,ERK
29617,One of the best games I've ever played. The idea of it is fun the creatures are accurate to real life and I'll never forget the feeling of riding dinosaurs. There are 2 problems I personally have with the game. It takes up way to much space especially if you bring in DLC's. #2 there are a lot of glitches and bugs. but i can give the game a break because of how old  it is and it is still very popular.
29618,Actually really fun just really hard in lots of ways
29619,Okay.

29645,Well  i played this during free weekend so but i liked it
29646,very good get it NOW
29647,hella fun w good friends or private server but community generally toxic af
29648,if you like games that you can do what ever you want then this is the game if you because it has dinosaurs that you can tame and kill you can make guns and make a base
29649,I really love Ark! It is a great game that keeps you alert on your toes and provides a fun building and exploring experience
29650,"game has a lot of mod bugs but otherwise its a really good game
it just gets annoying having to uninstall countless mods and reinstall them because the game glitched out"
29651,Very good
29652,i've played this game on console for around 300+ hours and after moving to pc recently i honestly think this is still holding strong. I mean tek did ruin the game but it is still so much fun to just hop on and join a random server with some friends.
29653,"nice

29658,I've yet to try PVP but the PVE experience has been amazing. So much to explore and we've only played on The Island so far!
29659,good
29660,dino go brrr
29661,Lost Island has legit Broken this Game Devs i beg you fix it
29662,"ARK can be a great survival game with cool dinosaurs and good ways to build.  It is great with friends and I highly recommend playing on some sort of private server because everything takes too long on public servers.  It provides plenty to do for a very long time, however, it is broken in many ways which will likely never be fixed because they have been there for a long time and the company is more worried about releasing a second game and show now.  Things clip through things all the time, commands sometimes do not work, and things occasionally just disappear for no reason.  In the end though, this is a great game to play with many people."

29682,I really like ark survival evolved cus it feels like the game never ends now that can also be a bad thing but in this case its a good thing and i just got the game for pc but i have been playing ark for like three years on ps4. One more thing i like about the game is the veriety of settings you can basically change anything you want to change and playing multiplayer is like the most fun and intresting thing i have ever done.

29706,better then rust. More pvp metas and you need to understand dino abilities and how they work which turns out to be fun pvp as every dinosaur serves a unique purpose.

"
29777,"i've played this game on and off for years. its a good game. always fun to jump into, smack some dino butts, build a sh*t shack then log off. i first played this on an intel pentium dual core with 8GB ram and a gtx 1050. it ran.. somewhere between 20-30fps. i've had many upgrades over the years and am currently at an i7 9700kf 64GB ram @3600mhz and an rtx 3060 and it still runs like sh*t (40-50fps) at high settings with the added bonus of looking like garbage if you turn the settings down. if they optimised it to run 144fps @ 1080p (like i can with a lot of newer games) on equal hardware then maybe it'd deserve its thumbs up. but given its age and the fact it still runs poorly it gets a thumbs down."
29778,This game is really fun and addicting. I personally enjoy single player PVE more than PVP but I have heard the PVP is challenging and fun as well. Breeding OP stats and crazy colours into my dinos is my favourite! Lots of stuff to do even without spending money on any of the DLC maps. Definitively better and more fun to play with friends though.

29792,"ive, not quite wasted, but used an enormously stupid amount of hours into this game (750)"
29793,It's alright.
29794,"I have been playing Ark since 2018 and the game certainly has evolved for the better during that time. I run my own dedicated server and I believe with a little tweaking this is the game MMO's will evolve to eventually. I'm extremely excited to see what ARK2 brings. Having dipped my toes into what passes for a ""Great Game"" in ""Lost Ark"" recently I found myself rather disheartened with the state of affairs in the MMO genre and games in general. I cannot recommend this enough to players who once spent countless hours in a game. If you do this at your own pace with a small group of players it's an extremely rewarding game. You must be willing to explore and set your own goals. There's really no right or wrong way to play it. If you want spoon fed content, there's tons of that. It's bland and all copy of a copy of a copy at this point. Thank god for games like Ark: Survival Evolved."
29795,Best game la brooo
29796,balls
29797,pretty decent
29798,Best game of all time hands down!
29799,"Ark is really fun, but you have to take it seriously. It is a very unique community of gamers. Be prepared to get frustrated, but as the game advances it all pays off."
