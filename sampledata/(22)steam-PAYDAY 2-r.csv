0,"Pros:
fun gameplay
good to play with friends
not too repetitive 
Cons:
lags my bad internet a bit
takes a bit of space, not much compared to alot of other games"
1,This gamę teached me how to rób na actual bank so i can finally afford all dlc's
2,"Very good game and mechanics, love it."
3,play game. wont regret.
4,Very time consuming and fun.
5,just do gta online heists
6,"I got this game on the Xbox One and it is really fun. I think that it is very unique because whenever you start a heist there is a chance that there is some moron who makes the mission way harder, for example, I was doing a heist on the Brooklyn bank and at the start, this idiot drives the van into the Bank so we had to survive an assault from cops while trying to open the vault door then we had to carry HEAVY stacks of gold bars to the sewers. The game is also very good because it has a cool customization system where you can customize your masks and weapons. I also like the game because you can choose if you want to play with A.I or by yourself or online with people such as your friends. I like the graphics, for a 2013 game it has some smooth graphics, I thought it was made in 2018 because of how good the graphics were. The Money system, I think the money system is very good because of the amount of money you get a mission. It is usually around 150K if you are a starter. I have to do other things so ill just finish this off with I LOVE THIS GAME PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE"
7,Dead game
8,5/5
9,Me and my buddy play this game all the time. Dont play with randoms they are stupid 10/10
10,like playing the movie Heat
11,Put hair on my balls
12,want to rob a bank one day and topple the US Government the next? play this game.
13,The onlything that will make this better is a SCP site heist.
14,E
15,nice
16,Game is actually free to play. Fun with dlcs but friendly to those who can't buy the packs. Actual W game would recommend.
17,robbery
18,I pay
19,fucking awesome and i havent even bought a dlc (NOTE this review was by a kid so it is certified true now play this game)
20,I love doin meth misson
21,"Good game, decent number of heists, but the inventory options are extremely limited, especially if you don't have the paid DLCs. Practically maxed out after ~20 hours, and the rest was just piling up money I'll never use."
22,it can be fun with multiple people but also is great with one other.
23,Meth
24,Yes
25,"I recommend this game

Its so perfect u can customise your loadout.
Lot of guns, best missions and its fun to play with your friends 😁👍"
26,HEAT
27,good i recommend.
28,"if you're looking for  game to share some quality meat, this is the game."
29,i fucking love this game
30,Deff Recc
31,"hi, i'm Yi Long Ma. Come come, money, give it to you
"
32,If you want to commit war crimes this is it
33,i hit people with big spoon
34,"Hello! I'm Robin... Robin Dabank heheheh
got it?
no...
not funny?
ok...
sorry"
35,Still very good until now
36,pay day
37,gun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
38,I personally love the game as it has a good blend of stealth and chaos(loud). the only criticism i have heard from this game is that the cops have an infinite amount of reserves but I'm cool. hey at the end of the day its my fault for going loud. lol
39,shit game dont recommend
40,👌
41,"This game is really good, its concept is unique and well made as well as it is loads of fun. It has a bit of an issue with minor bugs and glitches but nothing game-breaking. This is also coming from someone who has also never played with friends which is always better than alone. I 100% recommend"
42,this game is digital heroin
43,"Good, no other words needed."
44,w
45,"I got this from a friend, it sounded pretty fun. 20 hours later, I was playing overkill as a low level and sharting my pants constantly. Good game, lots of content for a low price, super fast paced on higher difficulties (hence the pants sharting), and so much more. Plus the game is actually updated, and it’s usually on sale. Also really good with friends, so you can shart your pants simultaneously when a multiple cloakers walk in mid-drill repair. 10/10"
46,One of the worst games I have ever played
47,Comically large spoon go bonk
48,good heisting game
49,pretty good
50,"Great game to play with friends it offers a different style of game then your typical shooter games. I will say it does get frustrating and repeating after you've completed all the heists but considering when this game came out it has aged well.

Like $90 Bourbon Its never as good as the $250 Bourbon"
51,Stealth Missions Are The Best
52,"yes
"
53,"Very fun single player that gets infinitely better with friends. Definitely recommend the dlc as the base game feels very minimal but this game goes on sale like every other week so just pick it up then. Very fun and highly recommend, especially if you have some pals to tag along."
54,body his ass
55,good
56,"""Guys The Thermal Drill Go Get It."" -Bain"
57,Great game I suggest trying it out with some friends
58,"""guys the thermal drill. go get it"" 🤓"
59,.
60,For me its fun until you hit infamy. Cloakers are a bitch tho and so are dozers.
61,"payday 2 in a nutshell:

preplan phase: mess around and scream at friends for not using 3 detection on shadow raid

lobby: crossbow.

skiils: inspire.

one down: *ptsd intensifies*

10/10, dallas doesn't need medic bag

im very happy (:"
62,I think I can rob a bank now

77,I have been playing this game for a few years and i can say it is a very fun game overall and there are lots of things to do in the game. The game gets updated regularly and overall PAYDAY 2 has a great community of players.
78,I had hundreds of hours on this on ps4 and I loved it. PC is way better.
79,"Ive played this game from launch and it is a very fun co-op game. the main issue that i have with it is the player base. There are two types of players that will prevent you from enjoying this game. 

1. the AFK lobby Host. Host sits in inventory or crimenet for a million years preventing a game to start. try to join other lobbies and you'll find the same. 

2. players who are infamy and wont play with anyone whose not. stopping a lot of progression because they assume you cant hold your own or help out. all i see is metagamers trying to get an easy heist and not have a challenge. but the challenge is kinda why you play the game in the first place. 

both player types will take up hours of your play time just trying to get a game going. so unless you want to host a game your kinda toyed around with."

86,"The game comes with FLAC versions of it's awesome soundtrack in the files. Even if you have literally no interest in the game  but like collecting music, this is worth it on sale. As for the game itself, it's really fun, although it can get repetitive."

☐ Practically/Literally Nonexistent Modding Community
☐ Developers Are Anti-Modding

COMMENT: PD2 gameplay can change depending on the build you are using. You can be a Dodge dual wielding Shotgun player running fast almost flying over the map, or just a full armor Juggernautt with an M249 that walks like a turtle, be the aim god or the rip-fire maniac. It's up to you decide what & how you want to play.

☐ Fast
☐ Enthusiast
☐ Supercomputer

---{ Difficulty }---
COMMENT: PD2 difficulty can be changed before you buy the contract, (Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish and Death Sentence) higher the difficult, higher the money you got. One Down is now optional, it's just an extra challenge. The game can have Major changes depending the difficult you're playing. On normal Loud/Stealth, the soldiers are really dumb, and can be easily killed, even with a pencil. On Death Sentence, they got more health, damage, for the enemies, cameras now got a ballistic protection, etc. Also the game use the major thing on heists, special units (Taser, Dozer, Cloaker, Shield, Medic and others) some can endure more damage, other can do more damage, heal, use special moves, etc.

COMMENT: PD2 ""grind"" is Infamous, you need to get to Level 100, have 200mil on offshore cash, and 1mil on spending cash, after this, you reset your cash and level to 0, and start over again, now with Infamous level I(1), more level you got, more prizes you win(all them are cosmetic). It's completly optional, you dont need this to play the game.
☐ No Grind Whatsoever
☐ Only For Leaderboard / Completionists

☐ No Story
☐ Basic Lore
☐ Decent
☐ Good
☑ Very Good
☐ Beyond Incredible

---{ Characters }---
COMMENT: The best part is the voice lines of the characters, they start talking sh*t when they kill enemies, heal players, and make a succesfull escape. All of them being unique with different accents according from where they come.
☐ Horrible
☐ Bad
☐ Ok
☐ Cool 
☑ Awesome
☐ Consider as a friend

---{ Game Time }---
COMMENT: All the heists combine, all the achievements, collectables, can make this game extend for a looong time. And has a multiplayer, that can expand this to another levels.
☐ Less Than 30 Minutes
☐ 30 Minutes - 2 Hours
☐ 2 Hours - 4 Hours
☐ 4 Hours - 10 Hours
☐ 10+ Hours
☑ 100+ Hours
☐ Practically Infinite

---{ Price }---
COMMENT: Well worth the price. If you have the money to spare, I suggest trying it out.
☐ It's Free!
☐ Very Worth Price
☑ Worth The Price
☐ Buy When On Sale
☐ Not Worth Any Price
☐ Do NOT Buy. You (and your wallet) WILL Regret It.

---{ Bug Severity }---
COMMENT: The bugs on PD2 are more a good thing than a bad thing, all of them are basicly ragdolls or the AI being dumb. But sometimes on Stealth, guards can see through the wall, and make you want to kill yourself.
☑ Bugs Enhance Gameplay
☐ No Significant Effect
☑ Minor Bugs
☐ Potentially Disruptive Bugs
☐ Seriously Disruptive Bugs
☐ Literally Unplayable

---{ Bug Frequency }---
COMMENT: If you use explosive weapons, you may encounter more of this bugs.
☐ Practically None
☑ Few
☐ Decent
☐ Many
☐ Unacceptable Amount
☐ Literally Unplayable

---{ ? / 10 }---
COMMENT: PAYDAY 2, is a old but gold game, OVERKILL still update this game since 2013, the updates are weaker now, due the PAYDAY 3 development. The gameplay is awesome, the fun factor is great specially with friends. A large amount of weapons and heists (sadly, most of them being from DLC), is a good choice if you like Frenetic FPS games.

I am a 406 yo multi-sexual hermaphrodite helicopter, probably one of the youngest people playing this game. I am a single mother to my uncle, who is 25 now. My father got this game for Swalloween in 2012 from his wife's boyfriend, so we installed it on his windows 6000000 and started DYING in this game. By the end of the day, he had 3000 HOURS on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my big, fat, greasy balls, as they are always out in the street. So I decided to make a Steam account and start playing the game. I loaded into the game, came super fast, and started playing but I was stuck on my huge penis. I asked myself and then they hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my nuts ever since Ronald Raegon had died of alzhimers. This game has ever since brought me and my closer again and now we actually spend time together, and outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's ghfhafh in everything, and it has brought both me. Happy and memories."

189,"One of the games that rightfully earns it's place in the shelf of ""10 year old games that are still relevant"".

PAYDAY 2 is one of the best multiplayer games, ever. The cooperation required is on its own level of difficulty, every mission requires a different mindset, a different team. And PAYDAY fills this gameplay loop absolutely perfectly.

Stealth in PAYDAY 2 is one of my favorite stealth loops of any game ever. Singleplayer stealth is incredibly difficult and long, almost enough to warrant it being called its own gamemode. While multiplayer stealth is this masterfully weaved art, where every pager used increases the intensity of the mission ten fold. Every player in a stealth mission has to be on their A game at all times, because you only get so much room to breathe.

PAYDAY's gunplay is also one of the most enjoyable parts of this game. Crafting absolute monsters of guns with modifications that make it look like something akin to Frankenstein's monster. The guns play off of every mechanic in an almost harmonic fashion. I never once felt like I was dying because of a fault in my weapon, I felt like I was dying because it was [i] my [/i] fault. Doing loud missions with a team of completely different playstyles is one of the most fun times you can have.

Although PAYDAY can be a buggy mess at times, maybe even downright unfair. It is still one of the best multiplayer cooperative games I've played. After 9 years this game still holds up immensely well, and it shows in its gameplay how much refining it took to get to this point. PAYDAY 2 will always hold a place in my heart and mind as a great game with extreme quality, backed by an incredible developer team. I hope to emulate it's refined gameplay in my future projects, as well as take notes and lessons from it's developer team about the proper way to develop a game about guns."

193,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

195,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

245,"I've been playing PAYDAY 2 since the good old Xbox 360, where buying skills costed money, the hardest difficulty was overkill, suppressors were only obtainable through RNG and it was pretty much impossible to reach level 100 through legitimate means before infamy 1.0. Payday is a game about heisting, but way more than just robbing banks: infiltrating into a museum to steal a rare diamond, robbing a casino, commiting election fraud, stealing from the FBI, breaking people out of prison and even cooking meth!
 
The game has changed a lot since its initial release, becoming more of an arcade game than the previous franchise game. However, both PAYDAY 2 versions shine in different ways. It is definitly worth playing. And if you would like to go back to the old days, there are certainly mods for that.

Pros:
- Plenty of missions
- Replayability: this game has RNG elements that make playing the same mission different everytime.
- Huge variety of characters, weapons, masks, gun attachments and skins
- Two different general strategies to play: stealth and loud
- Skills and perk decks allow playing in many different ways, suiting one's playstyle
- Lots of achievements and in-game trophies
- Contains secrets, easter eggs and even memes
- Great soundtrack
- Even better with friends, but you can play the game by yourself and bots
- Allows playing heists that you don't own
- Allows modding and ways to avoid playing with those who use mods

Cons:
- Outdated graphics
- No straightforward campaign (but honestly, it doesn't really matter)
- Unlocking some items require earning achievements
- Many heists are paid DLCs (you have to buy the respective DLC to be able to host the heist, buy the Legendary Collection for most of the content)
- Sometimes you are kicked right after joining a heist for seemingly no reason, but most of the time it happens due to the host restricting use of cheats and/or mods.
- Even though the bots are OP, their A.I. is incredibly dumb. You can clearly notice the difference on higher difficulties. It's manageable, however.

PAYDAY 2 is a great game, one of my all time favorites, so give it a try."

Utilize 100+ guns with 10,000+ different combinations, play the 70+ heists the game has to offer, each with their own different rng elements, meaning no two heists are the same.

354,"I remember buying payday 2 when it came out when I was in high school, and I was utterly intrigued by the way the game captured a heist or a smash and grab and the suspense and atmosphere that comes with it. SInce then i've spent countless hours in the game and I can confidently say please do not buy this game or support these greedy (dlcs). It is buggy as fuck and leads to irritating and unneccasary interruptions in an otherwise pleasant and exciting heist/stealth game. The gun play, the objectives sometimes, it just makes me laugh as if they truly don't care about their consumers or their quality of game play. I am tired of these games that clearly recycle game play loops and repackage it as dlc or game play by paying a celebrity or a license for a movie or franchise; it's initially exciting but wears off quick once you realize how dull and lifeless this game is time after time level after level, day after day, bag after bag, crouch sprint jump crouch after crouch sprint jump crouch.

394,I NEED A MEDIC BAG!
395,"This is the best game to have ever been created. I remember bothering my best friend to buy the first payday when we were kids because he had a shitty dell laptop and it could barely run anything but I bothered him for months straight. That story has nothing to do with this game but he never bought it but playing this game reminds me of those times. The wifi is trash where I'm at and it took 3 days to download but it was worth is because I now neglect all my other games like an alcoholic father to his kids. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I spend every second of free time I have on this game. Do I need help? Maybe, but if I were to die with this game being the last thing I did I would fall into hell happy. The point is that this is a great game and I love it."
396,"If you like sinking dozens of hours into trying to reach level 100, only to realize you need to pay $200 million to go Infamous, then you would love this game."

Fuck you for making me play this game.

The cops behave like they're playing goldeneye 007 on the original nintendo 64 thats been romhacked to allow dodgerolls
The stealth feels like the fucking madd dog mission from gta san andreas
The graphics are outshined by games made on roblox
The controls feel like they put the darksouls people in charge of making them.

overall, 9/10. I nominate this for game of the year.

Lot of arcady feelings when you ingame and everything is a grind to get new attachments and such. It was also hard for me to find people on MP to play decently and stay alive to make it to end of mission.

Once you are ready to start the mission within like 2 seconds you start getting swarmed with the cops and they get crazyily stupid, from reg pistol to shocktroopers throwing taser balls and such at you. I personally didn't care for the game and stopped playing"
421,i like money
422,"payday 2 is a well-made game with good gun mechanics, decent amount of story and lore and a ton of customization for your character. it is useful to grind steam trading cards too. recommend buying legacy collection since it has much more stuff that you unlock and missions too."

468,"bets game,i advise  buy it"
469,"Its a fun game, but the game is extremely poor when it comes to singleplayer - They give you two NPC characters who are next-to useless and have no proper AI and the missions require multiple people to do properly. So you'll spend half an hour doing a mission and if you get downed, your teammates are no where to be seen and you have to do the mission from the very beginning and you get nothing at all from it.

There are missions where you have to protect multiple points at the same time otherwise the enemies stop progress, but you can't be in two places at once and the AI people always blindly flow you and get in the way so missions that should take 20-30minutes instead take up to an hour to do.

The Teammate AI is so bad that that it makes me want to stop playing the game but I enjoy using the guns in it so am forced to play levels that aren't so heavily team focus.

There are also parts where you have to drive vehicles through a very convenient pathway, but the AI teammates don't board the vehicle to help shoot, so you have to drive without them, but, there are enemies dotted all over the course shooting you and then you get downed and your teammates are all the way over the other side of the map and ignore you when you call them for help, resulting in a failed mission attempt. Its happened at least 3 times now and when you get really far on a tougher difficulty its just BS that you can never get past that point because of the same stupid reason.

The added kick in the teeth is that you start getting an penalty on the EXP you earn if you keep replaying  missions, so it basically penalises you for playing solo and having to put up with their Bulls**t AI system. 

NPC's aside, the game is cool for leveling up and upgrading your characters, the skills can be really beneficial but also remain subtle and the ""Freeform"" class style is good - It lets you build your character to your playstyle.

An annoying part to the game is the random loot drop thing. you basically pick a card at the end of the mission and it gives you a random item (Weapon mod, mask, colour for the mask, pattern for the mask, etc) but it's all random chance and if you want to upgrade your guns you have to pray that you get the piece you need. they let you pay in game money to help hedge your bets towards a particular item (Weapon mod, mask, ect) but as what item specifically you get is all chance. and It frustrates me that you play the game for hours and not get the thing you want, which forces you to either use something else, or again, suffer for it because there is no work around."

503,"Played this game back during the times of the beta. Had it pre-ordered and tried to follow the game through its many updates. So, I can safely say, that without a shadow of a doubt;

I can only recommend someone this game IF they were willing to put more money on the table and just buy the Legacy Collection. Any other DLCs afterwards I can't recommend since I never bought them. I think that overall, the game is fine. The gameplay loop is what's gonna keep you coming back, along with the unlockables. I'm glad that a third game is going to be released, and this game is great to play with your buds or by yourself! However, I will say this. If you just want to do some heisting, play with your pals, and don't care about unlocks?

Just go buy PAYDAY: The Heist. Its cheaper, and with only one thing of DLC."

when I play this game, im not quite sure if I am having ""fun"" like I do in other games. Payday 2 is exciting, well paced, and addictive. every single sound and sight have been expertly designed to draw you in further. just before writing this, i had thought to myself ""I know I just closed the game, but I can just play another few missions, not too long"" purchase at your own risk"

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

It has a good amount of grind. It's up to 4 players, but you can play solo, or with random ppl. Although many heists are repetitive, you will always find something new. For the price of $2-6 it's a must buy. 8/10"

738,"I love this game. 

I loved this game when it first came out, and I have continued to love this game all the way into 2022. Payday 2 when you break it down is an FPS heist game where you fend off waves of cops (Loosely Horde shooter?) until you complete your objective and then ride away in an escape vehicle knowing you just pulled off a heist. The game does play a little clunky at times but I believe that is due to its age since it came out in 2013. I thoroughly enjoy the game while playing Single Player with the bots, but Co-op with friends is where the game REALLY thrives. I think for what you are getting with this game even $9.99 is a steal because there is loads of content and even though the developers have released an unworldly amount of DLC you don't have to buy it to have a good time. Supposedly they did that to continue development on Payday 3 and if that is the case I am all for it (I CAN't WAIT :) However if $9.99 still sounds a little steep then steal this game when they have a sale because then it is only $0.99 - $2.99 and genuinely that is too good of a deal to pass up for what you are getting (I mean I have played for 91 hours on here and have NO IDEA how much I played on 360 for). 

I write this review because I have seen a lot of negative reviews about this game recently and I honestly just can't wrap my head around them. If I can give you one piece of advice that a random Game-stop employee gave me it is, ""Buy and play the game yourself to see if YOU like it, because reviews can be helpful in determining how well the game is received among others but you won't know if YOU will like it until YOU try it, you might end up missing out on a game that you would have loved because of that."""

765,""" I was once a beautiful women, maybe not by todays standards, but in my day I was a hit. I was showered with praise and subtle glances from the average man, but one day I met eyes with a man like no other, it was as if our souls pressed together, and our pheromones congealed. His hair was tastefully wound up in a pony tail, his musk was penetrating, overwhelming....sexual. I kept asking myself what this was I was feeling and not until years later did I realize, it was love. All lady like aspects I had forged for myself were swept away by his presence, I desired him, and he desired me. Connections like this aren't easy to escape, neither of us could just walk away, this was happening, it mattered not that we were in a Macy's, this primal thirst between two people had to be quenched. So inside that fated Macy's handicapped bathroom, we made sweet, sweet love to each other. Later on I'd learn his name was Robert, and not much longer after that I'd learn that I was Pregnant. Nine months  later I popped my first little peanut out of my gross vagina, we named him Alex. Immediately we knew Alex was different, he had a dark aura to him,  he exuded evil and the doctor that ripped him out from inside my gross smelly gross vagina died not long after he was delivered. However, life with Alex was fine and two year after his birth we were ready for another. Our Second child ate so much in the womb I Gained about 437 pounds during the pregnancy. This was not only record breaking but extremely painful, I was tearing at the seam, this fat ass baby was tearing me apart. As a result I was forced to receive a c section five months early, leaving our child extremely premature, and extremely mentally/physically handicapped. We named this special needs baby Benjamin, and I have tried to kill him in his sleep many times but the boy will not die. I'd use my gross, crusty, blue and puss filled vagina one last time to birth a third child. Am I happy with  my life of love and family? No.""

The way the game lets u choose ur play style with multiple perk decks, skills, weapons to even characters, clothes and masks makes it so special. I like the way payday makes co op and supports its modders community and steam community. Great Game ! Super fun and always has everything new u can test and experiment in every heist. I love the game worth every penny i invested cuz its a game that makes grinding and ganning experience in harder difficulties enjoyable and even Fun.

oh the game was kinda cool too"
807,walter white and bain need to have a discussion
808,"this best game ever
"
809,yes
810,Its a great game period.
811,i like men
812,fun game with other people
813,"if youre willing to pay for the ABSURD amount of DLC, then this is a great game packed full of content. highly recommend
"
814,"Me at the beginning of my career i spend so much time on one robbery crawling on ass, but after 20 hours I gained experience and I can say that this game requires all your attention. You have to keep an eye on all the fucking indicators of stealth (unless you're a rusher of course). Of course if you want to play all robbery and buy new good gun, you need to spend a lot of money(It's really very expensive). Buy and cry! 10/10"
815,"yes

"
816,"please add sex
"
817,Good shit
818,Recommend
819,dis game big funny
820,"good horde shooter
"
821,game good
822,"Base game stinks, but filled with DLC this game is a riot."
823,a game about police men and you do kill and rob place. 10/10 now i know how to rob my local bank.
824,"I've played a lot of hours on Xbox and coming from Xbox to PC, Payday 2 is different in a good way like: the amount of DLC'S there are and adding more variety to Payday 2. Overall, I like the game, it just takes a lot of time per heist"
825,waiting for payday 3...................
826,VERI EPIK
827,"Alot more simple than I thought. Do the objective, kill cops. Escape."
828,ITS THEM THE PAYDAY GANG!
829,Old but still got it
830,ja gut men
831,shit game but i love it
832,Racism
833,the DLCs were worth it
834,"25 hours in and I still haven't even gotten that far. This game has a lot of content and replayability, even if there is a lot of frustration involved too. Cook off especially is fun as hecc.
Not to mention the obvious banger music and everything that inspired, absolutely recommend if you haven't played it already"
835,"Play as Ron Perlman and rob a store with Keanu Reeves.
Call everone you meet a punk ass bitch.

What's not to like about that concept."
836,very fun but sometimes the AI pathfinding can get a little stale
837,Dopamine inducing Game Much DLC but if ya got a Friend with the DLC you can play the Heists with them or buy them since they are mostly 1-5 Euros a DLC plus the Legacy Pack wich gives you most for 16.99
838,Bank game?
839,from what ive heard Leroy is not a good security guard
840,haha dallas with  shotguns go brrrrrrrrr
841,Squeeeeze thoooose triggggerrrs
842,I like when money number go up
843,"THE COMEBACK!! Been supporting this game since 2014 on xbox360 all the way to now. Love to see the dev team didn’t give up on this game when they were struggling. This game has TONS of content for both single player and multiplayer. amazing loud and stealth heists to play & lots of guns / load outs to try. Also the game IS mod friendly. only downside is there are some bad mods that people use in multiplier that can ruin some missions. all together tho i 100% recommend this game, it’s clear the developers still put time and effort into the updates and i’ll definitely be here for PAYDAY3 and beyond’"
844,Try practicing in real life before playing
845,hmm today i will have fun fighting the headless titan dozer <--- (clueless)
846,"F#$% you, Bain. YOU should have tried sneaking it >:("
847,"my favourite part of pay day 2 is when dsallas says :""its time to payday"" and then ron pearlman eats a child"
848,so good
849,broked. drill
850,"very guuud very nice good game 
"
851,"Alright ramblers, lets get ramblin"
852,rng punish you
853,Family friendly wholesome fun!
854,You steal stuff and hope You don't get drop kicked by a man with night vision goggles.
855,"i love the game vr reccomended but theres no way to  jusmp in vr! but i guess its better for dual wielding a comacly large spoon of gold
"
856,its gooooood
857,"After playing this game I robbed a bank, somehow it didnt go as planned and I am now on death row but I smuggled a computer in to continue playing. 10/10 would play again"
858,good
859,hirsizlik oyunu. oynanır :P
860,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.

868,"yes
"
869,yes.
870,i love this game but it's a shit game
871,okay most skins cost under 1 dollar
872,"passes the time like crazy, may seem like a boring game but your gonna be determined to finish what you started"
873,"its a great game, i like the concept and how you can edit your guns into exactly what you want, its just such a fascinating game and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Its just fun - ive already played for 10 hours after just a couple of days.

909,"A heavily flawed, awful game that glorifies violence and crime. The game doesn't run too well either, and the developers aren't the most competent.
 
Overall, 10/10 game though, would recommend."
910,eh
911,"uh ya it's fun, give it a whirl, but honestly it's not that bad of a game, actually if ur leik me u will play this for a bit then be leik huh ? y did i ever play that ? 6.9 out of 10 for me"

Also the DLC's in this game rob your money irl."

918,It's fun just... try not to get shot
919,stole my money stole my time but most importantly stole my heart
920,dallas is hot ngl
921,pretty fun
922,"An absurdly massive game full of things to do and things to play with. A true heisting simulator filled with memes and genuinely cool stuff. A bloated mess. A game in desperate need of a third entry.

Payday 2 is a lot of things, but at its price, all you can really say is ""it's worth it"".

Doing heists, both in ""loud"" and stealth, is always fun, and playing with random people can still definitely be fun. You don't need friends for this co-op experience.
There's a massive amount of customization both in terms of loadouts and the look of your heister. There are skill trees as well that give you abilities to do various things, whether its supporting your team, doing dumb stuff, or putting out massive amounts of damage for free.
You can easily stack 500 hours into this game (as I have) and still find more things to do. I can't guarantee all of it will be as rewarding or intriguing as the early experience is, but I can say this game is definitely worth picking up (I don't have any of the Silk Road Collection DLC either; this is all ""basegame"" content; (a lot of it used to be DLC, it's a long story)).
These days, late game suffers from massive content bloat and general lack of viability of a lot of builds on the higher difficulties. In addition, there's so much that it can easily overwhelm a new player; a third entry from the ground up would be a much better pick than this game.
I give this game a thumbs up, both because you should buy it AND because it deserves it's third entry so badly. It's in development right now, so be on the lookout for that in the coming years."
923,"I've one word for this game, DOPE !!
This game is a masterpiece. Only too many DLCs to buy."
924,W game but they don't have scarface available anymore 😭
925,"good game, mods being so easy to install is nice, sucks there is so much paid dlc"

I love it and hate it
Would definitely recommend"
928,yrah
929,"we went from robbing a small store to making a crime lord the president, the last of us aint got nothing"

940,This game is always fun to return to. You can always find groups to play with. The DLC is on sale a lot you can open the whole game for less just wait for the sale. This is a great gifted game to friends when its on sale.
941,time sink
942,"Payday 2 is THE heist game. You steal cash money, digital money, counterfeit money, money printing plates, gold, mayan gold, cocaine, pure cocaine, meth, meth labs, hard drives, servers, historical armors and assorted artifacts, supernatural artifacts, human research, energy research, cars, bikes, golf carts, turrets (including the TF2 turret), turret shells, nuclear warheads, EMP bombs, regular bombs, firearms, prototype firearms, convicted felons, not-yet-convicted felons, paintings, votes and elections, presidential pardons, [REDACTED] but the most important heist of all?

959,ebik gaem
960,yeah
961,its diffidently a game
962,"The UI is not the best, i found out in the wiki that there's skills section but never found it myself, the server browser (if you can call it that) is really, really dumb; there's a map and you click on... stuff... and join a game but you can't even see your or anyone's ping. Also, whenever a player joins an in-progress game everyone else's game just stops until they are in, literally.
The gameplay loop is pretty much a waiting simulator with shooty weapons, you go to thing, press E, wait, repeat; the game got really boring really fast. There's stealth missions too with slightly better gameplay but you don't do those in public unless you get a teammates more coordinated than a professional F1 repair team.
Another thing i didn't like is that you rely on teammates too much to progress, sure you can do objectives by yourself but then you reach a point in which all alive players must go to a point, good luck with the lvl 100 guy spamming his lmg and shooting explosives at your feet for funsies.
I really liked the class and weapon customization, lots of potential, however, the rest of the game just falls flat on its face for me to enjoy it."

1009,"A very good play, Nostalgic for any that have played the game in it's infancy, could not recommend the game enough. The DLC aspect is definitely a downside , as a majority of the cosmetics are purchased, still would recommend !"

1014,"Bought payday 2. Robbed a bank and committed multiple federal crimes, came home and did the same in game. recommend 5/5"

1019,"You can rob banks with a spoon, old ass crossbows from the medieval times a Mauser c96 from 1896, while dressed up as a trump clown with glowing eyes. 10/10."
1020,"Reading all of these poor excuses of 1 star ratings have really irritated me, and caused me to make this review.

The game is not ""buggy as hell"" as people has stated it is, where as there may be a couple of bugs, the game is still extremely playable, and those bugs do not show their head much at all, In over 3000 hours of play time, I've experienced a bug, probably once or twice.

I've seen people say that the guns are terrible, feel awful, and that Call of Duty has a ""natural feel"" where this can not be further from the truth, Payday 2 incorporates recoil control, and attachment selection in order to fit the gun to the playstyle you are going for, Aiming down sights feels as natural as it can, considering the games age, Bare in mind, the game was released in 2013....

The AI, can be stupid at times, but again, this is due to the games age, which you can not deduct points for, as they work a lot of the time. People complain that they are sluggish or don't follow commands, However, if you are calling them to you, and they are shooting, they are not going to just run through everyone, because that is not realistic at all, they will seek cover, and shoot their way back safely, this is how the game is designed.

As for the person who stated ""The game is rubbish solo"" This is completely incorrect, I have personally completed every heist on solo, loud and stealth, you need to learn to understand the game and its mechanics and character build system before making a judgement that is factually incorrect.

As for being cheaply made, the game was made in 2013, Overkill was still a small studio, and what they did, with the budget they had, was phenomenal, you can not compare this game to games like Call of Duty, or GTA, because its just wrong, the studio was small, and are still supporting the game to this day, they are a fantastic studio, that has created an amazing game, and for that, I will be leaving a 5 star review for this game"
1021,cool
1022,Mone Tim!
1023,fun because its fun and you shoot people and also its like real life because you kill
1024,It is the devs stealin my money with these DLCs.
1025,"This is a big improvement over the 1st game ( Payday: The Heist ). Tons and tons of weapons and heist you can do in this game. Though in my opinion, i still think Payday: The Heist is better than this, in terms of realism, balanced weapons, and simple skill trees."
1026,"it is worth it. grapichs are decent not the best but they are still okay.
gameplay is awesome. there is hundreds of guns.

but the game is ""kinda"" pay to win you need to buy lot of bundles or packs to get new guns or characters."

1041,single shot rifle over the horizon 2019
1042,Old game
1043,the game is fun but the player base isn't very friendly to new players i kept getting kicked from lobbies for things like i had no suppressor even though i did or having grenades even though i had the grenade key unbound because i kept accidentally using it granted they wouldn't know but they didn't ask and just assumed because i was new so i found myself having very little fun infact the only time i had alot of fun was when i randomly found a modded lobby and i got a couple hundred million dollars but thats not how you play. i would recommend you just get a few friends to play with you instead of getting called slurs and trying to join 6 lobbies and getting kicked instantly...or just deal with it but thats your choice not mine. conclusion game fun player base not good
1044,"This game is visually and physically stunning, it's one of those hoard shooters that isn't based on Zombies or an Infection and instead is based on Heists, and by that fact it's one of the best Heist Shooters in the world, no doubt. Payday 2 is a timeless masterpiece as now 9 years later is still going strong with Payday 3 coming out next year, and the only fact that this game goes on sale A LOT and is always $9.99 without a sale is just a low price and amazing for a video game with so much content.

If you haven't bought Payday 2 already, get it, It's timeless and with Payday 3 coming out you can get warmed up before you buy another absolute banger of the Payday franchise."
1045,gud game
1046,PLAY GAME
1047,veri gud
1048,This game is a one of culture. Despite it being almost 10 years old the game still holds up well.  The game is still updated with new content up to today and the developers are very generous when it comes to pricing.

1050,"ITS A PRETTY COOL GA,E WITH NO LOGIC.
"
1051,"Game fun
"
1052,"Payday 2 is everything you'd expect from a sequel and more. Though there's still some jankiness, and it's still basically just a horde shooter with a cops and robbers coat of paint, it's pretty fun and there's a lot of customization.

The main reason I didn't recommend Payday: The Heist was due to its low player count and poor solo experience. Payday 2 still has a thriving community, and offers a much better solo experience."
1053,"Killing people with giant spoons, fun"

1057,"Would be a good game if the save files didnt corrupt so frequently. Even if you make backups there's still issue and I lost 101 hours of gameplay to this. I am furious and do not recommend the hassle. There is no way to restore from cloud apparently either, even though it has the option. I can not believe any game would be like this. Very unhappy"

1140,It is a pretty fun game and it is even better when you play with friends but it is still okay when you play alone. It is fun with the dlc especially the ones that add weapons and heists so I would recommend getting the legacy collection bundle.
1141,"great and fun game to play, definitely would recommend."
1142,"I had this game in my library for a while, I saw the 9th anniversary event going on and decided to join in, I joined a lot of quick play matches and had fun doing my usual chill FPS routine.

1235,"For me this game is a great game not just saying that is the best game but there are still bugs but for me I can resolve them just by looking on Youtube. In my 379 hours of playing I am saying that Payday 2 is like a addiction because there are a lot of achievements ( 1287 achievements) that if you want to be a crazy dude do all of them. If you want to be more crazier do the secret ending and then you will be in 2.5% of all the payday Heisters finishing the secret ending. After all Payday 2 has cool things and those things are Mods, oh yes. Mods can make your gameplay crazier or you want to have a 8k resolution or even if you want to get masks, heists, guns and may more.                    In my suggestion is not really buy it now, and wait until the new Payday 3 comes or if you want really to buy it you are free to do anything."

1310,"A rather controversial product, some do not like the loud passage of missions (including me) because during the assault a lot of cops come in and due to the fact that they are very weak, it infuriates. But as for Stealth, it is excellent here, because when passing stealth missions, you need to take into account a lot: cameras, civilians and cops can see the corpse if you don’t answer the pager in time, the alarm starts, the cops can see the hostage (but if you put his head into the wall, then no one will raise the alarm if hostage
will be seen, since the npc and cameras look exactly at the head)"

1316,"(im a console player with like 400 hours infamy 9) i just wrote a 5000 word essay on how console is better as they made the game worse with updates and haven't fixed simple crap like medics not having a stagger animation and them healing through walls and ceilings. but steams dumb and deleted all of it on me for making it a negative review instead of the inital positive review. lets speed it up shall we? console doesn't have leech, is missing a few missions, doesn't have 200 dollars of dlc, it has some dlc prepackaged in it already, damage range falloff isn't on console, All the 500 levels of worthless pointless infamy levels with a mod they ripped and put officially into the game to circumvent the constant inventory and skill wipe of an infamy isn't in the game you have to reset your equipment and builds entirely every reset but on console is just capped at 25 infamy. in summary they've fixed nothing, made every shotgun but the 2 boring meta shotguns bad, ammo pickup is still pretty terrible even when your berserker 1 shotting heavy swats, they've made new missions that change very little about the game, overkill is terrible with money and invested terribly resulting on console payday dying with it and financially crippled payday 3, they added loot boxes for a while against other devs wishes and ended up walking it back. all we got for customization is armor colors and masks, you cant mod yourself into an anime girl or a cringe youtuber and you cant make your gun blue. your not told how much health you and enemies currently have or what stage of the assault is or how many downs you and your friends have left on console too. Mods (mostly) good, updates (generally) bad"

1340,At first you think you are stealing money from banks in the game. But then you realize that this game steals money from your Steam wallet.
1341,"I would recommend this game to people that like fps games and people that like Robbing banks in game.
The game is very fun just you kinda need someone to play with.
If you don't have any friends this game most likely wont be very fun for you
I'd recommend you at least to play with 2 other people since you can talk in something like Discord,
instead of playing with bots or randoms. At the time of this review I have about 250 hours into the game and me personally
I thought this game was very fun. I've gotten to the max level in the game which is level: 100 didn't take me very long since it's very easy to do
heists very quickly. I recommend you try out this game and when your starting you should probably play like a Medium difficulty since you would probably
want to earn at least some money and exp. I enjoyed the game as you can see since I have 250 hours, I hope I can get up to 2000 hours though
hopefully once I get at least 1000 hours you might consider this review at least a little helpful. Anyways thanks for reading and 5/5 game."

1518,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?

Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

1632,"If you ever wanted to go guns blazing running your way through endlessly spawning enemies without a care, scout and sneak around a set amount of enemies and security cameras, or play on such a high difficulty you will need to hit almost every headshot, have almost perfect positioning and timing while completing objectives or stealing valuables and drugs this is the game for you. There's enough enemy variety, classes, perks, and weapons to allow for almost any play style you can think of, and enough missions to provide lots of content giving you incredible value for your money. The multiplayer with friends, especially in stealth missions makes the game even better. For me personally, the base concept of shooting NPCs, sneaking by NPCs, bagging up loot and taking it to the escape did get boring for me after 120 hours though. My friends and I will 99.9% be buying Payday 3.

1642,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."
1643,yea okay i guess its a good game.
1644,The DLC for this game has unfortunately kept it on life support when what we really need is a Payday 3. Playing this game in 2022 when there's a sea of far superior alternatives is a joke. The lack of QoL changes made to this game over its lifespan is also a joke resulting in the experience of playing this game today being pretty miserable and annoying.

1667,yes
1668,Fun
1669,"Look man. Ive played payday on many different platforms and have played a good amount of hours. What I've learned over time is that what makes payday 2 so addicting to some people is the gameplay loop. Most heists require you to complete some sort of objective or multiple objectives. Then you must secure and move the loot to the loot location. The payday gang will then have to escape. Now they're many heists that are an exception to this gameplay loop but that's how most of them go. This gameplay loop brings me back to the game again and again. Now the weird loop of carrying illegal shit is not the only thing that keeps coming back. The second thing that makes me come back is the different builds you can make. You can create some really wacky but really fun builds. The most recent one i can think off is any build with the venom gas grenade launcher. You can turn the whole map into Shrek's swamp. It's really ridiculous but can be super effective and fun with the right build. Haha bad things about payday 2 where could I start. The game is really buggy. Most of the bugs are because of payday 2's engine called diesel. Its not good, never was good, and will never be good. It's just too out of date and buggy. Payday 3 is being made in the unreal engine which was amazing to hear. I just hope overkill gives us a great experience. The diesel engine is not just buggy it also just does not look good visually. It also has trouble delivering on cinematic sequences. When they try to do something cinematicaly the diesel engine just fails to deliver. The game doesn't crash too often for me but it does happen enough to be mentioned. Its probably due to mods mostly. Overall if you can get past the quirkyness of the diesel engine. You have a fun horde shooter with a heister coat of paint. The bugs can suck sometimes but when they aren't present you find yourself having fun with friends and even randoms online. I hope Payday 3 is good next year."

1672,"well in some ways. It's still can be fun, but too many challenges.
Also a lot of it's content is now overpriced with some unbalanced content.
To the abuse of not getting a ""pay day""... which is also not fun.

if you can deal with this, it can be fun... if you want to deal with some of its issues.

Browsing still sort of suck, same with filtering.
Then joining trolls or people that just bans, then to cheating/farmed accounts. but that is not always the case. Also to the point that browsing for a game can take too long, for what it should.

Gunplay isn't great (game being a bit old now), but can work.
Game gone away from it's stealth aspect which you can still do, but became more run and gun. Skills and perks that is a bit of a mess, at least they give you templates to mess with now. Skills and perks that are so specific you got to remember having it on and what they do.
Also the UI can't handle everything they have added over the years, which makes it god awful. To ""cards"" or lootboxes that is a pain to use.

game becoming more grindy, in the aspect it want to expect you doing 100 hours of grinding or more. Also less missions are mission focused, as previously you could do more longer day missions (days as in missions in a sequence), so 5 days be 5 missions. Now most is focused on 1 day missions which isn't bad as one mission can take from 10m to 15-30m."

1734,"I finally played PayDay 2 and... yeah it's pretty fun. To call it a good game would be a stretch in my mind, however it does make you feel like you're in a heist movie; and boy is it fun.

[h1] The Loop [/h1]

The game has a very repetitive game play loop, that follows a pattern of:
 1. Find the objective
 2. Access the objective, usually by defending something.
 3. Loot the objective
 4. Run for the extraction.

There are optional objectives you can complete, like picking up misc items like packages; however this doesn't actually effect the game apart from straying off path a bit. You could also stealth, but stealth in this game is very boring. Take the bank heist for example, you: sneak in, plant the drill, wait 3 minutes, haul out the loot. There are only 3 guards you need to worry about, and the cameras never face the vault in my experience. The stealth missions that require stealth are a lot better and are extremely tense even on normal difficulty.

Let's get back to the main game play loop. As I said above it is very repetitive; however when actually playing the game I never really thought about it since the game disguises the loop. As an example, let's take a mission I enjoyed; you go to Russia in search of a hidden lab where they're doing experiments. You have to:

 1. Find the lab.
 2. Once inside, you access a scanner; which you have to defend whilst it scans a test subject.
 3. Once the scan is complete, you grab the server; which has the scan data on.
 4. You run to the extraction point.

As you can see the loop is still the bulk of the mission, however instead of defending a drill; you're defending a scan. It may seem like a small thing on paper, but actually in game; it feels fresh. I'd wager the little story has something to do with this. Pair that with the: beautiful new map, different looking enemies, and unique side objectives; it all comes together as a brilliant way to trick your brain into feeling like you're not doing the same stuff. It keeps the game not only fresh, but fun. I'm sure it could get to the point where you complete all missions and the illusion is lost, but at that point you've already spent days in game.

[h1] Difficulty [/h1]

Next we need to talk about difficulty, it sucks. Playing PayDay on the normal difficulty you're practically invulnerable; you would have to try your hardest to die. I'll admit it does add to the feeling of being in a heist movie; however it becomes stale very quickly. The police and swat become more of an inconvenience then a fun challenge, there's just nothing to keep you occupied whilst waiting for the drill. Ultimately this led me to trying the harder difficulties, I found that Very Hard is where I struck a nice balance between difficulty, and fun. It's not too hard to the point where it takes all the fun from the game but it is also challenging enough to really distract you from the defense timer. The higher difficulties become a lot less fun, Overkill is probably doable; anything higher just seems silly to me. You do get amazing rewards, but honestly if you're in the situation where you are able to do those levels with relative ease, you probably don't care about the money or EXP.

[h1] The Soundtrack [/h1]

The soundtrack in PayDay 2 is fucking brilliant. It compliments the game in such a big way that I didn't realise until I turned off the music. It is mostly high BMP electronic music, however mowing down a whole countries worth of police with [url=https://youtu.be/RhyJWStIpFc?t=136] This playing [/url] you feel a rush of not only adrenaline but also confidence. All the tracks are amazing, but aren't all equal. For example, you don't want the song I linked to earlier playing when you're sneaking, it would just make no sense and would be annoying. The game chooses the right soundtrack depending whats happening, which is really great. I can't do it justice honestly. Oh also you can create a completely custom soundtrack with literally any songs you enjoy, but why would you do this when PayDay has masterfully created music to pump you up? 

[h1] The AI [/h1]

The AI in PayDay is terrible. I play mostly offline with the bot team-mates and let me tell you; they don't care about you at all. They will let a whole village worth of enemies just walk past them and shoot the shit out of you, even when you're trying to complete an objective. The enemy AI could be compared to lemmings, following their team into a swarm of bullets. They're truly all artificial without any intelligence. I suspect this was on purpose to allow you to mow down a lot of them so you get that rush, that we keep chasing; however  I think you could still have that feeling even after a few adjustments to the AI. Take GTA V for example, you still feel unstoppable moving down hundreds of cops however they will try to save team mates, flank you, send bigger units ect, I think it would be a really nice addition to the game.


[h1] Wrapping up [/h1]

There are a lot more things in the game to talk about, however there's nothing I can really add my take to so it would look something like ""There are builds in the game, they allow you to take on a new role"". There's not a lot to add really. I could talk about the units however I didn't really have a huge take on them. Most of the ones the average player will encounter aren't that special. There are snipers, that lock down an area of the map, that's cool but annoying. If I talked about all enemies that is about as much detail as I could give. In higher levels they play a bigger role however the average player won't be playing on Overkill or higher making the whole subject a moot point.

So to wrap up, PayDay is an okay game with a repetitive game play loop; however the game strives in being addicting and fun. Slaughtering thousands of cops makes you feel like an unstoppable force that could rob anything; and you do. This game isn't about following a story, it isn't about being strategic, it isn't about even being realistic. It is a game that wants you to feel like you're in a movie; and it does that amazingly. The AI may be stupid, the harder difficulty levels may not have never been play tested, the randoms you get paired with may be as dumb as the AI; but honestly even with all the issues the game has been and continues to be a entertaining power trip that always leaves you craving more."

1759,"Not gonna lie. Totally started playing after I saw the Russian Badger's video on the game. This game has got me addicted now. If you're new to the game, I highly recommend watching Black Yoshi's video on Payday 2. Cause' he nailed this game. It's addicting. I play this game pretty regularly now because of how much fun it is. The community is pretty great once you get to hang with them a bit on Online Heist. I'm a bit late to the party, but I don't care. This game slaps. I wouldn't have almost 100 hours into it if it wasn't fun. I highly recommend if you like games like Left for Dead. This game is the best horde shooter by far. It will kick your ass until you get to understand what you're doing. It's okay. I promise. Just give it another try with some people in Random online heist. 

All together. This game is fun. I can't wait till Payday 3 comes out. I'm definitely gonna get it when it goes on pre-order.  Get in their and let's get heisting."
1760,"Do you enjoy grinding and being a criminal? Outlandish stand offs with police? Tons of customization and ability to make your crew drip with cool gear and weapons? This might just be the game for you! PAYDAY2!

It's an amazing game. At first it can be frustrating with understanding markers for objectives. The indicators may take a little longer than necessary to show up or seem a little vague at times for players to quickly adapt to the situational awareness. Over all, it may be a little lagged at times or slow with dialog or objective updates from one point to another, but still a greatly FUN.

It's the type of game that isn't meant to be taken seriously to an extreme. It's a great heist game that has a sand-box feel to it with some interesting dynamics and story plots, missions and more. Customization is awesome! With tons to choose from (Some stuck behind DLC or require certain levels to unlock) in game for weapons, masks, outfits and more. It would score an 8/10. This game is great to play with friends (If you have any) or by yourself and that's perfectly fine. Multiplayer, online, offline selections allow freedom to progress on your own or side by side with other players. Making a matching outfit for ALL 4 crew members makes the drip and trip worth while progressing forward in game as one group of wolves or a bunch of comical misfits.

It's a great game for something that is inexpensive in what you receive. Don't take my word for it. Try it yourself and be sure to give it a chance. That's what I did, which it turned into a great idea and investment of entertainment. Hopefully, this review helps in making a better decision to buying the game (or not)."
1761,"I got all 1,287 achievements in this game. Don't believe me? Check my profile. I got to Infamy 100 and unlocked pretty much everything in the game. Did I have fun? I don't know? My life has spiraled out of control over the months that I have been grinding Payday. My girlfriend left me for a man who paid attention to her. My house was taken back by the bank. I've been fired from my job at my IT company after not showing up to work for 8 months. I have only a couple hundred dollars left in the bank. I'm struggling to find a new job and have been living in a cheap motel for 2 weeks. Am I happy with this outcome? Am I happy that I have ruined my life to be the best at this online video game? Am I happy that the only thing I have in my life is infamy 100? I don't know. I haven't felt much since infamy 60. I don't know what I am going to continue doing but I doubt it will be much, if anything at all. Once I run out of money and can't find a job I might just call it quits. My only option would be to leave my mortal vessel and return once more to the heavens in which God himself chose me to be birthed from an egg and sperm. That is if I'm lucky. Knowing my life I'd probably spend the rest of my afterlife living in eternal damnation. What is life? Is God real? Is Heaven real? Am I REAL? Why has my life come to nothingness after this game. What have I done to deserve this? I'll edit this post eventually on my situation, that edit will either be my last ever action on this world before the end or it will be filled with the good news of cotton candy and sunshines. Thanks for tuning in.
Edit: After a couple of months of trying to fix the soggy dirt my life has come to by taking to a ""female"" for the first time in 3 months, I've been rejected and sent back to rock bottom. Actually no I've been sent to shit bottom past the clutches of satan himself as even he couldn't handle the failures I have burdened him with. Before this i was watching Belle Delphine and knew my time has come. L+ratio+bozo+your short+no one asked+cringe+ok and+based+you have no friends+cry about it. That was for you Chris. Seya in hell."
1762,it gud

1796,"Payday 2 is a first person coop PvE shooter, where the player takes place as a member of the PAYDAY-Crew which are known for robbing banks. jewelry boutiques etc. with their brutality.

the game has a lot of weapons to choose from. from small SMGs to heavy assault all the way to mini and mashine guns.

What i like about the game is the variants you can execute each job: stealth or loud.
with each difficulty making it harder for the players.
from unbreakble cameras to heavy SWAT assaults all the way to a heavly armored ""Bulldozer"" with shotguns/Miniguns (depents on difficulty)
 

i recommend playing it with friends for the maximum fun.


overall a fun game.

1828,Really fun
1829,Just installed will give review after 1 month...
1830,"Very simple kind of fun. You can play it as complex or as simply as you'd like. Controls and UI are a bit of a mess, even for the time it came out, but it's something that you can get used to. The optimisation is also not that good, but it's honestly not as big a deal for a 9 year old game. Overall a fun experience, but not necessarily a must play; especially since Payday 3 is due in a few years from the time of this review."
1831,w
1832,Nice game i can only recommend
1833,I got this to play in vr and wasn't expecting much at all. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the game works for vr once you install the 'vr improvements mod'. It's no into the radius for immersion but it gets the job done decently well. Without the mod it's pretty janky though

1882,"I appreciate the journey this game has gone through in development over the years to be what it is now. The events are kinda fun. Generally, can be a grind it you let it become that, but overall, I think it's one of the few in it's genre and clearly the best of them.

Highly recommend to play with friends and not solo. It's relatively easy to drop into games with other people."

1921,"Ah PAYDAY 2 that one game where you rob things and shoot other things, just don't think about the story and you'll enjoy yourself."
1922,The Cash Blaster needs to be a permanent weapon. There are so many OP things and builds in Payday 2. Just nerf the heck out of it and give us it as a novelty flamethrower. It's sad that we only see it for events and don't get to keep it after completing the challenges.
1923,MISTER GORBACHEV I TORE DOWN THIS WALL
1924,LETS BREAK THE RULES

1927,Payday 2 is a great game to play with friends and on your own. The graphics look good and the maps/heists are really well made. The gameplay is great and the soundtrack is amazing. I would recommend getting the Armoured Transport DLC because you get 5 heists which are very fun to play.
1928,"dog shit

1934,I like it
1935,"its a fun game but i do have some critics
1) Even if you disable voice chat it still tries to use your mic so in my case every single time i do a contract i have to rejoin the call (i use discord and payday 2 is the only game i have that does this)
2) The entire system becomes unresponsive after a hour or so of playing apart from the game, closing the game doesnt fix this and i have to shut down my pc via the external power button to fix it

anyway very fun game i'd reccomend it if you dont use discord or dont mind the pc restart thing"

The game isn't good, in fact anyone you ask will say the game isn't good, but the way it was made provides some really well made feedback and gameplay. In other words, you may or may not get addicted to a really mediocere game."
1949,I NEED A FUCKING MEDIC BAG!
1950,It was a great game in its heyday but it's gotten pretty stale. They really need to stop milking it and make Payday 3 already.

1952,i once cooked meth with my friend for 5hours 10/10
1953,"This game is very very very good and as much fun as one man can handle without dying of a fun overload, but some enemies like the clocker scare the life force out of me lol, try it or the clocker will find where you live and will end you with a nice kick."

1959,very good
1960,"7/10 i can surely say that payday 2 is an ejoyable game and my 210 hours on this prove it. Lots of weapons,heists, characters, lots of customization and a good story behind it all. But yes the game has a lots of dlc's and if ya say pd2 is pay to win then i agree with ya. But what is the best thing about it is this : i spent 100 hours in the game before i bough any of them (NO JOKE!) so its not that bad of a system. Bugs and glitches are still in the game - such as when you shoot someone in head his neck will just get 25cm longer or civis dont react on your command or get stuck or sometimes the detection meter fills up and nothing happens - this last one is rare like hell. Many heists can be stealthed or you can go loud. Community is ok, not rly toxic, but some players just go : ''AH YOU DONT HAVE THIS PERK DECK SO I KICK YOU!'' ...I dare to say this out loud : Its retarted. Overall its a good game indeed, not perfect but rly good."

1978,"My favourite moment in Payday The Secondth is when the Payday Gang steal a prototype of the Sentry Gun that was locked on a train. This sentry gun was made by Engineer (From the hit game Team Defence Fort The Secondth). This means the Payday universe and Team Fortress 2 Universes are linked. Mean while, the Portal universe and Half-life universe are shown to be connected. As well as this, Half-life can be linked back to Team Gamer 2, proving that in theory i should be allowed to use portal guns in Payday 2."

1987,The game is fairly fun but for such outdated gfx I simply can't justify 80GB space requirement while much better looking games take much less space. Ridiculous that in 9 years they still couldn't give a hell about optimising their textures and pushing massive updates for very small changes.

2059,"Great game, one issue. DLC is everywhere, while i understand that a certain VR caused it is excessive.  But ignoring that it has a fire soundtrack, a good cast of characters, a storyline (Albeit a bit confusing) for people who want it. 9/10 the dlcs stopped the 10/10 rating."
2060,flaming cash grabbing piece of shit. If you like shooting someone 45 times in the head for them to die because they are the special police unit with literally electric batons that rush you and 1 hit dump you while taking full mags to the body this is your shitty game of the year.
2061,great game but never play online stealth.

2064,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone."

2088,"Hello, this is my review of Payday 2.

The game is great, when you have DLC. 
No DLC = Game Poo Poo
DLC = Belissimo

I'm polish so you need to agree to my opinion of this game,
every thief trick used in the game was used before by me.
The game is very realistic, as i been doing this in real life.
The game is hard sometimes, it varies at difficulties.
Sadly they didn't include polish men in the game, then it would be a 10/10 for me.
Chicken Guy still can't talk because he has a tumor.
Bonnie was included, idgaf about Clyde. F this guy.
I also have 3000 hour experience of stealing in real life as i'm polish. (if you didn't know already)
I recommend this game not for polish people as it's too easy for them,
i recommend it to people from Saudi Arabia because some missions are stealth and i know they want to be bomb at the start of the game.

But yes very good game thank you.

P.S. Your Father"
2089,"Nothing beats the sweet satisfaction of putting on a demonic-looking mask and smoking two guards before they realize I'm not a janitor. 

I'd recommend Payday 2 to anyone who wants a good time and memorable moments.

Oh, and hope you like holding 'F' and pressing 'G'."

2131,One of my favorite games. Hate the leveling system as losing gives you 0 xp for hours of work. But its still a blast and love the ability to customize.
2132,Payday 2 is a classic and can be a lot of fun to play with friends.

Frame rate drops from 126 to 1 every 3 seconds, massive input lag / stuttering and that was just in the main menu (plus the mouse cursor offset bug is STILL HERE AFTER 6 YEARS) make it so I can't even start a game. Apparently I'm not the only one since this same issue has been popping up since 2020 according to forum posts..."

2217,I love this game! being an infamous crime lord while robbing every single place on every single difficulty makes this game so replay able. The only downside is that when you're grinding Someone else's heist you can lose connection to them or the host may leave ending the heist giving you no compensation.

2275,"I no longer need my payday 2, I just want to be happy"
2276,"Very good fps game with a heist theme. Both Loud missions (action-packed), and also Stealth missions (sneak and be as stealthy as possible). Very good graphics, music score plus sound FX's and voices are perfect. Highly recommendable. Only minor things to put on this game, is eg. one needs to switch to Steam in order to accept Friend invites. But usually the case (I think) with a bit older games. If you are a beginner to fps games, or you have become a bit rusty after a hiatus period, then the game can be difficult even on normal. Setting up a custom game, could maybe also be a bit more straightforward. One needs to go to Online game - Then to Contact Broker - Then set up settings for the custom game - Plus invite to friend (And friend needs to go to switch to Steam window, and accept friend invite in the Steam Chat.). But guess that's minor things, that doesn't spoil the overall awesomeness of this Heist fps game. Krusty BTW: Looking forward to Payday 3 I had heard rumors should be there in 2023."
2277,The game is awesome but some missions are sometimes repetitive but other than that the game is really fun and when you play with friends or other people it's even more fun than when playing with AI. I recommend this game for people who like games like Grand Theft Auto and other games that include crimes and it's amazing for that.

2303,yes
2304,"horrible for disk space, too much dlc for too much money, too much base content, ai is garbage and useless in stealth, difficulty curve goes from 1 to 100, community is uncooperative, floods of overpowered enemies, very complex skill and perk trees with way too much to them, levels can be extremely time consuming(for example, jewelry box missions without a saw), too little reward for too high risk, missing voice lines between characters and unexpected ones between characters(ex. bodhi and sydney), something to do with finding packages that i mostly ignored, useless assets you can buy pre-robbery, extremely addictive, good music"
2305,"Beyond Goog!
"
2306,you get to cook meth
2307,really nice game to play with friends even if they don't know how to be stealth...
2308,game is a straight up vibe. with a bangin soundtrack and also a easy modding scene. the game can easily become something that you can enjoy for hours and hours apon end. but even without mods the base game is still extremely entertaining. highly recommend 1000/10

2329,"If you are willing to get the out of date DLC pack (forgot the name of the DLC collection) which gives you almost about everything then this game is genuinely extremely fun with a full stack of friends, even solo is enjoyable. The main enjoyment absolutely comes from the stress of your last pager trying to get everything back and the music blasting in your ear as you get swarmed with police officers. However it is a bit repetitive and grindy so if you can ignore its out of date performance/graphics its one of the better horde based shooters."

2363,"INTRO: 
It was time for enterprisin’ 
I gathered all the guys in My crew (mm-hmm) 
They knew (uh-huh) 
We ‘bout to go out heistin’ 

VERSE 1: 
We went into the lobby of the local bank 
It was Dallas, Wolf and me with Hoxton on the flank 
It escalated quickly, soon they sent in the SWAT 
As we were hauling bags of cash try’na avoid gettin’ shot 
Then BANG! I got hit - I was in the dark 
Through the commotion and explosions I could hear a remark 
As I was lying there envisioning my life as a cripple 
It was Bain, tactlessly goin’ “ Chains is in a pickle!” 

CHORUS 1: 
AAARGH! Sniper knocked me out Everybody shout: He’s in a pickle! Chains is in a pickle! (Pickle!) AAARGH! Sniper knocked me out Everybody: Chains is in a pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! 

VERSE 2: 
Another time we’re ambushing an armored car 
We had a loader push it off the road - the plan was bizarre 
In an alley outta nowhere came a green eyed Cloaker 
And I could not outrun him even though I’m no smoker 
He punched me causing my whole cerebellum to jiggle 
And without missing a beat Bain goes “ Chains is in a pickle!” 

CHORUS 2: 
AAARGH! Cloaker knocked me out Everybody shout: He’s in a pickle! Chains is in a pickle! (Pickle!) AAARGH! Cloaker knocked me out Everybody: Chains is in a pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! 

CHAINS’ GIRLFRIEND: 
Chains is in a pickle, Chains is in a pickle Chains is in a pickle, Chains is in a pickle Chains is in a pickle, in a pickle he is Chains is in a pickle, Chains is in a pickle (x2) 

VERSE 3: 
Next was a diamond we were looking to score 
A great start - Wolf even stayed off the dance floor 
But then the codes for the vault turned out to be wrong 
We were steamrolled by an army of SWATs 10.000 STRONG! 
A Dozer wrecked me, I swear Bain was mufflin’ a giggle 
As he went “Somebody help Chains - he’s in a pickle!” 
You feel me? 

CHORUS 3: 
AAARGH! Dozer knocked me out Everybody shout: He’s in a pickle! Chains is in a pickle! (Pickle!) AAARGH! Dozer knocked me out Everybody: Chains is in a pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! 

BREAKDOWN: 
A Taser just electroshocked me right in the nipple 
Don’t assume I’m in the mood to hear “ Chains is in a pickle!” 

CHORUS 3: 
AAARGH! Taser shocked me out Everybody shout: He’s in a pickle! Chains is in a pickle! (Pickle!) AAARGH! Taser shocked me out Everybody: Chains is in a pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! AAARGH! Something knocked me out Everybody shout: He’s in a pickle! Chains is in a pickle! (Pickle!) AAARGH! I’m here bleedin’ out You’re just goin’: Chains is in a pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! 
Pickle! Pickle! Pickle! PICKLE!"

Fun and games "" which the cops don't take nicely ""
the last situation you want to be during a heist, My take on this would to be in multiple heist""S""
and the only game you can fuck over by buying a skin to a DLC you don't own and yet somehow the npc's still have no respect for your amazing skins that made you go skint.
The cops that fire at you with a taser are bloody annoying the only satisfying thing with them is when they fall face first into a wall. after putting 3 rounds into their body,
Quite lucky that in 30 minutes later your having a payday for most of it to go into an offshore bank account. After that such of event you don't really have enough money to buy a clean tuxedo. and Finally there is more achivements in this game than there is chapters in the Bible 4 times over"

2398,is good play this
2399,its robbing but your high as fuck
2400,This game gives me a greater addiction than any amounts of heroin or meth ever could
2401,"You can be an 800 pound gorilla made of tungsten, moving at mach 3, hipfiring an 8 kilo LMG, while healing yourself by taking a swig from your alcohol flask, all the while Bain is shouting at you to reset the drill, which you do by hitting it with a comically large spoon made of 24k gold. Do I really need to say more"
2402,AHH I NEED A MEDIC BAG
2403,Worth it
2404,"You like Pistols, Shotguns, Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, SMGs, Akimbo Versions of the listed, Swords, Knuckles, RPGs, Grenade Launchers, Hammers, Bows, Holy shit man this game is fun and the variety is astounding. Great and challenging wave based heist combat for tryhards and casuals alike. You like GTA but wished it was more like Killing Floor? Well your in luck. In a game older that Jake Paul's fanbase you will be greeted with mountains of content all readily available. No need for map packs, it's all there. Buy it you have money, get someone to buy it for you if you can. This crap is decently beyond acceptable! 9/10"
2405,I need a medic bag
2406,"After 242 hours of playing this game and being on Infamy VIII, I can say that It's hard to get bored of it and I still enjoy the game, Overkill made the game look cool with those cinematic videos of the new characters or DLC's and they're not that expensive comparing to the other games DLC's. Overkill keeps updating the game so it doesn't look and feels dead."
2407,cum
2408,The description of the game is incorrect. This is a simulator of DLS

2412,"Go ahead, Rob a small bank with a minigun. Set a cop on fire with a (comically) large golden spoon. murder hundred of law enforcers too steal nuclear warheads because a russian mobster told you to. You know you want to, and this game lets you."

2427,dumb fun.
2428,very cool
2429,"Very good, Very nice."
2430,Its a fun game that you'll play for hours without getting bored its also 1000x better if you play with friends but sometimes the game can be overwhelming especially when there are 20 Swat units trying to get you at once
2431,"TL:DR Too much of a hoard shooter, not enough robbery. Its still pretty damn fun tho.

On reasonable difficulties this game is pretty great, as is the stealth. But loud heists are more about mowing down endless enemies while timers tick down instead of working as a team, completing objectives, and most importantly filling duffle bags with gold bars and cash. Players aren't able to really contend with the cops until level 70 since all the good weapons are locked off and your skillsets are unfinished. The DLC is necessary to buy, about half the content like levels and weapons are locked behind paywalls which is a shame. I think they did alot of things right though it just devolves too quickly into a fustercluck, its not ""over the top action"" its a mess."
2432,Best crime simulator ever.
2433,"This is a video game.

I don't even know how to describe it. This game defies categorization because at one point you're robbing banks, and in another one cooking meth, and in another one you're basically playing Metal Gear Solid. You're playing an RPG, a puzzle game, a strategy game, a stealth game, and a ""host kicked you from the session"" game. It's a broken mess because of its outdated engine and it has more DLCs than the total amount of filler episodes in Naruto.

And it's one of my favorite games of all time."
2434,"best soundtrack i ever bought, wait theres a game that comes with it."
2435,"THIS GAME IS MORE ADDICTING THAN COCAINE
HOLY *&%$ I CANT STOP PLAYING

2436,Frustrating but fun
2437,
2438,"I finally got to play this game after years of having shitty PCs, and it really gave me more inspiration and motivation to do my art things because of how fun and it interesting it was. I can consider this my new second favorite game"
2439,It's cultured chaos
2440,"Y'know, I've played quite a bit of this. It's really fun with friends, and a little less without. Sometimes the game bugs out and you fail a mission or it's not passable entirely, but it is still a pretty great game.

The only problem I personally actually have with this game is that it locks 90% of the content in DLC's that cost way more than they should. And while I could see maybe one or two clothing or skin packs that occasionally get an extra skin, they have tons of packs of just gloves!
I could also see maps being extra DLC, maybe even some weapons, since the different missions can be played different ways, but it would be nice if they stopped trying to nickel and dime us."
2441,is pretty good

2452,"Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.
The spot was perfect for camouflage. At least that's what she thought when she picked the spot. She couldn't imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings. So there she sat, confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger. Unfortunately, she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles, and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot.
""Do Not Enter."" The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around. That wasn't going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion that signs were mere suggestions, not actually absolute rules. That's why the moment Jack looked at the ""Do Not Enter"" sign, he walked past it and onto their property.
He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat staring ahead, never noticing that she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together.
She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly. It seemed that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep things clean and orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn't know was there was a tiny creature living in it that didn't like things neat.
One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack's only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He's lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.
All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult request to comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn't seem to want to honor the request. It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.
It had been a rough day. Things hadn't gone as planned and that meant Hannah got yelled at by her boss. It didn't even matter that it wasn't her fault. When things went wrong at work, Hannah got the blame no matter the actual circumstances. It wasn't fair, but there was little she could do without risking her job, and she wasn't in a position to do that with the plans she had.
There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned it exactly this way.
Another option you have is choosing the number of syllables in the words you speak. You probably have never considered this option before, but you have it every time you open your mouth and speak. You make so many choices like this that you never even think about, but you have the choice with each one. What are you going to do with this knowledge?"
2453,yes
2454,"This game has a great concept but got so many things wrong. To start it is bombarded with DLC (which is a shame considering it costs 10$ Pay to Play and is on a PC) including extra, there are not many weapons available and if you are looking for an LMG, sniper, or any other special weapon then you are stuck with one choice and some of the choices particularly the free sniper rifle are very bad and if you want a good weapon you are forced to pay. there are also many good and pricey special weapons like rocket launchers which gives the players who pay for them an advantage over the other killing massive groups with one shot confirming that the game is also a P2W considering the initial cost, in addition, some perk decks like burglar and kingpin are also paid and give the player a significant advantage. generally, the microtransaction has bad value (except for packs with big discounts) and if you want some investment like extra heist and weapons you have to pay something like 4 times the cost of the game itself.
another problem is the toxic community. If you are playing on a higher difficulty you may be instant-banned after joining without explanation and some of the reasons being that you have to make your steam profile public and expose your name and your location (if you like the privacy of course)  the problem propellers itself thanks to the default host kicking rather the other more popular method of vote kicking and most of the heists being paid to be hosted.
Last, the game experiences a lot of crashing even with no any mods installed compared to other titles.
the concept of a co-op criminal bank robber simulator is excellent but unfortunately, the over-monetization of this specific game has ruined it"
2455,"I keep shooting the civilians, butterfingers i guess"
2456,"Pretty good game. Rather gruesome for my taste and takes some guts to play if you are not into... you know... mass murder and things, yet even then it's pretty fun if you have friends to play with.
Great diversity in terms of customization, and a game whose plotline allows for memes and inside jokes not to ruin or oppose the canon, which is a very smart move.
I must of course exclaim that said plotline is quite gory, as the characters themselves are bandits and hitmen, or employers of such people. Although not exactly my cup of tea, I must admit that it is a rather interesting game if you've got some friends to back you up."
2457,Thank you Overkill for teaching me how to cook meth
2458,"Its honestly a really fun game. When you start to get into it, you start to get really addicted to the progress you make. You rob banks, mansions, hell even rob a airplane full of cash lol. What I love about payday 2 is once you earn lvls or cash you can upgrade stuff like buy armor, more health, or buy literally any gun you want. Buy skins on the market just like TF2 which is also really fun to do. Even the gun viewmodels don't feel like a trashy COD shooter where your character always sits perfectly still when you move. Overall a really fun game and I would recommend anyone eles who wants to shoot up some cops xD. I mean who wouldn't wanna shoot em am I right?"
2459,Game funni
2460,"Good game, it's just a shame that you have to pay extra for 80% of the content.."
2461,"It's really fun to do some heists with friends or just some random people, but maaan, this game has so much achievements that I will never ever get :D"

2508,"PAYDAY 2 is an addicting ""cops-and-robbers""-style horde shooter. The sandbox nature of the heists and the limitless variation of your loadout gives this game almost endless replayability. Plus, the soundtrack is great and (most of) the characters are full of personality. Though the game has shown its age a bit in terms of graphics, it offers a ton of paid DLC, and the heists can take awhile to complete, the fun gameplay alone makes up for it and I highly recommend it!"

2570,"Eh, it's alright I guess"
2571,"9 years, 70 DLCs and one bankruptcy later, Payday is still [i] somehow [/i] one of the most fun co-op games you can play. It's longevity and replayability comes in no small part from its dedicated modding community, creating entirely new weapons, heists, cosmetics, and even accessibility options, and the offline functions of the game ensure a fine single-player experience too. You'll have to splash a bit of cash to access all the content, fittingly enough, but it's a surprisingly casual game to hop right into with a variety of difficulties and playstyles. You might find yourself playing Payday for more hours than one person ever should, if you don't quit due to FUCKING DIESEL ENGINE CRASHING FOR THE 5,000th TIME. 

It's alright."

2610,very good game
2611,WHY DOES THE THERMAL DRILL NEVER WORK
2612,"Ive played this game for many years across both pc and console. The game contains a wide and fun range of ""heist"" anything from sprinting through a mafia filled building, run and gunning coke heads to sneaking into a museum and slipping a diamond between your cheeks. It has a fun set of skill trees in the early game that quickly become fun to play around with different builds depending on your approach to a heist. I feel like in order to improve upon the game, to be honest the game play and progression is fun and the art style suits how the game plays. 8/10 :)"
2613,it's cool
2614,spoon
2615,"adrenalin rush every time i play


also includes hotline miami shit so i give this 1 morbillion out of 10"
2616,I can make the courier packs look like Among Us.
2617,"Very cool GIMMIE PAY DAY 3
"
2618,The Dentist is a bit sus ngl
2619,"There are two options: Commit to stealth mode, and spend 30 hours per level perfecting your route, optimizing your objectives, and memorizing the randomized aspects of the map; or go in guns blazing and kill the equivalent of the population of Uruguay in police officers. Also stealthing becomes exponentially harder with more players.

This is a very fun concept, with a long, long history of developer support (as evidenced by the 999 dlcs). The gunplay is kind of bad, and the whole thing feels, in 2022, slightly unpleasant to play mechanically. But the gameplay loop, rewards, and challenges are very engaging. I spent several nights committing HARD to the stealth strat and man, it feels so good once you finally pull it off.

8/10, the devs actually cancelled Payday 3 to support this game with more content and dlc."
2620,"Game gets better if you install DLC unlocker, tbh"
2621,game is good mods reqired to be good btw
2622,i like it
2623,i get called.... white man's whᴏre.....

2627,Amazing
2628,"vary fun to play and has mods that are really cool if you are into fps games but they are getting a bit into the realm of grind and pay this is a good game to play as the grand is almost not there and payto win is vary low only in 3 to 5 $ dlc and with mods you can just get guns that are just as good as the ones in dlc or bater so theres if you want you don't need to buy dlcs to be good at the game and with mods you can add new hists and new music cool huds the posabilatys are endless 
"
2629,"Play this game if you have friends, alone is like pain in the ♡♡♡ (overall it is a very nice game, if you have a full players team you will need to comunicate with them - a great coop game). 
When you done the career mode, make sure to install mods and custom maps for this game."
2630,Get the game on sale with the bundle and play with some friends and you will see this game is f****** great and it gets wild and can at times feel badass then there's just times it feels like a joke and its funny being the worst thieves ever. This game for sure is a 8/10. (... Guard)
2631,"i am too bad for this game, and you have to pay for all the dlc or less its no fun"

2636,"Pew Pew, run for your life, fight for your life"
2637,"Payday 2 is a bad game ok
This Game Was Good back in 2013-2015 back when i used to play it on ps3
i bought it on pc in 2021 and i didnt like it much
the game is just nothing but an endless xp grindfest for people with no life who have never touched grass
and if you look past the xp grinding of the game you will realize this game sucks
the gameplay isnt that great
its a good stealth game but thats the only good things about it
and seeing as there are much better stealth games out there and the only good way you can play this game in 2022 is with mods or hacks because this game sucks and the community is just straight up just people who are probs discord mods and reddit mods who have never touched grass that  actually wasted half of there life playing this game because the only people who i see who get mad when someone uses mods and hacks are those types of people, i have never seen new players get mad, even alot of og players dont get mad, even people who have been playing for some time who arent at max infamy arent mad, its always the no life discord/reddit mods who are always mad who are at infamy 100 and level 100 which keep in mind in order to get to infamy 100 you have to have reached level 100 a total of 100 times which if you do the math that would mean without infamy they would technically be at level 10,000 meaning those people have no life other then this game and this game used to be good back when people would actually have fun back in the 360 and ps3 days of this game when people used to just go loud on bank heist and just have fun in general but now its just annoying reddit and discord mod body people who are the real problem because you can never have fun and they will get mad at people for modding a 9 year old game that the devs probs dont care if anyone mods since you cant even get banned in payday 2 and payday 2 isnt even a competitive pvp game and most modders and people useing hacked verisons such as p3dhacks and pirate perferction either use it for all dlc or to help newer players or there friends level up or to just have fun with new gameplay mechanics such as silent assassin 99 detection rate mod or  new skins/textures or new animations or new models or improvement mods such as mods that let players count pager times using hud mods or huds mods that can display some helpful info and since payday 2 is not even a comptitive game it doesnt even make any sense for people to get mad at hackers or modders not to mention starbreeze just pulled a gta online on payday 2 cause lets be honest here payday 3 is taking as long as gta 6 at this point and at least with rockstar games and gta online they arent just pulling the plug on consoles since payday 2 on all consoles have lost support at this point and the nintendo switch verison just is an example at how much overkill really care about this game because the nintendo switch verison only lasted a year before being no longer supported and the ps4 and xbox one verisons didnt even make sense to cancel support for since the ps4 and xbox one are still played to this day in 2022 or maybe they could have even ported this game over to ps5 and xbox series x/s
also lets not forget about that one payday mobile pvp game which was ACTUALLY GOOD and could be a example at how this game series could be better with pvp modes so that it isnt just the same repetitive game and also this game is a dead game at this point because theres nothing intresting and new and new heists arent intresting im talking about like a new gamemode like a pvp gamemode with some balances and stuff beacuse this game is trash and overkill can go suck my d*ck and B*lls because of how bad this game is now in 2022"

Framing Frame is by far the most broken piece of shit level I've ever had the displeasure of playing in my entire life.
THREE. GODFORSAKEN. HOURS. TRYING TO COMPLETE THIS MISSION WITH RANDOMS ON PUBLIC.
WE FINALLY UNLOCKED THE ESCAPE.
ONLY FOR IT TO BREAK AND MAKE THE MISSION UNABLE TO BE BEATEN.
Three hours on my goddamn life, fighting tooth and nail, and all I got was a fucking hernia.
Let me make it clear, so far I love this game, it's in my top 10 of all time.
But for as long as I live until this mission gets fixed or removed, I can't recommend it."

But For Real Though. If you've ever played Left 4 Dead Or L4D2 think of payday 2 like that. Except with cops instead of zombies.

2796,"Honestly the game is really fun, making the perk lines feels great, the missions can be really cool and overall I think it's a fantastic game to play with a group of friends. Stealth and Loud missions means there is some good diversity and a lot of options for how to approach your objectives."
2797,Chains is in a pickle.
2798,"PAYDAY 2 is a great game with sometimes broken mechanics and with some friends you can have a real fun time. When you choose what you approach you want to take, the stealth approach system allowing for skilled completion of a heist with a preplanning menu and a lot of waiting. Or you could throw all that out the window and storm places like banks to the White House. I'm not even mentioning one of the best soundtracks in a game ever. If you are ever thinking about buying this game, wait until a sale comes to get the legacy collection, you will enjoy the game that much more. Also get ready to wait for a lot of drills.

8/10 would recommend"
2799,geras
2800,the most realistic bank robbery simulator i've ever played
2801,explosives deal team damage 100/10
2802,"This game is a masterpiece. From the cracked out stealth mechanics. To the guards who have cataracts and can't see me lobbing a bag of gold through the air. From weapon customisation to the vast characters available, this game is A MUST BUY. So many ways to approach a simple heist from taking out the guards and having a shootout, to crouch jumping past the managers to get to the good stuff. MASTER. PIECE"

2840,shrimp
2841,came like 7 times.
2842,"A four player coop PvE game that is a lot of fun.
Takes some time to get used to the mechanics but the more you learn the better you get.
Payday 2 has a lot of maps and guns wich offers a variety of playstiles to be possible.
Both stealth and loud have interesting mechanics and are fun.
While not every heist is perfect most are fun to do and there is no need to play the heists you do not like.
This game does not cost much, but offers a lot of fun and many hours of gameplay."
2843,"this game is fun
"
2844,"So i have been playing Payday for a long time. initially i was playing on Xbox, before i found out how amazing PC gaming was, and have downed quite a bit of time between this and that. Its really fun...with friends. Doing solo for a while i found it to be boring and repetitive. i know that that kinda depends on play-style, since there are a lot of ""lone wolves"" out there, but if your looking for a fun fps to kill lots of time with friends, Payday is your game. (also has the best and most engaging dev team behind it). 10/10 def worth a buy."
2845,It's Payday Fellas.

2855,I hate this broke dick piece of shit drill
2856,200$ worth of dlc later and i still feel useless.
2857,My game runs 90% of the time. a good game
2858,This game sucks so good.
2859,"Screw this game and its god awful stealth. no matter how careful you are or how close you are to finishing the heist, one tiny slip up costs you the whole mission and all the time you spent on it. you can only kill 4 guards per mission because of the pager system but there is always at least an extra 5 ready to call back up on you. Its horrible. The detection ranges and angles are so inconsistent, It makes it impossible to guess where you should and shouldn't be. Not only that, but this game needs at least $120 for all the content, locked behind ridiculous DLC's. I got a bundle on sale, so I didn't spend to much at all, but another whole half of the game is locked behind payment for me, Its sad."
2860,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
2861,very mucho funno

2869,you'll need about a million DLC's before you can have just a tiny bit of fun
2870,this game is great but if your not into shooting games all that much you probably don't want to play this game or if you get bored easy
2871,"solid game, just need to get rid of those two weird streamers at the safe house"

2906,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

3011,"I happened to see this ""give a review because you have this many hours"" exactly at 420 hours. May this be engrained in permanance for all time.

Also, get this fucking game. It's amazing, there's nothing else like it. Tired of shooting your way through a bunch of cops? Switch it up to some stealth stuff. Tired of stealth stuff? Go back to loud. With almost 1300 achievements, the achievement hunting seemingly never ends. There's an incredible amount of things to do in t his game."

3115,Pretty fun game. I would suggest getting some friends that know the game fairly well if you want to get into it to have an easier transition to get the systems and general advice on how to improve your gameplay over time. Still rather fun to just mess around in as well.

It's empty, and still feels rushed, even after apparent fixes and patches. Whole game just feels 'heartless' if that makes sense.

Numerous bugs, often couldn't engage dialogue because prompts wouldn't activate unless in a very particular spot. Speech between characters is often delayed and clipping/disappearing NPCs was regular.

3163,I am so scared
3164,i love blue salt
3165,HAHA SHOOT GUN MUSIC  DODODODODOODO
3166,good game
3167,Way worse than how I remember it from years ago.. This game has no realism too it whatsoever. The amount of police killed during the average heist is at least 3x the amount that any normal police force would even have on call. The police are suicidal AF and you can take bullets on top of bullets and never die because of your shield that can take 100 bullets and restores in 5 seconds.. There's no challenge.
3168,"So, I want to start by saying that the game feels kind of incomplete. Not a lot of tutorials that REALLY explain the Skill and Perk Decks, convoluted methods for starting a party, certain missions are cumbersome, LOADS of stuff is locked behind a DLC paywall, and the VR feels a little rushed. (the weapons belt mechanics are kinda clunky) BUT, I really enjoy this game's co-op. Getting into heists with friends is super fun, even if at points you're all left wandering around, wondering where the objective is. The singleplayer is okay, but the AI doesn't do much more than follow you, pick off a few enemies, and absorb bullets.

In summary; I like the game, co-op is super fun, singleplayer is passable"
3169,"Can jump right in and understand whats going on. Easy learning curve, tons of support. Great Game"
3170,"10/10 would get detected again. bains my dad,"
3171,Bad game

Payday 2 is a good game, 10/10 would rob banks IRL"
3173,god game
3174,steal shit with friends? lesgo
3175,"i got robbed by people in a clown mask and this game reminds me of them, they stole my gold fish"
3176,"Even after 9 years this game is still constantly being updated. There is honestly so much fun to have with this game, especially since Overkill is in full support of modding and loves the modding community for this game. Custom Heists, cool weapon skins, etc. This game will give you plenty to do until the next payday game arrives!"
3177,LMFAO!!! How did this become popular? Glad I only paid 99 cents!!!
3178,gustavo fring
3179,"im so inspired by payday 2, that i have decided i am going to rob a bank"
3180,"Very fun, overkill is a balanced difficulty, and as you level up and get new weapons, you can slowly increase the difficulty to a point where it's possible but provides a big challenge. I really like it!"
3181,Need medic bag
3182,"you commit mass shootings, slaughter civilians and cops alike by the hundreds, steal what does not belong to you, canonically cause the green flu pandemic from left for dead and somehow you are framed as the good guys????
also gus fring from breaking bad is a hundred year old lizard creature trying to get you to do his bidding in game
10/10 would play again"
3183,"I wanna blow my brains out. I need a medic. 
play this game"
3184,Really Great Game
3185,Beautiful Game I love murdering people and stealing shit
3186,killing police officers and swat teams is acceptable in this game!
3187,"game is just fantastic.  a lot of people have negative things to say, but they dont seem to be looking for this archtype of game.  very fun, immersive heists.  amazing replay value.  multiple versions of maps to keep things new.  fun weapons, lots of updates and interesting skills to make every heist a memorable experience"
3188,One of the best games  of all time.
3189,"Decent game, with awful optimization, plus one of the best characters, Scarface, isn't obtainable anymore. awful game, hate it. would recommend"
3190,money :)
3191,good cool game
3192,spoon powerful
3193,Best game ever
3194,"This game is some of the most fun I have ever had playing with friends, or by myself. My friend kept recommending the game to me, and eventually gifted it to me. I installed and hopped on the game, to be blasted with an insane amount of weapons, heists (Missions), cosmetics, and all around content. A lot of it is locked behind a pay wall however, but there are a few mods out there that unlock the DLC. (It kind of is pirating, but you get a ""Cheater"" tag in online lobbies.) Which brings me to the mods, which ads a whole other level of content. There are people who use mods to cheat like god mode, infinite money, etc. But there are quality of life mods that change the HUD, fix some bugs, or just fix the game aesthetically. Then there are mods that add things to the game such as weapons, cosmetics, heists, and a lot more. This game also comes with a free VR DLC. By itself, its not very fun, but as soon as you add mods, it's an amazing VR experience. All in all, I would rate it a 9/10, subtracting one point for greedy DLC, and a not very good base VR mode."
3195,It's not a game its a addiction
3196,"ah yes , the art of stealing :D"
3197,"""Ok, takže stealth je optional ???"""

3205,very cool
3206,"Awesome game, must buy if you like action/shooter games."
3207,90% of the game is locked behind pay walls and seeing as the game is NINE YEARS OLD and theres still $90 worth of paywall before you can play the full game. its clear theyre going to wait until the game is dead and the players gone before they adjust pricing.
3208,"haha funni man scream need medic bag go brrrrrrrrrrr 
and cool music"
3209,mask on
3210,A simplistic game with a deep lore to the point of confusion. with all these updates it just keeps getting better. I truly hope payday 3 stays the same. would i recommend this game... does Dallas need a medic bag?

3263,i got called a bitch by a by a guy who jumps out of  sewers for a living 10/10
3264,"So in Short: Payday 2 Is a Good Game and if you don't have it you should get it. 
And if you already got it, GET EVERY LAST DLC and Fashion-Up your little Heist-Meister for the next stroll to the ""ATM"" while following the list of Geneva Suggestions while you're at it.

Stealth: Get your nerves ready and get yourself a Beverage of your choosing. My suggestion: Get some friends together or look for people in the community that you can coordinate with.

Loud: Is... Well... Loud... 
Better get that big Gun off yours Ready. Because if the police can have Military grade armaments and equipment, So can you!


The Game supports VR. And it's not even half bad. 
I personally enjoy enjoyed it.

Have gone back to it 3 years later playing on the PC and the AI is greatly improved and they have added the ability to earn coins that allow for the buying of the all important weapon components upgrades that is the lifeblood of the game. Pleased to be back!"
3298,BRO REVIVE ME I HAVE THERMAL DRILL
3299,rob bank is very cool
3300,"If you were talking to middle/highschool me, who would religiously play this game with friends instead of doing my homework, then he would 100% recommend this game. The Soundtrack is to kill for and never gets old, the actual gunplay itself in terms of handling is pretty good, and I can't pretend that I wasn't invested in the lore and the characters, and I can't pretend that I didn't have a fun fucking time shooting cops and stealing cash.

But that was years ago. 

Every time I think ""Yknow what? ONE more time!"" I'll redownload the game and give it ONE more shot; It's just not the same, especially as I've grown and learned what I want out of my games.

- The ai to this day is just fucking abysmal, especially civilian ai when taken hostage. Everyone you encounter just feels very robotic and completely takes away from the immersion the music and ambiance is trying to sell.
- It took them YEARS to make a proper safehouse and even then it's just... okay?
- There might be like 5 maps that give genuinely good cash while the others are purely just for fun - which is fine - but once the fun is gone, or you NEED to grind exp or cash, then those 5 maps feel like a chore (I'm looking at you, meth lab)
- I stg i don't know how I never noticed this when I was younger, maybe I was just too in love with the game, but almost EVERY update felt like one step forward, one step back, SOMETIMES making genuine progress but at a snail's pace.
- When playing public yo- [PLAYER IS JOINING: Please Wait 0%...] and brings everything at a grinding halt sometimes for legitimate MINUTES regardless of hardware or internet, and for WHAT?
- Everything is just ""Hold F to do blank"" and when I tried playing again it drove me fucking crazy, as it's the most lazy way to do things. Not that it can't BE a mechanic, but it's literally EVERYTHING. There is not ONE mini-game or ANYTHING to immerse you in the game at all, it is LITERALLY just ""Hold F"". Not ONE lockpick mechanic, hacking, ANYTHING.
- Any time they had weapons or systems that were overpowered, they'd basically fuck with everything BUT the weapon, or in general tweak very convoluted things to make it work, screwing with everything.
- DLC, Where 10% might be okay or even GREAT in the meta, but 90% is just fucking rubbish in terms of stats, as if they just randomly typed stats in the chart and sent it, not knowing they'd be underpowered. And when it comes to the GOOD gear, it leaves a bad ""pay-to-win"" taste in my mouth.

And overall just to summarize: This IS a game that holds a near and dear place in my heart, but I was younger and didn't play that many games, so I didn't have a reference for what I wanted. It's the shittiest haphazard game with the most addictive gameplay loop. 

If you want a genuinely fun 4-player co-op shooter, I couldn't recommend Deep Rock Galactic more, it was everything I wanted out of PAYDAY 2 but better. If you want to give PAYDAY 2 a shot, I can't exactly stop you and hey maybe you WILL have fun like I did!
 But for ME as someone who was a diehard fan for this series, it really does just feels like a corpse that was only kept alive due to its fanbase (okay AND killer OST like goddamn) and without us, payday 2 would have never stood a chance."

3331,payday 2 to get hot babes
3332,"Alright, watch, my experience from this game has taught me that I can steal anything. So here's what your going to do, Im going to say the funny haha, and you'll give me rewards. Deal? Good you don't have an option.
""AHHHHHHH I NEED A MEDIC BAG!""
"
3333,Payday 2 is a great Co-Op game and the game is alright but the Space u need to download this game is maddens but other than that I rate this game Good and there’s lots more stuff on the pc genre of payday than the consoles
3334,"Payday 2 is everything you'd expect from a sequel and more. Though there's still some jankiness, and it's still basically just a horde shooter with a cops and robbers coat of paint, it's pretty fun and there's a lot of customization. 

The main reason I didn't recommend Payday: The Heist was due to its low player count and poor solo experience. Payday 2 still has a thriving community, and offers a much better solo experience. 

I also noted that Payday: The Heist was more expensive at $14.99 compared to Payday 2 at $9.99. But it's worth pointing out that Payday: The Heist only has 2 pieces of DLC (one of which is just a soundtrack) totaling $13.98. Payday 2, on the other hand, has 75 pieces of DLC totaling over $200. Yikes! 

The good news is that buying DLC is not required to join missions from DLC. Only the host has to have it. And if you bought the Wolfpack DLC for Payday: The Heist, you automatically receive it for Payday 2. Additionally, all DLC maps up to ""The White House"" can be played without owning them, once, in Career mode.

The base game offers hundreds of hours of gameplay. The full version further extends gameplay by adding new heists in addition to exclusive weapons and equipment. So far I've enjoyed the base game well enough.

PS: If you're wondering why Payday 2 has the most Steam followers (over 8 million, while the second most, CS:GO, has over 3 million), it's because following their official Steam group unlocks a bunch of stuff in-game.

[h1]Technical Notes:[/h1]
Fullscreen mode only runs at 60Hz by default. To change it: 
[olist]
[*]Go to the configuration files location. 

Native Linux: 
~/.local/share/Starbreeze/Payday2 

Proton:
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/218620/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/PAYDAY 2/

Windows:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PAYDAY 2\renderer_settings.xml

[*]Edit renderer_settings.xml

[*]Find ""refresh_rate="" and set it to your monitor's refresh rate.
[/olist]
The native Linux port uses OpenGL. Depending on your hardware, you may get better performance with Proton & Vulkan.

Voice chat is bugged on Linux (players can hear you, but you can't hear other players). Another reason to use Proton.

There are several [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Payday_2#Mods]mods[/url] available."

3370,"Fun game to play, loud is solid, stealth is fun. Definitely good with friends and would recommend it to others when on sale. Few problems with gameplay/design however which I like some critics of the game have.

1. Stealth rng: Ever want to do Go bank, Diamond store, Breaking Feds, or Bank Heist without sweating? Just pray then. 
In Payday 3, I hope they tone down rng that affects stealth and actually make the rng fun rather than a restart like the door on Diamond Store.
Ironically, a lot of loud only missions have little to no rng what so ever like Brooklyn 10-10 which would actually be interesting to have and add replayablity.

2. Buggy ai/pathfinding: Ever have tied civilians run straight into everyone's line of sight and raise the alarm just from trying to move them into a room? Yeah, annoying like the guard movement animation sometimes being clunky and confusing to understand where they are going. Another example is with crew ai, ever have them walk to you slowly to revive you when you are about to be in custody? I hope in Pd3 they invest more into better ai and pathfinding.

3. Pay for meta: Kinda wish more base kit weapons were viable on Death sentence without using a bunch of perks and perk decks (which most perk decks cost money).

4. Tedious heists: Some missions like Golden Grin and Alesso are very annoying to complete ranging from too many bags, or waiting forever for an objective to complete. It would be nice if more of the missions used design philosophy of some of the older missions like Shadow Raid where you can do multiple objectives at the same time or have multiple ways of doing an objective.

5. Bugs: Self explanatory, Starbreeze should've fixed many of them already.

Though there are many problems with this game, I still enjoy it as a flawed masterpiece. 
Also, make sure to not shoot Garrett on accident while doing Breaking the Feds.

3389,"This game is amazing. Just absolutely amazing. The fun yet challenging difficulties are amazing. There's just something so rage-inducing yet also dopamine inducing about getting curb-stomped by a Cloaker or getting your body ripped apart by a Bulldozer, or even getting shocked by a Taser while a Cloaker runs up to you and a Bulldozer starts firing with their LMG. The guns are extremely fun aswell, you're able to customise them to no end. And the characters have fascinating backstories, even if it's just Jacket from Hotline Miami or even John Wick. Not only that, but the MASKS. THE GOD DAMN MASKS. Where do I even start? There are so many of them even if you don't download DLC (Downloadable Content.) They're extremely fun to unlock, not to mention the extremely cool designs. Even after that, if you don't like the regular look of a mask you can customise it to your own style with different materials, patterns and colours. Overall, bloody amazing. The DLC (Downloadable Content) Isn't a problem either, because it's basically one of the only ways to fund the development of Payday 3. So, sorry for writing an essay about this game, but I love it and seriously recommend it."

Oh you wanted to go for a full loot run on Shadow Raid? Oh yeah, the bag deleted itself or fell through the floor, good bye 30 minutes.

Better, DSOD hoxton breakout? Well what if 20 minutes into the heist the game just crashes. No money, no xp. Rip me."

3416,good game
3417,"this is actually awesome.
upps are: cool gameplay, alot of combos of weapons, alot of weapons in general, dumb (in a good way), multiplayer, customization is cool, and kinda funny.
downs are: grind, alot of dlcs for weapons heists etc. i dont see dlcs as a problem but i cant also call it a good thing. basically all.
for me all upps are more than enough to cover the downs, you can call it pay2win, and you will technically be right. HOWEVER. remember that this game is PVE so it doesnt give you advantage over other players. i guess you can flex the dlc weapons? idk, i cant also say that hackers in this game are a problem but i also cant say that they arent. its 50/50 cuz on the good side this game is indeed PVE so its basically good for the team. but on the bad side. it ruins the fun. so think of what you will. i still think that this game is fucking awesome, you atleast need to try it out for the badass music. its absolutelly awesome.

The characters actually feel like people and their different personalities are very cool. There is a ton of customization, whether that be modding guns, making your own build, or trying out masks. The game has so much content and I would recommend it to people who like shooters."

3447,"Insane amount of content for such as cheap price (especially when it goes on sale). There are countless weapons, perks decks, skills, customisation as well as missions which all can be played on 7 different difficulties. Insane value from this purchase, would 100% recommend to  anyone."

3473,"One of my most favorite exciting games to play in VR and has tons of replayability. Cant wait for payday 3 to come out in 2023, I just hope they have VR support on release although they probably wont like most games so I'll just have to wait hopefully not too long after release. Hopefully it will be a more open world like GTA with the focus on robberies and such."

3526,"Great co-op heist game and definitely fun with friends, especially as the base game can be very cheap to get  - but with a terrible DLC model that forces you to essentially rebuy the game every few months if you want the latest gear. If you never intend to play on public lobbies, consider having you and your friends install a DLC unlock tool and the mod that hides the ""Cheater"" flag from the UI. (If you play with DLC content you don't own, the game marks you as a cheater - the same as if you played with a full-on cheat tool, which in most cases will block you from playing on public lobbies)"

3556,"Really fun, interesting and has a lot of weapons. Their is a lot of DLCs but they're pretty cheap to buy, but there is a LOT to learn if your new."
3557,"How to start hating yourself and commit haraki.
Insane grind, co-op Is shit, loud Is basicly Imposible on overkill, stealth Is boring, shit ton of dlc weapons that are good compared to base game weapons, story Is Imposible to understand, wasting your hard earned In game cash on a random silencer, murdering almost the double DC national guard and SWAT force makes no sense.

I started hating myself becaus how ridiculos everything Is In payday2. 

Only good things are the soundtrack and random crossovers like: GOAT simultor heist, left4dead heist, hotline miami heist and having A list actors like Ron Perlman, Keanu Reeves and AND Giancarlo Esposito also known as Gus Fring from Breaking Bad. 

I highly recommend this review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNP6K4aWg8M&ab_channel=BlackYoshi

It goes more In depth about the absurd things In this heister simulator.

Base game maps are good. 
Dont forget the mini central hub.

3573,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

[h1] Review [/h1]
[b] Summary - [/b] Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Overkill Software and published by 505 Games. The game is a sequel to 2011's Payday: The Heist. Two years after the events of the previous game, the Payday gang comes to the Washington metropolitan area to perform another heisting spree. The player can participate in a variety of heists, including but not limited to robberies of banks, shops and armored cars, and producing and distributing narcotics. The game differs from the previous by allowing much more customization of the player (aesthetically and gameplay-wise), somewhat improved graphical interface and experience, more variety and playability in levels, and has reworked stealth mechanics.

[b] Gameplay - [/b] Payday 2 has really addictive gameplay (you are warned). You have a ton of content in this game and the progression is really well put together from what I have seen so far. You can make different builds and do so many different kinds of heist in this game. You have a loud and stealth option for most of the heist, although I will say the stealth ones are pretty hard to do if you are not good at stealth (like me). The gunplay is really good and snappy so no complaints there. I will say that if you want the full experience and everything in the game, it will cost you a good bit of money to get all the DLC’s. I don’t have a ton of hours yet, but I can see myself putting over 100+ hours easily in this game so you will get your money’s worth, especially with friends. I feel like even with 40+ hours on this game, I haven’t even touched the surface in this game. After every heist, you get a card that grants you either a weapon attachment, mask, weapon skin, ect. I really do like the progression system in this game, and it gets me coming back to do another heist. So in terms of replayability, you will have no issues with that.

[b] Difficulty - [/b] The game is really challenging, for good or bad that’s up for you to decide. Personally I like the challenge. The harder the difficulty, you meet different enemies that can make your heist more like a torture session than anything. Stealth is really hard in this game, but then again that could just be me being really terrible in stealth. The harder the difficulty, the more money and xp you get so it’s a fair trade.

[b] Multiplayer - [/b] The way this game shines is multiplayer without a doubt. I met some really cool people here and had a blast. I never met a rude player (well for now) yet, but I’m sure there are a good bit of toxic players out there in Payday 2, just like in any game. I will say that I only play with friends so I never joined a random match yet, which will probably be the moment I get kicked. Besides that, the multiplayer is amazing and the game is super popular and shows no signs of slowing down. 

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Amazing heist
	[*] Great replayability 
	[*] Lot’s of weapons and customization
	[*] Tons of content
	[*] Huge player base/community
	[*] Character builds and playstyles
[/list]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
	[*] Bloated with DLC (wait for sale)
	[*] Difficulty can be a hit or miss for some
	[*] AI companions can be a liability at times

This game culd be described as following: You start the game learn concepts of it and then start to play higher and higher difficulties --> NORMAL: its easy --> HARD: Still easy --> VERY HARD: Still easy --> OVERKILL: easy --> MAYHEM: easy --> DEATH WISH: easy --> DEATH SENTENCE> WTF?!! Why are the five green Bulldozers up my ass?!, ah and how could i forget, you will probably meet lot of people that cant read or didnt grasp the mechanics of basic logic (Rogue players) and im impressed that they know how to breathe.

3685,"If you got this game for like $2 during a Steam Sale get ready because to unlock the meta weapons you'll probably spend more money buying the DLCs, you can still play the game perfectly fine tho but it's maybe gonna be slower to get modifications for guns?

As a bit of an example of glitches that can happen, My friends and I were doing really well on a stealth mission when a guard all the way on the other side of the map nowhere near any of us or any bodies or suspicious objects tripped the alarm and made us fail."

3771,"I write this review having last played this many moons ago and many DLC ago it seems, so take what I have to say with a healthy pinch of scepticism. 

The game is a fun shooter experience, adding the dynamic of robbing various places and racing towards the exit area/van/gettothechoppa! You get to customise your character, weapons and loadout for each match which is cool and then selecting your missions based on difficulty and payout as they appear on the map. I played this game with my bros and we had a laugh trying to hold back the waves of never-ending police units, watching each other fumble to get the money to our van and trying to save each other when the gunfire was heaviest and casualties were had.....which roughly translated to in most cases running away whilst your squaddie gets tasered to the ground! We had fun playing this game but it soon became apparent that missions were being recycled quite frequently, the challenge aspect was getting too manageable and soon the appeal to select the same mission with the same goals and the same payout was too stale and we dipped out of this game. Now, as I said before this game has had plenty of DLC added so you will probably take a much longer time to reach this point, and one day I may even dust off the old mask and re-enter the chaos, but I still recommend this game as it can be a chaotic ton of fun at times and definitely worth looking into."
3772,For 9 Years I'm play this game it is pretty good and good but for now I think it too boring now and I'm waiting for Payday 3.
3773,ok
3774,"It's a good game. Very replayable and generally dumb fun. Each difficulty has its own fun and frustrating side, each heist has a unique approach that you are required to discorver, usually by trial and error. Gameplay is very easy to learn and adapt to, and you don't need a lot of time before being able to fully commit to harder difficulty.
It's great for unwinding with some friends and honestly, as toxic as some of the community is - the majority isn't. People complain about it a lot, but I'd disagree. A few bad apples don't spoil the bunch in PD2's case. 
The DLC's are good. The heists are fun and the cosmetics slap. I do find H3H3's inclusion incredibly unnecessary and just plain stupid though, absolutely pointless.
But other than that - great game. 
Go play it. It's worth your money."

3781,"Haven't played a lot because of the community. Super toxic towards new players that want to learn the game and barely anyone playing on lower difficulty modes. Maybe it's fun with friends but that shouldn't even be a concern if the core community is just super disgusting.

It's been 9 years since release and we still get DLC which includes cosmetics, heists and some YouTuber self insert circlejerk. Updates are sparse and usually just show off newly released DLC. I remember that there was some kind of edition that you could buy with like all the old DLCs included but that doesn't seem to be there anymore, so yeah...

It's literally Payday if you whale on the DLC."

3858,"This game saved my life.

I am 200.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 40 years old!

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read NONE of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 40 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

3893,"Payday 2 is a good game, dont get me wrong, but so many qualities that just ruin it for me.
I had fun with public lobbies, and the friends you make along the way trying to figure out how to do a stealth run.
I had fun getting fucked by cloakers every 5 seconds, reviving my allies while being showered by bullets.
The game is fun, especially if you have friends to play with.
BUT THE DLC just kills the game.
Half of the contenct is locked behind a paywall, you can get into heists dlc heists if you join someones game sure, but i said content, that means not just heists...
90% of the guns are locked, All you're left with is just garbage weapons you're never going to use except the only 10 useful guns that dont kill your build.
Speaking of builds, you cant really have any of the fun builds either, the card decks that give the best bonuses are locked away.
And i think the infamy system is both my least favorite feature of the game, it promotes replay value, for some masks...
I stopped playing when most of the playerbase left is either a russian hacker, or infamy 50 players sweats who insta ban you for daring to join their game.
Also, the grind for levels can sometimes be so exhausting, the closer you get to level 100 the more every failure kills your motivation, and then you throw it away for a goddamn mask and repeat the diamons store farm once again!
It's a good game, prob would've had a better experience if i didnt try to cheat the game and skip a few levels and reset because of my guilt, but it doesnt take away the clear issues of the game"
3894,"The best guide for bag throwing simulator
1. Press F on door
2. Wait for drill to break
3. Hold F on drill
4. Wait for drill to finish/break again
5. Repeat 1-4 for a bit
6. Bag up loot
7. Throw bags
8. Get all the bags secured 20 min later

3941,"This game is great, my favorite game, this game is like winning the lottery except you don't get real money but it is still nice to go to the safe house and look at all the money you've stolen, soundtrack is an absolute banger and a half, especially ""I Will Give You My All 2017"". There are still some bugs here and there but for me they don't happen all that often so it's whatever. Thank you OVERKILL for making such a good game and I can't wait to see PAYDAY 3 in the future."
3942,"It's very fun. The ragdoll corpses are hilarious, the heists are well-made (Except for Goat Simulator) and the gameplay loop is fun and engaging.
















Also, ""AHHHHHH! I NEED A MEDIC BAG!"""
3943,"Honestly my friend bought this game for me and we play it often. Going in blind with the notion that it was a heist related co-op game I didn't think I would like it. My first experiences in game were quite difficult as not only does the game have a lot of things you need to learn; like perks and skills, but it also has quite a few difficulty settings which affect game-play quite a bit. However you learn by playing quite quickly and once you start to know what's needed you start to adjust for the things you're not so good at via skills or perks. I would highly recommend this game. As even the bugs are enjoyable; most of the time.. it also loves it's community."

3962,"I really liked the game. Even some DLCs prolong the life of the game, although some DLCs are still bad, I like everything in this game: characters, a variety of weapons (and in fact there are a lot of weapons there), mechanics, preparation for a robbery (you can choose your approach), contracts, but the plot is still sad. In this game, you can have fun on many contracts. The AI of the NPC is implemented well here, as well as the first part. But the main question is whether there will be a sequel................."

3992,Very good.
3993,Sure
3994,very cool game i like it
3995,"A genuinely great game with even better soundtrack bundled with it. I've only been playing it off and on for about a year, and I can say that its an amazing game for when I'm too bored to really decide what to do and need something to kick-start my night (though I usually just then end up playing it all night). The game also has a pretty nice modding scene, just don't expect it to go all-out like Skyrim's modding scene. You can replace a bunch of random neat stuff ranging from your HUD to some paintings to a shark that appears exclusively in one heist. With all of this good stuff being said, there is the drawback that this game is a massive DLC-fest. For that reason, as much as I'd love to encourage people to buy this game, I can only recommend waiting for a sale. The base game's price drops to 0.99 USD, and you can snag the Legacy Collection for 10 USD (USUALLY), and that'll give you PLENTY of content to gun your way through."

4025,medic bag plz...
4026,It is surprisingly easy to get weapon skins
4027,"good game if you like robbing banks,cooking drugs like meth, comitting war crimes, torturing heavy swat members, killing civillians, ETC.."
4028,just a great game in general
4029,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4030,"It's simply amazing, get guns, eliminate the cops, get money for even more guns, rinse and repeat. It's such a simple premise, yet so expertly executed that it can't be matched."
4031,"i have played cook off around 300 times and its still not boring 

10/10"
4032,nifty
4033,haha mods go brrrr
4034,just an amazing game
4035,"yy
"
4036,very pog also the mods u can have realy help the game play if i could i would rate it 999999/10
4037,"Story: Good in the beginning but went into a ""What even is this? I drill a safe to get a treasure box with kirby in it and then I put the kirby in a microwave and when kirby explodes ghost thing invade whitehouse and stuff happens lmao.""

Graphics: Could be better but pretty good. 

Music: Literally put the soundtrack to random and the song will always be good.

Replayability: Endless because the RNG gods just go ""Whatever you're doing transport train heist why don't we make the turret shoot the player? (won't actually happen but yeah, replayability is endless)""

Difficulty (I'm a DSOD player): It is a good challenge but once you get used to how to beat DSOD easy it isn't a challenge anymore.

Customization Options: A lot for masks, guns, even heists with preplanning and assets so pretty good job so far :D

DLC: Most DLCs are worth it (especially the heists) but for the DLC weapons? No just wait for a sale on those boomer and there is free to play options. Plus you don't even have to own the Heist DLC to play it, you can just wait for someone who owns it to pop up on Crime Net and you can play it.

Bugs: A lot but most of them are harmless to gameplay and can be pretty funny like a dead cop clipping through a wall XD

Community: Literally just the Dead by Daylight community (very toxic) but a bit better?

Should you buy the game full price?: Pretty worth the ten dollars but on stuff like the Steam Summer Sale it can go to 99 cents.

Gameplay: Pretty fun in both stealth and loud unless you are playing a pub stealth, then that is when you rage and want to throw your monitor out of your window.

Content Creators: Pretty funny sometimes and actually deliver news about the game instead of going ""HeY gUyS, tOdAy We ArE gOinG tO dO a PAYCHECK 2 lEt'S pLaY sErIeS"" when all they do is play one game on very hard difficulty and go ""ThAnK yOu FoR wAtChInG"" with their cringe outro music.

Developers: Pretty good and come out with content every 3 months except for when they went all ""We are not adding micro transactions"" and then they added safes that you need to buy a drill to open a safe just to get a weapon skin.

Overall Review: 8.5/10 because of the story being kinda cringe and the micro transactions that one year :/"

4055,payday is 2 days away but i need to buy more video games so ima rob a bank. 10/10 would rob again
4056,'
4057,Great game worth checking it out.
4058,"Probably a good game, good buy. Yeah."
4059,"Payday 2 is probably one of my top ten favorite games of all time, but that does not mean it does not have its flaws. Payday 2 has a very very repetitive, yet consistently satisfying gameplay loop. You always have something to work for, whether that be infamy, challenges, achievements, etc. There is an extensive set of weapons to choose from. All the way from your bare fists to a rocket launcher to a crossbow to a gun that fucking shoots money(unfortunately only as an event weapon). There are a near endless amount of builds you can create and nearly all of them are fun to play and experiment with. All of this wouldn't mean anything if the gameplay itself was bad. Luckily, the gameplay is amazing too. The gunplay is surprisingly smooth and responsive. However, it was built on the Diesel Engine, which limits quite a bit but they still somehow made it work this well. The driving is pretty terrible which is ironic considering the game was literally built on a racing game engine. There are unfortunately a fuck-load of DLC's. None of them are required to have hours and hours of fun, but they can get pretty pricey if you buy multiple. However, by themselves, they are quite cheap and almost always worth getting. I recommend checking the reviews of the DLC before getting them as they can be hit or miss. The modding can also be hit or miss depending on your view of it. Most of the mods you'll see are just texture or HUD mods. However there are plenty of cheats for Payday and it can ruin the experience for you if you want to do things legit. Luckily there is a way you can tell if someone is using mods in-game, so you can kick them or choose not to join their lobby.

Overall, I highly recommend this game and do not see myself quitting any time soon. It is well worth the price."

4082,Good if you got DLC lol
4083,"If you're just looking for casual fun robbing banks and stealing nuclear warheads, this is the game for you. But I will bring up a topic that a lot of new players may not completely realize on their first time booting up the game: the things you think are good, probably suck. The miniguns for the most part fall off in higher difficulties and the heaviest armor in the game will be 1-shot by most trash mobs. What seems fun at lower difficulties will only be a hindrance once you want to bump the challenge up, and the difficulty curve in both stealth and loud is quite a jolt. Most things that seem fun or powerful, like dodge builds, are regarded as noob traps and you'll find yourself relegated to approximately the same 5 builds by the time you reach maximum difficulty. If you aren't concerned with higher difficulties and can manage to ignore the bleating from the DSOD community, then I welcome you to Payday 2, heister."

My friend accidentally fires gun; panic ensues. We rush to tie up people outside the store; we were too late. 10/10 would get gunned down right before we succeed
4146,yes
4147,it's a great game

4151,"This game is the greatest game of all time, especially with friends. Endless fun, endless mods, endless heists. I have over 150hrs played right now and I still haven't played all the heists yet. This game is also really cheap when its on sale, It's $1 when that summer and winter sale comes. Like come on bruh who don't got a dollar."
4152,"I think payday 2 is good even without the dlc and like you rob banks, diamond stores, and much more. Its replay value is a lot and there infamy so each time you reset you level up more and more. I like the difficulty of each heist and the dlc is a fresh addiction of the game and its community is amazing. Only problem is you are locked to fullscreen and the snipers are annoying at times but 9.7/10"
4153,"aaaaaaaaa

4166,Game is not bad but heists in gta online are better
4167,tons of fun at 5 bucks
4168,Overkill is doing a fantastic job! Really milking this game for what little it's worth now.
4169,"Only in this game you can be alcoholic while your friend can stab himself with injector or smell funny stuff from glass ampule while the last one is hitting vape with you. 
Very realistic game
12/10 would inject again."
4170,"i feel sad=die on fall damage,its bugged its want to make me cry and commit suicide what a good game right? 
(not anymore)"
4171,Love the game play. Just wish once you won a custom skin you automatically got it in your inventory.
4172,"Payday is a very grindy game, but that's a huge reason i love it. There's a whole diverse cast of characters, guns, heists, skills, and styles to mix up your gameplay which makes every mission unique. Not to mention that every time you load up the same heist, the objective locations, materials, and loot are randomized to give a fresh feel to every location."

4179,"uzmes pare i bjezis, ko karina"
4180,"kinda goofy besides the funny cloaker guy, still well polished"
4181,"I don't have much to say about PayDay 2 especially because I joined pretty late of its release but I see why it was so popular and controversial back then and can't say it didn't deserve its popularity.
I really like the characters,the amazing music,how you can approach missions from the brainless shoot everyone to the more tactic and rewarding stealth or how nutty some missions are [spoiler]like where you have to steal f*cking nukes[/spoiler] but [b]in my opinion[/b] it loses quite a bit without a friend or someone that knows a lot of the game because it takes a lot of time to understand it and perfectionate equip or strategy which is good aswell.Another problem is that it sort of become repetitive and boring quiet fast,this is why I try to play stealth which makes the mission more various and tedious instead of a shoot-shoot-shoot-everyone every mission but the ones I play with prefer that and for me it becomes repetitive fast,the only salvations are the laugh that I can have with my mates to break that mood.

[b]PROS:[/b]
[list]
[*] Awesome music;
[*] LOT of stuff to obtain...;
[*] Charismatic characters;
[*] Fun combat;
[*] Playable with other 4 players;
[*] Stealth gives different options to approach the mission...;
[*] Satisfying arsenal;
[*] LOT of customization...;
[*] Many missions to play...;
[*] Actual narrative that you can follow;
[*] Compatible with Steam Workshop...
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b]
[list]
[*] Grind can be very long and tedious even just for one item\gun;
[*] ...but lot of the better stuff is behind a paywall;
[*] Some missions are only available daily;
[*] Mechanics aren't explained that much creating lot of confusion through the menus;
[*] Random players in multiplayer have the easy ""kickvote"",one mistake or not fast enough and you are out;
[*] ...but there isn't enough incentive to go stealth or to have fun with it;
[*] Some civilians that could randomly witness something when you less expect it or pop out from nowhere;
[*] ...but,again,lot of the customization is behind DLCs or paywalls;
[*] ...but missions don't differentiate that much from each to each most of the times;
[*] Weird choice for John Wich voice actor;
[*] ...but you can only get skins from the Workshop.

I'll give this game a [b]7.9\10[/b],I am so curious to see how they can improve from this to PayDay 2 hoping that they actually improve it and don't release a crap,broken,heavily monetized and unfinished game."
4182,"really not a bad game. fun, fast paced, cool references EVERYWHERE and it has a collab with hotline miami?? buy it."
4183,I very much enjoy. Soon as you get your head around how it works. It's a blast. Mods then open this can of worms even larger
4184,"Clowns robbing banks with boxing gloves, spoons and playing cards that can somehow kill."

It may not be for everyone this game gets as low as $1 during sales so at least worth trying out (overkill pls make the starting weapons slightly better so its easier to introduce people to the game)"

4211,y
4212,pp
4213,"I never expected this game to fall under the genre of ""horde shooter"" but it does. Getting into the higher difficulties you'll fight small town's worth of police officers. The amount of content that is locked behind DLC is kinda lame, but the game and DLCs go on sale a lot - I would highly recommend the Legacy Collection which gives you all DLC from 2018 and before. The game can be intimidating, and veterans are not exactly helpful to new players, but give it a chance and it'll be some of the most fun (and legal) cop killing you'll ever experience."
4214,"This game is coded by a 5 year old. you basically need mods to play the game and half the dlc you can get or that you get in a bundle, you can't use because they lost the licensing. Also the game is just copy and paste with a little changes."

4227,"I haven't played the first game so I can't say the game has improved, but from some gameplay I saw, the game did get kinda better. The first thing I want to start with is the community, it is really small but is actually helpful and cool. Second, you have a lot of builds in the game you can play with like dodge, tank, etc... and they all revolve around a healing perk so you can say that you really don't have much freedom in picking which build you are gonna play but that is for you to decide. You can put mods in the game too so i guess you can put hentai robots or something idc. Now the bad part about the game for me at least is the content that is locked behind a paywall, I mean it would be ok if the missions weren't connected to the main story and a secret ending, and that is pretty much the only problem I have with the game so yea I recommend you to have more than 10 euros to spend on the game"
4228,"play with friends, not randoms
unless you wanna get yelled at for the most minor mistakes"
4229,
4230,this game can be tedious at times but its for good reason although it may be infuriating this game is a great one and i totally reccomend checking it out

4242,Very Fun game. Got it on sale for 0.99 cents probably the best game purchase I made in a while. Get it it's worth on sale or full price

4252,"i dont know i took shit
"
4253,heist game go brrrr
4254,"maybe I didn't play this game for too long and maybe i'll get some hates from this game's tryhards but for the FIRST TIME in my life I feel like a PC game feels more like a mobile game.. here is why

Microtransactions:
I understand that most modern games have this feature and they're kind of overusing it but payday 2 went with it to a whole new level, they LITERALLY went beyond the limit with these stupid microtransactions I mean 80% percent of the content is just DLCS that you have to buy 
Gameplay:
1-Stealth: stealth is just broken in this game sometimes when you kill a guard ( silently of course ) you hear sirens and stuff
even though there are no cameras nor other guards.. nothing it's just you and him, I couldn't even get past the tutorial because of this or even any stealth mission
2-The Animations: I was surprised when I was saw how bad were the animations this is what made me actually doubt if it was a mobile game ported to pc ( apart from the microtransactions ) I can't really describe how the anims look like but I'd recommend playing any 2-star mobile game on playstore if you really wanna see it
3-Graphics: for a game that is being frequently updated and worked on by its dev team the graphics aren't that good it's just below average. I guess the devs are just working on more dlcs to cash grab their players

Speaking of players why the heck do people play this piece of sh-- and how in the hell can you bear these microtransactions and the limitation of content, best thing I would do right now is delete this game but i'll keep playing it for a while more just to make sure i wasn't wrong about something"

4267,"Good game/10
you don't need a n.a.s.a. computer
soundtrack is bop
stealth that makes you shid yourself
loud heists that have intense gunfights
characters good also"
4268,This game holds up extremely well and is one of the most fun games iv'e ever played. The heists are fun on any difficulty and are great with friends. This game really does well with 2 or more players as in single player you're just playing with CPU. Would recommend if you're looking for a heist game. 9.5/10
4269,this is one of if not my favourite game of all time the music is fire and they mastered the stealth and i like the wide variety of guns

It's a serious emotional roller coaster, and you 100% need to be in the mood to play. Forcing yourself to play when you're angry will make you rage quit in less than 10 minutes."

4306,"Payday 2 is the sequel to Payday, the four player (or 1 player / 3 bot) heist series. 

Worth getting when it and its dlc content is on sale. 

Gets somewhat repetitive but over all a fun game with lots of customization possibilities from your character(s) to their equipment and perks. 

Plenty of ways to modify your characters appearance and an ever expanding catalog of missions added with the new content that comes out quite frequently. 

Like i said, Absolutely worth picking up all of it, when it is on sale."
4307,This game plays like a movie with poor pacing. The 'waiting for the drill' part is usually fast forwarded through.

Skill trees and perk decks allow you to shape a unique playstyle, while being reconfigurable infinite times means you don't have to pick one style at the start and create a new character from the ground up should you wish to try a new playstyle. Gunplay isn't exactly a substitute for joining the army, but it's a strong integral part of an overall thouroughly enjoyable 9 year old game that still holds up against modern titles in terms of enjoyment. Polar opposite of the League of Legends community."

4386,"This game is great fun and occasionally funny, perfect for you if you like spraying bullets and blowing up everything or just sneaking around with your newly adopted ninja skills. The devs are very up to date with the community and listen well.

DLC and mods recommended if you can get them."

4391,good game
4392,its pretty damn fun to waste time in payday and playing with friends will always be a blast
4393,"As a game about a gang of criminals trying to make bank while evading the clutches of the law, [i] PAYDAY 2 [/i] succeeds with delivering such a premise with a diverse selection of heists, and a variety of gameplay ranging from fast-paced, high intensity run-and-gun missions, to strategy-involving, puzzle solving stealth missions.

I personally had a great experience with [i] PAYDAY 2 [/i], whether it was by myself or with friends, there is always something to keep any heister on their toes, looking for their next, new and exciting objective.

[i] PAYDAY 2 [/i] doesn't come without some performance issues due to some of the incompatibilities of its engine. However, if your computer doesn't run like a potato, or you're willing to sacrifice a large margin of your in-game graphics quality, these issues will be few and far between.

The game itself is simply great, especially if you want to play with friends and fight alongside each other against an endless wave of law enforcement officers in high-stakes PvE missions. I would definitely recommend buying the $10 base game, as there is still something for every heister even without buying any DLC content."
4394,"Loud is so fun when you get good at it, obviously... Nonetheless this game is amazing, it is challenging but easy to get into the hang of things."
4395,"it's a good game, you get to whack people with a golden spoon, rob banks, other criminal stuff, I would recommend getting Payday 2."
4396,"you see, you know a game is good when ur goin around bonking ppl with a huge ass spoon"
4397,"i slapped a cop with a giant golden spoon


10/10 would reccomend"
4398,"I see that the developers are trying to add more content and to attract more players but this game is very repetitive. The point of this game is that you rob banks or houses and you have to choose how to do it either stealth or not. You get money after every completed heist and you can buy some cheap skins, abilities and weapons. It was fun playing with my mates but if you play this game alone you will fall asleep as i did many times. I see that the game is cheaper now but i would still not recommend buying this game at full price. I hope Payday 3 will be filled with more content and diverse missions."
4399,I simp for Sydney
4400,Its fun alone or with fwends. I love men!
4401,Luv this game
4402,So fucking good. Even more fun with friends. I don't need to tell you why it's good just look at all the positive feedback this game has garnered over the years.

4414,"This game used to be fun and great. 

Trying to play it in 2022, it's just not working. 
The game won't launch anymore and asking for help you are just pointed towards guides about restoring save files.
I don't even care about the old save from many years ago, the game simply wont load now without it.

To solve it, you either have to go through a user written guide or mod the game just to get it going.. 

Naa,  not anymore..  Either it works, or it's not recommended."

There are few games that have as many likeable characters as this game. The Heisting fantasy you could only dream of, and this game makes this possible. I hope Payday 3 deliveres upon the promises Overkill gives us."

4484,"Payday is a good idea. The execution would also be ok, I personally absolutely do not like the engine. The gunplay seems very arcadey. And what bothers me most are the number of enemies.

This game with fewer enemies or special units which are more tactical and deadly, would be more what would suit me. So it is a pointless bodycount shooter.

There would be so much cool stuff possible with this game, unfortunately it's also a DLC hell."

9.2/10 would highly reccomend"
4505,Never get old. Shout out to everyone I met in PD2 for creating all the good journeys and memories together. Much love for the dev for still making new maps every few months. Can't wait for PD3.
4506,great
4507,
4508,So during sale I got this game for $1. To be honest I wouldn't pay anymore than that for it. Its rather repetitive but it has some glorious masks and the comically large spoon which make it worth playing for a couple hours every now and then.
4509,gud
4510,very gut
4511,if you like left for dead 2 you will like this its very fun and has loads of maps get the legacy edition tho base game is small legacy edition adds best dlc
4512,"If you like horde mode games, this is a very satisfying one. Variety in enemies, plenty to fight, and adjustable difficulty so you can just have fun mowing enemies down or give yourself a serious challenge as you play the meta. It also has stealth in it, and it's actually done well. Nothing game changing, but also fun and with it's own set of challenges. 
And the DLC aren't ridiculously priced. Even if you don't get them, while you won't have access to the weapons and can't host the different heists, you can still join on players who are. So don't feel like you have to buy it to play the heists, but I'd still say it's worth if for the variety of weapons and such you can get, as well as being able to host and play those maps whenever you want.
Final thing, you are not required to always be online or play with others. There's AI companions and a single player you can play. And while the AI companions aren't the smartest, they are at least great meat sponges that can revive you if anything happens. And with strong weapons, they can kill and hold a room by themselves. So they are useful."
4513,Probably the most replayable game ever made.

4524,"Totally worth the $2 I spent on it (wait for summer sale). Gunplay is well done, graphics are good, and player customization is my favorite part. My only gripe is that for the most part missions are very repetitive. You go into the building, kill the guards, place the drill, wait for cops, repair the drill, and hold off the cops until the drill opens the vault. Then you grab bags of money and walk to the getaway vehicle and it's over."

4533,"I will gladly say that this is an enormous improvement over its predecessor!  The amount of of missions and customization this game offers (as of the current version) gives you so much bang for your buck!  I will admit this game will whip your butt around on single player (single player being a feature I will always praise its inclusion), but with your friends, you can overcome any challenge.  The biggest downside is that some of the DLC is no longer available for purchase, making some assets unusable.  While that is a noticable downside, it does no stop me from highly recommending this game!"

4573,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

As you play more, the sameyness becomes very apparent. Playing with friends and the rather in-depth build crafting helps remedy this problem a little but that stuff only goes so far. Also, there is way too much DLC. However, I would still recommend it because you can get a good bit of fun for the price that you pay."

4627,Payday Is a really fun game and I enjoy it a lot but after a whole it gets boring. Its one of those games you will spend a while playing and then taking a longer break. Overall I do suggest getting this game
4628,It's one of my favourite games! I'm looking forward to «Payday 3».
4629,If only the game was good at release. I don't have any idea how it is now. Purchased for $$$ back in 2015-2018. Everything that was promised wasn't there. It is now. Think No Mans Sky without the good parts.

4659,"Amazing game for a cheap price, don't let the dlc scare you away. there's plenty of content to do without it, and even then if you're wanting to do dlc heists you can join other players who own it to play those. Just a great game to make the perfect build, just waste a few hours playing, co-op with friends, and just overall a good time. I'd rate it a 9/10"
4660,very nutty
4661,Add fortnite sex?
4662,no one cared who i was until i put the mask on and pull a miningun out of no where
4663,this is literally the best game ever created. if you havent played this game you arent enlightened such as I. when im playing i reach a state which can only be described as pure euphoria.

4664,"Probably one of the greatest cooperative shooters ever made. Hundreds of fully customizable weapons ranging from pretty standard assault rifles and pistols to quad rocket launchers and massively over-sized solid gold spoons that ignite enemies on hit. An absolute insane amount of build diversity and a frankly amazing set of almost 80 missions that allow you to approach the objectives in either stealth, or loud and frantic combat, adapting the objectives to suit your chosen approach, and randomizing elements of each mission to ensure you don't know exactly what you're doing even if you've done it dozens of times before. This game has something to offer pretty much anyone, and the fact that it balances it all as well as it does is insane."

4707,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.

At first I had no clue what I was doing. This game definitely isn't the one you can start playing and slowly progress without failing multiple times. My first review on this game (the review is now deleted) was negative because I couldn't do anything in stealth mode and going in loud is just boring and packed with chaos. But ever since I've started playing with my friend who knows much more than I do about this game, I've kind of enjoyed my time and I'm sure, the more I play this game, the more I will like it. Just have to trust the process, you know?"

While there is some suggestive content, and also drug references, no child under the age of 8 will get it, and it will fly right over their heads. However, I still think that it would be best if the game was left for teenagers. This game is really fun, and if you have a teenager who likes shooters, I would recommend you buy it for them. (also, the music is f**king amazing in the game, this has nothing to do with the game, but whatever)."

4756,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character, and started playing, but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
4757,"I've spent so much time messing around with randos online in a way that really brings me back to the early days of multiplayer games. This game just has such a fun, careless aura that it makes it so refreshing.

That being said... you almost can't play the game with just the base game. I was lucky enough to get this as a bundle sale with 80$ of DLC for only $20, and I think that's almost the only way anyone can get into the game.

Wait until it's on sale and buy the Legacy Collection, that will ensure you have a majority of the content for decently cheap."

4767,"Lobbies with 1, 2, 3 or 4 players. Play alone, play with people. That simple option some games have issue with (cough Warface). Stealth or loud missions, endless customization for you freaks out there. Mad skills and satisfactory gameplay get rewarded with a great array of weaponry.

Some you buy, but you don't play against anyone and there is no pay 2 win. You only purchase weaponpacks, because you like the weapon, not because it gives you an advantage."

4845,"man i love payday 2 so much, you may look at this review and think, ""how could he love payday 2 so much with only 4.9 hours in the game"". my simple answer is that it takes even less than that to appreciate the true splendor this game brings. payday 2 is the culmination of such elaborate and purposeful design, providing a product and experience unlike any other. the tags of the game, ""co-op, action, fps, heist, looter shooter"" do not do justice to the boundary breaking this game does in each of these categories. starting with co-op, you are allied with your friends, those you trust the most, in such high octane circumstances you learn to rely on and provide for your team. this brings me to action, the true and suddenly realized adrenaline you hear when you come face to face with the enemy ""cloaker"" or have to juggle the tedious tasks of thrusting the ""f"" key to keep the civilian hostages down and fending off the ferociously fortified firearm flaunting officers. the gun-play in this game is second to none, playing games like csgo, i now see their attempts at such a system of gameplay is a meager attempt at replicating that of payday 2. payday 2 reinvigorates the heist genre for our generation, interposing items, trials, and elements unseen in any game before and likely after. after playing this game, you come to terms with the fact you will never play such an amazing a beautifully constructed piece of work which we are forced to inadequately and modestly call a ""game"". payday 2 is so much more than a game, it is revolutionary, it is the greatest game of our generation and likely of all time."

Its so laggy when I have everything recommended pc wise (besides monitor) and it lags enough where I have to wait a minute plus every heist for it stop lagging and run smooth. Game just needs a optimization update for my buds that have not the best pcs and so I CAN PLAY WITHOUT LAG.

4857,"I used to love Payday 2, but now I find it unenjoyable.

It used to be, you fought off cops while securing objectives, playing out the heist while also battling it out. Which was very hard, but at the same time there was some oversight to it all, with tactics and gunskills involved at the center of it all.

But then they started introducing builds / a meta that was so insanely overpowered compared to the AI's mechanics / it's potential that you stood there practically immortal and able to slaughter hordes of them without any concern whatsoever, and apparently rather than addressing that meta, the horrible imbalance it created, they figured ""Let's continue down this path lol and just throw some more cops in there so it balances out...""

And now you have this nightmare.

It's just so silly you're basically just four people cheesing through all the missions with cops absolutely everywhere, no chance even to control anything nor do you need to, as you just rely on magic immortality skills coupled with ridiculous and spammable firepower to get you through.

They went and made a mess of what used to be an awesome shooter, basically, these days it's just a parody of what it used to be.

It started so innocently with speedy dodge-builds which combined with converted bullet-spunges made it possible for you to just run past fifty cops before they even reacted to you, and they've only ventured further down that road since with abilities (decks to be specific) some of which, on top of that, makes you practically immortal. And now that battlefield which used to be enjoyable, it's just a mess, as the game has become 100% geared towards timing your cooldowns, cheesing past cops at lightning speed with them just looking at you dumbfounded, and resource-management (as long as you don't run out of medic bags, you can get through any mission).

I enjoyed it better when it was about actually fighting your way through a mission, battling it out against a well-balanced army of AIs, the way you'd expect from a shooter, but now seen from that perspective it's mostly unrewarding.

(Disclaimer note: All this only applies for loud mission, stealthing is still quite fun but it was never my favorite part as after a while it gets repetitive)."

Plenty of free cosmetics that you don't have to pay $100 for and every mission gets more intense the higher difficulty you select, the chaos that happens when you are playing can keep you entertained for long periods of time. 

If you are reluctant on getting PAYDAY 2 because it is an ""older"" game then just wait till there's a sale and get it for way cheaper or just wait for PAYDAY 3 to come out."

It's very addicting with the basic Loud style gameplay loop, and both Double Cross 2017 (the song that I started with) and I Will Give You My All 2017 have been absolute bangers that keep me out of stealth. Stealth needs a decent bit of work for Paycheck 3, but it's still enjoyable and satisfying when you finish a heist without being seen. The amount of weapons is also a big draw for me, being an absolute weapon nerd. The original 5 heisters (Including our Hoxton who is now Houston) are great and hilarious, and Bain is as well. 

Overall, very good idea to pick the game up, it's a good purchase.

9/10 Medic Bag required

Seriously though, go listen to I Will Give You My All 2017. It's the best song in the soundtrack and one of the best songs of all time. Any time you need to try hard in a game, it will work, I can confirm."

5008,"[Massive Download Time]
This game takes almost an hour to download - i can download any other game in my library in 1/8 that time or less.

 also why do i have to download DLC that i dont own? ive read that its to prevent players who do/dont have certain DLC from crashing or running into issues but ive seen games fix this issue in a multitude of ways that arnt as bloated as this.

[Needlessly Complex]
There really doesnt need to be this many bits and pieces - things to choose - equipment to change - perks to swap - this and that.

when i first saw the depth of this i let out an audible sigh as i realized i needed to disect every single one of these pieces to understand why it needs to be fiddled with and the more i dug into the more impatient i got with it as i started to realize how pointlessly extrapolated it was. Payday 2 could really do with looking at every other game that allows players to set up a kit but its way to involved to the point of being a chore especially to people just jumping in wondering ""why is this important - whats the deal with that - etc etc etc""

[Minor Keybinding Gripe]
there are is a fat chunk of keys bound to a multitude of things that its becoming seriously overblown - most keys could probably be cleverly coded to like 1 or 2 keys at most but it seems like almost every facet of your clothing and equipment needs its own dedicated key instead of a more intuitive equipment selection method

you cant change keybindings without first unbinding the key that you are looking to place on another function which only leads you down a rabbit hole once you discover that you have to bind a fuckton of different keys just to get one to be ideal.  seriously just let me press backspace and unbind a key or something.


[TL;DR]
* Downloads take to long
* Downloads include things that dont need to be there - content you cant use
* Equipment/Perks/Etc vastly over complicated - could be better simplified
* Keybinding is dated and doest afford the ability to simply unbind a key
* Far too many keybinds - could assign most functions to fewer keys

5109,yes
5110,Payday 2 is a very fun and noob friendly game. There is not much of a learning curve and you can just jump right in. It is also very cheap costing you only $10 but on the summer sale it goes for $1.

5221,"Where to begin with Payday 2? Well if you've always wanted a heist style game, that's fantastic with friends? You should look no further. The difficulties feel fair and balanced, and always keep you thinking of new ways to completely higher difficulty runs. The weapons feel fairly well, and the different ways to build them will have you thinking of what ways you can run heists more efficiently, all while maintaining great team play behind it. You want to stealth? Go right ahead! Prefer the loud runs? On most heists that's another efficient way of doing things if that's your choice! I give Payday 2 a 9/10 and have many hours from console and PC combined to give it that rating. Buy this game if you want a great game to play with friends."

5225,Very good game :D
5226,"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

5298,Nothing to say payday 2 is best robber game in the world 1000/10
5299,"After buying Payday 2, I was overjoyed daily at the multitude of heists I could pull off, banks I could rob, and mafias I could dissolve. I spent hours of my time, purchasing and modifying weapons to my heart's content, then, mask up with a personalized dripped out mask that I could really build to my style. I earned thousands, massacre thousands, if not millions of cops and special ops along the way. Sometimes, a newbie would join and ruin a heist.

5305,"cool game , except the DLC"
5306,"This game is a blast.

Throughout my near 250 hours of playing, I can say I enjoyed at least 245 of those hours. The price is insanely low, especially during winter/summer sales. DLC may be slightly excessive, but gosh golly the game is good enough without them. It's even better if you're playing with friends. If you need co-op game that doesn't bombard you with unnecessary mechanics, yet still allows you to customize the way you play, then be sure that the 6.5$ you spend are more than worth it.

10/10. Ideal with mods."

5324,"I am a 47 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

5380,"when the blonde hair women, when the



















stay frosty"
5381,"This is my review on payday with my experience, (kinda just got bored and did this, didnt expect to really make a review.)

please remember, i'm not the best at explaining, this is a review/explanation, probably gonna be my longest review for a long time. If you are actually interested, this is gonna be a hell long review but please, i ask you, read it all.

The gameplay - Your a heister, or as our legendary sit-in-the-chair-guy calls it, clowns, and your job is basically to just heist banks, with two options, stealth or loud. You rob jewerly stores, malls, anything really. Including the 'career' (campaign) you have things that arent even heists, you transport stuff safely (if you call throwing a bag of weapons a few miles up safe), or create the white clouds in one of my beautiful paintings. It's all different, each heist. On that topic there are 79 heists, each with 7 difficultys, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death wish, Death Sentence, and the extra one down mode. One down mode will be explained after I tell you this story...
Downs, you've heard it, seen it, had it in other games, you run out of hp you get downed, you have a standard of 3 downs, but with a skill you can get 4. On 0 you get downed and go into custody. There are 2 ways to go into custody to my knowledge, 1 is run out of downs, 2 is when downed, you have a 30s timer and if you don't get revive in those 30s (yes timer stops when being revived) you go into custody no matter the downs. How to get out of custody? To get out of custody (Only in multiplayer or it'll just end) you must have a hostage, can be a police or civilian, and wait for the police assault to end and then, our amazing bain, will negotiate for us so that if we set our poor civilian free or police, we will get our psychotic-maniac with a flamethrower free. For the gameplay changing part, that's skills and perks, (and weapons but you already understand that the second you get in.) Skills, to get them you must have skill points, which you gain 1 (only level 50 you get more than 1, which is 3) each level, up to level 100, you use these skill points to get certain skills depending on what your going for, a dodge build, tank build, crit, all what you want. How the skill points are categorized is with 5 sections, Mastermind, Tank, Technician, Ghost, and Refugee or something, each one has 3 different column's each with 2 sides (except for top and bottom skill which will be explained later). Each column is labeled on what it basically does, per say mastermind's first column is medic, to go up the skill ladder, and on the left side its mostly about giving more uses to medkit (equipment will be explained soon) and reviving, whilst on the right side its about medbags and that, but what the main ability of that column, is the top piece, there are 4 skills in each column(on each side) and the first and top have just 1 skill, not 2, each skill you get (except for top) will unlock the next tier skills, (does not include other columns in that section) but the top normally includes all + a few aced skills to unlock and only THEN you can get it with skill points, aced skills are skills where you need skill points as well to ace a skill, acing doesnt mean improving, its basically a whole nother skill. Going back to my main topic, the top ability only costs 4, at its the 4th tier, but its ace costs 8, and the ace is what makes it good. Inspire is the skill, and what it lets you do in comparison to aced inspire is, when pressing f at a teammate, it shouts and improves some stats for a bit, but aced lets you have a 100% chance, to revive a downed teammate by shouting at them from 9 or less meters away, this can only occur once every 20s. 
Now that, I think i explained the skills, (please if you got this far if you see me missing something or i left you confused at a part, tell me in comments.) 
It's time for me to ramble on about perks, or called perk decks.
Perk Decks are basically, skills, but you cant really choose which you want to get, each perk deck (most are locked to dlc) has a different objective on what it's goal to do, an example is rogue, best perk deck for a dodge build, (a dodge build is basically a build where you get your dodge to max, which is 60, so that you have a 60% chance to dodge each bullet) with 3 of 9 perks giving +15% chance to dodge, and other abilitys, 
you get to see what all the perks are in each deck and what they do.
Now to utilize them, it goes in an order likes, but its just a straight ladder, to gain them you use perk points.
I have no clue how to really gain them, all I know is after each mission/heist you gain perk points which you use to put progress into the perk your on in that line. 
I think I explained perk decks, so now i'll explain the working of equipment and thus some light to my information.
Equipment, includes quite a few things like sentries, ecm jammers, ammo bags, medkits and medbags, body bags, or the unlockable from every perk deck ( i think every) armour bag.
Equipment is meant to be used in a certain way, like jammers for stealth, or medkits/medbags for tanks that are going loud, body bags for stealth, and sentries, kinda just op with ammo bag, with inclusion of the supressed sentry which is meant for killing unlike its counterpart thats used for distractions. All of them (except armor bag) are able to be upgraded/improved by skills,
for example to what I said before, sentry skill allowing you to place 4 sentries instead of 1.
These are incredibly useful as medbag is able to heal you up to full and reset your down count if you lost some, or medkits which skills can allow you to carry a ton, is just a fast place-then-use to regain full hp.
That's mainly your gameplay, what you can change for your character.
Onto about the fbi, there are a few special enemies, they basically do different/special stuff but I don't think i've seen em all, so I don't think I can explain that part, but imo it's way more fun to have the ""what the F**K!?!??"" or ""wHaT tHe hELL is that thing!""
But also the best part of the fbi, is the voicelines, I'm gonna explain one of special enemies;
Cloaker.
Every. Payday 2. Players. Nightmare. 
He will jump out of thin air, do a summersault and drop kick you to the ground in a second, and his insults hurt more than his drop kicks.
The voicelines he has, are one of a kind, going from ""Listen here, I got this drum solo I've been working on."" and proceeds to hit you with a baton to ""You call this resisting arrest? We call this a difficulty tweak!"" 
But thats just fbi, all the heisters (there are multiple heisters you can pick to play as, most from different places) have their own. 

Overall, it's honestly great, I haven't learned to much or gotten to far, not much knowledge. but it's nice to see an option to ""Auto-kick cheaters"" and whatnot in a game for once, or ""allow modded players"". They encourage you to play how you want, Instead of just not allowing cheaters to play with others, its a choice if you want to play with a cheater. Per say, in public if you turn off the option, someone with cheats can join and that was YOUR choice to heist with a cheater.

Now maybe, probably 99% of the gameplay, is the masks, customization, was NAILED, to the masks to outfits, they really did it perfect, it's so fun to play around with the masks and with a friend it's just funny.

Honestly I definitely feel like im missing a lot that i should be explaining, but i'm gonna stop right here
I don't really think anyones gonna even see this message and, the rest you'll figure out easily on your own, 
or just go watch a video! go on wiki!, again this is the gameplay part, not the review.

And as always, remember, this is my opinion, if you don't like it, read a different review.


For the Review part:

Definitely Paint Worthy, 
10/10

5386,"This game is decently fun but you you want to know what is ruining it?

Bugs.

There are too many bugs with cameras seeing through walls, guards seeing through the back of their heads. And npc's thinking that glass broke when there is no broken glass. 

The lazy developers of this game are doing nothing to fix this.
This is the reason why I am leaving a negative review, I hope this will be patched in an update if the developers decide to wake up.

I expect all those bugs to be fixed in Payday 3."

5404,"Payday 2 is one of the games in existence. The moment I laid my eyes on it, I could definitely say I was in for a game. This game has many unique mechanics, like walking, sprinting, and jumping. I could tell that people made this game, the voice actors did a job, the graphics are visible, the soundtrack is audible, and there is certainly a story. There is a selection of weapons to use, and they are all instruments used to purposefully inflict damage. Payday 2 has characters, and they play roles. Every heist I play through has me on my seat and playing the game. I had such an experience playing the game that the main character, John Payday visited me in my dreams and delivered the famous line: ""It's Payday 2"". I would certainly rate this game as 4 paydillion stars."

5456,really good
5457,"- Best criminal simulator game

One of the more classic and better games to put you in the shoes of a criminal. Stunning graphics, very well developed story line, many well thought out heists, much better stealth possibilities compared to the first game, a very neat customization system that allows you to express your criminal side and also a lot of classic characters to be rememberd. You can't possibly forget how Hoxton insults his younger counterpart, Houston when calling out to follow him for example. The only real issue that might seem annoying to players of the game is the fact that you need to own a very specific version of a whole another game on Steam, to unlock one of the playable characters, Jacket. This just seems like another gash grab opportunity that Overkill Software decided to take, just like they did with the Wolfpack DLC in Payday: The Heist. Other than that, a big improvement from it's predecessor. Very hyped up for the upcoming sequel!"

5490,"Actual ass of a game. Can't even describe how cancerous it is to play, as its just endless army's of troops. You can be robbing a small bank and easily be assaulted by 150 policemen, or swat, meanwhile they just drop like flies. No tactical feel to the game at all honestly, more like a shoot em up cause the moment anyone notices what your doing its just a full on zerg rush of what should be tactical troops throwing themselves at you like cannon fodder.

Not to mention the insane price of weapons is outrageous. They expect you to play dozens to hundreds of hours to unlock everything but every single mission becomes the same thing within minutes. I'd say there isn't even a dozen hours of real content here."
5491,just don't play if you are into law enforcement
5492,it is a fun game for the guys who like playing rob games and snaking
5493,i been playing this game since it came out on PS3
5494,"its good game
"
5495,i think i need help i cant stop playing this game
5496,"The finest art of resurrection that this game has to offer is the offering of some random zip-tied idiot to return a crew member to action, and the finest art of healing is being shouted at to get back up. This game is replayable gold, deeper than it looks on the surface and a singularity of enjoyable content.

One of my favorite games ever, 10/10 would absolutely recommend."
5497,after you take the medic bag you cant go back and now my life is ruined all I think about is that damn medic bag please send help.
5498,yes very good
5499,you hit ppl with a golden spoon do i have to say anything else?????????????
5500,why is there a man with a gas mask with green glowing eyes coming at me with a baton?....
5501,Quit looking at this and fix the damn drill
5502,Marone! I'm italian
5503,its fun

5510,I have killed many cops in my 46 hours of playing

5512,Stupid devs. Buggy game. Good though.
5513,I've only owned this game for five minutes.
5514,*As a wise man once said* AGHHHHHHHHHHH i need a medic bag!
5515,all the shenanigans
5516,"""I'm going vi roll! and it should consider letting it all"" I know what I could wish for in a complex game, like this for now I use to bring it  more but dame I got with this ""Hard asses tramp peed to and unlock setup' I can not explain how much i could frustrate my losses."
5517,"100%

5529,yes
5530,How do you lockpick?
5531,i like it
5532,....
5533,payday two is a great game its not like all the other games where its a battle of a hundred people or a 5v5 or anything like that its great to play with friends and by yourself plus there's a million of custom clothes mask and even GUNS and not lame like COD mask and clothes can range from funny to nice dressed to military to looking like you are the grim reaper but thats not what the game is only it feels so refreshing to play this game and even tho its old it feels new i know how long this is but give it a try its only 99cents right now
5534,Fun game if you like hoard shooters while having interesting objectives then this is for you.  Another good portion of the game is the amount of weapons you have up for grabs.  Then there are masks which while they are cosmetic they are part of 75.5 percent of the fun in payday 2
5535,funny mask game
5536,Great game
5537,goofd
5538,shooty shooty
5539,officer down simulator. can't complain

5567,for me personally I really like these type of game u can do a lot of stuff like being stealthy or just slaughter cops for days. but this game not for everyone like few of my friend they didn't like these type of game. my tips is u better check few gameplay on youtube if you're interested on it
5568,"Great game in-general, dlc's dont always have to be purchased to unlock key items to better one's experience. Heists which require DLC can also be run if you have another person host said heist."

5587,i need medic bag
5588,"They've had years to add in more content to this game so there are heists up the #$@. Great to play with friends, but doing stealth missions solo can be a real challenge. The variation in objectives and styles is great, and going through story mode lets you try out DLC heists without owning them. Sometimes there's a little too much sitting around shooting and waiting for 5 minute timers when going loud, but beyond that I've got no complaints."

*Wouldn't recommend in real life :)*

Tell ya friends, to tell their PARROT, to tell their, dogs father, to tell their classmates, to tell a WATER BOTTLE...... that this game is good, not great, but good.

5726,"Directions/Instructions Checklist
Step 1
In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.

Step 2
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Step 3
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Step 4
To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.

Step 5
Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving."

5756,df
5757,good game
5758,I HAVE BEEN REBORN BY THIS GAME!
5759,good
5760,"Fun game to play both alone and with your mates. There's enough guns, variety and jobs to do to keep you coming back for more. A lot of DLC, but the content is fairly worth it as long as you know what you're buying."

5773,very good game if you have friends
5774,guud game
5775,Their is a mission where you can basically play as Walter white and cook meth.
5776,"It's good when you play with 4 friends, doing different type of missions together. But the police AI is not very challenging or various, most of the good guns and mods are in DLC too mean you will have to buy extra. If you are looking for the games focusing on shooting and making score, this might not be the game for you. It's more like co-operation and help each other to finish the mission together."
5777,very cool

5883,Dallas
5884,"haha game big fun now buy it
"
5885,"This one is good. Get it, Or don't. Wish the monetization scheme wasn't so... ridiculous. But it seems the devs are (and have been for a while now) in a tight spot. So the macro-transactions don't feel as bad as they probably should. Even so the game is great fun especially with friends. The community ranges anywhere from good too trash (about a 50/50 shot) so think about trying to get some friends to get the game as well. If nothing else just too have a more consistent time of it. Weapon customization is fantastic, I look very much forward to this system being expanded upon in Payday 3! The game play itself can be kinda... jank as hell and finicky at times (particularly with stealth) but with friends this is some the most fun I'v had in a while. It's unfortunate that I can only really recommend this game if you get at lest the ""Legacy Collection"". I'm not really one to recommend the ""Definitive Legacy Ultimate Complete Edition BUY NOW! 800% VALUE!"" version of any game, But for the aforementioned reason it doesn't really feel as bad as maybe it should. So get it, or don't."
5886,"It's feel very fun and relax when shooting Civilians AI
My mean AI"
5887,man fuck this game
5888,payday

5906,yes
5907,It is very fun and entertaining.
5908,M O N E Y
5909,"Isn't it fun to go rob a bank with a thermal drill that breaks down every 30 seconds? And meanwhile, the police free your hostages but after being untied they just stand there in the middle of the crossfire, being human shields for the cops. You can hear Bain being angry at you for killing some suicidal civilian. And then Dallas is screaming at the top of his lungs, ""I NEED A MEDIC BAG!"" Bro, go to the doctor bag I left by the vault. Oh, and speaking of the vault, After 5 minutes of repairing a shitty drill multiple times, the vault opens up by itself (oooh, magic!) and inside, there is gold worth millions. This is some tiny bank in the poor part of the city. WHY IS THERE GOLD? I guess someone around here robbed Fort Knox and just deposited it all to the bank. Oh well, now it's ours.

It's PAYDAY fellas!

6014,we live in a society
6015,good
6016,"Terrible game by even worse developers.

There are ads everywhere in the menus to buy their DLC.
Like 90% of the weapons and mods are from DLC.
The few mods you can get may only be purchased after you unlock them though a dumb random card system where after you complete a mission you might get one random item for one random gun.
They even charge to customise the color and shape of the cross hair.
Ai Is the worst i've ever seen. They don't help with objectives, deliver loot or even follow you most the time.
The mouse sensitivity is way faster than humanly usable and there is no setting to change it and never will be. The Devs only care about adding more paid content not fixing bugs.
They force you to follow their page for in game items and if you leave they take them away.

The only reason i'll still play this is with friends, but i wont be buying anything from these Devs in the future."
6017,"This game impressed me from the day it was released. You can rob anything you want, have a house, choose from a wide variety of weapons to use in robberies, and much more. I recommend this game with confidence especially if you have played GTA 5!"
6018,Very fun
6019,"Robbing banks, stealing *mysterious substances that I can't talk about without breaking steam rules* or cooking *said mysterious substances*, shooting people, committing crimes, etc.
This game is amazing and absolutely worth your money. The current deal on this game is something you cannot pass up, it's only 99 cents! Get it while it's cheap. The game supports co-op multiplayer with up to 4 total players and is a blast to play with friends."

6021,"i dont like guards, they're damn melon munching monkeys"
6022,"This game has THE WORST implementation of VR I have ever seen in my 5+ years of VR gaming.

The controls are so comically stupid, I was in complete disbelief playing the game. It uses the face buttons to actually turn. Not the ACTUAL THUMBSTICKS, the face buttons! Plus a load of other issues that just make this impossible to recommend if you like VR."

6075,"Good
But why the fuck so many dlcs"
6076,"Amazing game, just expect to spend some money on the dlc.

I recommend getting this game while it is on sale."
6077,"good game, especially with a good group of boys"
6078,"its ok
"
6079,"Pros:
+ Only game in my opinion that has this type of co-op heist feel that is fun to play solo/multiplayer
+ Lots of customization with weapons, mask, and outfits
+ DLC is fun and recommend to have
+ Story is actually pretty good 
+ Perk deck and skill tree allows more variation to how you play
+ There are mods but be warned that some could cause you or other players to crash but makes the game way better
+ Recent Infamy patch allows you to level up infamy without losing your levels, so you don't have to start off with no skills or basic weapons until a certain level. Also you can double level up infamy with this new patch but you are sacrificing you levels.
+ Easter eggs 
+ Repair the Drill simulator and Bag carrying simulator!
+ Lovely webseries and trailers

Cons:
- Waiting for the drill during stealth, but it's not a huge deal because you could use that time to do other things 
- The game engine is poorly optimized 
- On the highest difficulty some of the maps are cancer, but doable 
- Some perks, items, and skills could be reworked/buffed to make them less redundant on higher difficulty. You can do them, but it's not going to be fun.
- Not a lot of things you could buy because you get a lot of money later on
- They reuse maps or parts of it
- Community is a bit iffy with elites and cheaters for online but I think it's better than most 
- Buggy shit but playable 
- Fall damage :( 
- Ethan and Hila like bruh
- Killing civilians bad :( but killing a whole police department good =)

Remarks:
Although it might not seem like a lot of content for a 2013 game to now, they are trying and still adding content. Plus mods will solve a lot of issues with the game and some of the cons I mentioned. The game is PVE so you don't have to worry about cheaters too much apart from the fact that they might be able to crash or make the game too easy for you. It's up to you to decide where to draw the line. It's your game, so play however you want but don't hurt others enjoyment due to your actions. They are also making Payday 3, so support them if you like the game."

Pros:
Decent game that can waste your time, DLC heist content can be accessed if the host has access to it, Great variety of weapons from the devs. The modding community has made a lot of mods to fix bugs and make the game look better even adding more weapons for you to add/play with. The custom heists can be immersive and great fun to play on with some friends. Game is easy to mod too. 

Cons: 
Can get boring when solo, modding can be initially difficult. Some of the heists (Hell's Island being one) is highly unoptimised requiring a rather powerful machine to run it with somewhat steady fps. 

Works on my low end rig: i5-3470 @ 3.6ghz, Intel HD 620, 8gb DDR3 RAM @ 1333mhz (only rated ""Decent"" because half of the maps are unoptimised for the lower end machines like this one)"
6120,"The game overall has a lot of fantastic FPS game-play like in COD, CSGO, and Battlefield, mixed in with a lot of ideas and more arcade-like and fast pased like DOOM. Sure its a game made back in 2013 and has some problems with it like:

- AI either clipping through walls, stand there doing nothing, or just ignoring you and shooting other teammates (Even if you are behind them BTW).
- Missions that are a tad bit aggravating like finding a certain item in an area that has items that look identically to each other, or carrying heavy items to a drop-off zone 150m away.
- Forces you to wait either for a helicopter to arrive, a drill to finish drilling, a thing to heat up, or literally waiting to move forward with the mission.
- AI teammates not having the best awareness and can either do somethings good or bad;
Good - They help you by taking care of enemies, carrying things for you, and helping you off the ground when you get downed.
Bad - Sometimes they'll take a different path to follow you instead of directly following you, or follow me if I go too far whenever I told them to stay in one spot.

Despite the problems that I have endured the game overall has a ton of content and is still getting updated to this day, and I've been overall happy with this game since its all that I want in a more arcade like shooter, it has great mechanics, a very high level of customisation, likeable characters, tons of references that'll make someone laugh, and has the best skill tree that I have ever seen in any game.

Game overall is a 8.5/10
It has its flaws, but is still a fantastic game.

6200,"Overkill is terrible for their handling of console. So it's a ""No"". And they deserve it. But without bias, I'd call this a good game. But don't screw a bunch of your players like that. What's that tell us to expect from Payday 3? I buy the game on PS4/5 and it'll get abandoned again?

Don't worry there's a real review here too.

PC has all kinds of new stuff to do, but some things are different; masks and attachments tied to challenges/achievements. it's ok, just a bit annoying. More continental coins. But can't buy masks with coins now? I can't find a way to do so. Overall not a bad game. 

My problems personally are Overkill's abandonment of the console titles. That hurts my experience with the game vastly. Wasn't happy with Tony Montana's (Scarface's) removal, but that's not on Overkill, that's on Universal Pictures. But it still annoyed me. So i bought the pack that had him included.

Got it (with the Legacy DLCs) for 1535 CAD (11.6 USD), don't remember the discount or original price. Was a while ago. Refused to buy off Steam to support Overkill as much as possible. Got it as a code off a games-for-sale site, i forget which one. cdkeys, g2a, one of those i think.

Hours are low on PC. Played for hundreds of hours on PS4. PC is better. 
On PS4:
beat the game
Unlocked everything
experienced pretty much all the content the game has to offer.

Give it a 4.5/5 as a game. (Removing my bias on Overkill)
Give it a 2/5 for terrible business practices regarding Console. 
Have it noted, I have many things I'd say about Overkill that would get purged from this review by the review process that I have omitted. You can use your imagination tho."

6209,"I got this game on sale since it was probably one of the best deals, I had wanted to play it for a while but honestly wasn't expecting much. I had heard many good things and equally bad things about it. Looking at it was like the beginning of The Dark Knight with Left 4 Dead like gameplay but instead of going through through a cooperative campaign of levels slashing zombies it was robbing banks and I guess fighting off cops and swat. This game is very, very fun, mowing down dozens of enemies and going overkill (haha funny) while having specific objectives will never not be fun at all. And the environments of the places you can rob are amazing. However the game does have some minor animation bugs which can get annoying at times, also why is this game 80GB? It should be about 50GB at max, 80 is just way to much disc space for this. Although I have only played an hour and a half it has been awesome fun and I can't wait to play more of this, especially can't wait to try the VR mode"

6214,This is the game ever
6215,So goodddd!
6216,"as someone that plays this game sometimes, robbing banks is fun and you should do it in real life"
6217,This game is very great and I really enjoy it on vr but some things need to be fixed like VR's performance because I had to install a mod just to make this game run well with all the constant stuttering and freezing. Also I hate how the game forces you to update even though you don't own certain packs. But in all the fame is fun and very enjoyable. It's definitely worth the grind and would highly recommend.
6218,This game is so good bro I had so much fun playing this that I lost track of time. The soundtrack is god-tier. The gameplay is also pretty good. God I love this game so much.
6219,it gud
6220,It is a game that is underrated obviously. And understanding how to play is a totally a different ballgame. There are lots of stuffs which should be understood by players. Given that economic fluctuating has spreat around the world it is cheaper than I expected
6221,Good game worth the money.
6222,"Mofo I was able to get from level 4 to level 49 because I went into mayhem with some guys who were level 50. Now I have a almost complete half dodge build setup, and several million dollars, and the power of god. Overall, the fucking game is built in the wrong engine, and it's so fucking funny."

6226,ahh payday 2 the game where you come for the music and stay because your getting curb stomped by a cloaker
6227,"This game is extreme fun, despite the kinda shite engine, but the core elements hold it up as a really great game."
6228,"AAAAAAAAAAA I NEED STEAM POINTS BAG!

AAARRGH IM DYING!"
6229,get payed
6230,KILL THEM!!!!!!
6231,i need a medic bag
6232,"Dumb fun with friends, worth buying (even at full price, this game is far from dead), just make sure you have some people around you that are experienced, as there is some nuance in this game.

My favorite is the stealth heist ""shadow raid"", I had a ton of fun with my friends in middle school running that all night, and it continues to be fun after all these years.

There's no game that gives me the feeling of urgency like this game does, nor is there one that makes me feel as badass. 

The best part, in my opinion, is the ability to play as you'd like. Wanna be a ninja? Go ahead. Wanna wear an iron man suit and try to out-tank dozers? Nothing's stopping you! Wanna kill all the guards, take hostages and leave without a fuss? Perfect! 

The only gripe I have about this game is the grind. But even then, you can min-max to shit and still get away with it, given you have a well coordinated team. Right now, it's only a dollar, so don't hesitate because it's a crime (pun) to not try this game."
6233,"fun,buggy,fun"
6234,"amazing game
"
6235,"still feels good
"
6236,Game offers a lot of different weapons and interesting missions
6237,The game is very intresting and it fufilled my needs as pleasure i loved killing all the fbi/police its was very stress reliaving i highly reccomend this game it has also taught me alot of skills i never knew before and can hopefully use them in my every day life 10/10 game.

6380,"great gameplay, its amazing a game from 2013 has held up so well against other large titles, you should absolutely purchase this while its on sale. However the amount of paid DLC content in the game makes it hard to customize weapons or enjoy the experience as much as you potentially could."
6381,"The most fun I had playing this game was the demo version on the Playstation 3, apart from that it's just a mid-level game. I personally wouldn't recommend it unless you want an extremely cheap game to sink some hours in with friends. There are however definitely better quality games out there to enjoy with friends."
6382,"This game is fantastic, in nearly every way. There is plenty of heists to run, people to play with, and things to do. The only real complaint I have is that the dlc practices are a bit much, there is a lot of content behind paywalls. I can only hope that payday 3 dials back on this practice."

I think I have PTSD after playing this terrible game. The UI was disgusting to look at and it ruined my 2020 vision. My son never will look at me the same after he found out that I played this game. He is 5 years old... After he found out I played this game he started to tell ME what to do. Once he turned 18, he put me in a nursing home. I tried going to therapy to help recover after what this game has done to me. But nothing helped alleviate the damages. This game ruined my life."

6464,Bad
6465,very fun
6466,"This is a game where you can kill cops in many means but your means of defense are way funnier. In a concise manner you cannnn drink off bullets, you can dodge bullets, you can stab yourself with a syringe and shrug off bullets, you can have a leech suck your blood and by killing cops you heal wounds and you can do all of this while hitting cops in the face with a comically large spoon. 9/10 would still play after 241 hours"
6467,robbrs gam e

6476,Its fun

6478,"I tried this irl and now I'm wanted in 17 countries. 10/10, would recommend"
6479,"Cool game. Cant manage 4 pagers? Use silent assasin. Wanna do overdrill on stealth? There's a mod for that too.

Dont have friends to play with? Dont have a mod for that, sorry."
6480,"This game has evolved so so much since the last time I played many years ago. Came back after revisiting some RussianBadger videos on youtube. Was not disappointed. New Perk and Skill systems a veritable wealth of small DLCs to peruse and replayability for miles. 

Oh and you can hit cops with a gigantic spoon.

6503,went from hundreds of hours on xbox to here and its a lot more fun on pc than console
6504,"I got payday 2

Robbed a bank
fought of the police
set of some bombs
fought of  some more police

then went back home  and played payday 2."
6505,its amzing game
6506,"My Personal Review:

1 - It's a great game, alone and with friends. There is a lot of possibility in this game, there are different ways of doing heists, different masks, weapons, and characters. There are a lot of strong female characters in this game, which is always a plus.

2 - Payday 2 may be seven years old, but it still provides gamers with an extremely fun and unique experience. The game allows players to live out their wildest dreams as a professional thief, as they complete a variety of different heists ranging from simple jewelry store robberies to elaborate military raids, Which I find really impressive.

3 - (Extremely Important) Parents need to know that Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is essentially a bank heist simulator and is full of inappropriate content. Players can rob banks with others, shoot and kill rival gangs and police officers, kill hostages if need be, and deal drugs in some other missions, Plus it's a fictional game, Not based in a real life situation.

4 - Whether you are joining for the first time or jumping back in, PayDay 2 is the perfect game to play with friends. I personally have a lot of fun playing this game with my friends.

That's pretty much it, My honest review on this spetacular game! :)"

6518,pretty good game up until my skins were all removed one day i loaded payday2 not a uncommon issue with no solution
6519,such good sh1t
6520,"While being fun this game is a total meme that embraces it's ridiculousness. Great to play with friends, and it's worth buying, especially for the price it goes for on sale"
6521,"Great game, i used to play on xbox before, its worth getting it on pc over console."
6522,its ok i guess
6523,Don't buy unless you have 4 friends to play with. The AI is the worst I've ever seen in my entire life.  I've gotten swarmed because the AI just sits there and watches you do everything. They aren't any help whatsoever other than to pick you up.  The saws jam and the AI makes you do that yourself.  Overall the game is great. But the AI and enemy coding iS DOGSHIT. Bought it for a dollar. What a waste of a dollar.
6524,❤️ 🔥

6563,"one of the best games ever
was playing with one friend and 2 bots
the bots carried us
we died like 100times but not the bot
"
6564,Dozzers hurt my fewings...
6565,"With the about 40 hours I have put in, I feel I am finally able to rate this game. Payday 2 is an amazing co-op game to play with friends. The majority of time I have in Payday is time staying up with friends seeing how much meth we can cook or how much money we can take from a bank. Combined with the fact that this game is often on offer with its DLCs going for literal pennies, Payday 2 can manage to create a wide variety of enjoyable scenarios. The achievements can probably keep you playing for 100s of hours and the repeatability of this game is practically through the roof. Hell, even if friends aren't online I will still play a game in offline mode. Payday 2 is almost impossible to sum up in this last sentence, but even if it is not on offer, you should buy a copy to play with friends."
6566,"payday 2 is worth the pay
to bad there is no hay
and that is not okay 
although gladly it is day
yay"
6567,Its very fun game !

6579,"This game is special, I put over 1000 hours in on console and have just started on PC. Is the game engine shitty, yes. Is there tons of stupid glitches, yes. Does the game just crash randomly for no reason frequently, well... yes! This game is still amazing though, and has a super dedicated community, even if cheaters are a semi-frequent problem."

6654,"Payday 2. 

Payday 2 is one of my favourite games, now it may not seem like it due to my nonexistent hours, but I sadly played on console. I hope to enjoy all future and past content. I currently cannot fully enjoy the heisting experience as I do not have a mouse. (DO NOT PLAY WITH TRACKPAD OR ANY FPS FOR THAT MATTER) I may update this review once I get a mouse. Good luck heisters!"

6658,Epic very pog
6659,"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

6752,"Got the thermal drill, it broke down about 3-4 times during the heist, fun times."
6753,"It was fun like 6 years ago but the feel of the game hasn't been updated to feel modern or smooth and playing it now feels like a chore. Kinda wish they'd just make a new Pay Day instead of making all these map updates. The game is starting to have feature creep too. The skill trees are massive and overwhelming if you haven't studied the meta and maps, which also feels like a chore to get through if you haven't been grinding the game since day 1. 
The mechanics are cool and fun, but my main thing is that they need to just make a new game already. If they made a modern Pay Day or Pay Day 3 I think it would sell extremely well and that's exactly what I've been looking forward to.
The game overall is fun if you can get past the old clunky FPS feel. The heists are cool and strategizing new maps is very fun. Of course some maps have less replay-ability since you learn how to easily get it done. The developers helped with this by making some aspects of the map randomly generated, so a specific room you might be looking for could change from one side of the map to another from each heist.
Love the game when I played it years ago, can't say I recommend it now though because I just want them to actually make a new game instead of updating an outdated model. Too clunky and saturated with features."
6754,yes.

New content is always being released, so you get a game with a big community that never dies and with new heists to play. And yes, dlcs are for sale but honestly, with the offers you get sometimes its worth a couple a bucks. Highly recommended."

6842,one of my favorite game <333
6843,"meth, money, murder and guns is all you need for some time of fun.
"
6844,"Wonderful game. It is fluent and most basic controls are great. Customization is also great, on PC customization is more expansive than console. It has both stealth and run and gun. You can stealth most missions. Most missions can give you major experience boosts. Leveling up in this game is usually quick. The guns don't feel underwhelming on all difficulties. Missions feel great with the many enemy types.  Payday 2 also gives us skill trees that allow us to offer up different strategies and builds. Payday 2 offers up a challenge where ever you go. (Depending on the difficulty/level)"
6845,They say games are more fun with friends until you have one person ruin the stealth mission for everyone else. It is a lot of fun to sneak around guards dressed up as a pickle and steal everything though.
6846,if you're thinking about buying this game just do it W devs W game
6847,
6848,It has american clown mask
6849,This game is just awesome in every way. Finally a game for adults with foul language and brutality all the way through. So much fun and very funny.
6850,"love this game, but the amount of time the drill breaks is just dumb. 10/10"

6876,"PD2 is an incredibly fun and most often fast paced arcade shooter. It isn't realistic, it isn't strive to be realistic, it isn't supposed to be realistic. Most importantly: The game doesn't really try to be something it isn't in most cases - it's simply fun.

Almost all levels can be done ""loud"" (read: shooter) and most can also be done ""silent"" (read: sneaky), wether it's robbing a bank, a warehouse, the white house, or tampering with election machines. The game can be picked up years after having it played last and is still exactly that: fun. Pretty much everything can be done solo, however it's also optimal with a few friends, if all have a decent internet connection. Modern heisters and characters from pop-cultural sources are also available, whether it be John Wick, h3h3, Clay von Sons of Anarchy, etc.

A major gripe for me is the amount of DLCs now - shortly before the h3h3 expansion came out in 2017, I remember patchnotes reading there would be no more, as the game is finishd... 5 years and over 100€ later, there is still content coming out - which is good. But a lot of money for people only getting a chance to play on rare occasions."

Honestly, simple game but its great.
You either get to go in like Sam Fischer, stealthy and slow. Or wreck everything like a Vietnam Vet on the 4th of July.
Although the mechanics aren't complex they're effective. And overall makes the game a nice little solo [45] minute endeavor, or a [5] hour long session of stupid with [3] of the dumbest teammates imaginable singing to the tune of ""DonacDum""

Beat every heist on One Down back when that was the hardest difficulty and I gotta say there's a ton of stuff here.

Music- Slaps

Gameplay- Splits into 2 different types that require different builds, thought and honestly some luck to pull off well.

Sound design- For 2013 really well done and immersive.

Hours to complete- Depending on skill level I'd say around 300-700 hours to see and do everything

Final Verdict- 9/10
Really looking forward to Payday 3 with a 2023 release window!!!"

7127,"Almost 9 years on, it is one of the best cases of a GaaS done right. Despite the memes, this game refuses to die, and keeps adding great content to this day. This means that Payday 2 is one of the most massive games you can get today, with dozens of heists, weapons, playstyles and some different modes. All of this with (currently) no abusive loot boxes (since they were removed) or microtransactions.

There is a lot to complain about with Payday 2, but it's impossible not to recommend it for anyone who likes horde-style action games, careful stealth planning, and comically large spoons."

I love and hate this game. I love it because it's fun, ridiculous action, and the millions of different customizations the game has to offer. But on the other hand, the game can run poorly on even the most optimized PCs and has had a habit of crashing on the most random shit. But get past the those few flaws, you have yourself a hub of heisters who all are passionate about the game."

7198,"I remember when this ""was"" great, having funny random moments with random heisters, been carried by more experience folks on DW+OD, teamed together to get the achievments, etc... Now they nerfed too much gun and vice versa with enemy, the drop rate for the Safe is too low and pay too much for the DLC, even most of the DLC gun are bad, heavily nerfed.
Went from 10/10 to 4/10 real quick, not recomend anymore"
7199,"Payday 2 is an all-time classic. Many poor technical decisions were made from the outset of its inception. It is no secret that the diesel engine (literally the foundation/core/engine) around which the rest of the game is built.
Regardless of the flaws in logic of the original creators, the game is a cult classic. 
The lore, characters and the sheer brilliant audacity of the concept around a game in which one can rob banks. Live the life of the outlaw and become infamous and extremely rich. 
there are many characters to choose from thanks to DLC adding to the original four heisters of the Payday Gang. And the team didn't skimp on choosing great quality actors, including many well known in hollywood.
there are many great features connected to lore in the game. Most of the heists have a stealth option, so one can sneak in and sneak out with either sim[pe of complex plans, feeling worthy of notoriety for not being detected. Personally I get my rush from stealth heists, however those of your for whom ""the action is the juice"", most heists do have a loud option. Some achievements and trophies will rely on either stealth or loud to be achieved. I love the idea of being a professional, not a mass murderer, so I generally try to stick stealth for the immersion factor.
an added bonus is the level of character customisation (in terms of clothing and masks/disguises) only for aesthetic purposes and not really functional, however, it is all part of building your own take on the style and type of professional heister(s) you prefer. While they all come with back stories, it is fun to insinuate oneself into the role of the character, build on lore/legend in the imagination. 
There's not better rush than working with a team (communicating and assisting via mic) and pulling off the ultimate heist together or getting one of those badass difficult achievements with a good team. CO-OP is the name of the game, but it's no less fun playing solo with AI either on standby or joining you when it goes loud.
Despite a little too much whining from some players, the devs have done a great job at patching and updating  and really taking on board player feedback for bug fixes. The devs were often put under the pump. working unfair hours just to try to slap together updates and DLCs that were given unrealistic release dates by the head of the company. All things considered, the devs did an amazing job whith what they had.

When all is said and done it will forever be one of the greatest. most infamous games of all time. I love PAYDAY 2 and i am looking forward to the release of PD3. I pray they learned their lessons with PD2, but maintain lore and characters (keeping original voice actors) while still introducing new characters. I'd be happy if they really surprised us, even if the original characters have ""retired"" or maybe it'll be an origin story. EIther way, conceptually they have set the bar pretty high. And I hope they listen to the creatives over the bean counters or their own egos and pay due respect to what is such a classic. 
PD2 is affordable and despite its age it is still and always eill be one of my all time favourites.

DEFINITELY GIVE PAYDAY 2 A TRY. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

7236,"god cried when this game was installed on my pc. the devil laughed when i opened it. we call this a difficulty tweak. fully automatic flame enhanced high explosive rotary akimbo shotguns. all who feel my presence live in fear. my 7.1 tonne body armour that was fastened from tearing a tank in half with my bear hands cause the earth to shake when i walk - all particulates in the air travel around the globe at mach 6.3 and induce tsunamis that cover 65% of japans population. my sheer playstyle in this game makes me wanted by 6 separate private militaries across the democratic republic of congo. dallas is more cracked than my great great twice removed nans urn when i punted it across the floor wearing steel toe boots at 4:15am. the only objective in the entire game (despite the announcers orders) is to take every guard off the census with 6000 pounds of c4 plastic explosive in a stealth mission. its ok though. the c4 had a silencer on it. stealth? no wenches? filthy casuals. loud is the way god intended this game to be played. i need my 200mm shoulder fired autocannon in case i get in a heated battle with a deer. what if the real cloakers were the friends we made along the way?

download the game now"
7237,new to the game but completely hooked. haven't played anything else since buying it

7242,"PAYDAY 2 through my time of playing it has offered me some of the best experiences alongside my friends and random people, pure moments of mindless rage exhausted on cops and other beings which honestly from my point of view wouldn't of been better with other games.

7251,Payday 2 its one of the most unique games i have played. Tell me another game where i can rob a bank with a crossbow and a flamethrower dressed as a chicken in a one pice suit. The only bad part is that Overkill adds too many DLCs and sometimes they are not worth. Other times DLCs are too OP and just having 1 or 2 of them makes you a killing machine. Still would recommend.
7252,the drills never work i swear
7253,It's good. Play it.

7264,"Bad game, i didnt enjoy it, also there this Lagg spikes that goes to 7 FPS on my RTX 3050Ti 4G with Ram 12G, this game is insanelly rushed out, and the AI dies by a mtter of bullets count, so for the easy level they die by one shoot, for the hard levels they die with more, so that's basicly what it is, not realism and they just die with the same death animation which is dull..."

7281,The game that should have died 3 times by now continues to survive on sheer entertainment value until they manage to make a sequel.
7282,"I love murder and armed robbery, Payday 2 is also fun I guess"
7283,Great Game Have it on PS4 and PC and love it
7284,Just a lot of fun (got most DLCs as bundles or some other sort of discounts). Idk about the newest content (after they finished with the main storyline)

7311,"This is the best comic book movie of all time. A dark, gritty, and realistic look on how superheroes would act and how they can remain unidentified. With great lead performances by Christian Bale (Batman) and Heath Ledger (The Joker) I believe this is if not the best comic book movie and a competitor for the top spot in crime thrillers as well. Deserves its fantastic reviews and box office totals."
7312,good and good and fuck you n word

most of the dlcs are pretty cheap.
And the satisfaction of completing a hard heist is amazing.
Although grinding is a part of the gameplay, the amount of content in this game makes up for that.
10/10 game.

7353,"Payday 2 at first seemed like something I could find on Roblox for free, but with a little convincing from my friend and some contemplating life decisions, i concluded I would try it out for its relatively cheap price, good reviews, and variety of maps. My first day on Payday 2 wasn't very fun as my friend carried me through the heist with very long drill timers which at first I was unhappy about, but after playing a lot more other heists the drill timers are not that bad as you can do other things while waiting for them like searching for gage packages (a collectable found on every map that gives more xp), other tools needed for the heist, or just fucking around with body bags or nailing people in the back with a giant metal spoon. The drill timer is also needed for loud as defending a drill can be very challenging, especially in higher difficulties. money isn't really a thing you have to grind as you get a lot of money already from career heists (multiplayer story mode basically). If I had a spare $30 or so I would 100% invest in getting Payday 2 if I were you because of the countless hours of entertainment it provides, and even if you finish every single heist in the game 3 times, you can always go for achievements, different variants of heists,  and smack more people with a giant metal spoon to unlock a giant golden spoon that you can smack even more people with."
7354,its epic and theres epic clowns who kill people in an epic manner and its named after a really underrated candy bar
7355,"""We call this a difficulty tweak!"""
7356,"Robbing the government, rich, over privileged, killing narcs, and shooting people in the face that try to stop you all while getting rich and stealing america? Still holds up after years and years of being out...? 10/10. Good enough for me to have it on playstation and still buying it and planning on rebuying the DLCs too. 

Can't wait for PD3."
7357,"If u get this game, know that most base weapons will be purchasable within 20 hours of  off and on play, I suggest getting some DLCs"
7358,"very fun, you there do you like to heist but hate the setup and crew assemble then this is the game for you. in any given game mode you and up to three friends are dropped into a heist you take hostages and fend of the police while cracking safes, stealing diamonds, or just making meth."
7359,Very fun game less fun if your playing solo or with randoms but if your playing with friends very good game however it does get kind of repetitive from time to time
7360,"This game is really fun and has a lot to offer. Since it's old, the DLC also goes on sale for very cheap as well. Very good game, can't wait for Payday 3"
7361,the meth formula makes saltwater
7362,Truly one of the games of all time.
7363,Great Game
7364,Who are these god-damn people!?
7365,"We’re no strangers to love, You know the rules and so do I.

A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of, You wouldnt get this from any other guy.

I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling, Gotta make you understand…

Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry,
Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

We’ve known each other for so long Your heart’s been aching But you’re too shy to say it.
Inside we both know what’s been going on, We know the game and we’re gonna play it.
Annnnnd if you ask me how I’m feeling, Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see…

Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry,
Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

7372,"This game saved my life.

I am 37.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
7373,The best game to play with friends if you want dynamic time spending at your computer.
7374,"Arguably one of the best and most addictive games i have ever played, it has been about 6 days. I have sunk more than 44 hours into this and I could not ask for much more. The screams of Dallas needing a medic bag whilst being curbstomped by a cloaker brings tears to my eyes. One of the best dramas I could ever see. 10/10 Would play again"
7375,fun
7376,shooting civis

7381,the game is great

7395,very poggers
7396,rob banks bro
7397,ok game
7398,"The game is really fun, especially when played with friends. Specifically it offers a great variety of stealth and loud heists with various difficulty settings giving you the freedom to choose how you want to play, even plan a few details in a heist yourself via the preplanning or assets tab when you are ready to launch a heist. It also offers a great variety of weapons of all kinds, clothing options for your character ,deployables and also it offers a variety of skills and perckdecks that you can equip as well depending on how you and your team want to play. In my opinion the game is still worth buying in 2022 as it gets constantly updated with new content and even if you dont have a crew to play with you can always go solo with team ai or you can join public games hosted by other people. With all these things considered i am sure that the game is worth the money and time put into it, guaranteeing a plesant expirience."
7399,"This game kidnapped my parents and buried them alive, I miss them but I hold no regrets

this game is fucking phenomenal"

7429,"Affordable as hell when it's for sale, even with the dozens of DLC it has. Also realising that the game has the Comically Large Spoon as melee weapon and a person behind their Twitter page that's just a legend, I really can't recommend this game enough. Engine is obviously a bit dated, but hey, they resort to Unreal Engine for Payday 3.

Also, this game has loads of mods. At the same time, this game also doesn't have anticheat, meaning you'll run into cheater/modder lobbies quite a lot, but you can simply leave them if you're annoyed by them. 

On the bright side, mods can really overhaul the game. Weapon rebalancing? Sure. Full visual overhaul with textures? No problem. Give your characters Titanfall 2-tier movement? Go ahead!"

Payday 2 is the best heisting game I ever played. Many heists, many weapons and mask and you can choose if you want to sneak or go loud. Have fun playing with friends or sneak alone. Highly recommended!

I had this game on Xbox (200+ hours played) and I wanted to play this game again since this is much better experience than on console. The game has alot of content and even more with dlc's and mods. Making builds and heisting is simply fun, but grindy.

Showed me how run stealth as well and after learning, you had to do be able to do the Bank Heist: Gold Pro job on the hardest difficulty. (at the time) To see where the game has evolved throughout the years, with new jobs and mechanics being introduced since then. it's safe to say I've been having a fun time heisting. I will continue to do so even after the future releases. $"

7676,"This is game is simply Awesome.

If your into first person shooters and maybe if you have friends who are too. This is a must have.
The Gunplay is great, the builds you can create are unique and help you and your crew fill multiple rolls.
Whether your the Crew Chief buffing your team and controlling hostages.
The Muscle - being a general badass, mowing down guards and Cops
The Breacher - your vault cracker who can get you in the vault ASAP
ETC ETC, there's TONS of different builds and roles you can do to help your crew pull off a big score

And this game is JAMPACKED with years of DLC (Free and Paid).
The sheer amount of content is insane in this game. Especially when you compare this to games that big AAA studios have put out in recent years.

And considering this game is generally on sale very often. its a steal. Your gonna get more than your moneys worth from this. I can promise you that."

7681,the stealth in this game is absolutely garbo and the maps are randomized so you can't actually learn or plan anything
7682,Suck my dick
7683,it is a lot of fun
7684,its pretty good but you gotta buy a ton of the DLCs to have fun. if you're gonna get it i recommend buying the first few DLCs since they have way more content and cost less than the newer ones
7685,PAYDAY 2 GET THE COKE
7686,wacky game recommended
7687,"Great game, quality of life mods are worth checking out."
7688,"This game is AWESOME. You can do so many fun things in this game, you can buy guns, go stealthy or loud, and you can have fun with your friends! This game is basically call of duty but its better and I can't wait for the sequel, Payday 3."
7689,"i love killing civilians

7814,"This game contains a melee that is a very large spoon. this is similar to a video posted on vine, 2013, where King Bach asks his friend if he can have some ice cream. To which he responds ""Only a spoonful"". Then, it pans to King Bach who, was prepared for this encounter, pulls out a comically large spoon. The joke is that he can fit all of the ice cream in said spoon. Very good game"

7816,"Its a great game to play with friends. The comedy is great, the characters are great, and there are so many weapons and classes to choose from. Very fun. My only issue is that there really are only a handful of viable classes to play in higher difficulties, and the really fun/good weapons all have awful ammo pick up so you cant really use them because you don't have any ammo after a few minutes. This causes the really open ended variety you feel when the game starts out to become very restricted feeling at higher levels. Other than that though, the game is great."

 - It's my second single most played game on Steam and one of my most played games in my entire life

 - I think it's incredibly fun for a variety of reasons

Still, I simply can NOT recommend a game with now almost 200 EUR worth of DLCs which aren't even exclusively cosmetics. I personally can afford this situation without resorting to legally questionable measures, but I hate it. Sadly, for me there is no alternative to this game."

This game has great combat and a majority of the heists are super fun. My only complaint is that you pretty much need 20 DLCs to play the great content of the game. Its really hard to get bored of this game, because there are different ways to play and a bunch of secretes and achievement hunting to do. Overall a great game with friends or solo, definitely worth checking out."

되게 어려운 편이라 정말 침착하게 공략해나갈 수 있는 사람 아니면 추천 안해요
하지만 알죠? 어려운 게임이 숙달 됐을 때 더 멋있는거!

 I've enjoyed this game since a long time ago, but it's still full of unique charms
It's really hard, so I don't recommend it unless you're someone who can be calm and go after it
But you know, when you master a difficult game, that feels awesome!

 어떤 사람들은 옛날 게임이라고 비추천 하는 것 같은데... 그건 뭔가 이상해요
그 논리대로라면 체스도 사람들이 싫어하는 구린 게임인거에요?

 그리고 어떤 사람들은 대부분의 컨텐츠가 DLC다! 게임이 컨텐츠를 토막내놓고 DLC로 판다! 이러는데
그래서 기본 게임이 만원이잖아요..? 기본 컨텐츠가 만원도 아까울 정도로 별로라고 생각하진 않아요
DLC들 나오기 전에 1만원에 사서 즐기던 사람들이 바보는 아니잖아요
나는 얼리엑세스 때부터 만원 넘게 주고 산 게임들이 수두룩한데

Some people say most of the content is DLC! The game cuts the content and sells it as DLC!
So the basic game is 9.99 dollors, right? I don't think the basic content is so bad that it's a waste of 9.99
People who used to buy it for 9.99 dollors before DLC came out are not idiots"

The game was good, but the companies views on dlc and their abandonment of their player base has caused the game to become stale for most players.

Before they swapped to this model they had an ultimate heist bundle which had every heist but none of the clothes and cosmetic included with it. With the new business model they changed it so that ultimate heist bundle no longer includes anything from the past 2 years, nor does it live up to the companies promise of not having to have another dlc.

If you want a fun game this is for you, but if you want to have a game where you don't have to worry about companies changing their busniness model just so they can make more money this isn't the game for you."

8038,"Okay by itself this game is the best horde shooter (i think thats the right term) even if you go loud running in fighting cops taking civilians hostage etc or going stealth where you take out guards cameras and make sure the cops don't appear its always fun (plus the mask customization is godly) but it'll get old pretty quick if you don't change the mission, but thats no concern because there is a UNGODLY amount of missions and all of this, can be done in multiplayer (which is how i play with my bestfriend) and when you pair a chaotic mission, multiplayer with friends, and a discord call, this will be the most fun you'll have with payday 2, and i am unable to fully put into words how fun it truly is because i've only been playing for 10 hours...but you gain levels so fast, the flash would cry and the more levels you have the more customization you can do, and with that brings more fun, and you already know what that means... if i continue on wee will be here all day so simply put, get some friends together (or don't you do you) and start up any mission and prepare for the most fun horde shooter of your life, do yourself a favour and get this game! -Radian"

8042,"I've played Payday 2 off and on over the years, and I think it's the game that just keeps on giving. It may seem like a one-trick pony, but that trick is incredibly satisfying and keeps people engaged for literal years on end. It seems so simple at first glance, but it is proof that great games don't need incredible graphics and a million different abilities and animations in order to have great gameplay. The game does what its players want it to do, and while there is a ton of DLC, it's all quite cheap and actually adds to the gameplay loop. I've never once had to ask myself, ""Do I need this DLC?"", because each DLC adds to that gameplay loop in its own way according to each individual's proclivities. 

Payday 2 is in a way a bit like the Hitman series, albeit much simpler with more action-oriented gameplay and is a bit more random due to placement of different items in each heist, meaning that not every heist is going to have X at Y location. Online gameplay is fluid, easy to jump in and out of, fun, and challenging. 

The game scratches the itch for the specific type of gamer who likes these games, and that's why it's still on top."
8043,"That pro gamer moment, when the devs pull a payday on you, giving jacksh*t for purchasing legacy collection. The most useless purchase I've ever made. Just go with the petty items given along with base game and have fun, don't invest."

What the fuck did you just fucking steal from here, you little clown? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in ZEAL, and I’ve been involved in numerous police raids on the Payday Gang, and I have over 300 confirmed custodies. I am trained in nightstick warfare and I’m the top cloaker in the entire Department of Homeland Surveillance. You are nothing to me but just another heister. I will kick you the fuck down with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this heist, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with stealing that money from the bank? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of tasers across Washington D.C. and your crew is being stunned right now so you better prepare for the storm, clown. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your heist. You’ll get what's coming for you, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can down you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare feet. Not only am I extensively trained in stealth combat, but I have access to the entire ventilation system of the Metropolitan area and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the District, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “stealth"" heist was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have played on Normal. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will wear it like a badge of honor.

8085,It's fun
8086,Awesome Game <3
8087,cant wait for payday 3 plus this game includes lots of fun for non dlc content as well as the dlc being worth the price
8088,Its a good game
8089,10/10 the best game i've played in a long time. 100% would recommend to others.
8090,"Payday 2 is a fantastic game to play with your buddies. I play with my friends on easier difficulties because we get to try crazy shit like a 23-round M1 Garand, or a Shotgun Revolver with Dragon's Breath. Payday 2 has a lot to offer, and while the heists are often very similar, it's a lot of brainless fun on lower difficulties, and a lot of ""I NEEEED A MEDIC BAG!"" on higher difficulties."
8091,"Just posting this for the people saying ""dead game lul"". The game is ranked 22nd on most played games on Steam, out of THOUSANDS. Sit down, shut the fuck up, and think about what you say. You'll thank me later."

8093,add borderless fullscreen
8094,"Still extremely fun to play and has a constant update schedule, plus the devs are also gaming & tv geeks."
8095,"Fun game, sometimes too tough due to top down balance. Every update introduces new weapons that are OP and break meta which isn't terrible, I just wish more weapons were free.
After a while the heists get boring and it's hard to go out of your way to challenge yourself, especially since new maps are often paid DLC.
But this can be incredibly fun with friends!"

edit I have made a grave mistake. I allowed the haze of strong emotion to cloud my judgement. I lobe u payday. U will always be my little game 😘"
8121,"Yes, This game is fun! i love the heist, story, characters, but despite all of that, i only have 1 flaw. Whatever heist i'm in, if it has a huge wave of cops. My game crashes. Please OVERKILL, fix this. Anyways, What i love about this game are the weapon customization. you can get any weapon from any Dlc, and you can add suppressors, long mags, long stocks, short stock, (some from Gage packets) etc etc. and most importantly, THE HEIST. I love how all of the Heist (well some of them don't connect to the story) are connected to the lore of the story."

8145,"While the stealth leaves something to be desired and is very uninteractive, I can't possibly recommend the rest of the game more. Combat is enjoyable, challenging when it comes to higher difficulties, and very fun. It is possible to build into becoming an unstoppable tank or a incredibly damaging one shot build, and all sorts of other fun, interesting, and engaging builds. Buildcrafting is wildly variable and in the perfect zone of being limited enough to make you care what you're investing in, but generous enough to give you everything you need, and makes making and using a build incredibly engaging. All and all, 8/10"

I don't know how to describe it but the feeling of taking down what feels to be all of America's police and Swat force makes me feels invincible. And then immediately after feeling that I would get dropkicked by a Cloaker. This game is amazing. If anyone who doesn't have Payday 2 reads this. I strongly recommend that you buy it.

8240,GQOD GAME
8241,"After a decade of consistent updates and dlc packs, there is more than ever to sink your teeth into; stealth will always be an imperfect system based on how it was implemented (running into enemies around corners or on stairs etc.) but it is still fun and satisfying. Engaging enemies feels satisfying and the selection of weapons means there is almost a guarantee that something will peak your interest. Play this game casually and you will have a great time, don't go hardcore after a specific goal or weapon as you may be gated by dlc cost, level / experience or in-game stolen money amount preventing you from reaching that goal for an indeterminent amount of time. This is the kind of game you keep coming back to and there's more to offer each time you jump in.

The VR mode is a great addition but assigning reload to the grip sensor was a terrible idea as during a gunfight you will subconsciously grip your controller with more force when firing which will repeatedly empty your clip to initiate a reload leaving you defensless until you can reattach ammo to gun."

 its far from perfect and the DLC model could use a looking too, like give us 1 DLC pack that has ALL future dlc the base game and current DLC for £15 - £20 bucks and get people playing it in VR so the newer players don't feel so intimidated by the older players and maybe people would actually use the voice chat too on the VR radio.

 overall its a great game and by no means perfect but it gives endless hours of enjoyment you wouldn't have had otherwise especially when you have someone to play with."

8323,"Very good game to just lean back on or  be comp. 

:)"
8324,"A solid solo or co-op experience.

The game has been around so long and has been given away so often that it is rather hard to say anything that has not already been talked to death or experienced first hand.

I have not felt compelled to buy any of the DLCs since they started Milking the game again, I think about it just to ""have it all"" again but it seems really hit and miss and then a whole mess of meaningless cosmetics.

I really enjoy the game tho and do recommend it to people that do not already have it. It is a game that stays in rotation with my friends something we can spool up, do some crime spree or quick heists that can be fit in with our busy lives when ever people are able and can load up."
8325,Good practice game before the real thing :)

I can't get over the fun masks they have and the ever-lasting joy this game brings me. I do not regret my purchase and will add on to my prized 38+ hours!

8361,"Enemies phasing through walls, enemies shooting you from the place that they're about to spawn from so you cant hit them because they are literally not there yet, enemies spawns are scattered around the maps in a brainded way(we love no mercy), instead of smart enemies we get borderlands2 OP 8 style scaling, cringe ending, certain dlcs are made with fuck off quality, insane amount of DLCs is basically mandatory, latest maps are dull, uninspired and boring, last difficulty is made for maybe 5 meta builds thus making 80% of the items skills and perks of the game useless, the only good map is shadow raid, wow we love payday 2

8438,"Summary
You play as various Hesters ranging from maniacs to ex military to youtubers as they rob, cook, frame, and get revenge across the world in a stealthy or Loud manner. They are given these jobs by contractors which are the best part of the game because of Giancarlo Esposito and Mira Furlan (God rest her soul). 

PROS
Great Gunplay
Cool and Free cosmetics
No lootboxes
Great replayability  
Over 75 heist to play
Great Customization
A playable shitpost
You can join randoms or friends with DLCs you don't have
Stoic

CONS
Hard to understand aspects
Overabundance of DLC
Diesel Engine (It's a very unstable engine that is meant for racing games)
Not very good driving (It's made on a racing engine and the driving is bad)

MIDDLE (Things that are good and bad)
Mod Support but due to the engine might completely break the game
Over 1,200+ Achievements but about half of the achievements are doing a heist on a difficulty 
VR Support but has a weird set up 

Overall
This is a fun game solo and with friends. There are some issues but they are overshadowed by the enjoyment this game can bring.
 
Score
9/10"
8439,Amazing bank heist game. Great lore. Would recommend a medic bag.
8440,i like hitting people in the head with comically large spoon
8441,"I consistently talk an absurd amount of trash and negativity regarding this game when it is brought up in conversation, but that is due to my own burnout and experiences with this game through its 9 year development cycle. Despite the insane road it took to get to the point it is now, Payday 2 remains one of, if not the greatest multiplayer co-op shooter of the modern day. A game with absurd replayability, content, and challenges to keep you entertained and spicing things up. I hate this game, but I also love it, and I hope people continue to keep its legacy going."

8471,"Game is certainly better now than it was when they released the skins. The choice for both approaches with the newer heists is really good too, even if some of them are easier than others. Going to keep supporting Payday for :)"
8472,Did you know that a 'weapon' is any device used with intent to inflict damage or harm to living beings or structures?
8473,Great game and I hope Payday 3 if or when it comes out will be just as good if not even better. There are some bugs. Minor bugs that good be fixed but it makes the game that much more enjoyable and funny to play. The bugs aren't really a hindrance but instead more of an added bonus to the game. There are an unbelievable amount of weapons strategies and things to rob from nukes to a tiara. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.
8474,fun game

Nothing works ever, enemies rarely die and will require a north korean fucking missile up their ass followed by the force of muhammed the prophet himself curb stomping their skull into a brick wrapped in barbed wire to even scratch them, every time I power on this game I want to commit suicide and begin praying to god that someone comes into my house and shoots me to death, this games somehow worse then borderlands 2 and that game makes me want to commit hate crimes to whatever retarded 7 year old with a half functioning brain made borderlands 2, again games horrible and buggy DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."

8572,It's a decent shooter that actually requires some skill. RNG elements of missions though are very annoying sometimes. Also there's way too much dlc for this game. 9/10. (Would be 8 but the modding ability makes it a solid 9)

8625,good
8626,"After playing this game for ~1000 hours on and off since late 2014, I figured I could at least make a review of how I feel about the lovable nightmare that is Payday 2.
And taking a trip down memory lane, the game changed alot in the 6 years I've played it, starting fresh at least FOUR times due to computer/system changes, on top of modding it to hell and back didn't help either.

But ooh boy this game has some really bad first impressions : lack of any menu or stats tutorials (I see soo many players with no perk deck upgrades) and lackluster heist tutorial that is so scripted it barely teaches anything about how the game works, along with so many difficulty settings that either don't feel any different to huge gaps in difficulty all the way to a new story order for missions that not only makes little sense in the timeline, but it also jumps around in difficulty and design quality so much you're honestly better off ignoring it for some time. 
Speaking of story, the ""lore"" of the game is so convoluted you're better off watching youtube videos about it (still don't get it by the way).
Now to talk about possibly the worst aspect of the game : the JANK, starting with the engine, I'm honestly surprised the game not only runs but also is being modded so well given the obscure engine it's running on ! But that's the only positives I can give it, the performance are awful (it's still just a 32-bit game that runs on a single core !!!) and the game is prone to crashing, even on vanilla (loading some heists on high settings straight up closes my game in some extreme cases), with the absolute DUMBEST AI pathing and enemy behavior I've seen in a long time.
There's also the stealth behaviour of the game, with the biggest issues being the host-based detection and getting instantly spotted in some obscure cases you otherwise wouldn't. There's also the infamous ""detection loop"" where someone or something gets detected by a guard, said guard is detected by another guard which in turn is detected by a camera which sounds the alarm instantly.
I also cannot talk about this heist without talking about repetitive it can get, the entire game is basically one giant grind to max level and once you're there uhhh ... achievements I guess ?
You can add on top of it all some fairly absurd monetization of weapons and their mods, missions and weapon skins (because of course, thankfully most of them are ugly as sin) but thankfully all of the ""main story"" DLCs as well as the first secondary story arc are now bundled each in their own discounted package.
And abit of a personnal thing, but I wish the game had some better sound design to help identify better when you're getting shot at.

But I'm very happy to say that everything else sound-wise in this game is absolute gold ! Be it the soundtrack (minus a couple but that's just personal taste), the gun noises, the special units callouts or the voice acting (no the H3H3 heisters don't count as ""acting""), all of this is great !
There's also the sheer comedic aspect of some of these voice lines - especially some pager answering ones, but the cops have some great ones too, especially the special units.
Speaking of cops, the gameplay in this game is amazing : It's responsive and feels great. The guns and their animations are really responsive and gives great feedback with your actions (like helmets popping and such).
Did I say guns ? Right, they're the main reason you'd buy this game : the weapon customization is through the roof ! From sleek and classy frames to the most absurd Mall Ninja meme shit, there are so many options and accessories you may as well spend more time in the inventory recreating movie/game weapons than actually shooting them with how good the customization is here.
And while I only mentioned them a little bit earlier, mods are really what makes this game playable for me nowadays : customizable HUD, view model and menus ; better performance, heisters and enemies reskins as well as reskinned or entirely new weapons, characters, heists, ... From must-have quality of life changes to the most obscure fandom memes, the modding community never ceases to amaze me !

Despite all its flaws, this is one of my favorite games ever. There's a reason it's my most played game according to Steam !"

8635,"kinda like l4d but with your robbing banks and shooting hordes of cops

very arcadey feel, but the missions are fun

I mostly played in VR and that made some missions and things hard to learn because im also learning a weird control scheme as it wasn't built for VR. It was also like button reload instead of motions, but at least the inverse kinematics are there and you can see VR players arms and stuff move

I had fun tho, at least theres a healthy online pop to play with VR since it has 2D players. lots to do and upgrade too to keep you coming back to ""level up"" so to speak"

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

But on a serious note this game has a lot going for it, incredible soundtrack, huge weapon variety and character customization, fun characters and voice lines, and a universe that lets you live out your masculine urge to wear a clown mask and ""Steal from the Rich and Give to Yourself"". 

The only negatives of the game are so tiny that they're pretty negligent, the main one being that some times when you alt+tab into the game you have the ingame cursor and your normal cursor and they both move at different speeds, which sounds annoying and it is for a little but you find yourself not really caring when your able to slaughter hordes of human amoeba's just fine with it on your screen"

8761,I have just over 2000 hours in this game across all its releases. I can say with utmost certainty it's a blast with or without DLC you can just turn your brain off and feel the power fantasy. If that gets boring crank the difficulty up and find a powerful meta build and go nuts taking down the challenges of DSOD. Yes the DLCs have gotten outta hand but not having them doesn't make that game unplayable so if that's whats been stopping you pick the game up for 10 bucks and try it for yourself buy a bundle if you like it and wanna support

8774,"Fast paced, easy to start, pleasant community, and loads of content! Slightly wacky, but hey, that's what you sing up for when you buy a game about clowns robbing banks. With mini-guns. And sometimes comically large spoons."
8775,how come i never play this game anymore?
8776,"I recommend this game because, There is so much fun to play with friends.
There is so many characters, weapons and heists. So many masks that you can customize. 
I LOVE THIS GAME!!"
8777,"i didn,t buy the game just to get annoyed with bug in white huse all time it will alart even sitting on a helicopter in nomercy i can,t get the simple wtf"

8785,"PAYDAY 2 is one of those games I have a love-hate relationship with.

On the surface, the game promises a fun, wacky wave-based horde shooter system. But once you actually get into it, you find out that most of the content is locked behind way too much DLC and the game runs on a racing game engine from 2006 (and even then the driving is horrible).

Don't even bother playing online with randoms, either. The public servers are either full of cheaters or you get kicked out instantly because f*ck you.

The only ""anti-cheat"" the game has will only slap you with a ""cheater"" tag on your nameplate. That's it. Not even a VAC ban. Sometimes the game will even falsely flag you if it thinks one of your mods are allowing you to cheat

This game is on life support, and OVERKILL needs to just pull the plug already and focus on only developing PAYDAY 3 instead of making more DLC for 2"
8786,yes
8787,amazing
8788,Boring
8789,"I would say that the DLCs are actually worth buying, there are so many achievements which give you a good incentive to play this game even more and the game itself is kind of repetitive and tiring when you have to wait but otherwise, it's the best experience you could have with your friends."

8800,"Amazing game to play with friends, visuals are stunning, a shit ton of crossovers, you can go silent or guns blazing. You can even go into a bank, and rob it only using a fucking comically large gold spoon. it's ridiculous in a good way (also supports vr)

though, it is 80 gigabytes so take that how you will"

8813,i love this game
8814,"This is the most expensive $10.00 game I have ever played, the devs have consistently lied to the playerbase to varying degrees for nearly a decade, and final content bundles have never been final. Buy it anyway, Vlad alone is worth the cost of admission as he is in fact an upstanding citizen with no links to a group of mass murderers whatsoever. If that isn't convincing, murdering endless hordes of clone-cops is extremely cathartic, there is a ton of meth to be made, and many, many heavy objects to lug around because you forgot where the engine clues are again."
8815,"great game, doesnt get boring after a while, and is easy to play and get used to. Does sometimes require money for DLC's to get better weapons"
8816,"Very great game, very strategic has every element of robbing banks it has the planning ,the comms, the crew.
It is a great experience based on crimes. Missions are a little lengthy but the game has so much elements that it makes even the lengthier of the lengthiest missions fun. Wouldn't recommend playing solo with AI crew because the game is better with your friends and it makes it more fun. All praises to the developers. 10/10"
8817,it's a great game to lose time in!
8818,most awesome game if you computer can handle it.

8825,"great game very fun, i like atempting very hiest i can stealth"
8826,"A very enjoyable and solid game with tons of loot, enemies to head shot, and loot to grab.

Just grabbing the base game will get you plenty of content in the form of heists / missions to do, guns, skills, and masks. Since Payday 2 lacks a demo I would recommend the heists Four Stores, Jewelry Store, and the various Bank (Cash, Gold, Unknown) as they can be played through fairly quickly in the 2 hour refund limit.

The DLC is not necessary to play but does contain a lot of useful and powerful weapons as well as cool heists."
8827,HEHEHEHEHE big spoon go thwonk
8828,"its a good game, but in my opinnion its not for everyone if you dont have friends.But if you have friends you can have fun even if this game is not your type genre."
8829,"good game:)

8830,yes gun

8832,cloaker go burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
8833,"If you're hunting for achievements, you can stop here. 90% of it requires multiple DLCs. They add achievements for DLCs and there's like 1000 of them. 

I got it on sales some time ago and finally got to play it. The game itself is pretty fun for a short while. After you manage to join other people's game who had DLC and play the same couple of stories, it becomes repetitive and all you do is kill massive amount of spawning cops of difficulty levels.

The UI is terrible. The crime net was confusing with many of the options available only for DLC. I didn't know how to I had skill points or how to use them until I really went through each of the buttons."

8866,"I have played this game since 2016 and on 3 different platforms in total, each platform had brought something new. The Xbox 360 version had introduced me to the heisting. The PlayStation 4 version had more heists and weapons, but no ending to the story line.  The PC version however, has way more jobs and heists than the other two versions, plenty more weaponry, and a story line with both endings. Payday 2 has always been there on my days of blue, so if you like shooting cops and stealing cold hard cash, then this game is for you."
8867,"I like the game but if you do any job solo, it becomes a giant struggle because the AI can be very bad. I hope payday 3 gets a big AI overhaul that makes it less of a struggle."

8951,"I've known about this game for a long time and only recently picked it up. And boy am I glad I did. The game has a little bit of everything. There's tons of content after 9 years of updates and DLCs. This game has hiests for people who like to be slow and methodical and heists for those who just want to just blow stuff up.

Pros:

100s of weapons with something for everyone.
A lot of different missions ranging for stealthily stealing shipments to raiding the motherfucking FBI.
Tons of customisation from the guns, characters and even skills and perks.
Interesting story if not a bit over the top.
Different difficulties from incredibly easy to down right impossible.

Cons:

Some bugs, but that's a given for how old the engine is.
Random crashes, again given the reason above.
Some enemies are down right OP.
All the cool stuff is locked behind DLC.
After a while, you start playing the same heists over and over.
AI team mates are kinda dumb.

Would I recommend this game? Abso-fucking-lutely. I also recommend you annoy your friends into getting the game as its so much better when you can shout at your friends to drop a medic bag instead of the AI."

8963,"So after playing it for as long as I have, I just can't recommend this game to people, to be quite honest.
With the amount of stuff labelled as ""DLC"" that they churn out, it's just way too much money. It feels like you're investing in a company, and I feel like even then, you'd at least get something tangible out of it that you could use on something else.
I bid thee adieu, PAYDAY."

For others (literally anyone who plays another autism shooter as the mind can only take one at a time) its way to grindy and too complicated to get into. I highly recommend getting through the grind and the complications because underneath is a really fun game filled to the brim with fun and bullshit like every coop shooter. 10/10 game despite it being so old.

9001,"As an player who play this game since 2015, this game isn't really something I enjoy a lot nowadays.
To be fair, the gameplay is good and fun when you have decent teammates, but the content of the game changed a lot, for those who are new to the game, HRT is gone and assault status have been tweaked. The overall gameplay is pretty straight forward right now and thas is kinda boring to me.
Not to mention a shxt tons of DLCs, the company is trying to sell skins and useless weapon with gadgets for a price more than 10 USD.
If you guys are fine with it, then purchase the game and DLCs. Though the game is pretty much a dead game now."

Your transporting goats with crack up their ass
Robbing the damn White House
You go into the middle of the damn ocean to revive a squad mate

9016,ahahahaahah clocker
9017,"good

9018,"After few hundred hours and a few hundred crashes after modding the game or just the poor game performance made from a racing game engine. Still would recommend the hassle. As long you got friends don't even bother with pubs especially stealth, fuck stealth. No honestly. Get the game and the DLC's when they're on a sale."

"
9033,"Enjoyable game to play with friends if your messing around or bored. A lot of people would probably say not to play, or not worth it. I don’t see why, I enjoyed playing through everything. Granted, it has its moments when it  glitches. But not a bad game at all."

9060,"Amazing game. Allows the player to earn weapons, attachments, and cosmetics just by playing the game. While there are some paywalls for certain parts of the game such as activities, cosmetics, and weapons the game is fun regardless. If you have friends to play with i recommend buying this to have some great times, and even if you don't have a friend that wants to play, there are plenty of websites you can use to find someone."

9073,"jesse, i need a medic bag"
9074,ha ha gun go brrrrrrrrrrrr
9075,"Still haven't mastered the game yet, still working on the secret ending achievements.
Gotta say there are few games that have gripped me as much as this one. Between the gun play and the stealth heists there is so much action all the time.
There is no feeling in the world better than finally nailing a death sentence one down heist.

9141,"Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include:
Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become addicted.
Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited. Genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes.
Parents and peers. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke are also more likely to try it.
Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers.
Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers.

Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even ""all natural"" or herbal cigarettes have harmful chemicals.

You already know that people who smoke cigarettes are much more likely to develop and die of certain diseases than people who don't smoke. But you may not realize just how many different health problems smoking causes:

Lung cancer and lung disease. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer deaths. In addition, smoking causes lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse.
Other cancers. Smoking increases the risk of many types of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, throat (pharynx), esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix and some types of leukemia. Overall, smoking causes 30% of all cancer deaths.
Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attacks and strokes. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition.
Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems.
Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration.
Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men.
Complications during pregnancy. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of preterm delivery and giving birth to lower birth weight babies.
Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, the flu and bronchitis.
Tooth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis).
Smoking also poses health risks to those around you. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. Children whose parents smoke are more prone to worsening asthma, ear infections and colds."
9142,Cool shooty game.
9143,"(sorry for bad english)  get it, you will like it , then get over it. un install it, then re install it again because the comunity and producer support all over again."

9149,"Personally I feel very fond of this game. Maybe I sound a little biased but I gotta confess that I've enjoyed this game thus far. I've left the game around 2016 because I had little time left to play, so when I came back and saw that the community and the game were flourishing again made me feel happy :D.

Game related, at first I just wanted something that could make me feel the hint of what it's like to be pushed against a wall with nothing more than my skills and guts to survive and complete my objetive..., and it was here :3.

So yeah, my advice would be, give it a try, why not?
Maybe at first glance won't be your usual FPS but it'll show you another face of the coin that you can enjoy."
9150,amazing game overall
9151,"if i had to describe this game in a few words it would be yes, just yes."

9164,Great fun with friends. I have played this quite a lot in VR with HTC VIVE and Oculus Quest 2 with my friends some in desktop some in VR. The free VR DLC/update works very well and I personally haven't had any major issues while playing this game.

9174,good game. money hungry ass devs tho. this some sims 4 dlc type shit.
9175,"This is much more than ""Robbing Banks with friends.""

The game has been given countless DLCs and is brimming with endless content including Heists, playable characters, crossovers and OG content that can keep you busy for ages. With the new Texas Heat Campaign right around the corner it is the perfect time to pick up this gem.

You steal nukes, cook meth, raid the FBI, Break out Criminals. And kidnap Goats.

Kill cops with flamethowers, Russians with Commically Large Spoons, Mexican Federales with Chainsaws and Specs Ops Mercs with your own bare hands.

Combine the already absurd base game items and situations with custom heists, guns, characters and full blown Fan Made DLCs for free on Beardlib Modding you got yourself a endless stream of content to enjoy.

TL;DR

Haha funni Dallas Scream Medic Bag."
9176,so much gold it makes a jewish man happy. and money. loooooooooooots of money.

10/10 we live in a society 🤡🤡"
9180,"very fun, even on VR it feels great!!"
9181,"""A pantomime discovers that his lover has hung herself. He tries to explain, silently, the experience of this new horrific shock. Realizing that words cannot convey the feeling, the mime goes back to the usual street performance; casually leaning against nothing, trying to escape a box that is growing ever smaller, pulling on a rope. The movements so graceful, yet betray an anguish so great that when the mime pretends to fight the wind, you can feel the gust tugging at your shirt."" - Christopher Hopkins
good game"
9182,"the new Russia medic looks shit never take ideas from anyone with 3D model it be way better if the russia medic was in a snow cameo in i mean it was cold country tho..kinda say. sorry but i got no respect for overkills no matter how hard they try. not after removing the most famous ones from the movies (lucky it wasn't ron perlmans one) but Al Pacino's one as scarface? typical way to give people the ""BAD"" news is more then a crap one. jacket.. ( which i have not heard but do not care about that character from hotline Miami) well...atleast i'm already tired of his "" robotic girl voice"" that already annoys me good riddance at last. anyway..there no issue about the models but i do have problems with mods in the online mode. that's the biggest problem."

9188,"I think the dev's need a ""moral compass"" dlc. The dlc total is 20x the base product cost. Despicable conduct."
9189,"I got this for free in 2017. Pretty fun game, I said to myself then, but I wasn't mature enough to appreciate it fully. Now, in 2022 I can honestly say, I fell in love with it. Let's see how far I can take it. The only problem for me would be graphics - excusable since the game came out in 2013 and some weird mechanics in stealth that encourage you to try and play at Usain Bolt, trying to evade guards' and cameras' vision."

9193,"Fantastic game. Though there are a lot of DLCs to be paid for, they are worth it considering the low price of the base game and the amount of content it gives out. In addition to that, this game is also easily moddable, so that also extends the ""fun"" aspect too. Here's hoping Payday 3 will be just as good, and just as moddable!"
9194,i hate this game

9204,yes
9205,You get to play as a funny british guy who has a funny british accent. 10/10
9206,good game :)
9207,"almost 10 years later and payday 3 on the horizon this game still surprises me with a long list of different heists and ways you can do most of them, i can only give this game a thumbs and would give it something better if i could. I will continue to put time into this game because its a memory to my childhood with the first game. I can do almost anything in anyway, tank bullets, dodge bullets and shoot even more bullets. If your too critical or lack the part of your brain that releases fun juices then you will see this as a mindless cop horde shooter game which happens to involve robbing a bank or something of that nature. But you if enjoy having a good time and have friends to play it with then its a worthy investment of not only your money but your time. You can raid the white house, rob different sized banks and much much more; there is even a ending if you follow the lists of heists Bane gives to you. With 158.9 hours so far what more could i ask for? Honestly Couldn't tell ya, because there is already so much to this game that most player barely get to scratch. Not to mention yeah there are micro transactions but it is mostly for weapon skins and the like, nothing that could hinder your gameplay in any way. Sometimes you will get a safe that you can open for free and out pops a skin you can sell for money on your steam account. No money spent to do this besides buying the game and dlcs if your interested but if you have a friend with hella dlc then dont worry cuz you can still play whatever map you want with them as long as they are the host. Only downside to not having dlcs is the weapons that become available when you purchase them BUT you can still make it work without them but its always nice to have them. For reference when there is a huge sale (summer/winter steam sale) the most of the dlcs if not all are $1 a piece. So as of now with the game being only $10 on steam and about $5 on G2A it is a very good game and even better with friends who are not smooth brained."

9230,"Throw me five years ago with this game in my hands and I would have recommended it but now, just no. This game is outdated in every possible aspect. 
> The AI is utterly stupid, running into your bullets, the only difficulty residing into their sheer number and HP amount. Stealth is a massive cheesegame with an AI either seeing through walls or blind to a guy hidding behind a pot of flower three feet away from them. It's just a game of ""which couch will hide me from the omniscient blind guy on rails"".
> The graphics are horrendous and the game's engine is a massive failure. Google Chrome has nothing on how it eats up your ressources and is willing to crash for maps that are barrely more developped than some CS:GO ones.
> The balance is lame. Each class of weapon is divided into four subclasses: lots of ammo - low damage; medium ammo capacity - medium damage; low ammo capacity - high damage. And the fourth: Utterly broken because it's part of the last paid DLC and people need an incentive to buy it because Payday 3 needs funding. Same for the perks. The meta is pretty much ""use the last added broken thing Overkill hasn't fixed yet"" if you wanna be effective on the high difficulties.
> Multiplayer is fun if you and your friend(s) are willing to put your brain aside, or suffer a meltdown because of frustrating game mechanics and desyncs. Oh and don't play with randos unless you wanna stumble upon cheaters over cheaters over cheaters because anticheats are hard.
Not worth whatever money it's sold for currently."

9252,"Given the short period of only a 3-hour worth of playtime experience, the game was tight enough to keep me engaged and wanting back for more. I imagine for a co-op + fps game to be based entirely around the criminal lifestyle landscape, it would turn out to be an easy-to-digest type of game and then morph into an easy-to-forget type of a game. Goddamn was I wrong, it had a tidy selection of variables meshed unto the gameplay mechanics such as the different scenario for each maps, the proprietary approach, equipment roster (which equipment would suit best for a map), safety net planning just in case things go south, role fulfillment and more. The visual aspect is not bad, I believe the graphical details are poppy and accurate enough to satisfy your craving for realism specially for a game in this genre, which is respectfully understandable. Audio aspect is also worthy to be mentioned, soundtracks can be set to your liking. Add character and weapon customization in the mix and you already have a solid view of what Payday 2 offers. There are many types of playas out there. I am the smash-and-grab, clap that foo' type of one, I like it loud, extremely risky but slow and also fast. I will give this a honest 8/10. Also cocaine, try not to get addicted to it at least virtually."

9311,Payday 2 is a heist game so you might be wondering if it's worth getting when GTAV exists however there are many good reasons. If you liked the heist aspect from GTAV at all you will love Payday 2. It just does heisting infinitely better than GTAV. The car physics in this game are very aged but other than that the game does not feel old by any means. The game is still being updated (Update came out a few days ago) and there are 70 or so DLC's that you can buy if you ever want more content. It is still a worthy purchase almost 9 years after release and I highly recommend you check it out.

Sometimes completely desyncs from other players on team (you end up with two different branches of the same game, that never seem to resync).

Stealth bugs make me want to die. Desync even when I'm the host (visual, not network desync), guards that can see through walls, bags stuck midair, and more. 
Game has randomly crashed many times after spending 30 mins on a heist, escape is often glitched, stuck in a wall, downed and instantly revived and then teleported into custody 20 seconds later despite being completely alive and not downed. So buggy it's unplayable."

Quite cheap for the great game it's...
The graphics are not bad at all, in fact it are quite well preserved, it doesn't have any bugs (or at least I haven't found any).

TL:DR- this game is amazing and you should play this with friends for maximum enjoyment."

9471,police head go brrrrrrr
9472,"Normally, grindy games with no real stopping point don't capture my interest much. I often rely on a driving force toward a final boss or narrative climax of some sort (and while Payday 2 has the latter, it isn't in the way that would normally catch my fancy). But Payday 2 is an exception to this, with a very addicting gameplay loop, pure freedom in gameplay options, and an interesting plot to boot.

Let's start with the pros, shall we? The main draw of the game is the pure build freedom available to you, because holy FUCK are there a lot of weapons, skills and equipment to choose from. Any play style that you're interested in (in terms of FPS games, anyway), Payday 2 almost certainly has it, both in terms of guns and perks that allow you to play the game however you want to, and while you're very limited in terms of options in the very beginning, the weapons and skills at your disposal quickly ramp up over time.

Of course, Payday 2 isn't a perfect game. While most of it's glitches don't affect gameplay experience, there will be the occasional glitch or bug that forces a restart, and while it isn't common, it isn't an extreme rarity, and will likely happen every now and then. And while there's plenty of content available without any DLC purchases, there is a massive amount of content that's included with DLC, which can make things seem very limited if you're unwilling to spend a bit of cash to get DLC weapons and heists.

Despite it's flaws, though, Payday 2 is, in my opinion, a very fun game once you get into it.

9/10."

9540,"This game is pretty good, but not quite as good as Cinnamon Pull Apart Bread!

What you'll need:

- A 9x13 Pan (preferably glass)
- Non Stick Spray
- 2 Tubes of Biscuits (Pillsbury or Otherwise)
- 1 and 1/2 sticks of Salted Butter (Unsalted also works, just be sure to add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in step 3)
- 4 Teaspoons of Brown Sugar
- 1 Teaspoon of Cinnamon
- 1 Tablespoon of Honey
- 2 Tablespoons of Milk, Heavy Cream, or Buttermilk (Non-Dairy Milks work as well. See Step for more info) (More as Needed)
- 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar (more as needed)

Step 1. Preheat your oven to 350 and give your pan a light coat of non-stick spray

Step 2. POP THEM BISCUITS OPEN BABY!!

Once you get the biscuits out, grab a butterknife (or use your hands you filthy animal) and quarter them. Start laying em out in the pan. Spaces in-between the biscuits is A-okay cause we want that buttersugar to get down in there once we start pouring. Likely, you'll run into the issue of ""too many biscuit pieces, not enough space"" so just kinda squish em down and try to fill in the edges and corners with an extra biscuit piece. Once you've got all the biscuits packed in there, we're on to step 3!

Step 3. BUTTERSUGAR TIME

Grab your 1 and 1/2 Sticks of butter and we're gon' melt that son of a gun. Personally, I like to melt butter in the microwave, but if you wanna get all fancy and pull out the saucepan then go for it. Ain't nobody stopping you.

So for the rest of us common folk, put your butter in a microwave safe bowl or Pyrex measuring cup. I throw it in there for like 1min and just check on it closer to the minute mark, but we all got different microwaves. Basically, you just want the butter to be melted with no chunks left in it. So however long it takes to do that. DON'T leave it in too long or it'll burn and then you gotta go get more butter.

NOW. You've got your melted butter. Add the Cinnamon and the brown sugar to it and stir the everliving life outta that thing til' it's all nice and pretty. Once you've successfully crafted the buttersugar, pour it over the biscuits in the pan. My two main goals here are ""1. Make sure every biscuit gets some love"" and ""2. Fill in all the cracks"" So pour slow and steady.

Step 4. MAKE IT HOT

Okay. Let me level with you here. I am not a classically trained baking professional. I'm just a regular schmegular person who likes the sweety sweets. I have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ these up before and this is the step that made my spouse leave.

Double check the oven is on 350. Put the little biscuits in the oven so that they can grow up to be big and strong. Leave them in there for about 10-13min. Be sure to check on your biscuits throughout the process. What you're looking for is the tops to be golden brown. Like that real fresh baked brown, that you see in the movies and tv and recipe sites. Once you see golden brown, open the oven and don't be afraid to get a little greedy. Grab a biscuit off the top so you can see how the middle section and bottom of the pan look.

If it looks doughy Turn the oven off and let the biscuits sit inside for maybe 5 minutes. Again, note the color of the tops and go back to your reference piece that you took out. You want them to look like done biscuits. I can't put pictures but I'll make a guide if people are interested and go back through all the steps with pictures.

If it doesn't look doughy Well then what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing? Move on to the next step champ! We got biscuits to eat!

Step 5. Make the Glaze

In a good sized bowl, whisk together your Powdered sugar, honey, and milk. If you don't have a whisk, that's fine. Just go grab a utensil or something. Personal preference: Fork. They look meaner than the other utensils.

NON-DAIRY MILK USERS UNITE!
I really like an almond milk substitute here, but whatever works, works. Just know, with the amount of ingredients we're using here, your glaze may come out thin and runny. If it does, don't panic and cry. Just add a little more powdered sugar in tablespoon increments. Add, whisk and repeat if it still comes out runny. Once it's thick enough, go ahead on.

Take your whisked mixture and and drizzle it over the finished biscuits. And boom done. You just baked something delicious.

If you read this far, thank you. If you liked the recipe, thank you. I'll try to make a guide and go back through with pictures and gifs to make this a lot easier to follow if enough people want that.

Call the ones you love, tell em you love them.

Let me know what recipe you want me to do next.

9547,"PAYDAY 2 is a pretty good game, though I feel that you will enjoy the game much more if you have the DLC. Most of the good content is locked behind DLC, though fortunately you can buy the Legacy Edition for remotely cheap, and it has a majority of the good DLC. Sadly, you can no longer get the Scarface DLC due to licensing issues. To the actual game though, the gunplay is some of the best I've ever seen. Though it can get very repetitive when not doing stealth (which is also very odd, like stealth just functions really weirdly and for me at least is not as enjoyable), as most of the loud heists are just ""Go to _____"" ""Use drill"" ""Wait for ____"" and though it does get repetitive after a while, it can still be extremely fun, especially with a group of friends, though playing with randoms online is also pretty fun assuming they aren't a hypersweat. The soundtrack is also extremely good, like by all accounts the soundtrack on a game where you rob stuff should not be as good as it is. Jacket is also the best heister, I'm not accepting criticism at this time. We all know its true."

9576,"Payday is a game where you steal shit and shoot guns. Sometimes, you steal some very cursed shit while shooting VERY cursed guns, during which the thought never escapes that the only reason you're in Vegas after said cursed stuff is because you shot a Russian druglord for Gus from Breaking Bad.

Still with me? No? Good. Time for some genuine shit.

Payday 2, generally, is great fun IF you play loud. The flow of jobs and especially the combat are amazing, and the customization beyond your weapons lends well to individuality while (mostly) still being viable for most difficulities. You wanna OUTRUN FUCKING BULLETS carrying a heavy ass RPK? You can do that. You wanna be a bitch and AFK Alesso Holdout with turrets and AI? You can do that. Just...Do not stealth. Stealth in this game is a piece of shit and I hate it. The only good stealth-only heist is Yacht Heist. Also staying quiet means you missing out on Simon Viklund's LEGENDARY soundtrack.

The main other issue comes from the piece of shit engine this game was developed on. Diesel is a crime against humanity and should've been thrown in the trash long ago. This game has some of the weirdest bugs, and also sometimes shield units clipping through walls just to shoot you. Though, in fairness, it's not like the rest of the game isn't utter chaos and most bugs don't really get in the way. At some point, you WILL develop Stockholm Syndrome for Diesel's shenanigans. After all, at this point it's part of the charm.

As for getting your hands on this buggy, chaotic masterpiece, here's the thing. The beginning and endgame heists are available through the base purchase of $10. Don't get me wrong, it's a steal at $10 even with just those 20-30 jobs. But you want Legacy Collection. That'll get you everything released from launch through 2018. Well worth the higher price tag, especially considering you'll get access to all but 3 perk decks (RIP Scarface Character Pack)

also donacdum and buy the h3h3 character pack. it's ass, the two's vo performances make me wanna rewatch SAO over listening to them, the perk deck sucks, and it's not even in Legacy Collection.

and if you're still on the fence, just know you can beat a guy holding a minigun in a bomb suit to death with a giant golden spoon while your friend calls you a wanker"

9623,"this game is amazing and all but we cant forget about the glitches that happens in the game such as the glitch in the white house mission when you going on stealth sometimes the guards faraway from you dies for no reason and the whole mission go nuts or when you're in the helicopter the guards who is 10 meters away from you detects you in the first 27 seconds of the game and you have to restart again and hope for not getting detected again in the first 27 seconds, game developers ihope you fix this annoying glitch or just delete the mission from the game"

One day I got onto the game and it crashed it kept crashing every time i would launch it. I still love the game and I would still play it if i could. I have tried everything I could to get the game to work and it just wont work. I played this game every day with my friends and had a bunch of in game cash but I cant play it anymore so it is what it is

9705,"By far one of the best games I have ever played on Steam. There is a ton of awesome people to meet online to play with, there is endless heists, weapons, and a ton of different ways that the game can be approached and played. You can use rocket launchers to rob neighborhood banks, or you could stealth up and enjoy the game in that sense. This game is definitely fun and addictive though, and I do recommend it for the price. If you enjoy first-person shooter games with a ton of customization, this is another game that you would end up enjoying."

9764,"i dont get why people think this game is hard, definetly on the last 2 difficulties but its a realy fun casual bank robber criminal game you get to level and build your criminal up with neat gadgets, perks, and weapons. fun stealth game and fun horde game. great thing is you feel like theyre isnt restrictions like in other games like GTA you just stea stuff and  always have room for bonus, and pulling off a hiest stealth that gets realy tough if it goes loud feels like you actualy got away with something. customizeation is great too enev though its alittle limited with random unlocks at the end of a mission, but there is variety unlocked at the start for me to be unique. 

only negitive this game has is its comunity, be careful of online unless you host the game yourself as people can just Kick you at the very end and you get nothing for what can sometimes take an hour to achieve even 20 min feels bad though, and a slight negitive is the bots in the offline mode arent the best to say the least they serve to revive you and trade hostages for you but offline is a 1 player one man heist, they even wont mask up and help if you are stealth so offline can be tougher then it has too be and tiedious when you have to move 20 bags of gold by yourself"

EDIT:
for some reason this game (and only this game) really dislikes my PC. like, i'd be playing and suddenly BOOM, my keyboard and mouse would disconnect leaving me for dead. keep this in mind, before you buy any DLC's (and fyi, ive tried everything. windows updates, verified game files, driver updates and even straight up replacing my keyboard and mouse, to no avail)"

9870,ddope azzzz game had high expectations after #1 and was not dissapointed
9871,"One of the MUST HAVE games when looking for games to play with friends. Relies on teamwork, everyone plays a crucial role in the game no matter what (yes, even those told to stand outside and do absolutely nothing). Very potato computer friendly (Unless you're running a heist that has more than 50 entities on screen). It's buggy nature is lovable and I wouldn't wish it to be any other way <3"

"
9880,I tore my kneecaps off and sold them on the dark web just to buy all of the DLC in this work of art.
9881,This game takes four players and allows them to join a game to complete heists. The missions are tough so working as a team pays off in making the heist go smoother. The game play is fast and is quite exciting when having to either dodge  cops and security guards in stealth or blast your way out of a jam like the movie 'Heat'. Fun first person shooter.

9978,"i have killed many men
"
9979,i just love to get rid of bullets that have been fired into my abdominal region just by drinking a bottle of whiskey and pretending like nothing happened
9980,"Amazing game with a bit of a learning curve.

Payday 2 feels like as much of a puzzle game as it does an FPS; the stealth is incredibly addicting, as it forces you to avoid line of sight with the guards and gives you a sense of mischief as you defy the laws of physics to jump-crouch 20 feet past a guard without getting seen.

Loud mode is just as fun, giving a new feeling to the term ""hoard shooter"". You can try to beat heists as fast as possible to avoid heavy confrontation, or you can set up shop on a heist like ""Meth Lab"" and cook meth for 2 hours to get stupid amounts of money. There are countless guns/attachments to make sure you never get bored, a plethora of worthwhile DLC, and a metric buttload of achievements.

Overall amazing game, would recommend to anyone looking for a refreshing FPS with fun, yet challenging mechanics 10/10"

We've been going the distance
Aiming for the sky
With a secret ambition
It's not our thing to walk the road that's paved
We're not the ones who roam the trail that's blazed
And there's a flame in your eyes that's igniting mine
I know I've seen it before
In the gaze of the prowling lion
I'm not afraid anymore!

[Chorus]
Let's break the rules!
And really put our backs into it
Max out, pursue it
What's a better time than now to cross the line
Don't brake, let loose
And make sure that your heart is in it
Start line to finish
For every second rushing by we're losing time

[Verse 2]
You and I
Breaking free of our prisons
We defy
The control of the system
The thunder's growing louder in our hearts
A storm is rising, this is where it starts!

[Chorus]
Let's break the rules!
And really put our backs into it
Max out, pursue it
What's a better time than now to cross the line

Don't brake, let loose
And make sure that your heart is in it
Start line to finish
For every second rushing by we're losing time

We're losing time!
You and I

[Bridge]
And there's a flame in your eyes that's igniting mine
I know I've seen it before
In the gaze of the prowling lion
I'm not afraid anymore!

[Chorus]
Let's break the rules!
And really put our backs into it
Max out, pursue it
What's a better time than now to cross the line

Let's break the rules!
And really put our backs into it
Max out, pursue it
What's a better time than now to cross the line

We're losing time!"

10044,"To explain why this game is both good and bad. This game has a few ""easy"" stealth mechanic missions which let you play the game stealthy if you wish, but it also has a higher difficulty curve when not using stealth, though the reward is the same. In stealth, you could play the entire game from start to finish and never play a single mission which requires using a non-silenced weapon. There's tons of missions you could easily play when you get bored of one, and not all of them are exactly the same, though they follow similar patterns. A random element is added to the game in order to increase interest in players who don't want to play the same missions over and over. The top two highest difficulty settings scale in a manner that rewards stealth players more. What this game is lacking as of right now a custom mission or maybe even a custom map maker. Custom maps might be asking too much, but custom missions would be easy to put in and make the game less boring for the players that have mastered the mechanics to the point where everything is trivial, and there is a point in personal game mastery where the game becomes very trivial."

10124,"This game is truly one of a kind with addictive gampelay loops and satisfying mechanics. It feels like overkill actually listen to their fans, constantly releasing missions and dlc that feel like they could fit into the early years of this games lifespan. Even when this game inevitably stops getting dlc its still more then worth playing. This is a monster with a bit of a learning curb but can be enjoyed by all, with playstyles to vary and more guns to choose from then you know what to do with. Buy it on sale and get the dlcs (except for ethan and hila)  you wont regret it."

10163,"I was really into the first Payday. Judging from these hours you can tell I was ALSO into Payday 2 for a spell. I think sometime around when they introduced paid cosmetics that alter your stats my friend group dropped off this title. I can't endorse those middling and almost ""pay to win"" models. Sure, you can grind out competitively meta items and weapons, you can make a build that compares to the skill ceiling without spending a dime. It's the grind that makes that all the worse, as I can't help but indict anyone that would throw money at the problem instead of alleviating the long slog of a trip to the top.

But that's just my take. Don't act dumb, make your own decisions for this one. Maybe an easy sale pick up?"

10172,"This dipshit named Private Kombat made me play this and it is not ""based""."
10173,"Payday 2 is a variety game. It offers many different things to do in a single package. It offers one of the best stealth experiences ever, as well as solid gunplay for when you don't wanna go stealth. You can customize your character towards many different playstyles, and play however you want. You can play with up to 4 friends, or alone, or with randoms through the matchmaker. You can mod the game to suit your preferences, including extensive gameplay and UI mods.

Stealth:
- Solid detection system
- ""Pager"" system that forces you to play actual stealth, instead of killing all guards
- Multi-layered looting system that forces you to be smart with moving the bags of valuables
""Loud"":
- Many different build styles
- Many ability interactions
- Solid gunplay
- Many guns to choose from
- Guns can be modified to suit your preferences
- Enemy AI is reasonably smart
- Enemy types are simple, but have different variations of each type to keep things varied

Game balance:
Most guns have a place in the game in one way or another. Pistols are used for stealth, while you can use the rocket launchers to clear rooms in loud heists. Some guns are better than the others, but you can expect to do reasonably well with any gun at moderate difficulties.

DLC:
The DLC of this game falls into one of three categories:
- Cosmetic DLC:
Buy at your own discretion. They add no gameplay benefits or detriments.
- Weapon DLC:
Some weapons in the DLC can provide gameplay benefits that the ""Free 2 Play"" weapons may not have. That said, Some of the best guns for both stealth and loud gameplay are available for free, so not owning any weapon DLCs is not a huge detriment. Some of these DLC also include perk decks, which can provide some significant benefits.
- Mission DLC:
Unlocks extra missions for you to play. However, even if you do not own these missions, you can still join a lobby that plays that mission. This means that among a friend group, only one person needs to own a certain mission DLC for everyone to be able to play it.

Conclusion:
Game looks expensive with the amount of DLC. However, you do not need those DLC to enjoy the game. Grab the base game or the legacy bundle (which contains the base game and 5 years of cosmetic, weapon and mission DLC for only double the price of the base game, which you don't have to buy if you get the bundle) and play through the game. You can get hundreds of hours of playtime with just the base game alone. Then, if you feel like you want to try something new, consider grabbing a weapon or mission DLC."

After the devs decided that the game was finally over, the endless DLC packs being released would finally end, the story could conclude with strange appearances from John Wick and Scarface that made all others irrelevant of interest, and the hundreds of hours of my life dedicated to farming that stupid lab,

they started it back up again.
Because they couldn't fund their VR headset."

10276,"You're telling me they made this sh/t
In a driving game engine?

A monumental experience full of action and f..f...fun?! 
Seriously though, this game is a blast
Over 200 updates, with a bundle of the DLC made before silk road that contains enough content to equal 6 LAUNCH PAYDAYS OF CONTENT. And the bundle INCLUDES the game, for only double the price of the game on its own

Plus the developers actually seem to endorse modding the game as long as it's not cheating, which is the BEST move they could have done, because some cool stuff can be found on mod workshop
Unfortunately it suffers the issue of being made in the diesel engine, which again, is a driving engine. Physics are kinda weird and freedom is somewhat limited from development
Overall though, Payday 2? More like Payday 2 amazing for words"

10349,Pengen maen
10350,pog
10351,rob bank
10352,Game with your friends
10353,"Good game, interesting lore, different methods to use"
10354,"This game is so fun. That I did not get enough money 4 food. OK Jokes aside, Me and my friends enjoyed this game a lot. 10/10 would recommend"
10355,"In the story of the game the cops are technically the bad guys and your the good guys, not sure how, i never played the story, but when your playing this game its more fun to think of yourself as the bad guys and just blow shit up and steal shit. 9/10 because of the stupid number of DLC's, if you do buy the game get the dlc that enables you to buy the minigun and rpg-7 its worth the whole 3 bucks."
10356,"Payday 2 can be easily summed up as a lot of fun with the right online players, futile with the wrong ones, and a complete headache on single player.

The game has a lot of fun aspects to it, and doesn't limit players (in most cases) on how they should or could approach each mission. The majority of the time, the outcome is based on how professional or sloppy you and your team are. Getting through a heist in 100% stealth mode is challenging, but possible if everyone knows their part and acts accordingly.

Much like most online games, this game suffers from people who don't have, or don't want to use their mics. If this were a standard shooter where it was every man for himself, this wouldn't be an issue. However, Payday 2 is very much so team driven, and communication is key to success."
10357,this game sucks. i love it

"
10396,ED
10397,"One of the most fun games ive ever played, really fast paced, smooth and tons of dlcs if you get bored/ complete the already enormous amounts of things you can do. Ive bought both the game and some DLCs and I have got to say it was 100% worth it. Good buy."
10398,decent game
10399,The first step of becoming a pro heister is stealing from the devs by paying 10 dollars for this game
10400,Left 4 Dead but no zombie
10401,Balancing feels all over the place and gameplay is extremely repetitive. Not my kind of game

10411,Get the cash and get some mask.
10412,"Thanks, now I have learned everything i need to commit war crimes against federal agents."
10413,"Non-stealth combat is like pissing off a hive of killer bees.

Stealth combat makes you depressed.

All this now, for only $250 (base game + all DLC)"
10414,"very fun but better with friends, and I feel special when I get 5 or more achievements for a single heist (worth the price)"
10415,I thought this game was very fun and I enjoyed it a lot. Would recommend  to players that like fast games.
10416,dont act dumb
10417,"good
"
10418,big spoon very nice
10419,"Gameplay wise it's really fun, but there are two things that put me off this game:
1. The career progression going from normal difficulty to very hard in a very short time-span.
2. The amount of content locked behind a dlc paywall.

Still a decent game, but you wont be putting in as many hours as expected unless you buy the dlc."
10420,feds die
10421,"The game itself is great and I would recommend buying it but most things are unlocked through dlc. 
But it's not as bad, if another play has dlc they can host a lobby and other players can join."
10422,CONSUME PAYDAY 2
10423,is gud
10424,"Im torn on this one. I'll reccomend it, kind of. The dlc practices and practices of the company are terrible at this point. But the game is damn fun if you get a usual group going, ive even had solid fun with randoms over the years. That is except the time a hacker boosted my progress to infinity and i had nothing left to do. Only once at least.

If you can bear a bit of greedy devs and i bet you have for at least one or two products there is a great game here. But I do caution you.

More specifically if you like wave based objectives mixed with some timers and a bit of risk reward game is good. There is usually plenty of movement in most missions, you dont just camp which is a big plus.

There are also a pleathora of weapons, weapon attachments skills etc to unlock. But again that bussiness mofel. So a very slight reccommend from me."
10425,how payday
10426,Yes
10427,overpriced cocaine
10428,"payday 2 is a good game, too good.

that is why im reviewing this, anyway its got coop and i get to rob shit lmaoooooooooooooooooo im gonna do this irl"

10450,bad graphics and really unclear intoduction on how the game works
10451,"I've played this game since ps3 days, to ps4, and now on pc. Pretty much played this game for 6 years. And wow this game is so fun, the game isn't perfect but hey if you're bored and want to just run around and practice your aim this is the game for you. But I recommend waiting til the legacy edition is on discount so you can get it for $20. which is what i did. basically game is recommendable for people that like a challange. If you're a person that's a shitter, complains, rage quits, ass at video games; this game is not for you. But i give it a 10/10"
10452,bean
10453,"This has been one of my go to mindless fun games for a long time, Starting out on Xbox 360 and then buying the Crimewave Edition when it came out.

Around 2016 I started playing on PC and I have been playing on and off again since, the game has a nice mix of Perks, Skills and Weapons which allows you to really enjoy the game whatever way you want, Whether it's a meta akimbo Grimms build or an off-meta melee build on anything below Mayhem you can really play however you want.

However on the higher difficulties (DW, DS, DSOD) a lot of the worse perk decks become far more apparent and instead you are forced to use one of the stronger perk decks (Usually being a newer one due to power creep). Apart from some balancing issues and the instability of the game when it comes to crashing and the likes I'd heavily recommend the game to anyone who enjoys casual FPS games but make sure to install some Quality of Life mods though."

10455,"This game is not perfect by any means. The diesel engine leads to some less than stellar performance sometimes, and the driving is not fun. But, all in all, this is and has been for years my favorite PvE shooter. If you have some friends who're already playing this, or are generally good at and amicable to shooters, then I cannot recommend this game enough"

1: join a public lobby.
2:get kicked immediately 
3: join another lobby.
4: actually start a heist.

6: repeat until you actually start a fuckin heist.

I really appreciate that costume and glove now is separate but as I use jacket character and equip costume with default glove, it will equip blue glove instead of jacket default glove (the hand wrap). could you like make it so I can use jacket default glove because I really love the hand wrap as it look awesome with sosiopath nature."

10535,Amazing game still fun to play
10536,"The stealth mechanics seem like they're fair, until you nail everything and fail due to some bugged bullshit. 

The stealth bugs can be very  frustrating on harder missions. Overall, a good game."

10559,Nope.
10560,"Random individuals who waltz into your lobby,ruins your stealth and get insta-downed during police assualts largely increases the challenge and replayability of the game,making it truly one of the classics that stands the test of time."
10561,dodajcie maski masno gang
10562,"Amazing game. The game-play is fun and engaging and the skills and perks make it just complicated enough for it to still be enjoyable.
 The main concept is, as therussianbager said ""Steal shit and kill people with some extra stuff revolving around methamphetamine and nuclear warheads."" 
The game also has 2 top tier waifus so that makes the gaming experience way better.
And if you ever get bored of the main game, you always have tons of DLC for all tastes.
If that's still not enough, Payday 2 has one of the biggest modding community`s in any gamy I have played.
All around great game with lots of content.
10/10 Will play again."

this game is great tho, aged very well and i love hotline miami and everything related to it."
10614,"Although I prefer the more tense, slightly more realistic gameplay of the first Payday, Payday 2 makes for a great gun collecting / horde shooter game. Hours well spent"
10615,"I really enjoy that I can play solo, with friends or with complete strangers. I mostly do quiet jobs but I have a couple loud ones I like as well. There are not many first person shooter games I like but this one got me, with lots of achievements to work towards and the upgrading of your personal safe house. Oh and ""DO PUSH THE BIG RED BUTTON""!

10616,This game really is like no other I've ever played.
10617,AAAAA
10618,"experienced players with a new profile waiting to get a good bank heist layout simulator good gaem doe
big momento"
10619,"Yes, but no, this game is a fun game, but after you play this for a good while it becomes dry and it feels like their is nothing to do. If you have a lot of friends that you can play with, then yes I would get it, but if not then it is not a good idea"
10620,"First off, know that this game doesn't cost what you think it does. You're going to want to spend another $10, $20 on DLCs to get some of the best heists, weapon attachments, and weapons. You don't need to buy all of them, but you're definitely going to want to pour a couple bucks into DLCs for quality of life.

With that said, this game runs on a very old engine, leaving it buggy and sometimes unoptimized, and the gameplay loop really doesn't click for some people, but the memes are plentiful, the guns are blazing, and the lore is really, really weird. Give it a try, or just wait until Payday 3 in 2023. I will say that Lab Rats is a religious experience, though."

10684,"I would say the game hold out and even gold out over the years, it's actually really good and it can be really cheap on a sale, it's good if you are looking for a fun game to play casually with your friends, rob some banks etc. And if you are actually invested in the game like some of us i would have to suggest buying some of the DLCs to unlock more weapons and heists, overall a great experience if you are looking to rob some banks loudly or infiltrate the fbi silently, solo or with friends."
10685,"Before playing PAYDAY 2, I had never thought in my life that there was a game of just 4 clowns robbing banks accompany such an engaging and interesting lore that all seamlessly ties together to a suspenseful and rewarding climax."
10686,"I've been playing this game in vr and let me tell you, its super fun to play. I feel very immersed into the game and just feel like a straight BA running through the missions, of course i run into some bugs which is to be expected but its not enough to really take away from the over all game play.

10736,"hello guys this is a review by a poor person that plays this game (can't really afford too much because of rental and house bills) I bought the payday 2 legacy collection for $29.98 and I got it on 19 Jan 2019, and I think the game is fun.

You don't really need all DLC packs to enjoy the payday 2 experiences, and also I still have the same DLC packs as I have when I first bought the payday 2 legacy collection.

I feel like for those people that doesn't have DLC packs should know that if you are poor like me you should not have to buy DLC to have fun in the game I recommend people to wait until it goes on special so that you could buy those DLC packs.

I'm not saying to waste your money on DLC packs like those mens living on the streets but what I'm trying to say is that you should save up your pocket money for the DLC packs so that it's easier for you to buy them.

Just if you ever seen a review or heard it from your friends or family saying that you need all DLC packs to enjoy more playtime just don't get suck into it it's just a waste of money if you do, and also it just means that you are a sucker and care about the money more then life.

I hope you guys understand what I'm getting here and I hope I'm not being a bit too hard on you people but I just feel like some of those reviews there saying that ""DLC packs are too expensive"" or ""It's more fun with DLC packs"" just doesn't get about savings and debit cards plus some of these people at rich so you do need to be careful about those reviews and make sure to buy the things that are the best and the funniest things that you know you would enjoy.

payday 2: 10/10

people that care about money more than life: -999999999999999/10

people that care about savings and pocket money: 10/10"
10737,Finally completed Overdrill
10738,I really like this type of game because it has everything you want. I also like the option to rob a bank (or whatever you want to rob) silently or aggressive. There are lots of good things in this game but I won't put them all here since you have to experience them too ;)
10739,neat.

10823,"A really fun game to put lots of hours in, every mission is an adventure. but to make the game complete, you gotta play it with some friends. playing it alone or with random players can also be fun, but not for long, at least to me. play with at least 1 other friend. most of hte time it's for sale aswell so a friend with a lower budget could easliy get it. overall a enjoyable game.
There is even VR support which makes the game even more fun if it's to your liking."

10849,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family."

10875,good game do recommend
10876,"If you love bullet hell games and customizing your character buy it. It’s dirt cheap although buying the legacy edition is a better idea as it includes a lot of the content you get. One word of advice: Just have fun. Don’t grind for money or continental coins, just enjoy yourself. Its better that way. 

10/10 by yourself 12/10 with your friends.

*Side note, the bugs are hilarious janky not game breaking janky














What are you waiting for? buy it already"

10887,Time to earn our Payday.
10888,"Game's really fun, even solo. All the heists never get boring and you can play for hours on end, meeting cool people in online games. If you're new to the game, try crime spree, it's a great way of getting continental coins, and it's really fun, since you can play DLC heists for free!"
10889,Pls don't try this in real life
10890,"Игрушка Б О М Б А!
"
10891,THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME
10892,yes
10893,"I FUCKING LOVE PAYDAY 2
The idea of a cooperative shooter less focused on shooting and more on getting tasks done is so fun, but it doesn't leave the shooting aspect behind with the cop waves systems similar to the zombies from l4d its so much fun to go loud on the missions and having certaing enemies that make you play in a more fast paced way instead of going for a more methodical approach just makes things better
Stealth is weird because it is fun, but I don't know why everyone likes it so much, for me it's way more fun to go loud
The music is great for setting the intensity of the game
Graphics are okay
The lore is ridiculous and I think the game is so self aware on it's gameplay clashing with it, it ends up being a great experience"
10894,"amazing
"
10895,why does houstons mask look like a purple squidward. not complaining tho.
10896,"The best game I have ever played, It has the most accepting community I have ever played with, yes some players are Rude and will kick you but that's for every game has those people, My friend got me hooked and I been trying to get as many masks, I love jacket, the rooster from Miami is great, I wish there was more maps in Florida bit its okay, the in game vc still needs a lil work but its okay because discord is a option, This game is deep into detail its great, the secrets are fun to try to find, tho it makes my pc run hard it still a Favorate to play, with 336 hours of play time and more to come I got to say PayDay2 is going to be a game that will be in my heart. Thank you Payday Team and please lets Have more fun!!!"
10897,the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night...

10899,"If you have some friends for play, this game is for you! Very tactical game and lot of heists and modes."

10903,Great game with tons of levels and extreme replayability. also supports mods.
10904,dude is that the guy from fortnite!!!! (please laugh guys please)
10905,"this game is pretty lit. i love how chaos this game is. like being outnumbered by cops and go on rampage during loud, while stealth requires slick players, each loadout and skills are effective for either stealth or loud, choose wisely.
i would recommend it for fps players, especially GTA V players who wishes intense heists."
10906,payday
10907,The game has a vast amount of weapons which (along with pre-planning) can tailor how you play the game. This is the only game where you can fight entire police forces with a giant piece of cutlery and a medieval bow
10908,0kln
10909,"186$ for all the DLC, What the literal fuck? I bought this game years ago because it was fun, not because it was a pay to play. What the literal fuck agian."

10912,NICE GAME
10913,"i never knew commiting misdeeds as a ragtag group of semi-immortal gang members of diverse backgrounds wearing self-repairing body armor, armed with a wide array of firearms, of which they have incredible freedom when it comes to attachments, using state-of-the-art gear such as the B.F.G as well as experimental gadgets such as the ECM and the ampoule yet somehow being stuck with the most useless, broke-dick piece of shit drill is so much fun"

but if you have time can you add a swearing removal just sayin"
10929,medic bag funny ha ha
10930,"This game is good and addicting. Would recommend. There's just some bugs and the game crashes at times. If you play with players with mods, it may affect your game play. There are also cheaters in the game that passes through walls and have an abnormally high damage. When playing online, even though there are over 30k+ players online, you often see the same players and play with the same players so I would love to play with different players when I play online. Apart from that, it's still very enjoyable, fun, and challenging."
10931,is good
10932,"We do a little heisting. Nothing more, nothing less."
10933,"Gotta say Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and George Bush. Raiding the White House is pretty fucking mint."
10934,"Game's an Absolute Icon, Stacked up there with the Co-op Greats like Left For Dead 1 and 2. Highly Recommend, Wouldn't sleep on this game :P"
10935,You can beat cops to death with a comically large golden spoon. 10/10 but the sheer amount of dlcs would bring it down to a 9 if it didnt already have baller default content! Still 10/10!
10936,money shoot gun
10937,"this game's devs are really funny

check them on twitter"
10938,chains is sometimes in a pickle

10940,"good game, get on sale."

10942,Payday is a very fun first-person shooter game I would recommend this to my grandma
10943,"Instead of shooting school, you could rob banks."
10944,"I owned this game on xbox originally but my friend had gifted it to me on pc and now I can't stop playing it with them.

10947,you lose money if kill civilians
10948,its good
10949,Great game however in the community section the moderators are pretty stupid. Made a joke about DLCunlocker and I got banned from the group. I will continue to play regardless of this however this is a warning to others to not joke about anything there.

"
10960,Fun to play and chilling with friends.
10961,sigma game
10962,fun
10963,"Payday is the perfect example of a fantastic concept done terribly wrong.
Granted, I've not played in a few years but simple things like really bad lag for your detection meter and corpses being in differing locations for host/client, sometimes causing answering an alarm to be triggered, are just a few of the problems that have been in this game from the start and (since I last stopped playing) have never been resolved.
The idea of transition from stealth to loud is completely lost, you are never going to run a mission in stealth and then resort to loud if it goes wrong, your stealth build is never going to cut it.
The difficulty for stealth missions plateaus fairly quickly, whereas Death Wish loud requires incredibly specific skill builds and it saps the fun out of even trying.
This, in addition, to the steady stream of DLC that is churned out just kinda killed the game for me. I'll pick it up every now and again and play some stealth missions with friends but it's definitely not worth the price tag and probably not worth your time.
(Also having the music for the Alesso heist not controlled by the music volume is horrendous because it is hot garbage and my god is it painful having to stealth that mission with that crap playing non stop.)"

10973,great game
10974,"This game is a classic, although all what it went through, it is still a great game, a busy arsenal of great missions without buying any dlcs, with that said the dlcs are good too (not all but most i'd say like 75% are good), the graphics are decent for the fact it's a 2012 game, loud heists are ballsy and adrenaline inducing (that is only if you play it at death wish/sentence or if you're that confident you could try one down), as for the stealth part of the game you genuinely need to put some brain power to crack the missions to plan and to execute plans in some of the stealth heists, even with masterful planning and execution unfortunately the game incorporates rng, so you have to learn to adapt to the BS sometimes, all in all 8.5/10 game"
10975,I have 150 hours on this game and i am still not tired of massacring hundreds of cops. Very cool!

10995,Good game :D

10997,"The game overall is fun it's just the content that came after the ""H3H3"" DLC is what I find lacking. You could in a sense go quite far without any DLC, but if you are interested in completing achievements it will cost quite a bit and time to complete. The difficulty in the game comes down to more health for enemies and more damage to you, so most of the time using builds that are ""meta"" are almost always necessary. There are a few maps that are easily done on the highest difficulty with one down active but if there is a map with little to no cover and a roaming objective your life can become a living hell. Stealth missions are probably my favorite for highest difficulty one down, it boils down to a mix of luck and skill, with invulnerable cameras, changing guard patterns during/new runs, and random loot spawns sometimes it can be overwhelming or drive you further to want to complete that heist since you've gotten further than you did on your last run. While I do like the guards mixing up their paths sometimes this can be a complete run ender, when you think a guard has left an area and they do a double back to you. 

Holdout is a wave survival with increased difficulty as waves go by with a right build and (AI) Team it can be easy, I like this gamemode it's simple and to the point, I do feel there is something missing to it 90% of my runs end at wave 7-8 with almost every other enemy becoming a dozer, even with the ""meta"" builds it becomes odd the way to deal with AI going down, Hostage being released, health management, and the dozers. This isn't comparable to most other wave survival based gamemodes that I can think of in games that I have played so that is a factor in this segment to take into account.

More into the DLC area of the game: H3H3 pack was interesting at the time yet it is completely out of place. I think universally the community can say it was the worst character DLC they made besides the tag team mechanic, all other characters that were introduced had some heists added with them included to somewhat loosely tie them to the payday gang, this character pack just planted them center stage (almost quite literally when you read the description for their studio in the safe house and location) without even a small bit of context. Voice acting jobs were bad not just for H3H3, but Rust, and John Wick it was terrible. they had some that were perfect and creative like Jacket, Jimmy, and Scarface somehow though when something was working with other of the DLCs the odd ones out had the poor quality treatment when coming to voice acting. Colors/tailor DLCs should have been a free addition looking at how bad they are and still expecting you to pay for it, it's best to save your money on this front. 

Conclusion: game is amazing with some improvements before they attempt to release Payday 3, they can make a spectacular 3rd entry, DLCs need more time and effort put into them even it requires more time with voice actors as well trying to tie in some way guest characters to the payday gang, also just cut the color and tailor packs it's a complete waste to release something that most players will look over or assume your trying to wring them of their wallet."
10998,noice
10999,fun robbery game
11000,Ninjas in socks tiptoeing on thick carpet make more noise than this review!
11001,meh game solo but a blast with friends
11002,"I only say no because of the sheer amount of DLCs that add new guns and heists IF you are thinking about picking up the game for the first time. It's the same problem that Destiny 2 has that the good stuff is behind DLCs and if you can't get into it in the first place then you just wasted money.

But on the other hand, if you're a fan of 4 player co-op objective based endless hordes of enemies FPS with special enemies and no two runs of the same heists will be 100% identical then have at it. Just be ready to drop money for some of the good guns."
11003,This might simply be the best game ever made lads.
11004,ive learned alot from this game so i tried it irl
11005,"Absolutely thrilling. Every aspect of this game plays into one of the fastest most intense and thrilling games I've ever played. First off, gun customization, though not great, especially cosmetically; being able to change the gadgets that your gun uses, the color and decals and a few more things made the customization at least decent, and was certainly enough to make guns unique. Then the maps, absolutely gorgeous. There are so many different environments, whether a mountain top in the dead of winter, or a smoking hot desert to a beautiful hill by the sea; there is bound to be at least some place on the map that you enjoying. Another important aspect of the game is well of course gameplay. It is essentially a PVE where you fight around with the cops, you come across missions like robbing banks or pursuits around the map however far less optional then these secret packages. As you're not the only person in the heist, cops are a very present force and frequently hunt you down. This is the most adrenaline filled aspect of the game. They police are ruthless and difficult to simply outrun, now you can switch sides and know what it's like to be the hunter if you ever so choose to, however most of the customization options are taken away."
11006,"it is fun
"
11007,yutg

 This game saved my life.  


I am 69.  


My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  


When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  


After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  


Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  


After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  


Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  


I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  


Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  


Thank you.

11034,"banger of a game, and for 10 dollars.. *chefs kiss*"
11035,"This is by far my most played game on steam, and honestly, it's awesome. 

The fact that all of the Payday 1 heists still hold up so incredibly well, alongside the fact that many incredible moments and heists were added over the years and are still being added to this day, leads me to believe that this game is one of the most continually supported games out there, and is definitely one of my favorites in recent years.

My main complaint is that the story, while incredible when pieced together through lore videos and external sources, is very hard to discern when playing normally. The so-called ""Career mode"" isn't 100% accurate to the true story, as it hasn't accounted for the million additional DLC heists added over the years, and some events are out of order (No Mercy being a flashback in this game, for instance, still confuses me), but it still provides a loose timeline of the story's events.

There are also way too many unnecessary difficulties, with the main game truly starting at overkill, and increasing from there. Also, the scaling on difficulties is definitely weird (hard and very hard feel pretty much identical, while mayhem, and death wish feel like 2 completely different games. And don't get me started on Death Sentence One Down)

This game, despite its frequent bugs and crashes (the ladder mainly occurring if you mod the shit out of it like I do), has an incredibly enjoyable game flow, due to the mechanics and controls feeling extremely arcade-y and responsive. It's not aiming for realism - the stealth AI make that very apparent. It puts cold hard mechanics and lore above everything else, and is incredibly enjoyable for that alone.

All this makes the game fun, fast-paced, and a blast to play alone and with friends / randos alike. But it's the secret of Payday 2 that really elevates the game into something truly special.

I'm going to spoil the true ending for Payday 2 right here. If you have no intention on completing the admittedly drawn-out steps to obtain the secret, then by all means keep reading. Just know that the story surrounding the game gets absolutely crazy from here. After you complete the seemingly final mission [spoiler] and steal the pardons from the White House [/spoiler], doing the secret will unlock the true ending to the game, and cracks the story wide open. You have been warned!

[spoiler] TL:DR of the secret: basically, it's a laundry list of obtaining certain materials from a wide variety of different heists, deciphering codes and an entire hidden language, completing 20 specific and randomized achievements, going under the white house into the secret tunnels, decoding the text on the ruins 3 times while getting kicked by shadow cloakers, killing the Dentist, and rushing Bain to the inverted pyramid and transferring his consciousness into the president through the use of Mayan gold. It's as bonkers as it sounds, and if you never experienced it before, either look it up on YouTube or attempt it yourself. Beware! [/spoiler]

Overall, Payday 2 is a testament to what long-term dedication and work can add to a product, aiding it in the long run. Not every DLC is a win - H3H3 pack and the Border Crossing heist, for instance - but besides a few hiccups, the game overall is a labor of love that will continue to be cherished for years to come. 

Let's do this, heisters!"

11062,"Payday 2 is one of those games you're expected to own when you have a Steam account. For an fps that was built out of a racing engine, I'll give it some props. However, there's alot of dlc/paywall content and it's vastly more enjoyable with friends, but only for so long."

11101,"Definitely recommend Payday 2. I've had an absolute blast playing it. However, the game will just crash with no apparent reason. With an AMD 5 3600, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, 8 gigabytes of ram and vram, and 200 gigabytes of free storage, the game will most likely crash within 5 minutes. That's the one issue I have with this game however, and if I fix this, there really is no issue talking about. Definite Recommend."
11102,"It was really fun playing this with the boys, because of its soundtrack and missions, but after some times it gets soo repetitive for its lack of content. This game is literally a barely touched gold mine. 

Also I don't recommend playing this alone. I tried it and it didn't give me those goosebumps as with friends."

11162,"This is a DLCs with a game, instead of making shitty ass different editions with hundreds purchasable dlcs make one and sell everything on it."
11163,"Payday 2 is a very positively-received co-op wave FPS with decent graphics, and a compelling story-line. The game is extremely fun and has many instances of its core aspect - the heists, having great game-play that is best done with teamwork and friends. But, if you have none at the time, you can also play the offline mode, the same experience, but with an AI team (but the game is best experienced with friends). You also have many ways of playing with perk decks, skill trees, many weapon options, etc.

Payday 2 is not without its flaws however, and the biggest flaw is the amount of money needed to get a decent-sized experience. MANY career heists are locked behind paywalls if you want to host an online lobby of said heist, which makes it harder to play many missions. Another flaw is how buggy the NPCs are, especially civilians / civvies. Civvies when they turn into hostages, are hard to make move around due to the fact that they are glitchy. MANY times civvies will go through walls, move for many seconds after telling them to go back down, etc. The game is heavily reliant on releasing DLCs to make money and stay alive, which I cannot blame them for however.

Overall, the amount of fun, experience, and arguing about pagers will be worth your money, same with the DLCs. However, I recommend getting DLCs during a decently-sized sale, such as the time of writing this review. Thank you for reading this review, and I hope to see you at the safehouse, heister."
11164,AMAZING
11165,I dont have any words for this game. Its just awesome.
11166,"If you want a fun, quick, and easy game to learn how to play with friends then you're in luck because this is the one. Cash and XP is fast to gain and you can zoom through heists at the blink of an eye with a good team on your side. The gameplay is very fast but not in an annoying way although heads up if you suffer from motion sickness like I do because the weird bobbing motion while running can be VERY disorienting at first (You can turn it off in the settings luckily but it's still kinda screwy). In case you're worried about crashing I cannot recall a time this game has ever failed on me, it runs pretty smoothly on my MSI laptop. To end the review off, if you're someone who loves first-person shooter games or even if you've played Hotline Miami you're going to love this, so come get your payday!"

However my favorite part of the game is how it is unrealistic in a very good way, for example you could literally hit a SWAT in the head with a comically large spoon (a reference to King Bach's vine), and you could also carry a 200 pound mini-gun and go nuts on a crowd of police officers. In this game the possibilities are endless."

Great game!"
11193,I like the game because its very fun but it can be awesome  if u can add a a filter and put the heist in a different category like stealth and loud and select wich one u want

11198,"This has since become my favourite game of all time. The Death sentence difficulty can be an insane challenge. Some of the pager phrases are really funny. I have found that almost all the heists are fun to play over and over. It is a major learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it's a pretty easy game to play. When you're learning I recommend looking at guides on how to play anarchist suit along with the use of Jokers."
11199,"Fun game where you get to shoot people, i dont recommend buying EVERY DLC but some are great, also its one of my favorite games, it helped me get through the rough years of 2020-2022, Recommended and you should buy it :D"

11224,"I highly recommend this game if you enjoy shooter games. It is similar to other games such as GTA, hotline miami and is very fun if you're looking for violence / action. But lots of the achievements in this game are required for you to own specific dlc's."

On top if it all its 9,99 when it should be at least 29,99
Only complain I have is that theres lots of DLCs that provide small bits of content. You dont necessarily need em but they do actually make the game better."

11284,"Guys the game is good. What they've done with the DLCs is quite annoying, but understandable. My only real issue with the game is after spending 200+ hours somehow my ""save"" was deleted. Yes... online game with servers and everything and my saves just vanished because of some steam sync conflict. For years I've been glancing at it, downloading it, realising I have to grind from the start and just closing it. A deal breaker that they stole 200 hours of my life and as far as I can tell the files are perm gone... Inf levels and all is just poof... I have 180 achievements and 0 progress, 0 of my masks, designs, weapons, perks etc..."

I play the PC version, while he plays the Xbox version. Could you possibly make it to where its cross-platform? That would be appreciated, thanks."
11329,is good
11330,"0/10 too many dlcs

Jokes asides, I give this game a solid 9/10. The main flaws are the DLC and infamy system along with being made in a buggy game engine, however it is still really fun especially iwth friends and there's a whole lot to love. A majority of the heisters/characters have interesting and unique dialogue, the perk decks are really interesting ranging from drinking whiskey to heal yourself or literally dodging bullets. It's probably one of the best co-op shooters ever created to be honest"

luckily, the developers outright bought the game from the parent company and remove MOST of those issue

in regards to the game itself, it is a decent shooter, albeit at an expanse of a bait and switch, the tutorial mission puts heavy emphasis on stealth, silently taking down enemies, hiding the bodies, avoiding cameras, sneaking past guard, the whole works
but almost all other mission throw all those mechanics down the drain in favor of a wave shooter with the occasionally ""pick object A and use it on location B while enemies still attacking"" 
if you go to the game expecting action, it's a good fit for you, if you want a strategy and stealth, you'll be disappointed
you will, nearly always, have 3 AI partners that will shoot enemies and follow / cover you, they will not do the ""bring A to B"" objective, but the will try to cover you while yo do it, if you play on multiplayer both of you can either 1 partner each for the normal 4 members crew, or you can have everyone with other 3 AIs to have 8 or even 16 heisters, but I was unable to figure out how to set that for every mission

and a HUGE plus for me personally, it has a VR DLC completely free, I am a VR enthusiast, I bought my first VR headset over a year ago, and I had this game sitting on my library for over 3, when I notice the VR DLC was there and for free not less, I indeed found more reason to play it, it is reasonably well implemented, while multiplayer friends can't see my motion controls, it does translate will to both, in-game actions, and IRL motion controls, albeit with the same trappings of a game that was not designed with VR out of the box, but it doesn't feel like an afterthought either

TL;DR better game without publisher greed, set your expectations and enjoy the real game, VR is rather good and free"

11458,"When it comes to first person horde shooters this is the best. Unlike lesser games such as Left 4 Dead 2 (which is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination) it has more mechanics than ""go over there and kill enemies along the way"". It has a main objective (usually revolving around steal this *object* and escape) and the waves of police and swat officers only serve as barriers to that objective (while being incredibly fun to fight). From getting the thermal drill, to finding key cards, to getting the loot and escaping. All of the objectives add much needed depth to make the game much more lasting than others in its segment (after all this game will give you about 70-80 hours of satisfying gameplay with no dlc or mods). Along with many of the more challenging difficulties the game itself is ripe with challenges to make the player feel as if they have accomplished something every time they finish a heist. With the difficulty ramping up by doing more than simply increasing base enemy hp and damage, no it add new enemies with specific abilities. The taser can hold you in one place while his friends attack, the cloaker and pin you in place, and the dozer has enough health to tank a rocket launcher to the face and keep on going to stop you. The different enemies make the difficulty feel very fair and distinguish the difficulties from one another. There is more than just basic heists, in fact there are many holiday themed heists, a wave defense mode, and even a mode that ramps up difficulty (and reward) with heist after heist. All of the modes are worth playing due to the great base combat and mechanics (which is the mark of a truly great first person shooter). Over all the base game alone is more than worth the $10.84 (usd) that it sells for normally, and when it goes on sale adding this to your library is a no-brainer!"

Legacy Edition set me back close to £10, cheap and cheerful.

Plenty of masks to obtain and customise, same for weapons, good build variety, missions can be done loud, or stealth, the latter of which I find boring so I always go loud unless necessary. Plenty of missions to tackle via DLC from Legacy Edition alone, enough bang for your buck. Soundtrack slaps too.

Easy game to throw on, invite some buds and shoot some cops for a couple of hours whilst raking in the dosh."

11524,"This game is something I'd compare to a very nice restaurant. 

You try it the first time and you're pleasantly surprised, the meal may not be fancy but it's a good hefty pile of food, with a good taste and texture, so enjoyable in-fact that you find yourself returning to have that meal again.

Eventually you start to try different things on the menu, different styles and experiences keep you coming back to this new ol'faithful, Knowing you're getting some good filling food for the price you're paying.

I've gotten quite lost in this metaphor. Uh... It's something you're happy to return to, trying out new builds and guns, mismatching all the different little bits until you've got seven builds of equally interesting combinations, Facing down gradually more havoc inducing forces of law enforcing armies, Cashing in the hard earned Cash, drugs, gold and jewelry until the escape van hangs heavy.

Have you ever felt like robbing a bank? well, this is the perfect game there are abilities for every playstyle (personally I really like rouge) there is a TON of different heists to do. if you like stealth games then there are heists for you, try heist with stealth required and you even get rewarded for it in an XP boost for your next heist there are different difficulties easy for new players and really hard difficulties that I'm still not good enough to play on (I think there is like 6 which is double what most games have) they are a ton of guns to choose from like AR's shotguns, snipers, etc, and you can even put a ton of attachments on those weapons and if you still dont think that is a enough there are DLC's you can buy for even more guns and attachments (there worth it). you can also play with your freinds you can have 4 players in a heist the game is most fun with freinds. and I know its and oldy but its a goodie i play this game so much I just can't get enough of Payday 2."

11612,"Fun.
The melee weapons aren't balanced properly.
The throwables are mostly useless because of how limited their uses are and how few of them you can take with you.

Shields are a pain since they randomly become full aimbots and perfectly follow you as you try to flank them, something made even worse when you consider that they do 7x the damage of a normal unit.

General inconsistencies such as cloakers kicking you through walls, tasers tasing you from half the map and Dozers that insta down you the moment you see them from a distance.

But otherwise, good game."

11621,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

11627,"You rob bank, in a beautiful way. You cooperate with friends to create nice strategies or fun moments. You get scared the shit out by cloakers. You try to do heist in stealth, only to fail at the last part of your plan. You do 2 heist, say it's not exceptionnal, then land on the Alesso heist, or the Diamond. You fight, you get chokeslammed by skulldozers, you get back up only to get down 4 seconds after on higher difficulty. Well you know what ? It doesn't really matter. Seriously, play with friends or the *nice* community of this game ( avoid doing stealth heist in public tho ). Enjoy it, buy it, play it, it's one of the best games I ever tried.

11632,I've had many hours of fun in Payday 2. There is so much content for this game. Most of it is dlc but you can still play the dlc missions if other people host it. The game is definitely a little dated at this point in certain parts but imo it holds strong overall. The community these days isn't usually great. There's a lot of sucky people that host games but it's not the end of the world. For $10 Payday 2 is worth it.

11681,"im like robin hood
steal from the rich.
and then spend it on guns"
11682,"Let's brake. the. rules!

and really put our backs into it, max out, pursue it.

what's a better time than now to cross the line?

Do as Simon Viklund intended, the soundtrack and action packed into this absolute masterpiece of art is more than enough to keep one entertained for days. Whether it's robbing a jewelery store, shooting up the white house, or stealing thermonuclear warheads, you will find something to love. 10/10

the soundtrack really is 90% of the game, not because the action is bad, but because payday 2's assault OST is fucking awesome, it fits almost every situation, and the wide variety of over 50 assault and stealth songs really prove it."

You are the only person the enemy AI targets, your team is useless, and for objectives like in Hell's Island where you need to try to figure out a code from the shitty graphics of their security camera if you're hit you're pulled out of the camera view and have to start over.

The lore is very twisted and there is ""post lore"" lore which you have to unlock by unlocking secrets and that's superb in my opinion. The weapon customization is quite easy to wrap your head around, unlike other games. And the missions really never get boring, there is always something harder to do, some secret to find or some treat left for the players by the devs like the toast on white Xmas."

11891,"Hell yeah! This game is amazing, runs on pretty low hardware (coming from a person with a laptop with Intel Integrated graphics), and is fun! Granted, there IS a difficulty curve, but what game doesn't, and the DLC's are sorta P2W if you have both money in the game AND real money.

All in all, a great game, and I recommend it."

11962,"This is really fun playing alone but ESPECIALLY with friends. I'd imagine that playing this while drunk would be fun aswell but I can't say yet as I'm not 18. this really is a gem, but seeing how many dlc there is can get frustrating at times when you see all these guns which can't be used. I mean the dlcs are cheap but for a game that you'll only come back to every once in a while it may not be worth it, unless it becomes your main game"
11963,"The game is very fun the most with friends
i had a friend i met in game that helped me grind lot of money, i got 12million when i started playing the game again. Thank You Friend
moving on, you should definitely install mods for fun its legal but other ppl need to download the same mod as u for ppl to actually see the mod."

11997,"this game is about robbing banks, jewellery stores and even more! however the best part is committing war crimes. the amount of police you have to kill makes the game more fun, just mowing them down when your crouched right at the vault door kills the time you have to wait for the vault to be drilled through. i first played this game on console and went to pc and it is a lot better. I highly suggest this game if your up for murdering families and becoming rich (in-game rich)"

12140,"Very fun game with loads of contents, all though after playing a long time it can be repetitive. If that happens get yourself 3 nice friends and have loads of fun running the heists co-op.

There has been loads of controversy around this game after the 4th Crimefest (Overkill makes an event of every year PAYDAY 2 has it's birthday) With microtransactions being added to the game as locked safes for weapons skins. These safes needs a key (drill) to open. That wouldn't be a problem for most people, but there is also stats boosts to these skins. Now how ever you feel about that this is a PVE game the stats boosts does not in anyway destroy your game. The stats boosts does not make you a god in anyway.

Overkill has since also backed down a bit on the microtransaction skins, and you now can also get the drill as a reward after a heist the same way you get the safe.

Now then would i recommend this game, i have played 1000 hours hell yes i would. In a group of friends it is one really fun co-op game.

An amazing and fast paced co-op shooter marred by bad dlc practices. Payday 2 is a great horde based shooter that can be enjoyed alone, with friends, or online with or without VR. The varying levels of difficulty make it quick to figure out just what you can and can't handle and as you progress, choosing higher difficulties for heists rewards you greatly. The infamy system, now reworked as 3.0, gives good enough reason to reset your progression the first time but any resets afterwards give little to no reward worth going back to level 0 for."

The economy is so unstable that nearly all your earnings are kept safe out of state, leaving you little to actually spend in your day-to-day life.

12231,АХУЕНАЯ ИГРА
12232,"After spending 300+ hours in this game, i can talk about props and cons... Let's start with cons:
1. If you want full game experience, you need to buy DLC for weapons, modules for weapons, characters (with the exception of Jacket), perk desks (i still cant unlock kingpin perk desk because The Scarface character pack was removed) and heists (Black Cat, Big Bank, ect.). Without these DLCs this game is ""PAYDAY2 Demo"".
2. Some gameplay aspects can be buggy. For example, you can join any steath heist (Shadow Raid,Murkey Station, Carshop) and kill someone with your mlee weapon and everyone will hear it, like you took a shot with a pistol without a silencer (it's not a regular bug, but sometimes it can be irritating). Also on train heist i had a problem with ammo for turret... so i restarted this heist and it went back to normal (Also Mountain Master with it boss).
3. Adding ""Ban"" button. This is co-op shooter. Who decided to make this button? Very bad option.. After DLC.
4. Lack of balance in the game. Let's take Death wish and Death sentence and you will see differences. It's harder than it has to be... but still playable, even on one down.
Cons are over, now props:
1. It's fun co-op shooter, you can team up with your friends and play your favourite heists!
2. Also you can make new friends and play any time you want.
3. Soundtrack in this game is amazing.
4.And that's just funny game.
Would i recomend this game? Well, i think yes and no at the same time. So think about buying this game ;)

12252,"[h1] PAYDAY TWO: THE REVIEW. [/h1]

(please not that i have played this first on an Xbox Series S and then moved onto the PC release.)

payday 2 is a co-operative FPS heist simulator, where you can work alone or with friends to take on countless heists and try to make it out with cash, valuables, and whatever isn't glued down. in short, it's fun.

I think the charm of payday 2 is customization. you get to pick what goes on your heister; from their base model, to their suit, mask, and gloves. (which are all customizable as well). then once you've personalized yourself, then you move onto your weapons. from miniguns to comically large spoons (real), this game has pretty much any weapon you could ask for. 

now, the heists. you'll be robbing banks, trains, casinos, goats, and secret Russian documents. whatever people contract you to steal, you steal. oh, and don't worry about taking a few spoils of war for yourself. overall the variety of heists is large, and it'll be a while before you get bored. i mean, i have nearly 400 hours on this game as of the time of writing this,, so it must be good, right?

as usual, no game is perfect. and now i shall address the concerns.

[b] WHY IS THIS GAME EIGHTY GIGABYTES. [/b]

for real, this game debuted on Xbox 360 (2013), so how have the devs let the game get THIS big? 80GB is almost A TENTH of my PC's hard drive. i don't know about you, but having 1/10th of your ENTIRE pc dedicated to ONE game. yeah, nah. i mean, if i wanna play this, i find myself installing and uninstalling it, over and over again. 

then, there's the difficulty spike. easy, normal, hard and even overkill seem like a walk in the park. almost the same. just that there's one or two extra random guard spawns. then the moment you go to mayhem or higher, then all of a sudden, the flood gates of hard have been opened, and all the difficulty climb that SHOULD have been slowly ramping up, is now steeper than Everest. hope you enjoy reseting. a lot.

overall, is this game worth it? i mean, with PAYDAY 3's announcement, if you wanna follow the story, yeah, i'd recommend it. also if you just want a fun co-op game for your friends. but please, don't sink 400 hours into it, for your own sake."

12315,"Been thinking of reviewing this game for a while, but hadn't decided if I hate this game or approve of it yet.
I think I've finally decided what kind of review it deserves:

Update "" 219.3 "" apparently added ""Gamesight"" (formerly known as ""Red Shell"" ) to the game. 

https://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/eventcomments/3187991824497314636

Gamesight is a third party spyware program that collects data on you and sells it to god knows who. Probably Google, Facebook, the CCP, the CIA, whoever's willing to buy at any given moment. 

You can email the company who runs the spyware (LOL) and tell them* to not spy on you (double LOL) or, alternatively, you can opt out of their tracking in-game at any time. (Other users who have tested it say opting out of Gamesight works as intended.) Call me cynical or a schizophrenic, but do you really trust the game devs who added the spyware, or the spyware company themselves to honor ""their end"" of the bargain? I don't.

Best to not buy this game at all, not even on sale for 2 dollars or discounted DLC, lol.

OH! right, I forgot to actually review the game; The overall balance of weapons and mechanics is terrible, I bought this game wanting to do the Street Shootout from Heat, instead I got a basic horde shooter with perks, really REALLY bad stealth, and meh guns. Playing this game without any DLC at all puts you at a disadvantage, there are DLC weapons and attachments that are nice to have / more useful on the higher, more insane difficulties. Like the Cavity SUB-2000 for stealth builds or the m60 for not being a cringe stealth player. 

All of the guns have arbitrary stats that don't follow any logical pattern. Some guns do more damage but have no ammo, other guns do no damage and have lots of ammo. A sniper rifle in .308 caliber will penetrate armor, but a Galil assault rifle also chambered for .308 will not. All in the name of GAME BALANCE for a PVE shooter...?

As for the Difficulty settings, once you get ranked up a little bit, anything below ""Overkill"" (4th difficulty) is boringly easy to do solo. Let alone with players or bots, and anything above ""mayhem"" (5th difficulty) is an annoying slog where you're forced to play whatever meta the community has come up with at the moment. No freedom to bring what you want, you either run this kit / perk deck, or you die. 

There's no middle ground difficulty where you can experiment with non-meta gear while still facing competent resistance from the AI. It's either a trip to the petting zoo with your 4th grade class or fighting with a butter knife at the Battle of Khe Sanh.

If this game Didn't have terrible stealth, weird weapon statistics, spyware. Or that god-awful, talentless, evil scumbag Ethan Klein as a playable DLC character. I could maybe give it a thumbs up. 

At least the music's good I guess."

12329,"The team AI randomly changes from being completely OP to completely useless. Sometimes you can pick every single safety deposit box in a bank without a single officer getting into the vault, sometimes it'll feel like your team does nothing but shoot walls and get in your way while trying to defend yourself from super soldiers who are able to hit a dime from across the map. There's also this strange thing where the AI acts really weird outside of your vision. This can lead to police just walking up behind you even when your AI teammates are looking directly at the officers.

The damage from all officers ramps up with the difficulty to the point where adding more special units starts to feel unfair if you play single player. The officers also seem to prioritize shooting at players rather than AI.

There's also a really annoying delay between looking at an object you can interact with and being able to use the interact key. It's also really annoying that just holding down F doesn't start the interaction automatically when the prompt comes up. I've wasted way too much time to this inconvenience.

Overall it's a really fun game, but there are a number of small things that really make it frustrating to play single player."
12330,"“Gold is golden.”
“It’s payday fellas”
“Ahh I need a medic bag”
“WULULULULU”

From Dallas requesting a medic bag to a cloaker dropkicking you in the face while letting out the iconic sound effect, the game is full of memes and is an iconic game. Gameplay wise it can get repetitive if you are constantly going for the shortest time or the most efficient heist possible, but there’s a large emphasis placed on “if” The amount of stupidity which can take place in payday is incredible, why not make a super short suppressed M1 Garand and not even use it properly, constantly reloading to hear the ping. Alternatively you can do clay pigeon shooting with live grenades, throw a javelin into a guy wearing a bomb disposal suit carrying a Vulcan or even just throw cards at helpless civilians. 

Gameplay:
Can be summed up with: 1. Get to X. 2. Take Y from point X to point Z. 3. Wait at point Z for some time. 4. Take the stuff and get away. 5. Try to stealth, if it doesn’t work then try not to die
As you can see this can get repetitive, however playing with random lobbies always adds an extra layer of challenge as people have different playstyles.

You do get a fair amount of content without DLCs but to really experience Payday you need some DLCs, especially ones such as gage mod courier pack which allows extra weapon mods. The ammo system is also quite weird at first as the number on the right is actually the total ammo, including ammo in the weapon. So that’s slightly confusing.

Would I buy it? Yes, definitely, but maybe wait for a sale, they are fairly common but payday is already not very expensive for what you’re getting. If you are going to get DLCs, get the legacy bundle, it works out way better than buying individual DLCs. So in conclusion, it’s very fun if you don’t take it mega seriously and you mess around a bit."

Only thing I don't enjoy is stealth only missions (but thats purely my preference, I just like going in like bulldozer and tend to play the tank in most games, only issue is I also love completing all achievements) and the total reset when you level up an infamous level, gaining everything back is a pain in the ass. Ai's can be a bit on the useless side. I do sometimes get a glitch where it scrolls through my entire items and menu and it randomly equips things which can only be fixed by closing and re-opening the game, not sure what causes it but its happened way too many times."

12364,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.

The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?

Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.

Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.
CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ""The Elephant"", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.
PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.
Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.
Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.
More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.
Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?
Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.
A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts."

So, buy the game! Go out there and heist the world. After all, the world is yours to rob. Join us to keep those helmets flying!"

[Verse 1]
Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey, here's how you feel
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
Tilt your head back, let's finish the cup
M.C.A. with the bottle, D. rocks the can
Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan
We're offered Moët, we don't mind Chivas
Wherever we go, we bring the Monkey with us
Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D. is D
Double R foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey, and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell

'Cause I drink it anytime and any place
When it's time to get ill - I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice
Come on, y'all, it's time to get nice
Coolin' by the lockers, getting kind of funky
Me and the crew, we're drinking Brass Monkey
This girl walked by, she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker, grabbed the spanish fly
I put it in the Monkey, mixed it in a cup
Went over to the girl, ""Yo baby, what's up?""
I offered her a sip-sip, the girl, she gave me lip-lip
It did begin, the stuff wore in, and now she's on my tip

Step up to the bar, put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
You take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it
We had a case in the place, and we went right through it
You got a dry martini, you thinking you're cool
I'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool
I'll down a 40 dog in a single gulp
And if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp
Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'
Def-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin'
The song and dance keeping you in a trance
If you don't buy my record, I got my advance

12434,"Fittingly, PayDay 2 is a lot like a bank heist. If you pick your crew well, everything comes together like a well-oiled machine, and everybody gets rich. If, on the other hand, you leave the guy with the IQ of a toaster in charge of grabbing the money while you guard the hostages, you’ve booked yourself a one-way ticket to San Quentin. Like most co-op games, PayDay 2 is only as good as the people you're playing with, but when everyone involved plays it the way it's meant to be played, the rewards include challenging, high-tension action, and intense running gunbattles.


The core four-player co-op gameplay is really strong, as are the many systems and mechanics that feed into it. Crime.Net is your principal gameplay mode, where you'll choose missions from an interactive city map and get matched up with some partners in crime. Things like safe, guard, and camera placement are randomized every time you play a mission, keeping you and your buddies on your toes at all times, but in a creative and thematically appropriate idea, you get dropped in to case the joint as civilians first so you can get an idea of what to expect. Though it might sound boorish, it's actually one of the best parts of the experience. I never felt more like an uncatchable thief than when I started calling out guard positions to my teammates while waltzing through a jewelry store undetected.

Walking around the maps can be a jarring experience, though, due to some graphical inconsistencies. Out in the streets, environments feel believable thanks to impressive daytime lighting and some truly authentic-looking architecture. But that believability crumbles the moment you step inside, where the geometry is so basic, and the textures so flat, that you'd think you were playing a different game. Both could definitely use an extra round of bug fixes, though – I wanted to immerse myself in the fantasy of being a big-money bank robber, but an endless stream of snafus kept shattering it. Invisible walls? Check. Endlessly repeating civilian character models? Everywhere. By the time I noticed I could stand inside of innocent bystanders, I wasn't even surprised anymore.

Thankfully, the excellent sound design does a lot of heavy lifting, rescuing some of the atmosphere. Rifle fire rings out across the streets as beautifully as a church choir, and the muffled sound of a guard getting plugged with a silenced 9mm feels ripped right out of a good caper movie. Paired with a wide variety of well-animated hit reactions, the sound effects give PayDay 2's gunplay a punchiness that invited me to pull the trigger again and again. The dynamic soundtrack isn’t quite as memorable, but musical flourishes accompany each shift in pace, cuing you in that you need to either buckle down for a big firefight, or haul ass towards that escape van when the cops are hot on your tail.

But unlike its predecessor, that won’t happen every time you play – at least, if you play well – because PayDay 2 actually recognizes and rewards a smart, stealthy approach to bank robbery. Though some of the multi-day missions have unavoidable armed conflicts, most heists allow for a skilled crew to ace them without the cops ever getting involved. Disabling alarms, silently taking out guards, and effectively controlling civilian crowds all have a huge impact on how fast and how severe police intervention will be. A flawless heist is incredibly tough to orchestrate, but it IS possible, and that possibility kept me chasing perfection match after match.
Part of why it's so challenging, and alluring, is all the different details and elements that play meaningful roles. Downing security guards means you'll have to answer their radios to avoid alerting others. You'll need to balance your load-outs between mobility, utility, and concealability. Four robust skill trees affect everything from the kinds of gear you're proficient with to your skill at hand-to-hand combat or lock-picking. The amount of depth is impressive when you add it all up, and the result is a surprisingly strategic affair disguised as a fast-paced shooter. But the best part of all is that even once things invariably go wrong and the focus shifts from executing a plan to thinking on your feet, PayDay 2 remains a blast. The ensuing firefights are long and intense, and the varied types of foes that get thrown your way require good resource management and quick thinking to best.

Which leads us to PayDay 2's biggest, most glaring issue: the offline single-player mode. It should be clear that this is a co-op game that’s meant to be enjoyed with four human players, but if you had any aspirations of making bank as a lone wolf, you might as well shelve them. These AI helpers aren't even capable of interacting with objectives or carrying money bags, making even the simplest, most straightforward missions nearly unplayable. They’re fine as mobile meat shields, but otherwise, they make PayDay 2 look like a much worse game than it is. It’s honestly baffling that they’ve even been included in their current state.
Verdict
Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big. Parts of its presentation are lacking, and the state of its single-player is criminal, but overall, it's a deep, addictive co-op shooter that tickled my inner burglar."
12435,Guns and hostages go brrrrrr
12436,Payday 2 is a game that has lots of guns and lots of fun. Buy this game if you love freedom of customization and dumb fun. Character customization is practically in your hands from perk decks to skills.

12495,If you like the bank robbing type of game then this will be perfect for you. I think it is a super well done game and would highly recommend it.
12496,"This is a great game with friends! BUT, it's great for the price. I have put in a lot of hours over the years, but at the end of the day, it's the friends that make it fun to do. After you have played each mission a handful of times, there isn't much to bring you back. Missions boil down into, what gives the most money or xp. None of the missions are really fun. Not fun enough to warrant doing 1000 plus times. The game loop works as follows: you get xp, level, then prestige (lose your levels, and start over with minor buffs and a cool mask). Then you do it again. After you have prestiged a few times, you have done most of the missions in the game. Then you would have to buy dlc. This extends the process by a little bit, but after a while you just come back to the fact that you are doing missions to see a number go up. That number being your prestige level. If you are playing with friends, this is fun enough. But you can only play a mission so many times before everyone is just doing it on auto pilot. I think it's worth the price of the game, but do yourself a favor and play with friends. It's not much fun alone. Hope this helps!"

It really is one of the best stealth games ever made, and really really unique, you cant find a game like Payday 2, there is no game similar enough to compare it, it is so so good.

If you want one of your best solo experiences of your life, THIS, IS, IT.
Alot of customization for character, masks, etc. Also many many mods.
Only problem is that you need most dlcs to be able to do the campaign but if u are paying for them like i did its 100% worth it. Also its going to run really smooth on any computer with very decent graphics."
12503,nice
12504,"It's an old game, but I find myself coming back every so often to gun down waves of cops and stealing all the cash. There's enough variety in missions, guns, and load outs to play any way you like. Plenty of free and paid dlc content without suffering too much, if not at all, from a paid to win system. Great community and supportive Dev team. Any comment saying the game is repetitive is making a lazy opinion because that applies to anything on a case by case basis. This is a heisting fps, so if you like bank robbing movies and shooting things, give this game a shot."
12505,"play this if you want heart attacks
"
12506,"Payday 2 in the beginning game: ""Yeah! let's go rob a bank!""

Payday 2 in the end game: ""We just robbed the white house and also took some ancient alien artifact and mindswapped bodies with the president of the united states.

Payday 2 in the post game: ""Let's go steal even more shit!""


All in all. Really fun. Especially with friends. You either grind out Death Sentence One Down runs or just wanting to feel like a badass and decimating cops in Overkill difficulty and below."

12558,"I had been considering writing a review for PAYDAY 2 for a while, and while for the majority of my playtime I've really enjoyed the game, I cannot recommend it due to the questionable changes the developers have been making to the game, especially in regards to its balance. However, that's nothing compared to their decision to introduce the data harvesting spyware Gamesight, formerly known as Red Shell, into the game. This isn't disclosed on the Steam store page either, so you'll only know that Gamesight is on your PC once you've already installed and run the game for the first time.

In my opinion, it's disgusting that this kind of 3rd party tracking is in the game at all, and I really can't trust the developers not to monetise its playerbase more aggressively in the future.

Edit: I'd like to clarify that this review was not written soley due to the Gamesight integration. There are many reasons I can't recommend this game in its current state. They continue to sell DLCs that are nothing more than badly optimised, rehashed versions of heists released years prior, and they continue doing this while leaving the game in a downright broken state. There are many gamebreaking bugs that have gone unpatched for years, such as the black screen bug, cops walking through walls, Cloakers kicking you from another country, etc. The game suffers from excessive power creep, which has somewhat recently culminated in the release of Leech, the most powerfully broken perk deck in the game so far. Ethan Klein is also in this game for some reason.

Half of the game's heists have very poor optimisation, resulting in inconsistent and/or low framerates. People like to blame the engine for this, but that's not the case - community-made mods have proven that even some of the worst-performing heists such as The White House can run at very good framerates without any sacrifices to graphical quality, so this is a developer issue, not an engine one.

Also, the game's Linux port is a joke that features a broken framerate cap, constant stuttering and an average framerate of around 35 FPS. Similar to the console versions of the game, it was released and has since been essentially abandoned. I've heard that some people can get decent performance out of the Linux port, but I've not seen it for myself. If you're on Linux and having performance issues, try running the Windows version via Proton. Just note that, for some reason, the asset files are not shared between the Windows and Linux builds, so you'll have to re-download the entire game if wish to use the Windows build on Linux.

In regards to Gamesight, it's important to understand that the information they collect [i]looks[/i] innocent at first glance. However, they use this information to fingerprint your device and track you across the web. Even if Starbreeze isn't using this data in any insidious way, Gamesight are the ones who ultimately collect the data and can also use it. If you're okay with this, then by all means, opt-in. But personally, I don't trust Gamesight and I certainly don't trust Starbreeze who have a history of lying to their customers.

That said, this game can still be very fun and at its core its a great game. It has great gunplay, an amazing soundtrack and most of the heists are fun and well-designed. It's just a shame that its ruined by the game's overall instability and Starbreeze's greed.

I love this game, and it pains me to criticise it so harshly, but I cannot defend Starbreeze's business practices and laziness when it comes to new content and the game-breaking issues that the game still has despite being supported for 9+ years.

If you're a new player looking to get into this game, I'd say avoid. If you do decide to get it, get it on sale and get the Legacy Collection. Most of the new DLC are simply rehashed versions of what's been released before, so as long as you own the Legacy Collection, you basically own all of it."

12573,played this game on the xbox back in 2016 now i play it on my pc great gamelots of fun and there is so many classes and wacky ways to play
12574,Amazing.
12575,"Really love this game :D
it has a lot of variety:
TONS of different weapons, you name it: swords, bows, grenade launcher, flamethrower, playing cards...EVERYTHING (even a spoon!!)
Skillsets easy to modify, can create profiles to store combinations of them, or other more general profiles to keep combinations of skills, perks and weapons all together.
Heists have randomized elements that make them unique everytime.
You can chose in most of them how to play, stealth or loud.
It hides tons of secrets to explore.
Needless to say it's a must try"

2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 tablespoon canola oil
12 mini flour tortillas, warmed
1 cup pico de gallo, homemade or store-bought
1 avocado, halved, peeled, seeded and diced
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
1 lime, cut into wedges
DIRECTIONS:
In a small bowl, combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Season chicken with chili powder mixture.
Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side. Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces.
Serve chicken in tortillas, topped with pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro and lime."

12725,"When the game had just come out, Overkill promised players that there would never, ever be microtransactions in PAYDAY 2 on multiple occassions. They lied.

When players were completing challenges for Crimefest 2015, Overkill promised that all content unlocked from the completion of challenges would be free. They lied.

Screw Overkill.

I mean, I really, really wish I could say that despite all that there is still a part of me that enjoyed the game, even after all this. And I tried and I tried - because I never played any other game as much as PAYDAY 2 up until that point. But the weapon balance they brought witht he pay-to-gain-the-advantage microtransactions made all the gunplay feel completely off, compared to what it used to be. Assault rifles are inaccurate and ineffective, and the pistols have all been turned into hand cannons. Concealment in stealth is now more reliant on how much your weapon skin buffs concealment than your skills and mods.

I really still wish I could say ""despite all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, what's was always still great about this game was..."" but it's gone now. That era has been and gone, and it really, really saddens me.

Rest in peace, PAYDAY 2 pre-Crimefest 2015. A brilliant game with so much potential. You will be missed."

And that's the only way I would got it, not because it's a bad game, far from it, but It's almost the polar opposite of what I like in games. It's multiplayer, to play with frends, frenetic and action packed. That's not for me, at all. But it's similar to first one, which I enjoyed, but a lot more polished."

12739,good
12740,playable
12741,Beans on toast.
12742,"Cool game in the core, but nearly unplayable.
The community is absolute trash. You shouldn't had given individual players control over their lobbies, they abuse it so hard and feel like gods in their lobby, kick-baning me and others for no or wrong reasons, just cause they can. And that to such an extend that you barely can't join any lobby.
These stupid humans can't think, they have no brain, they are animals from the stone age, and they make out 95% of the whole community.
Why couldn't it be just like cod where the host is just hosting and doesn't get entrusted god tools, that their small pea brain clearly can't handle?
Absolute scum community. If I wouldn't know it better i'd say they are almost all aggressive, depressed, suicidal, angry 8 year old kiddies who rather insta ban instead of straining one brain cell (if existing).
Also, there is a very, very obvious option to set the lobby to ""only friends"" or ""private"", but half of the community apparently doesn't find it, and prefers insta banning dozens of people joining them. Maybe you have to have 1500hrs play time before you realize that option?"
12743,"Pros: Play this with friends and it is a lot of fun for a long time. 

Cons: super grind-heavy. Also hold on tight to your wallet. This developer will stop at nothing to drain your bank account with DLC. They will probably cure cancer before Overkill stops producing weapon packs and new heists. I can't even remember how often they said they'd move on to Payday 3 and then came back to this for the easy money it generates.

High difficulty is achieved by making enemies bullet sponges and their damage enormous. The only way to counter this is to read into whatever the current meta is and following it by the book. If you want to complete heists on high difficulties, you do not have a choice HOW to accomplish it. There is only the meta.

This game has more weapons than the amount of socks all the Kardashians (and their film team) combined must own. New players will probably be overwhelmed. Give the game a fair shot and if you like it, buy the DLC in a bundle. Do not(!) buy DLC separately, it will mess you up.

Story wise this game has strayed so far from it's roots that it ofter derails into Saints-Row-like silliness. Payday 1 was a completely different experience, almost incomparable. I highly recommend Payday 1 by the way - very simple, very straight-forward. Payday 2 often feels overloaded with too many details and add-ons that make it unfathomably confusing. It almost feels like features were added into this game over time without applying any filter to prevent superfluous crap from getting in.

About the community: There are nice players, there are jerks. As in every game. But since this game is so heavy on experience and knowing what works and what doesn't, you'll find yourself antagonized in public lobbies if you play inefficiently or appear to have a low level. It is not predominantly skill that determines a successful player but knowledge of the games mechanics, skill tree, perk system and most importantly the heists themselves.

My conclusion: this game is the most fun if you get super invested in it, learn everything there is and let yourself be absorbed by it (and - sadly - if you buy all the DLC). So dip your toes into the water and see if you like it before you commit. Casual on- and off players won't enjoy this nearly as much."
12744,"This is one of the greatest CO-OP games of all time, and with it just being 10$ and going on sale often? It's a no brainier. The real cost is the 80GB on your hard drive."
12745,I NEED A FOOKING MEDIC BAG!!
12746,"This is an amazing game with good grind, but could take a couple of tries to get into lobby."
12747,Still ain't got the thermal drill
12748,"[h1] Payday 2: A game somehow still worth buying and playing in 2022. [/h1]

Seriously, they've given us updates for 8 years and are still coming out with new content, even if some of it is questionable.

Go rob some banks, shoot some cops, and don't forget that f*cking piece of sh*t drill.

"
12757,Best horder shooter out there
12758,"Payday 2 is a very fun and customizable game that can be played with friends for hours on end. However, I cannot recommend this game because of the sheer amount of DLC. Not only is there A LOT of DLC, but the game itself is balanced around the DLC, not items that players can get for free. I would not have a problem with it if the DLC was not so prominent in the game, but you have to spend a lot of money to do well in the game, which may end up making it cost more than most full games today. 

If you do decide to get the game, there are a wide variety of heists that you can play, but a lot of them are locked behind DLC. although most DLC is completely inaccessible by a FTP player, all DLC maps can be played regardless of whether you own it or not, so you can find a contract in the online menu on these maps or have a friend who owns the DLC start a lobby.

You can get by without owning too much DLC if you only buy DLC specific to a class you want to play, but it may get boring to play one way every single time."
12759,"funny, silly, heisting game"
12760,
12761,Great Game
12762,"This is a good game
(satire)"

Top with pie filling before serving."
12770,10/10 kachow would play again :)
12771,You pay 10$ for the base and your savings for the heists.
12772,"this game has guns

cool"
12773,"NOT RECOMMENDED FOR VR PLAYERS!
problems:
1. gameplay is repetitive and gets old after 5 minutes.
2. Feels like a GTA knockoff with only the crime and without an open world
3. VR controls are awful, uncomfortable, and make it extremely hard to play
4. Gets boring after only a few minutes of play time.
5. Hard-to-navigate settings, and almost impossible to change keybinds in vr.
6. gun physics are extremely annoying to use, and you can't drop your gun or change the hand you're holding it with.
Not a bad game, but needs a lot of improvement. If you're a VR player wanting a fun gun game, I would play Pavlov instead."
12774,Yeah I've played it a little

12806,cool
12807,This is the part where you realize that every moment's a swan song.
12808,"Fun for about 30 minutes until you realize there's nothing new coming and you already saw all the content. (Outside of cranking up the difficulty so enemies require 1000 shots each to kill). 

The AI and gameplay is extremely repetitive, to the point of being not-fun, and it's just a skinner box to make you grind overbearing amounts of XP and make you want to buy microtransactions."
12809,"we got almir listo to add a giant spoon. 10/10
who needs stealth when theres an assault rifle with an underbarrel grenade launcher"
12810,yes
12811,"bad game, I recomend it"
12812,"A fun time with friends that too can be very difficult (unless carried), leading to money being either too easy to get or too difficult, which is the same story with perks and talents. However the main gameplay is substantial and is always good together"
12813,Its great fun with your friends

12850,"I dont get it. What is the point of this game?
You ran in somewhere do some stuff, then shoot endless hordes of cops that dont deal you any damange?
Looks like poop. Where is the hype for this game coming from.
If I wouldn't got it for free I would be very mad about it."
12851,"PAYDAY 2 is a thriller, horde FPS. Commence sophisticated heists ranging from a simple bank heist that takes one day to finish, to taking two days too hunt down a Russian Mafia boss. All while being under attack by the (clone army) FBI forces.

With a total of 22 unique Heisters (ranging from a mute ex-military, to an ex-software developer) and 22 matching Perk Decks (you can use whatever Perk Deck you want with your preferred Heister) that allow you to alter how you play the game, well over a hundred, highly customizable weapons (ranging from your standard assault rifle, to something as outlandish as an old English longbow).

There is a lot to do in PAYDAY 2 aside from just robbing professional money launders, a full campaign, a game mode centered around speed running specific heists, to a survival mode. With around 60+ heists (some similar, most incredibly different), ranging from a good old fashioned bank robbery, to a two day heist collecting goats carrying drugs and getting away in a car on the second day.

PAYDAY 2 is one of those games that (even if you finish the campaign) doesn't really end until you declare you're finished.

Buying PAYDAY 2 and it's DLC supports Starbreeze and Overkill, giving them more money that they can put into PAYDAY 3 development. I'm going to miss Jacket.

PAYDAY 2 is worth your money if your into playing Clown-masked Heisters slaughtering half a thousand cops in a single heist while trying to rob a bank."
12852,the music is so good i forgot i was killing cops

"
12888,its a  great game over all
12889,"Even in 2022 this is a great game. That might be nostalgia from playing Payday with some of the best people I ever knew back in college. But with the continued content and awesome storyline and lore, Payday 2 is still very much alive and well to this day."
12890,"Tbh A really great game, the heist are well made guns are good, but some dlcs cost like 8 steam funds. i'm not saying the dlcs should be low, is just that's one problem about the game but the rest of the game is really good."

12914,"The game is good and it is really fun to play with a friend, unless you are playing in VR. The game alone is sort of boring (especially with AI) it just turns into a grind fest as you just play the same heists over and over again. I think the game would benefit from an actuall story mode with actual feeling of progression"
12915,"The Game is great in it's own right when purchased standalone, but the DLCs, especially the newer ones, are where this game shines, the modding scene is probably the biggest i've seen second only to minecraft, basically allowing you to mod the game to your heart's content.

Overall, a great game and worth the price, though maybe get the DLC on sale."

Just saying."
12930,My parents are worried about me.
12931,I spent more money on DLC for this game than the actual game.
12932,I consider this game a religion. I own every single dlc for this game and put a lot of hours into this game. Anyone who doesn't have the drive to play this game is lacking motivation to become a true proud heister.
12933,"Ever since I was first introduced to the series by some good friends some years ago, I've been a huge fan of it ever since. Great co-op, plenty of insane action and awesome game play! 10/10 would recommend!"

here's  a video link for recommended essential DLC for the game https://youtu.be/pOw-I2ErrHU i also would reccomend getting the game on a sale so you can save up for the DLCs as well"

Pros:
 - Cheap (when on sale)
 - A shit ton of content

13003,"Bad Game with Bad devs and community staff.

The game suffers from lack of anti cheat and devs that will protect cheaters on the community platforms like the official discord server.

The game suffers from dlc bloat, is poorly made and half of the time you will need mods to fix issues that the devs refuse to fix themselves, and the ""newer"" heists (like stuff from 4-5 years ago) will crash you game 50% of the time without fail, no matter your setup because this game can only use 4 gigs of ram no matter how much ram you Have.

Not worth, buy the base game for cheap and download dlc unlocker for the rest of the content, the devs don't deserve to get money for all the broken dlc content that crashes when u boot up"

13027,"Great game, really awesome modding is very accessible and pretty easy to do, but I have some things I want to address!

1st off over the years the textures have been downgraded by sneaking them in updates without any notice for ""better performance"", but downgrading the textures doesn't give that much more better performance and why not let us decide what texture quality we want instead of giving all the players the same low quality textures even if they have a high-end gaming pc, what they really should have done is optimize their game more and that would have given significantly more performance.

2nd there are SO MANY DLC's and they aren't cheap either and some DLC's aren't even worth getting.

3rd there a many glitchy things that can easily be patched, like wrong dialogues being activated, wrong things being displayed, etc. (Luckily for us there are alot of mods that fix these problems and glitches at modworkshop)."

13029,"Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big. Parts of its presentation are lacking, and the state of its single-player is criminal, but overall, it's a deep, addictive co-op shooter that tickled my inner burglar."

13070,"This is one of those games that absolutely nobody says is a good game, but everything about this game will make you want to come back. It's insanely addictive. When I say it isn't a good game, I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's my most played Steam game atm. But the game definitely has a significant amount of problems.

Pros:
-Quite possibly the most fun I've ever had in a shooter, and this is coming from someone who just finished Ultrakill an hour ago.
-A LOT of ways to experiment with builds to fit your playstyles, it's one of the reasons I've been playing it so much for months.
-The story is very interesting, at least in my opinion.
-Very active modding community. This is another reason I've been playing a lot.
-Amazing sound design. There is only a few OST's i would listen to daily, and this and the first games OST's are two of them.

Neutral:
-The DLC's. Everyone who has played Payday 2 knows how much DLC it has, but the reason why is because Overkill and Starbreeze almost went under after the... ""incident."" This would be in cons if that weren't the case for the DLC.
-The console versions are terrible. They stopped updating this game on console a couple years ago because of the ""incident"", and because of that the console versions are very outdated in content. PC is the best way to play this game by far. The reason I put this in neutral is because of the neutral before this one.
-The outfits. Yeah there's some cool stuff here and there, but most of it is behind a paywall (which i understand) and don't really look like they're worth four dollars.
-Stealth.

Cons:
-There is little to no balance in this game. if you are new you will have a hard time figuring out which perk decks to start out with unless you follow guides on them. I've been there before, I know how it feels.
-It goes without saying at this point, but the engine this game runs on is horrible. It's a heavily modified version of the Diesel Engine, which was made specifically for racing games. Dunno about you, but that doesn't seem fit for a horde shooter.
-This game is very unoptimized. It isn't Cyberpunk 2077 launch date kinds of bad, but it definitely isn't good. Heists like Hell's Island and San Martin Bank definitely need work with its optimization. 
-There are a lot of cheaters in death sentence lobbies (which is what I play on), and I mean a lot. 1/3 death sentence lobbies will definitely have someone using cheats in one way or another.
-The game is pretty buggy. Enough said.
-Micro transactions. Years ago Overkill promised there would never be micro transactions, but they added them anyways. It's a massive ""fuck you"" to the people who play it.
-Public stealth lobbies.

Does this game have problems? Many of them. Is this game atleast worth playing? Absolutely.

I give this game a solid 8.7/10, loads of fun but definitely needs to work on the problems I mentioned

also stop calling this game a fucking bank robbing game"

13080,"""AAAHHHHHH!! I NEED A MEDIC BAG!"" Is the only thing I hear when I think of payday 2. I am still surprised that such an old game like this hasn't died or been renewed with payday 3 yet, it still gets constant updates! This game has so much controlled chaos that you control in your fingertips. There is a story yes, but just like many of the other players in this game, I only do it for the fun mechanics that makes everything a living nightmare. There are two ways of doing a normal mission. The sneaky way with lockpicking and silenced weapons takes time and cooperation with your teamates to get more experience and cash for each mission. The other way is guns blazing, running into a bank with 30 civilians and blowing everyone there with a rocket launcher as the police send endless waves of armed guards, the area just becomes a slaughterhouse. The upgrades in this game are also insane, each one giving you basically god like powers that makes you immune to enemy gunfire and allows you to take missiles over and over again. I can go on and on about the crazy mechanics that make this game fun but that would take forever. I strongly recommend this cheap game  that includes hundreds of amazing stuff that makes each playthrough crazy."

13093,yes
13094,Really enjoy the game aged well
13095,"Firstly, as I started playing this game, I wanted to redeem my money after 2.7 hours.
But as time progressed I began loving this game. 
As of now I have accumulated 1000 hours in this masterpiece of PAYDAY 2.
Similiar to tf2 with its spagetti code, this game runs on a race engine and plays like a potato. (I love playing potato games)
I met a ton of friends in this game, still play it regulary with new players and will continue to infamy up until I reach infamy 100 for the last infamy achievement or infamy 420 for the fun of having a funny number.

The ride since 2013 was very bumpy. They removed the case drops, so nowadays everyone gets a drop daily (economy was fucked by this tho). Although promised not add further DLCs they are still adding new DLCs, like new heists, cosmetics, weapons etc. I have nothing against this because this way they can get the financial support they need for the upcoming PAYDAY 3, after their last game RAID WW2 flopped and they were almost bankrupt. 

Contrary to other games you can't finish PAYDAY 2, there are always new ways to play it, be it playing with mods, speedrunning, getting better in (new) heists, leveling infamy (Infamy 500, level 50000 is max.), finding new glitches & bugs you can exploit, learning game mechanics or teaching new players (or even friends who are new to the game). The possibilties are endless. 

Of course just like in every other multiplayer game you will encounter cheaters, you can either avoid them by looking and the name before joining a lobby or autokick them / manually ban them if you are the host. In my experience you will encounter cheaters in about every 15-20th lobby you join or about every 30-50 player who joins you. Just like in CSGO you will encounter the sterotypical cheating russian who is infamy 200 and has all achievements done in the same minute. 

With time passing you will encounter the playersubtype I would call ""special"", there are wide variations of this subtype. This could be either a new player with no silencer who does not understand the concept of stealth after restarting the heist 3 times in a row because he keeps rushing everything or someone who has no brain and does not learn from his mistakes and keeps doing the same mistake repeatedly like bumping into guards or going trought lasers. This subtype of players are mostly found in infamy 0-5. My friends and me are calling those kind of players the ""classic payday 2 player"". 
Of course you will find very competent players in this range as well and very special people outside of this range.
A cheated infamy 100 more retarded then a player with brain being infamy 0. 

All in all, I would recommend bying a Steam Key for this game outside of Steam, because they removed the Scarface DLC due to licensing issues, which is a great DLC in my opinion."

13196,"Payday 2 is a great game about committing organized crime, and doing criminal work for different people. I love the variety of missions and I'm impressed in how different they can make the same map feel. I like that there are missions where you steal data, destroy money, and take a singular important item, it really makes the game feel less like you just do the same thing in a different map. I prefer stealth in games rather than a loud approach but the weapon upgrades and uses makes loud really fun, but stealth is still my primary approach to missions that allow stealth."

13202,what the fuck
13203,its a pretty good game and the bugs in the game are just features or ruin the game a little if you remove its overall a very good game would recommend

13211,big spoon gud game
13212,Consume Payday Content
13213,very good game totally recommend to play and its cheap
13214,A game is good when you can't decide which meme to use on its review
13215,Game is fun. However user interface is probably the worst I have ever seen. Needs an 3 hour course before you know how to start a game.
13216,"Fun dirty deeds done dirt and cheap game especially with mods

Like you can be pekora doing crime or you can even be majima and shoot cops instead

Downside: dlc, without it you will have very little option to play with"
13217,dead game.
13218,Fun to play as a group
13219,"I hate this game. I hate it so much that I've never actually played it :D
don't really plan to either, sugondeeeeeez"
13220,because in my opinion i like it
13221,GAME is good mainly just with friends
13222,Very good
13223,"game very fucking good
"
13224,This game rocks as you were given options to either go stealthy or go blasting which I prefer
13225,"KNEEEEEL BEFORE THE D U K E!

Please pay attention, you will be happy to know, you are victims, of a robbery! :)

Oi, Di**head! come with me!



best game. for those lines alone. 
Consume Payday Content

this is a threat"
13226,"if you r looking for a fast-paced game, I highly recommend you buying this game, But its better to buy the ""legacy"" edition, just because it conjtains a lot of dlcs included in the game. Anyways, Amazing game"
13227,"Great game.
If you like robbing stores and banks and ""other things"" this is the perfect game for you, the freedom of choosing whatever loadout you want with a wide array of different weapons. There are tons of heists you can do all of which are different than the others. You even get a rundown safehouse at the start, but as you progress through the game the safehouse turns from a complete dump to buckingham palace. So in short this a great game."
13228,"as the great martincitopants said ""very gud"""
13229,makes me want to shoot kids
13230,just put razormind and wreak havoc

13254,Spent too much time in this game lmao. Also runs way better on linux mint instead of windows on my laptop if i remember to take it out of power saving mode and actually use the gpu. Also on windows i have to turn off multi threading or my game is a stuttering mess.

"
13267,"One of my favorite games of all time. You get to rob banks, planes, museums, and so much more i won't say due to spoilers. The community is very welcoming and will help any newcomers as the need. So regardless of if you have a group of 4 to play with, it's one of the most fun and content rich games out there."
13268,Good Game
13269,"realistic-ish and fun, strongly recommended

10/10 would medic bag again"
13270,Why the f y'all removed Tony Montana?
13271,Its alr
13272,"A very good game to play with friends, stealth is my favourite tactic but having to cover your friends while killing cops can be very fun too."
13273,"actually pretty fun, tho it could totally use a little more info in some of the missions, once you get used to the flow, the hard part is just the infinite cop swarms! multiplayer REALLY helps, as the bot AI is pretty dumb... but funny enough, they still make DLC for this game!"
13274,Its fun
13275,very good game to play
13276,"Very fun if you like having a date with the thermal drill. 10/10 would do again, as for the game 10/10"
13277,"fun game 
"
13278,"One of the best free-to-play shooters. The co-op mechanic and horde based gameplay make it incredibly fast paced, intense, and all around great fun. The guns and mechanics are incredibly realistic, making a quick and intense match for you and all your friends."
13279,"BAIN, I'M MISSING MY TEXTURES AND I FORGOT TO DOWNLOAD SOURCE"
13280,musicccc beeeo beeeeeeeeep
13281,"Great game, great devs, supportive community. All around a great time."
13282,this game is very epic and me enjoy big time.buy and play now or you go to juice wrld concert and see harambe
13283,very fun game love the concept of it and its vr too whats not to love wish the game was more popular and it should be with all the extras it has and customization's for guns masks outfits and hidout
13284,"Game is really well made and I'm glad ""Overkill"" keeps updating it. If you want to enjoy the entire content, you have to pay a lot (even without buying all DLCs there is a plenty stuff to do), but I do not regret spending any money on that game. Amazing gameplay, characters, weapons and most importantly lore.
I'm waiting for the ""Payday 3"" and I'm going to buy it for sure.

I noticed one thing and I think it might help new players (only applies to ""loud"" plan), so they will not be discouraged from playing the game.
The higher the difficulty the faster you need to do things in game. Basically think faster. After a while you will get used to it and be able to do heists on ""Death Wish"" ;)"
13285,haha I get the mony
13286,"gayday 2, very gud"
13287,its very fun but dont play over hard mode if ur just starting out if you like having a working keyboard and mouse also dont expect guide from 5 years ago to still be valid

13306,good game.
13307,after playing this game for 70 hours i would recommend this game for people who like robing games it really fun i had a good time but it easy on xbox as it is on pc but i don't mind l love this game a lot and you need to get this game
13308,"I love this game! I have been a fan since it came out for console. But because I found out that you could do so much more on PC . I quiclky upgraded and found out that console was not even half the content I got on console. Who's infamy stopped at IV. So having all these NEW heists ( new to me ) , mods and more, It was like getting a brand new game! love overkill and payday 2. Can't wait for PAYDAY 3"

13313,Fun
13314,Yes.
13315,"if you've ever wanted to play a heist game where one person has to constantly stand next to the drill to ensure that when it breaks and it will break, you can fix it. Well this is the game for you!"
13316,YES!
13317,yeah its alright innit
13318,been playing for years i absolutely love paydady 2 and all of it antics
13319,gg
13320,"This game is pretty good honestly, It's more hands on/Interactive in missions whether it be having to memorize names, codes, locations, or Pre-Planning the mission before going in, I have a few problems with having to get DLC at times but I got the Legacy Edition at 75% off, so basically I have a series of DLC that would have been more to buy alone, But still I enjoy the game, Whoever is looking for a challenge in stealth, or going Gun's Blazing can change difficulty, I find the entry of Cloakers and Bulldozers at the 'Very Hard' Difficulty more challenging, I'd have to suggest getting a good Loud Skill-set, Otherwise you might just get wiped out on the first few minutes, It's way better to have friends who have the same game as you do, But going online and joining Public Lobby's is also an option, I prefer going solo in Stealth as I usually don't need help, But Going in Gun's blazing I usually need a squad and a plan otherwise I get wiped out, What I really like about the game is that you have to actually take time to memorize the mission names, maps, also you have to make plans, execute properly, and even then Screwing up is going to happen, I am not good for writing reviews or anything but I just felt like expressing this, Most of this was basically the same thing repeated, I once again am just really Shit at writing reviews, Thank you for your time and reading this, I genuinely hope this helped somebody, peace out."

13339,"A game that I really enjoy playing, something about the onslaught of cops and being able to just mess around with friends appeals to me, and for those that play for a challenge the option of Death Sentence One Down exists, an extremely challenging mode that i have only been able to complete Shadow raid in."

13342,mmmmm
13343,
13344,"You can play the game for a short while and its fun, however I definitely question the replayability. Missions become repetitive and stealth in pubs is just awful. I would only buy the game if its on sale."
13345,"There's tons of weaponry, loot to rob, and you're the robber. Enough said."

13355,"You don't need anyone's opinion on how good this game is. Nevertheless, this is a great recipe for an amazing caramel custard pudding -

Ingredients -
1. 1/2 cups sugar
2. 6 large eggs
3. 3 cups whole milk
4. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1. In a large heavy saucepan, cook and stir 3/4 cup sugar over low heat until sugar is melted and golden. Pour into eight 6-oz. custard cups, tilting to coat the bottom of each cup; let stand for 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, vanilla, and remaining sugar until blended but not foamy. Pour over caramelized sugar.
3. Place the cups in two 8-in. square baking pans. Pour very hot water in pans to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350° until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
4. To unmold, run a knife around the rim of the cup and invert onto the dessert plate. Serve warm or chilled.
5. Enjoy!"
13356,yacket
13357,crash to much

13389,fun gamrrgregrdffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
13390,day in turkey
13391,good game
13392,"This is quite fun when it comes to robbing heists on loud and getting to know the basics and the machanics. You'll get to feel something new if you play stealth. Stealth is easy, I think they should bring back the old stealth system but I guess we gotta keep it how it is right now since it would be practically impossible to actually complete a heist only on stealth.

I love how there is mods in this game! They are quite entertaining and I NEVER knew it could get so big and so far that would keep me modding forever. But still, I don't like mods, but I love mods. You can't deny that mods can be more fun and useful than the built-in features and scripts in the Payday 2 game. However, there is one down side to modding... CHEATERS.

Cheaters are pain in the ass and I can't deal with them easily if they can crash me. It's so disappointing for Overkill making the game so exploitable and explorable in API learning. I still gotta say, this game is damn good and I will never dislike the Payday games and the PAYDAY community. Y'all are the best for being a great helper to new players, and I appreciate it alot.

btw i dislike we have to buy DLCs to be cool"

13408,Good game if you want to blow your stress but doesn't have anyone to blow you at easier level. Harder levels are okay. Stealth missions are for masochists.
13409,Its a good game and DEFINETELY not a dead game.
13410,"Welcome to the world of crime, either become the ultimate tank and run through the 5 million cops they send once you're found out. Or become a ghost and never be seen/kill every guard without being caught. Either way you'll make enough money that you wont ever worry anymore. Also stick to your own level cause difficulty is mainly cancelled out by perks and abilities that you get by leveling up."

It has a great story, with some rough edges.
The Replayability is insanity, there is always another achievement that requires you to play in a very specific way, and you have nearly infinite customization of your gameplay experience.
Playing with friends is a blast, especially when laughing at the ai

The one negative thing I can say is that it is showing its age; however, even this is combatted with some mod_overrides for better textures and modern mechanics.

Because of its age, you may want to wait for a sale. I can assure it is worth full price, but it goes on sale for really cheap"

13507,"First off, I'd like to thank my friend for gifting me this game.

PAYDAY 2 can be a fun & thrilling robbery game. There is no Workshop on community on Steam for the game, but there is on external websites, so be careful where you download from. Although, I personally feel some of the DLC's are unnecessary, as some of them should be in the base game. It is also very easy to bug the game without realizing it. Such as getting unobtainable characters from public lobbies and forever glitching the character you can choose. Public servers are a unsafe place to go to be honest. Lobby owners will kick anyone they see fit; as they did to my friend more than once.

Over time, the game gets VERY, VERY boring and irrelevant. I spent a whole summer break playing with a few friends and pretty much accomplished what we wanted to do, now the game is boring. When I do play it, it is either to kill time, or play with friends. I am ONLY recommending this game because of how fun it was for me and my friends.

Overall, the game is fun for the first few hundred hours, but then gets boring as time goes on. The game is paywalled a bit, and the game is somewhat easy to bug. I will be updating this review as time goes forward perhaps."

13512,"Not really a heist simulator, but a hoard shooting game like L4D2 with some stealth elements, that lets you pull off a few heists quietly.

Overall solid game. Fun if you have friends and know what they are doing. Communication is key if you want a stealth play-through.

Will recommend. Fun with friends."
13513,it works.
13514,yes
13515,Astounding.
13516,really boring
13517,yeaaaaaaa pretty gud VR needs to be improved tho
13518,"The game guys, go get it.

This game follows that same ""Left 4 dead"" formula, you can play either alone or with up to 3 friends, you either go from point A to point B, or defend point B to get access to point C in order to get look and escape, while fighting all the time against an endless horde of cops, some of them with special abilities.

What makes Payday 2 special is the high amount of customization that you can get for yourself and your weapons, with multiple abilities and gadgets that you can equip, you could potentially play thousands of games and never ever bring the same primary and secondary weapon twice, always changing something on the equipment that spices up the gameplay.

It has a good amount of heists, so having the DLCs gives you a few more hours of playtime, the good thing is that only the host needs to own the heist DLC in order to host it and allow others to join in without owning the DLC."

13537,"[h1]Short version review:[/h1] 
After spending thousant hours in this game, i guess it is good time to write a review.

While ago i got this for free, at first i didnt liked it very much, but played with friends and kept playing even after they left. So it is probably not very suprising that i am more than happy to reccomend. You can play with friends or solo, whatever suits you. Its price is fair and often on sale anyway, also you are not forced to pay anything more you can join any heist even if you dont own them. Achievements are working and robbing banks it is simply a lot of fun.

[h1]Longer version (For those who have time and like reading tons of useless stuff)[/h1]

[b]Players[/b]
There basically four types of players:
Good and experienced - Great to play with theese folks, they know what they are doing and if mistake happens they understand, can adapt and are not harsh to new players.
Bad and unexperinced - Usually they got no idea what they are doing, they are new, but willing to learn and are here to enjoy the game. Fun to play with, it is harder, but not steoretipical and after all we all started somehow.
Cheaters - Not much to say, when you see them, leave server, just idiots with no desire to play.
Bad players thinking they are good - Worse case scenario and main reason i am playing alone. Usually kinds that swallowed all knowing of the world. They are making stupid mistakes and always blaming others. Sad thing that there is a lot of theese rage kids, they are just ruining game experience for everyone.

[b]Mods[/b]
Game got great modding community love to mess with the code. And basically everything can be changed from bot equipement and behavior, to cosmetics and overall map visuals. So now the real question is, am i stupid cheater? Well, i dont think so, im using mods for years and i still dont have most of hardest achievements, because they are not giving me some insane boost, also many mods i basically just balanced and made weaker, because they felt way too overpowered.

Ok, if you read up to this, now it is time to add some hate  to wrap this up.

Here is the reason why im not playing to much anymore: For me game ended when company got financial problems and everything was wraped, and PD2 secret finished. Dont take it badly, im happy that company is back on feet, but after returning, it was not the same. Many dlcs were made just to get cash, new heists are expensive and not ever on sale. We have new useless cosmetics like weapon colors, charms or lobby joining sounds and you cant combine suit skins with armors. New weapons were added but inventory space is the same and overall lot of useless stuf that im not willing to pay for, because i have absolute no use for it.

Not to end it it negatively, game got its flaws, but it also have its beauty and for low price you have fun for many hours. So go ahead and try it :)."

13557,"Just a little disclaimer before we start: Please be understanding as English is not my first language so do excuse me for any grammatical errors, thank you!

If you've seen my other review on another game, you might know my cousin.

Once again, he was the one who recommended this game to me. Being the gamer that he is, he would constantly be leading all the heists and missions while I meekly followed behind trying to help.

The sheer variety and creativity in each individual heist is incredible. From your normal bank heists, to breaking and entering the White House; You will never be bored of this game.

Not only that, but pushing yourself and your friends to the limit is possible with so many difficulties.

There were moments where we were over an hour into the mission already, getting so difficult and tough to move forward, but we persevered (also because we put in so much time already), and always ending with a huge feeling of accomplishment.

And if you know me, you'd know I love the customisation functionality. I love the masks. I love them so much!"

13610,"“The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.

Strategy

His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.

The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.

A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.

The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.

However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.

Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.

It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.

In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.

Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.

When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.

Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.

Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.

If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.

For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.

For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.

They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.

The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.

A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted

A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.

This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.

The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.

A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.”"

13661,"Whole lot of weapons, customization and heists. While playing with friends is best, solo is also great fun. I'll just sum up by saying i'm wearing a custom carnage mask, running around taking bullets from every direction while using 3 tommy guns. The game is dumb fun and it knows it.


(I would say, get the legacy collection if you want any of the dlc ... because otherwise some of them are definately not worth getting on there own)"
13662,The tutorial was really good
13663,yes
13664,"due to ~20gb's, it takes too damn long, tho also its download time as is long as its playing time, so yes, gud, 8/10 wud reccomend"
13665,"Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, ""Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.""

Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.

So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night.Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?

Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeletonwithout its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.

Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night."

13692,08iuytgv
13693,"Props to OVERKILL. 
While they could expand or work on the game's glitches more, a majority of the glitches give it heart and a fun laugh with friends.
Who expects a guard's arm to go through the wall? Or expect a body to go flying?

Or to crash straight into a wall because your crew sucks at driving.
Or prop the same car atop another car.

Who knows, but either way, it's a very fun game to play with friends but friends are not required.
I haven't reached a level of infamy yet, but that's because of my own playthrough.

Your skill tree is good to be open, but it's never forced to be, everything is flexible. Which makes it great.
You can be built for murder within loud heists, but then commit silent crimes the time right after-wards, or vice-versa.
It's always a good boredom cure, especially when something stupid happens.

Of course, it has it's aggravating moments, any game does.
But it's centered around teamwork, and if you have a good crew, it's amazingly fun.
10/10 in my book."

And there's like 1000 DLC, even for stupid shit like 70% of the attachments. And you end up holding the E key while picking locks and shit for like 2-3 minutes of each game. I don't like it."

13709,why
13710,"Community's more toxic then a litelar radioactive waste at Chernobyl i do not recommend if you're looking for a ""fun game"", basically you're gonna get fucked for anything, playing with mods? = Death threats, fucks up mission because of mistake = getting fucked by a whole team, having fun? Hell nawww nobody accepts fun here, i litelary spend like 10% of my whole playtime on playing with random people and mostly nothing happend but usually they get mad at me cuz i had low lvl? even doe 100 is max, it's kinda like all of those toxic people are the most demantaly broken fucks who has nothing better to do in thier life then getting mad at someone's breathing, next time you want to have accual fun in games choose something that has really small community they are always nice, or just play with only your friend cuz game otherwise is kinda fun but nothing special, it could've been a nice arcady shooter but its more of a competetive pile of steaming shit with a high amount of grind and yes i may be complaining about it but getting mad at loosing in mission that takes around 10-40 minutes is just sad"

13714,"[h1] PAYDAY 2 [/h1]

[b] TOP TIER CO OP GAME [/b]
Payday 2 is easily on on the best Co-Op game standing along Left 4 Dead !
the game is more than 9 years old , but it still got many updates and fixes (some of them are DLC)
[b] I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERY ONE ![/b]

[h1] Game Play [/h1]
The Game Play separated to 2 parts :

[b] LOUD !!!!! [/b]
The BEST way to play the game in my opinion is to play it loud !
in loud payday 2 shines as a star , the shooting , the music , and the team work with your friends 
is the best elements of this PvE game .
The maps disinde well , to be fun for killing hordes of swat that run on you like zombies , in each map you have different task for example : find manager key-card - open his office - hack the computer - disable the alarm - get the keys - and steal the cars !
every level different story and different loud play style .


[b] Stealth: [/b]
Ooh , I see it's hard to impress you with some shooting , so allow me to present you a world of shadows and sneaky tactics 
from all multiplayer game I have met Payday 2 has the best stealth mechanic off all .
Many of the loud level can be passed in stealth , that add a lot of replay ability to the game 
You can customize you'r stealth in many various way : skills , weapons , equipment and more.
Payday 2 open a big door of opportunity for the player to sneak to guarded In they way the player wants.


[b] Skills [/b]
In payday there 5 skill tree each of the have game changeing skilsl that will help you survive longer, make more damage , and finish job quiver ,
to fully understand what each of the skills do may take up to 100h , but when you start understanding the game logic you will start to have fun !
The only minus is that in the highest difficulty only some specific Builds will survive , and the other won't survive a minute.

[b] Weapons [/b]
all the types of weapons you may think , exist in the game (and what don't you can add with mods)
AR rifles , LMGs, sniper , revolver , mini gun , grande launcher , bow and many more .
All the weapons are customization  you can add scopes , silncer, grips and more.
The main down side is DLC .

[b] DLC HELL [/b] 
The main way the developer earning money is through DLC , around 90% percent of the content looked under DLC 
guns , maps , attachments, characters, skins.
No , you can't full enjoy the game without DLC so if you want to buy the game , you should consider buying the Full edition.

[b] MUSIC [/b]
The music in the game is amazing , Huge respect for Simon Viklund the composer of the payday 2 series !
He got the right scene for music , and he added to the game , he not only created music from authentic for the Payday 2 DLC like Hotline Miami , Hardcore Henry , Scar face , Reservoir Dogs
The music on stealth is pretty good , but in loud you will just want to stand up and start dancing !

[b] MODS [/b]
MODS is one of the main factor why the game is still alive .
the mods add a lot to the replay ability of the game , m there are thousand of modification you can add (character skins , new weapons and custom heist )

[b] CO OP [/b]
CO OP is a bomb it's amazing , awesome , but don't listen to me try by yourself 
playing the game with friends highly recommended !
nothing can be compared to completing  a hard stealth heist with your team on the highest difficulty !

I personaly recommend you to PLAY THIS GAME >< 
ps. YOU WILL NEED A MEDIC BAG"

13720,"This game and soundtrack slaps hard af. Such a good game, I wouldn't recommend. You'll start playing and next thing you know you'll sink over 700 hours in and then you'll end up single, with several broken keyboards, and no concept of reality. But not only that, you'll have no PC space left due to the immense amount of content the devs at Overkill put out (even after 9+ years) and be clinically diagnosed with PTSD from the booming soundtrack and firefights. All you'll have left is $334 billion in your offshore account and the ability to load up another heist in your sleep, if you still have time for that. This games too good it's bad."

13799,"VR Enthusiast here,

At the time of writing (2022), the VR experience in this game is much better than you'd expect, and with access to the entire library of weapons and maps, it can dwarf the enjoyment you'd get out of a lot of coop FPS's you'd find today. Add in the ability to seemlessly play with your NON-VR Friends, makes this game one of, if not the best VR 4-player Coop Action Shooters / Stealth games since the VR DLC's inception. Yes, even better than After The Fall (2022), which lacks content.

The experience is made even better, if you use the VR Improvements mod to allow for smooth locomotion. Follow these steps, and thank me later.

13816,.
13817,Game is fun and when you get more and more experience you can do everything as a professional. The only thing I hate is the amount of DLC and the requirement to follow a certain steam group to unlock a crap ton of items.

13862,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

13870,robing bank sim
13871,"Payday 2 is a game that revolves around heists. Heists that are provided by some contractor called Bain. Bain sends you all around the local area committing various acts of robbery on local store owners, banks and breaking some guys out of jail. The payment for doing these things successfully is obviously money, fame and a chance of weapon attachments, masks, mask materials and mask patterns.

You can use the money to buy new weapons or attach weapon attachments to your guns, create new masks with a fresh look. There are loads of guns to choose from and most of them support some form of attachment that adds or changes the looks of the gun. It’s fun just being able to customize guns like this but they don’t make a major difference in terms of usability in most cases. It’s pretty good fun but it does require the grind as most attachments are locked behind rng.

The missions has two different types of modes. There’s loud which you go in guns blazing trying to complete the objective whilst fighting off hordes of cops. Stealth which is well you sneak around the place trying to not get spotted by the guards, civilians and cameras. Both are fun in their own ways. Every time you successfully complete a mission you’ll get sent to a screen where you are to choose a card

Each card represents loot and choosing one will show you which type of loot you got and then after a couple seconds shows you which pool you got it from. To simplify this you select a card, get shown an image representing money, fame, weapon attachments, masks, mask materials, mask patterns and then after a couple seconds it’ll show you what you got based on that first image.

Now is payday 2 a fun and enjoyable game? I would say it is. It does have its bugs that can ruin some runs. Especially if you're doing stealth online where you could see the body but if you're not the host then it could be in a completely different spot. This is obviously bad as guards, npcs and cameras may be able to spot the body where you think it's safe. This was a run killer for a couple of games and was also really annoying for the more difficult stealth ones. There is also the grind. 

You also have to complete a mission to gain a chance of unlocking weapon attachments, masks and the such. This means either finding a really easy mission to quickly run through multiple times or playing through the mission that provides the currency to straight up buy attachments. You only have to do that mission once to afford any attachment once for a single gun.

If you don’t mind those then I highly suggest it and if you're on the fence then give it a shot when it's on sale since it does go for cheap. There is a lot of dlc but they expand on the gameplay and aren't required to complete the base maps that are in the game. The only bad part is that you’ll see the DLC REQUIRED quite a bit when looking through the weapons, masks and maps. You can test run maps by joining somebody else that has to see if you personally would enjoy it."

13878,"Check the achivements and go to the bottom, you won't regret it, trust me"
13879,Yes. Fun.
13880,"Ridiculous value, hundreds of hours of missions for the occasional price of free, including a bunch of missions and cosmetics from the first game. In terms of style and consistency, I think the first game is a lot more appealing, but I just can't argue with all the missions, equipment, and skins available. You could probably play this game for a full year, no problem."
13881,"before i edited this review i called payday 2 the greatest awful game of all time.

now i believe its just the most awful game of all time. abhorrently optimised, with wonky gameplay and story. but the worst part of this game is the developers DLC Politics. 200 odd nzd for the game and all of its dlc, in the state that it is, is wholly unacceptable. it is an absolute spit in the face, seeing as this game is developed on a modified racing game engine from 2001.

just. pirate. it."
13882,"I love this game to absolute pieces and I would highly recommend it it's become probably my favorite game and is so worth to hop on solo or with friends and mess around on different heists. Also has an amazing story and worth putting the time into to finish the game. And as Bain say's ""Let's do this"""

13889,"this game is really bad but I fucking love it for some reason
"
13890,"I love this game, the awesome characters, the weapons, the mechanics, but the devs need to stop making shitty and unnecessary new DLC, and focus on fixing the base game, or even just focus on PayDay 3 development. I'm sure with all the DLC they've released and the popularity of the game they're not short on money."

13902,"This game is really fun if you just play it as a horde shooter. Grinding out the achievements wasn't as enjoyable as i thought it was going to be. The new content is enjoyable, and there are some good heists in here, but if you played the first game, this plays radically faster than The Heist. Overkill in this game is as hard as normal was, and there are new difficulties, but are harder because there are more enemies and they hit really hard. Play the game with fun in mind and you'll have a blast."

13922,"For a free to play title I cannot give anything than a recommendation. Now to still name some good and bad points: The game can be very fun and tense, especially if you get together a good group and can communicate via discord or so. The stealth in the game can be very fun. As for the bad stuff, in my opinion the loud missions without stealth very quite boring and had a very generic shooter-style feeling, also sometimes the game was a bit buggy and finicky when it came to for example use certain abilites on NPCs."
13923,Its very much yes
13924,"Never understood the hype behind this game. Same boring missions, gun fights are weird, menu is complicated, same close quarters fights, weapon animations are poor, oh yeah and DLCS... The only good thing about this game is music and skins are somewhat cool too. Other than that not recommended."
13925,man i love shooting civillians and it is so hot when bain yells at me man

13929,nice
13930,"good game, only problem is that i think there is a lot of naked people. however it does say that it is age restricted, so what do you expect. and also its realistic because if you have been to a mansion then you would know that there are naked statues everywhere, and one of the mansion heists has naked people everywhere. also there is a heist called goat simulator. vlad best contractor"
13931,Who doesn't want to rob a bank amiright? Going loud or quiet is fun with friends but becomes a bag tossing simulator in the higher difficulties.
13932,"The game is excellent, very great graphics, I recommend it to people who like shooting games, it is very realistic and it is worth all the money !!!"
13933,"good game but relies so heavily on dlc you're basically paying 10 dollars for 1/4 of a full game, which is fair considering how cheap the base game is. but i would rather pay 30 or 40 dollars for at least 3/4 of a game then have to buy everything seperately"

14008,Robbers are not nice people.
14009,Literal virtual crack
14010,"After my whole experience with this game, I'd say that I can't really recommend the game in the current state. Especially  if you are trying to find a game with a good public games.

Issues as follows;
- Horrible public game hosts kicking you for no damn reason.
- Unfair DS:OD difficulty. Trying to force your whole player base to play in a certain way with that kind of (spongey enemies that kills you from far-far away is not fun - It is just cheap).
- Crime spree is a damn joke.
- Enemy AI's pathfinding is just horrid. Climbing through objects, dozers floating, etc, etc.
- Desync between players is still not fixed, very nice.
- The vehicle collision is still not fixed until now, cars, forklift, et cetera feels like slipping on a solid ice.
- Edit, despite claims in multiple reddit posts.. apparently civvies getting alerted and sounding the alarm on GO Bank, murkies instantly detecting you on White house was not fixed since 3 years ago either. Impressive.

Yes, you could still have some degree of fun with friends, but you can't just keep releasing more and more paid DLC, Overkill- that's just not how it works in my book."

14089,I robbed your mum's house.
14090,"Love the game itself but it's hella outdated, excited for PayDay 3."
14091,"Honestly this game is one of the BEST heist games. The cheap price tag, the amount of dlc, the feel of the game itself. And I love how the sale for this game during Christmas time is only 1 dollar, a great gift for a friend to play with. Please do buy this game!"
14092,"It is a good game, but I never want to see a fucking goat ever again."
14093,yes
14094,Fun as hell buy it will be worth it
14095,PAYDAY !
14096,"Lot's of replayability/ways to play, tons of content, and it doesn't take itself seriously. Basically, it's one big meme game with only one goal: to be fun. The community is really chill too. Aside from a small group of people who are toxic to others who don't have experience with certain heists, most people are just in the public lobbies for a challenge, success or no success. I play a lot of games from AAA to indie titles all the time, and this game just happens to be one of my most played. That says a lot to how much content and goofy fun is here."
14097,"first of all, Nice.
second of all, good game :]"
14098,nice.
14099,perfection. Literally one of my favorite fps games of all time

14105,"runs on potato PC, can cook meth as john wick, medic bag/10."
14106,fun game a bit grind y but with friends its super fun
14107,I would recommend this game to other players.
14108,much very yes
14109,Jheee
14110,"""killing civilians is bad"" yeah ok overkill"
14111,We *all* need a medic bag sometimes within our lives.
14112,"It does feel like this game is on it's last legs. I'll start with the positives. 

Positives:
Probably a really good game to just jump into and switch your brain off with friends. (I'd probably recommend that honestly)

The humour in the game is subtle at times and charming.

There's tonnes of customisation options from your weapons to your outfits and masks. The DLC practices don't really bother me but I guess you could describe it as pay to win. There isn't really a pvp aspect though and you can get by with the basic stuff and even buy DLC items with the what I assume is premium currency you can earn in career mode. 

Negatives:
The game looks not great, which is fair because it's getting up there in age now but idk if looking like it was made in gmod was good for the time honestly.

The gameplay loop can be really tiring. I haven't been able to really sneak through any levels because everything seems to be randomised every playthrough which includes guard walk patterns and positioning. That just leaves half hour long firefights against a whole nations worth of police and if you're not playing on the higher difficulties this means absolutely nothing to you. Most of the time I just scrolled twitter while waiting for the drill to break.

The servers are dead. I've had a few people join my games playing through the career mode but it's only ever one person who tends to leave halfway through, shooting as many civilians as they can before they go. It's really not that great playing single player as I'll get into.

A couple of missions will see you carrying heavier objects long distances, in one instance using a forklift. These two missions made me want to immediately uninstall the game. The long waits for the objectives to unlock coupled with how many enemies spawn is just frustrating in it's monotony. Adding an encumbered movement objective which you have to pack mule with while going through your own bullet hell just seems like developer sadism to me but who can say.

AI is pretty barebones, and you'll be running with a crew of them unless you have three friends. They will shoot, they will revive but don't expect them to help you with objectives. You're carrying those brickloads and driving the terrible vehicles by yourself my friend. 

Overall I'd give it a 2/5.

TL;DR: Servers are dead, can be a really boring experience solo and not really worth your time. 

EDIT: Just learned that Payday 3 is being partly funded by Koch media, not really keen on playing right wing libertarian oil baron sim so I'm probably going to give that a miss."
14113,Playable
14114,H3H3 should've been the last update
14115,Very Duisgise Much Robber
14116,it is so fun even by your self
14117,"Great game to play verry fun filled with lots of action. can choose for it to be challenging or just chill, good in single player but better with others. has match making."
14118,balls
14119,"Very re-playable. Tons of customization for your guns and masks. Skills that change game-play and add a sense of style to how you run and gun. Tons of different missions that range from either being stealthy using suppressors or to ""Going loud"" and just guns blazing. All of which generally revolves around getting some sort of loot. Can play it solo with offline bots who actually can be bullet sponges and help revive you or play online co-op up to 4 people total."

14166,fun
14167,OOAOHAHHHHHHH I NEEEEED A MEDIC BAAAAAAAAAAAAAG AAAAAHHH-
14168,As a person who needs to cash out czechs every payday I can confirm this is accurate to my everyday life pulling out my 12 gauge shot gun and everyone thinking I'm robbing the place. I do find it highly unrealistic that you can go to the white house and find out that the pardons are in the basement because last time I check they were in the fountain. I also loved how alcoholism prevent damage as I'm glad that the world is gaining more respect for alcoholics. 9/10 most woke game of 2013. Edit: after playing this game on silent mode and with 3 other clown I'm now realizing how crap the stealth is in this game. It's worse than all the meat gear solid games except for the 5th game which is the only good meat gear game because i can't do stealth.
14169,"yes it is fun robbing banks but also hard at nthe same time but very recommeded
"
14170,"yes
"
14171,"gennerally good game, plenty of missions and upgrades to always have fun with. The missions feel short but you can spend an hour on each and rewards system in great."
14172,
14173,its boring
14174,iz cool
14175,genre defining game that everyone should at least try
14176,Fun game but not that realistic when it comes to taking damage.
14177,gun go bang
14178,haha smg go brrr
14179,Can't to see what the Payday gang does next so Overkill can avoid bankruptcy
14180,"Very fun game. Stealth is a bit bs but I do love the fact there's mod support.

pros:
mod support
multiplayer (helpful most of the time)
helpful community 
*workshop mods*
cons:
1.stealth is a bit crappy (just use a mod to deal with pagers lol. *It aint cheating*)
2. stealth trolls (people that purposefully ruin stealth for you)
3. Lot of disconnects
4. crashes randomly (even mid heist)
5. pagers. How the fuck does the operator know a guard is dead when you killed them undetected? In front of another guard yeah makes sense. Camera? Yep. But in front of no one? Makes no sense.
6. No windows borderless mode (cause screw windowed mode). Borderless is more fun and makes you less likely to lag your game (GTA V already has borderless and the performance is better that way when you tab out to do something)

Apart from the cons and how old this game is *(August 13, 2013)* it's fun to play. I definitely recommend getting this. Crazy how this game has been out since the ps3/xbox 360 era."
14181,its really fun game im not gonna lie
14182,Dobra ko leb
14183,it's soo fun and make all the game's go brrrrr
14184,Fun game if you want to spend two hours trying to complete a stealth mission on to have your best run stopped by a AI heads phasing through the wall.
14185,"game borin as hell, cheated and had more fun, want my $5 back."

14202,boom boom no! silent... yes!!!!
14203,"What can I say about this game without making this 12 pages long...

Payday 2 is my favorite wave shooter. The dev team actively tries to balance not only weapons but also enemies in both easier and late game difficulties. The amount of customization possibilities is immense. The weapons selection is not only still being extended, but playing online you get to see so much variety due to the arsenal being so large.

Payday 2 actively encourages differed play styles, and to the day I die, or until Payday 3 comes out, I will stand by saying Payday 2 is one of my favorite games I have ever played.

Also modding allows me to turn my loot bags into body pillows great game 11/10"

14244,"i was very skeptical about this game at first. i was gifted it by some random in my friendlist. am i complaining? HELL NO.
very good objective based shooter. doing heists both stealthy and loudly is very fun. this game has my favourite shotgun from Left 4 Dead 2. it's underpowered but perks make it very fun to use.

cosmetic system is really nice. getting weapon skins and making your own is great. it has No Mercy from L4D2 as a heist and it takes place before infection. there's even Bill cameo at the start. 10/10"

Summary:

Payday 2 is an extremely underrated FPS game that shines in its unique mechanics, varying arsenal, and character customization, while incorporating co-op elements to make teamwork rewarding and the game is based around a theme of crime with an epic story and the game looks beautiful but has sometimes repetitive gameplay and lackluster stealth mechanics.

Gameplay:

The game is structured in different heists and missions that each take money from your offshore bank account to do but provide more spending and offshore money when complete. Heists involve many objectives and maps – usually stealing riches from banks or jewelry stores, but there are some other unique and absolutely insane (in the fun way) heists like stealing nukes, burning money, cooking meth, and attacking the White House. However, the gameplay does get repetitive sometime to just spam “F” on items or hold off cops while you wait for drilling or hacking, but some heists stand out, for instance, Cook Off (and its sister heist, Rats), the meth cooking heist, has you put meth ingredients in the correct order not to blow up the lab or Big Oil, a heist where you need to get the correct prototype of an oil alternative machine to the chopper. I personally hate Big Oil because I am no physics nut, but props where its due for gameplay. Still, be prepared for the grind, as Payday 2 is very much intense on grinding for XP (money takes a backseat). For customization of gameplay, Payday 2 is an absolute wet dream. There is so much customization, which I personally love, but if you aim more for simplicity and get overwhelmed but still like the Payday-esque gameplay, I’d recommend the predecessor, Payday: The Heist. Even without DLC, Payday 2 has a massive arsenal with many weapons to choose from and then you can customize your weapons with many skins, ornaments, attachments, and stat boosters. In addition, you can also customize armor type, armor skins, throwables, melees. It’s always a joyous occasion to beat DEA officers to death with a giant golden spoon that sets people on fire. Then you can also customize your character guy (which just changes the voice lines), the tons of skills, and perk decks. There are no two Payday 2 characters that are alike, I’ll put it that way. There’s always something for someone to suit their gameplay style, but some balancing issues in perk decks and skill trees exist. When it comes to glitches, they are very minor graphical bugs. Stealth-wise, the game is a rush to play, but the stealth system is clearly outdated and not up to par when compared to games like Hitman.

Graphics:

Payday 2 has exceptional graphics for its time and small production studio and they still hold up by today’s standards and look good, apart from some lo-res textures for blood splatters or iconography/text when up close.

Comparison to predecessor:

I haven't played Payday: The Heist, only researching features, so forgive me if I get some things wrong. Payday: The Heist has considerably less content and customization than Payday 2, which some may like due to simplicity, but personally, I believe the lack of content and lesser price of Payday 2 makes it more worth it than Payday: The Heist. Payday: The Heist also has only 9 heists, whereas the base game of Payday 2 has around 50 and if you liked the Payday: The Heist missions, they are in Payday 2 as well, remastered, albeit some classic heists are behind DLC. Payday 2 also has a way more fleshed-out stealth system than Payday: The Heist, most Payday: The Heist missions don’t even allow stealth. Payday: The Heist also has extremely minimal story compared to Payday 2.

Story:

It’s sad most players skimp out on the story, considering it is, in my opinion, an integral part of the game. The story is very good, starting with a gang of masked bank robbers, but ends with them stopping a global conspiracy. To fully, experience the story, complete the heists in chronological order and watch the Payday Web Series to supplement parts of the story, but not all of Payday’s story is in the web series.

THIS IS THE END OF THE REVIEW, BUT BELOW IS A SYNOPSIS OF THE STORY, SKIP IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO SEE SPOILERS.

The game begins with the Payday gang, which start in 2011, making money by robbing banks and museums, but as they get in touch with more contractors, they move onto more high stakes jobs. Later, the gang meet a character called The Dentist (played by the legendary Giancarlo Esposito, the actor of Gustavo Fring), a mysterious contractor that usually takes interest in historical artifacts. Working with the Payday gang member Duke, the rest of the gang slowly uncover the Kataru, a conspiracy to control the world with mythical artifacts, which started as a secret society to protect the artifacts but went rogue. The Kataru are working with private security agencies and mercenaries like GenSec or Murkywater to fund their illegal operations and assist the Kataru. The Kataru use multiple contractors to use the Payday gang and Murkywater to do their bidding of bringing them powerful artifacts and allowing Kataru-associates to progress into the political system, while fabricating the illusion they are not working with the Kataru is not working with GenSec or Murkywater by pitting the Payday gang against GenSec and Murkywater. When they finally get what they want, the Kataru then start working with the police to double-cross the Payday gang by offering them new information and capture the leader of the Payday gang, Bain, leading other contractors, mainly Locke, to aid the gang as other contractors like The Dentist, The Elephant, and Hector to be dismissed after being outed as informants or agents of the Kataru. The Payday gang then win the fight against the Kataru in 2018, after killing The Dentist and sieging the White House, giving themselves pardons to all their crimes and retiring from crime."

No other Coop shooter comes close to the level of variety this game packs, and every couple months it brings more free sh*t to the table.

11/10 experience. Occasionally unstable, but so, so worth it."

14539,"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

14621,"Ive sunk too many hours into this game so heres a synopsis

You have tons of weapons to choose from, every niche can be fufilled

enough skills and perkdecks for tons of variation and experimentation, as its free to respec points

Weapon mods that can help turn a good weapon, into something god would use to shoot someone with how potent they can become

so many heists you can play, some cater to some play styles and builds over others, rewarding the prepared

PRE PLANNING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ITS AWESOME, WANNA PLACE  A DRILL HERE OR THERE? JUST FUCKING DO IT! WANT A KEYCARD? A SET OF KEYS? EXTRA SUPPLIES? BIT O CASH AND YOU GOOD!

Uma fita de mais de um milhão
Pra pegar e fazer ostentação

Cada um com uma peça na mão
Cada um fez a sua oração
Uns até bateu o joelho no chão

Se der ruim nóis vai parar na prisão

14682,"Playable solo, but best played with IRL friends over mic. Online lobbies best played with mic.

The best thing I can say about this game is that it builds cooperation and friendship and a sense of teamwork with the people you play it with. More than most games, I feel like we are playing TOGETHER. It's been great for my friends and me. The game is old but is by no means dead, there is a decent modding community, and while there is a ton of DLC most of it isn't really necessary to enjoy the game or be successful in it.

Even when PD3 eventually comes out, I'll still probably play this game sometimes."

14699,"This is a masterpiece but it needs more content and his dlc's doesn't have what i am waiting for it, but is a very good game and i just find 1 bug in my experience so that's a good point and almost all of the missions 
that are repeated have a different experience. If u want to have fun for hours the this is your game."
14700,smells of old people robbing banks
14701,mmmmhhh very coke
14702,VERI GUD
14703,Best game ever made! 10/10

14708,wow!
14709,IM VERY MAD MY HAMSTER DIED AND IM IN EMOTIONAL DRESS AND PAYDAY IS WORKING FINE AND IM TAKING MY ANGR OUT ON THIS FINE GAME I LOVE TO PLAY
14710,As a fan that has played this game for years i will say payday 2 is a good game if your willing to grind like crazy.
14711,One of the most fun and awesome games I had played in a while.
14712,sos de baieti
14713,for the gun nuts this will be so much torture and equally as much gun porn for you. for the lovers of the shooter genre there's so many ways to play and rarely can you make any of them useless. this game is great. it's wonderful. solo or multiplayer you can have tons of fun in this game. some days i boot this up just to mod the guns.
14714,Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask
14715,A classic. Can't wait for Payday 3.
14716,game great!! Nice
14717,"
The gameplay has a lot of depth to it. In the way you customize your (100+) guns, to the skills you manage to the perks you chose. Everything just clicks. 
The game bleeds personality. Each Heister has a number of lines for each situation, and the enemies talk trash to you. Its great.
Although the game has a lot of dlc (a lot), this has been mostly rectified with the Legacy Collection, which includes most of dlc's up to 2018, and includes the base game as well, with a massive discount on everything. If you end up buying payday 2, i suggest you get this

This is one of the best Horde shooters ever"
14718,...
14719,DUCK
14720,i like it
14721,can steal everything from coke to goats 11/10
14722,"Two game types, stealth and loud. Stealth can be pretty hard but really fun with friends, usually trying to rob buildings while not getting caught. Loud is all about hordes, objective holds and pretty crazy shooting action. Some missions can be completed tactically, others are just about run and gun. Overall 8/10"

The only saving grace of this encounter is your miraculous survival. Now a hostage,you watch as an ungodly amount of cops get fucking vaporised by these bank-note bandits wielding all sorts of weapons like the aforementioned grenade launcher, along with a mini-gun, dual-deagles, and a fucking spoon.

Hostages can sometimes bug out and not follow you when you need them to move in a critical situation in stealth, team AI will sometimes have a hard time prioritizing reviving you when downed and often lose the mission on loud."
14761,Haha gun go BRRRR

14787,"hahaha, funnie rogue players
"
14788,"The game is fun. 

The community is terrible. 

Unless you have a dedicated group you can play with every time or the faith you won't go insane trying to do every mission solo with the braindead bots, this game isn't for you. 

In my last 20 or so hours of gameplay I have only completed missions solo, every time I join online the host will kick the entire party right at the end of the mission one by one and then exit the mission by themselves. Do not buy this, or any of the overpriced dlc."
14789,It's okay I guess
14790,Gun money shoot good
14791,"Simply breath taking
this is one of the best games I've ever played it so far is timeless and no matter how long its been sense it first hit the market this game will always have a place in the heart of anyone who plays it.

Much better with group of friends.
Terrible anti-cheat, devs too focused on making money by releasing dlc.
It isn't worth it at this point. Too much dlc, the amount of content locked behind the dlc is crazy.
Only purchase this game if you truly wanna play it for awhile, and plan on playing with friends.
You are going to get a hacker who will ruin the experience if you play public matches
Im 99.99% sure they promised to stop releasing paid dlc about 15 dlc releases ago..

14899,"After all these years and updates. This game still have crash issues and bugs that makes the game unplayable. What a bloody disapointment this game is.

The game would occasionally shutdown by itself, with no prompt and no error messages. Just closes. (like wtf? especially when during a long campaign. Wasting my time)

And don't get me started on a abysmal bug that makes the game unplayable. I have multiple times where my character would just randomly shoots my full-auto weapon and waste all the ammo. And for single firing weapons, they just for some reason doesnt allow me to shoot at all. The game assumes I was holding my mouse left click down so i can't shoot. 

FYI, my mouse isn't broken. It ONLY happens for PAYDAY2. 

Conclusion: Game Sucks, Still a disapointment, with updates which interest you to buy more DLC rather than fixing the issues. 0/10 would refund again."

15003,"Another cool game to play with the boys but strange how this game is 80gb, anyways there are a lot of stuff to do in here like managing your character, playing various game modes and etc. The only reason this games gameplay is challenging is because they spawn you 200 feds, special army, and policemans at the same time, so If you sorted your equipment and perks bad you are dead.

Easily one of my favorite games I own. It has extreme potential to be replayed, and is a great game to play with friends. If youre looking for a co-op shooter like Left 4 Dead, this is it. It will take a while to hit your first Infamy level, but it comes with progress. Be sure to take your time and try harder levels. And having friends always help me beat Overkill and Mayhem heists.

Anyways I digress. Buy the fricking game. Its worth the 10$"

15153,It's a blast. You can play solo but I recommend playing with friends. You can go silent without the cops even knowing you're there or go loud and kill them all while getting all the loot.
15154,"This game is old, yet it has aged quite well, and the devs are as of now still continuing to add new content from time to time. There are lots of secrets and fun things to unlock in the game. I would recommend the game even more if you have friends to play with, being able to goof around or have a synchronized heist. While lots of the game is behind dlc, it is worth picking up dlc to experience the different heists and maps."

15193,"This game has no polish at all and rather fixing bugs or improving the overall game they decide its better to just shove more DLC's for you to buy. The story is nonsensical and its not really fun to fallow with, too many references of other licenses and overall its mainly aiming for the gameplay. However the gameplay is also is not its core fun aspect, with a possibility of having stealth and direct approach in missions both aren't fun to deal with. With stealth revolving you playing a simple ""don't get spotted"" mechanic with not much else with it, which leaves having more players in a stealth mission more redundant. While the action aspects are really basic with gunplay not being viscerally fun or interesting to watch the weapons being used (along guns having no equilibrium, so only the best ones get the most attention), most of the enemies are braindead and spawn human wave offences to flush you out leaving you with no tactics in the game, just like going threw mud when doing objectives. Besides that they also add some bullet sponges to devalue the gunplay even more, leaving you the direct approach with no tactics and no fun actually just shooting the weapons, too. You'l always encounter bugs during the game, the gamebreaking ones a rarer but don't even try to get some atmosphere in the game, it has none or at least its weighted down with bugged out smoke grenades that last whole round or police corpses that clip threw each other and just eventually start to look like its a floor texture. This game doesn't offer anything great in the Story, Gameplay, Atmosphere categories and just feels like shovelware. You can try the base game for few euros when on discount but its stripped of its ""content"", if you call it that. You better off just buying something else with these few bucks, really."

These safe houses are usually built along the same lines. Nice big houses, grounds, 24 hour security, and most likely a panic room somewhere inside. See where your tax dollars go? The plan is simple - get in there, find our informer, and finish him. Now, I'm betting there'll be evidence against us in there too, so it'd be good to clean that up too."

15284,"Wow. At first I wasn't sure about this game, But when the sale came around I decided to buy this game a few Days ago because my friend told me so. So i bought this game to me and my friend. And oh there's so much achievements in this game, I was in shock. I did the starter heists and stuff and now i'm playing with my friend stealth heists, And I like the Shadow Raid, Because its a rob where you need to be like a ghost with strats and try to not get attention from guards and workers. Very Cool Game"

15339,who hasnt played this??????????
15340,cool
15341,YEs buy good game :))
15342,"It's payday, you and up to three other people don masks to either run and gun your way to riches, or stealthily sneak around to become the world's greatest cat burglars. Of note, the in-game HUD can be lacking, so once you're used to the game, I recommend installing a modded HUD"
15343,"Something similar to L4D but with GTAV's heist. Pick a job and run through the objectives while killing endless waves of cops and mercs. AI and revive system feels like L4D. As you progress you unlock weapons and skills. Earn money and get better gear to do harder jobs. The game runs very well, unlike GTAV players and d/c and reconnect in the middle of the job and it won't reset. I can get through alot of it solo, but for harder missions having friends really help as AI are very limited."
15344,Great Game
15345,"decent for a fiver

15360,Addictive Game
15361,"Good game as long as you don’t mind insanely stupid meta and needs/buffs listen the game it’s fun as fuck but what are the buffs and nerfs like tf.

15369,funni bank heist
15370,Awesome robbery Guide for real world :)
15371,"You wanna do some outlandish heists and feel like a juggernaut against the onslaught? Payday 2 provides that. Boost nukes from a merc company? Yeah, you do that. Steal a diamond from a museum? Ohhhh, yeah. Stick it to a cartel by not stealing, but TORCHING the cash they have in a bank? The disrespect is real, man. At a good price and tons of cheap but awesome dlc, give it a try, and see for yourself."

15461,"Addicting shooter that fills your brain with dopamine chemicals with it's amazing soundtrack and fantastic game design, just don't play the game with random people. They are actually brain dead, I once told a lobby eight times to not enter the puzzle room so I could beat it and the second the door opened they super sonic raced into the room and failed the heist that we wasted 20 minutes progressing through. For the sake of you and your loved ones, only play solo or with people you know IRL. Playing this game with randoms is more damaging to your brain than dementia."

15538,"If you ever wanted to be the Bad Guy.

If you ever wanted to mow down police officers with a minigun.

If you ever wanted to perform cracked out heists.

Then, this game is for you.

Admittedly, I'm a Johnny Come Lately to the game, but I am thoroughly a die-hard fanboy.  Learning from past mistakes, the devs have upped their game over the past 8 years-adding more guns, heists, and tweaks to the game than you can shake a stick at.  

There's always players on, so either jumping into a heist or getting players to join is not a problem.  The heists are enjoyable, some more than others (I'm looking at you, SAFE HOUSE NIGHTMARE), and the mass variety of guns and modifications for each will have you tinkering for hours.

I cannot recommend this game enough if you enjoy co-op shooters.  Get the game, heister!

the worst part is 80% of guns and missions are included with separate DLC's which means that you have to buy a lot of DLC's in steam in order to profit from all the features which makes no sense to me.

15770,"Has a ""beta"" version for testing without any limits exception being the time for which you are allowed to play the game. I have bought it and lemme tell you this thing rocks. It isnt quite expensive but its totally worth buying if you do like shooters. It has multiple ways of playing and hiests arent the only thing you do in the game, like you can cook drugs or infiltrate a facility or... yea you gots stuff to do. It is quite hard and there is alot you gotta pay for with actual cash that i dislike, especially their saints row 3 crossover where you can get a gotta say pretty hot lookin suit (black and magenta) for the small price of the entire saints row 3 game... for a cosmetic. But it is super fun especially with friends and it works flawlessly, the animations are on the spot and the game looks really nice. NOW THE MUSIC IS WHAT I AM TALKIN ABOUT, its incredible and i love it, there are fun songs and there are srsly good songs. 10/10 with a badass seal of approval.

the game is old as sin but still holds up pretty well
its a blast with friends and the varied gameplay allows players of all skill levels to find something they enjoy
the only gripe i have if you can call it that is the fact that the masks earned for beating every heist on a certain difficulty require the dlcs that arent included in the 'legacy collection' but other than that its a great game with terrible driving physics"

15782,WOW!!!!! I love this game soooo much. Almost as much as I love when Taylor Torrance from Sigma Chi sits on my face. Oh how I love it when he eats my man pussy and his scruffy neck beard itches my placenta.
15783,good game about robbing banks
15784,really good game
15785,"I got this game on the Xbox One and it is really fun. I think that it is very unique because whenever you start a heist there is a chance that there is some moron who makes the mission way harder, for example, I was doing a heist on the Brooklyn bank and at the start, this idiot drives the van into the Bank so we had to survive an assault from cops while trying to open the vault door then we had to carry HEAVY stacks of gold bars to the sewers. The game is also very good because it has a cool customization system where you can customize your masks and weapons. I also like the game because you can choose if you want to play with A.I or by yourself or online with people such as your friends. I like the graphics, for a 2013 game it has some smooth graphics, I thought it was made in 2018 because of how good the graphics were. The Money system, I think the money system is very good because of the amount of money you get a mission. It is usually around 150K if you are a starter. I have to do other things so ill just finish this off with I LOVE THIS GAME PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL IM 20"
15786,good game but stealth missions are shit

15832,mm monee :}
15833,the only game where you can rob a bank whilst wearing a Donald trump mask whilst dodging literally all bullets are being shot at you with a dj-level beat blasts in your ears and shoot the entire military with crossbows and a minigun simultaneously while your character screams about how he needs a medic bag and how he needs to fix the god damn piece of sh#t thermal drill by hitting it with a chainsaw.
15834,I just saw a spider so big i thought it was from pacific rim - Hoxton
15835,Games fun i love killing cops with a spoon
15836,very fun played over 2k hours on console and pc is better way more additions
15837,"I have bought most DLC for this game, I have access to every weapon and perk deck (excluding the H3H3 deck) and this game is amazing.

You play as a career criminal in the Payday Gang, and don a mask and rob banks. Well, that's very loose. You moreso take on all types of crime to get your quick PayDay. And yes, the funny breaking bad man is in this game.

First thing to talk about is the cops. It's common knowledge that the AI in Payday 2 isnt the smartest, but that doesnt make it less fun.
Average Police are aggressive, putting pressure on the player, it's fun and extremely erratic. Heavy Police have much more armor, encouraging headshots and to make those helmets fly.
Shields are your first big issue, and remain an issue. Anything explosive will take them down, Sniper Rifles (and some select guns, such as the Five-Seven) pierce shields and also make quick work of them. Otherwise, you're forced to move and flank them.
Tasers first appear on Hard. They do what it sounds like. They tase you, forcing you to stop in your tracks and making you erratically fire your gun. Find them and make them let you shoot them and free yourself, or face a quick down.
Bulldozers, the poster child of PayDay 2. Shoot their visor to make them vulnerable, then shoot them in the head. They do massive burst damage with their shotguns, and can control the heist if you can't take them down.
Cloakers. A PayDay players nightmare. Instant downs, flying kickflips, that damn sound. Aim for the head. I beg you.


There are many heists, all of which feel different.

Rats is a very often played heist for it's XP output. It is a 3 Day Heist, and here's an overview.

Break Bad by cooking meth, combining Muriatic Acid, Caustic Soda, and Hydrogen Chloride to make definitely meth and not at all table salt. Bain will tell you how to cook it.
Trade with the gangsters for valuable intel. After that, you can steal back your meth. Wouldn't be payday without a little bought of armed robbery, would it? 
Finally, take out the Drug Cartel the contractor wants gone, and take their money.

Rats is a good introduction to the idea PayDay isnt a Bank Heist game, it's a Crime Game. No crime too grand or too petty for the gang. Bank Heists are the draw, and the grand heists are what keep you coming back. Breaking your old friend out of jail, raiding the DEPARTMENT OF MOTHER FUCKING JUSTICE, and raiding the FUCKING WHITE HOUSE TO STEAL ANCIENT PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS TO SIT BACK OUT OF A LIFE OF CRIME MY GOD

Yeah it's great. Not even talking about literally dodging bullets left and right, the 23 round M1, a Semi-Auto RPG, and yelling so loudly at your friends they get up and stop bleeding out. Dont ever let those helmets stop flying when they start flying.

And never let yourself look normal, always look either really cool or really stupid."

15849,IMA DROP ON THESE SHITHEADS LIKE A FUCKING PIANO
15850,"wait for a sale, get it for peanuts and enjoy your new criminal life. 
I waisted multiple holidays on this game. I probably wouldn't do it again, because I've done it do much, but there's a reason why I did it -
it's a game for grinders. It motivates you really well to level up and become better at doing stealth heists.
all in all, a very cool game with iconic mechanics.
Put it on your wishlist :]"

15881,game good
15882,"Games amazing, I bought it on sale got almost every dlc and im lovin it"
15883,"good game
"
15884,"Epic game, can run decently on a potato laptop if hardware performance is an issue for you. Basically L4D2 with cops."
15885,its good
15886,The thing I love about payday 2 is you get to steal the U.S by robbing everything that's just my point of view about the game if you have other views on the game let me know.
15887,The game is good but I can't kill innocent people without a price. I want to shoot them with my grenade launcher and light them on fire and watch them scream and burn but NO I HAVE TO PAY MONEY TO KILL CIVILIANS. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRICE GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRs
15888,driving game engine
15889,"This game has aged like milk. I don't understand the popularity. It has some cheese value, sure. But:
- This game has some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. Sean Connery's awful Russian Accent puts ""Vlad"" to shame.
- The gunplay is atrocious. The hitboxes are clearly not built for gunplay and most player/npc models are more of 'polite suggestions' of where a person might be rather than an accurate representation of 'where to shoot to deal damage', direct gunplay isn't satisfying at all and the npc patrols make silenced killing equally unsatisfying. Assuming your headshot doesn't miss because of a wonky hitbox.
- The missions are neither realistic enough to be immersive, nor silly enough to be funny. Many of them are just copy pasted. The game doesn't really allow for much exploration in maps especially on higher difficulties. 
- There are entire weapon attachment categories locked behind DLC. DLC attachments are better than base, which I suppose isn't too bad for PvE.

Its 10 bucks though. Get what you pay for."
15890,yes
15891,THE THERMAL DRILL
15892,it is a game where u take drugs and get high and there is lots of porn in it
15893,it good
15894,very good i like killing hostages
15895,"Really good. It requires a lot of DLC to be GREAT, but compared to the average cost of a game this size, it's usually cheaper."
15896,"I love this game a lot, it made its way to my favorites collection in a very short period of time. I love the characters, weapons, graphics, and the aspect of the game that makes it so that it doesn't matter how many times you play a mission or however long you're playing the game for, it doesn't get boring. 5 stars."
15897,download it now
15898,"first game on steam, fuckin awesome!!!"
15899,It's Great!
15900,pretty good game
15901,Rob banks legally for once! very great

15908,everything burns everything will burn I will burn them all. . . the police the civilians my own friends. all will burn all will burn
15909,:)
15910,"This is one of the best games in my library. The action of either stealth or full guns blazing can always keep my violent side happy, whilst fulfilling the role of an arcade shooter and mayhem game. The missions can sometimes frustrate me, but most of the time it's not the games fault and rather mine, so beware of creating your issues.
The guns feel great, the characters are all unique and different, there is no shortage of masks to equip,
and every enemy feels balanced, even the cloakers. 
I reccomend this game to anyone on steam who has taste for good action or stealth, with massive outcome of millions of dollars.
Highly reccomended, best game in my library."
15911,Clowns are scary
15912,big spoon go brr
15913,Heists

> ""you said it was stealth dumbass why are you playing this mission loud you can do it on stealth""
> ""the lobby is labeled loud, lol""
> guy ragequits
10/10 would play public lobbies again"
15920,"Playing Payday 2 since its early console days, I've always had a blast on this game. Alone or with friends, heists and loadout crafting is still as fun as ever. The only negative aspect of this game is how playing alone can sometimes feel tedious or repetitive. I just recently switched over from console and instantly dove head-first into all of the expanded content I have been exposed to. Pick this game up for yourself if you want to play the best hoard-shooter of all time."
15921,Always wanted to play this game and finally got it. Its great especially with friends and everything. So many options and things to do. Even with its repetitiveness it is soooooooo muhc fun
15922,love this game always will amazing game

2 large eggs
1 large egg yolk
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
2 cups pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin (see Recipe Note) OR 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée (can also use puréed cooked butternut squash)
1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
1 homemade pie crust, chilled or frozen (see pâte brisée recipe or our no-fail flaky pie crust recipe), or 2 pre-made pie shells

Preheat the oven:
Preheat your oven to 425°F.
Make the filling:
Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, spices — cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed.
mixing pumpkin pie ingredients
pumpkin pie ingredients mixed well
adding cream to pumpkin pie puree
pumpkin pie filling ready to add to pie
Fill the pie shell and bake:
Pour the filling into an uncooked chilled or frozen pie shell. Bake at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly.
(About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.)
Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.

Cool the pie on a rack, then serve:
Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours.
Serve with whipped cream."
15939,Payday 2 is a fun game to just chill on when you are bored of games and just want to have fun you can play with 3 other people all the levels are so much fun alot has changed since 2013 when the game came out i would def get this game if you have $10 to spare!!
15940,fuvking idiot
15941,Definitely a great game! Live out your fantasies of robbing banks without any of the legal repercussions.

15955,AWESOME GAME PLAY PLSSSSSSS
15956,"   A pretty awesome FPS with a nice story to dig your teeth into, the only criticism I could possibly come up with are a handful of visual bugs and that some of the puzzles are lacking. Aside from that, a great game that becomes even greater with friends. Buy it!"
15957,"Can't wait for my life to eventually go down the drain due to this game. Oh wait, it already has. Thanks Overkill"
15958,The framework of a great game exists but in practice it just feels like a zombie rush game with the zombies in police skin. I only had fun modifying the weapons to different play styles. I don't recommend this at all unless you love zombie games.
15959,good
15960,very good

15979,"havent played it much yet, but its definetely very enjoyable. the graphics looks very frikin nice for a relatively old game and the gunplay is amazing imo. also the game is still getting updates which is a very nice touch on top of all of that."
15980,"yea
"
15981,"After seeing the overwhelmingly positive user reviews in steam I thought I made a good desicion buying the game. But after playing the game just for a couple of hours, I would say that this game is boring and repetitive. 

I played many different heists in this game but they were all just ""drill the safe, get the jewellery/money, shove the money into the van and get out"". After just a couple of hours it became very repetitive.

Another negative thing is that the game doesn't really tell you what to do and what not to do. I spent a long time just figuring out the controls and what to do during the heist. And honestly it was not a fun experience. I hope Overkill makes a better sequel if they are making a Payday 3."
15982,amazing
15983,AAAHHH! I NEED A MEDIC BAG!
15984,"The base game has too little too offer and even with DLCs, the stealth fucking sucks compared to games, where it wasn't even meant as an initial feature"

16029,"Bank be like: ""Bruh"""
16030,"Super fun game, the idea is basic, you go around robbing banks solo or with friends doing optional objectives for more money and XP to further level up your characters traits and hideout.  You can also do little special jobs which you can also earn money and XP from, different from just the traditional banks, you get a very generous picking of maps and levels with the base game and don't need to buy a ton of DLCs to have fun, I don't have many hours on it because I've been into other games recently but the hours I do have on it, I've enjoyed every bit of it. I'd recommend it, even with it being so old, still super fun in 2022.

16063,"Payday 2 is an anomaly, and I mean that in the best way possible. The development crew and community is still active since launch and is still pretty noob friendly. By buying this game (and probably a boatload of the DLC) you are entering one of the most unique communities in gaming. I'm writing this after hitting infamy 1 and I still have a ways to go before I am both satisfied with the game and as good as I can get at it. I snagged this game on sale and it is more than worth full price.

P.S. For people reading this for the decision to buy or not, here are two things that you MUST know going to checkout.

1. This game has quite a few bugs that make themselves quite noticeable as you continue playing, these don't break the game and in fact, are a major part of the experience. These bugs are the good ones, like goat simulator.

2. BUY THE LEGACY BUNDLE, this game has A TON of DLC and a lot of the content is actually locked behind these walls, wait for a sale, buy the bundle for $10, and have fun.

GAME GOOD PLAY NOW"

16095,"Game is amazing with friends, you get to par take in heists that are always fun and enjoyfull, you get to choose your choice of guns and upgrade them to suit you."
16096,"So I am 100 hours into this game and... WHOA! If you know GTA V ONLINE heists, well this game is all about that. Its just epic, 4 player coop heist action with RPG elements. What i mean by RPG elements is not that the game is open world. there are multiple missions to chose from, each of them putting you in the body of an armed robber. the game trows you in a map, where you have the choice to either use the games AWESOME stealth sistem and rob them whihout them knowing OR go in guns-blazing and face off against hordes of SWAT officers. What i mean by RPG elements is that, with a heist done, you get money and XP. With money you buy guns and attachments XP is used to level up, so you unlock new abilities in the skill tree. The graphics are not Red  Dead Redemption or Cyberpunk 2077, but they are decent, especially if you consider the age of this game. This game also has a ton of DLC content, so i recomand buying the legacy pacage, that contains ""almost"" all of them. This game is a absolute BLAST, buy at the next sale if you like FPS games!"
16097,"how to rob a jewelry store:

step 1: Sneak around to the back of the store.

step 2: Somehow get spotted by a security officer on the other side of the building.

step 3: Steal as much stuff as you can.

step 4: Massacre every police officer and swat team member in your way.

step 5: Profit.

16203,"I wish it was more like Payday: The Heist. Less corporate soulless characters and more realistic, simplistic robbing simulator. Lots of lost potential. The main reason you would play this over payday 1 is the amount of content and mods it has."
16204,"Payday 2 is a very fun experience. I would genuinely recommend this game to anyone (and I mean anyone). But four things that if you're sensitive to or not a fan of, they are: Blood, there is some blood in this game, if you're looking in the right place, but it says gore in the ratings, but there really is no major gore. Swearing, there is a lot of swearing in this game, if you don't like swearing too much, then maybe don't wear headphones. Drugs, there is a contract to steal a bag of cocaine from a club, and there is a few other contracts including taking and cooking meth like you're in Breaking Bad. If you don't like drugs, maybe don't play the meth contracts. And finally, ""Citizen POV."". If you don't like thinking of being in the situation of being in a robbery, maybe just don't play this game. Anyway, there's that. Payday 2 is a very fun game, like, really fun, except the lag that happens sometimes if you don't lower your effects quality. Despite all the negatives PD2 has, it's certainly an enjoyable game with or without online play. Hate the game or love the game, at least you can say it was a fun experience."

(all jokes aside this game is pretty great even tho the game gets too boring because of its repetitive gameplay but thats why dlc exist the game without the dlc is kinda boring so i  recommend every player to atleast buy or purchase one or two dlc 
but you must be careful when buying dlcs u need to at least read reviews so that you wont waste your money on useless dlc such as the tailor pack dlc or the weapon color pack dlc.
dlcs i recommend for new players are the wolf pack dlc and the point break dlc 
those are by far one of the best dlcs so far
hopefuly you will find this review useful)

16258,"The game definitely has a lot to entail. You may play it for the first time and not know what to do, but Overkill tries to help you with that. Which is thoughtful. There is also a lot of achievements.

There are countless different weapon customization options, and Overkill has done what they can to provide non-DLC weapons for players.

Many heists and weapon customizations, however, do require DLC to play or use. If you do not care about the game too much, I would not stress about buying the DLC, though it's become a huge help over the years for me. You can play heists locked by DLC online with other players if you do not have it.

6/10 Fun fps"
16281,good
16282,Best guns and I like to burn the officers and OBAMA
16283,"an incredibly fun game, with tonnes of replayability, and a unique learning curve. for a game that's just about robbing banks it's surprisingly deep.

Highly recommended, particularly if you have some freinds to play with, playing with a group of people you know makes the game about 40 times more fun and interesting, plus it opens up new opportunities and strategies, and of course makes it way more fun when everything goes tits up"

16330,"Only worth it on -90% sales.
Very fun, but expect that you will have to buy alot of DLCs in order to buy new weapons and weapon mods, clothing, do new heists etc.
All heists in career are accessible even without owning the DLC, but i still recommend asking for advice from other people on which DLCs are good and which are bad. There is ALOT of bad DLCs and some are overpriced."

16335,.
16336,Game is fun for a few hours and then it gets boring as fuck. Once you've gone infamous there's really nothing else to do. 0 replayability. Not even worth the .99¢ I paid for it on sale.

It might get repetitive when your gameplay is a bit off, but when ur timing and tactics are spot on and ur roling through the Heist’s it gets really rewarding, and if that’s not enough u can go for trophy’s, achievements or try to get to lv100 within a short amount of time.
I highly recommend gathering a crew or joining some Discord community where u can communicate with ur crew."

Bye, Sisters!"
16457,dose not even work anymore '-'
16458,"Payday 2 is a great game even if they lied to the comunity about no dlc it still is amazing

I Gameplay.

In payday, you can really see what great gameplay is, amazing gunplay and good stealth mechanics. 

Stealth
In payday stealth is usually the go to method for making cash and exp. Stealth has some basic mechanics: detection(what it sounds like, a big bar in the center of the screen, if it fills up, the guard saw you and will move in for arrest/shoot), the ecm (it is a must for stealth, blocking cameras and pagers for a set amount of time, they can be used to open doors with the right skill), pagers ( PAGERS SUCK but they are needed to ""balance"" stealth, you have a maximum of 4 pagers you must interact with the pager in a set amount of time or the alarm will go off, once you start the interaction you can't get off it because it will sound the alarm) and the most confusing mechanic noise ( ""noise"" gets triggered once you use the saw, drill, break galss, and shoot an unserpressed gun. The drill noise won't really afect you, glass should generally not be broken because it's shatter noise is loud and can allert nearby guards and the stock saw has a huge noise range)

LOUD
Que up razormind get your minigun and let's go. Loud is the ""fun"" version of payday2 with swarms of enemys trying to shut off your drill and kill you. Loud works like a horde shooter, with diffrent sections of the attack sgnaled by the music. Also loud has the signature payday music and you don't really need to use meta guns and perks.

II The story.

Payday 2 really took the story off the rails. If in the first game you wanted to get rich now you have way bigger plans. Now there are two endings the one you will get and the one you dream about. The cool ending can only be triggered by your team being infamy 100 (rebirth 100) and completing a complex easter egg that requires the complition of several achievements and playing the piano with a gun. 

III The comunity

Payday is just amazing and the comunity is even better, with Overkill adding a comically large spoon and the golden variant of it wich sets enemys on fire and does an insane amount of damage. Overkill proved themselves to be amazing with handeling the comunity with their twitter posting memes. The devs supported this game for good years adding a lot of content, and if you don't own a heist dlc you can still play it in the campaign mode and by finding the desired heist on crime net.

Conclusion: Payday2 offers amazing price to quality ratio and you should play it if you like to steal shit and decypher the language of gods. You should give this game a try to be honest."
16459,This game is a blast whether you're playing alone or with friends.
16460,criminal
16461,good stolen soup
16462,"Man, they best rename that sh*t to Gayday."
16463,ye
16464,good (y)
16465,Really fun and not too rage inducing.
16466,"very good game, veyy fun doesnt get boring"
16467,"The gameplay is arcardy.
The balance is wacky.
The difficulty scale is double-wacky.
The quotes and atmosphere is fantastic.
The (loose) story starts with casual (casual?) bank robbing and ,naturally, cop killing. It then does a 180° and becomes a semi-serious one with behind-the-scenes magic and alien lore. Weird.

Aside the base game, there are dlcs, and, more importantly, other players.

Some good, some silent, some bad.
From experience, the best way to get a quick (and relatively peaceful murder-hobo) lobby is to have a votekick-only-lobby. If you have a host-kick-lobby, its a dictatorship, so pray your host is cool and not evil.

Dlcs are wacky. I mean, WACKY. 
Weapons (And other equipment and perks) are generally not in line with the balance of other weapons. 
Some maps are made very well, others are absolute bonkers or under-average.
Base game provides you with a decent enough selection of all, in which 'balance' already is somewhat negligated.

Have fun in casual murder!"

16508,"Bad game, no slide cancel nor building"
16509,"It's a very fun game to play with friends (unless you're the kind of person to complain about dated graphics and games that generally use Source, that is.) The only problem is that you NEED friends to play this with. Without friends, you'll quickly discover several magnitudes of incompetence, especially when trying to make a public stealth game. Other than that, you can have tons of fun here. A lot of the content is in DLCs, but there's plenty that are cheap enough that you could play a couple of rounds and sell random drop skins to be able to afford."

16522,"Slowly approaching its 10 year anniversary, the game holds up in a way few games do. Congrats Payday. You've done what few games can manage without just being MMOs with daily/weekly updates or cycling events over and over to keep people playing because of FOMO."

16596,"I have played this on both console and pc. The game is solid. Horde shooter as you try to do different objectives, endless gun and outfit customization, builds, and stealth gameplay on different heists. However it is worth noting on console a good 1/3 of features are as of writing this still missing. If you are gonna buy this game, get in on pc."

16644,"PayDay 2 is primarily a robbery game. The game is clearly worth the money, even more. I want to note the graphics separately, everything is thought out to the smallest detail. Robbery can be carried out both covertly, and vice versa, to rob by storm. You can pump the character's abilities for the same assault or stealth. There are also a lot of weapons and modifications to it in the game. Multiplayer adds even more color to this game. I advise you!"

16652,"Payday 2 is a great crime game, no questions asked. The game is soft on progression, and is made very well. You can play very casually (every once and a while) or frequently, and the fun doesn't change. You can play solo, with friends, or with randoms; the fun doesn't stop. Although being rage-inducing (like every good game is), Payday 2 has a great story, great mechanics, and is regulated by developers frequently. The game has a ton of customise capability, and that's not including the modding of the game. In short, it's a ton of fun. Ramblers, get rambling! (Game reference.)"

But still good game recommend if you dont value social life.


edit: Ok at the time i wrote this i had 30 hours and i though i would drop the game at like infamy 2, well that did not go as planned and i now have entire map layouts multiple builds and item/loot locations rembered to the pixel, in my mind. I have pumped more than 50 bucks into dlcs, and i have forgotten the word sunlight. My own parents find me more disgusting than ever. I just cant stop, the infamy screen is a adiction, honestly its easier to stop taking drugs, than stop playing this game, so a tip is dont buy this. 7/10 its easier to stop smoking."

16714,"I received this game as a gift for 10$, and for what I [didn't] pay for it, the game is well worth 10$. Oftentimes the game is only on sale for 1$, and for that you get even better value. The game can be quite laggy at times, seemingly for no reason, but it doesn't have very many bugs, so it evens out I suppose. The graphics are good, but not amazing, especially if you have issues with performance. The game-play is phenomenal, particularly if you are playing with friends. This game can be run single-player, but I would not recommend it because the missions get quite difficult at times. Overall, this game is a worthy investment, and if you and a couple of friends have the money, I would say 'why not'?"

16742,Good
16743,"It's been so long since I remember playing Payday 2, back when Hoxton Breakout was the new update and an entire skill tree was the craziest thing when I was younger. Now, in 2022, it's still so fun and nostalgic, and the fact you can still join in on heists and play with friends brings me joy. I never got to reach the highest Infamy, but even then, there's still so much to explore in achievements, weapons and skill builds."
16744,its neat

16747,"Really Good Steam Choice Game, It Might be Slightly Old But It's Fun to Grind For Levels and Prestige and The Community is Somewhat kind I Hope This Series Continues!"
16748,"My review of Payday 2, My review of payday 2 is a massive yes I loved the missions the heists the dumb as heck story, and how much effort went in to this game, however, I did get this game for free by a friend so my review is a little bias cause I did not buy it. The only thing I do not like is that after a couple times of replaying every heist and getting infamy it feels a little repetitive unless I buy dlc but after 48 hours of game play I do support the game and give it a thumbs up."
16749,"People are jerks but, the game is good."

16886,"This game is like a drug addiction, so instead of talking about it, I'm going to give you the lyrics to Dead Wrong by Biggie starting from the good part

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act (uh huh)
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capisce-ha? (yeah) I'm out like, ""The Vapors""
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho? The head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down with the Stylistics
Make up to break up, niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clit'
Suckin' on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was ""Humpin' Around"" and ""Jump-in' Around""
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, ""B-I-G""
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (Junior MAFIA, Bad Boy)
You're dead wrong (Born Again)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin' (woo)
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (you're dead wrong)
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (This 2000, Bad Boy forever)
You're dead wrong (come on)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (who got it goin' on?)
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (ladies and gentlemen)
You're dead wrong
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin'
Horse's heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kicked the habit, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a 9 in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw (ooh)
My Uzi's heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third
Then she's dead on the fourth, I'm dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (you're dead wrong)
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (Junior MAFIA, Bad Boy)
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on? (Born Again, yeah)
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (come on)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (yo Big, you're dead wrong)

overkill to zabil s paday 2 která je prostě 20. lepší než jednička 
doporučuju pro hráče který maji rádi stealth/akci a mody
jen jeden minus a to je ten debilnej engine kterej je postavenej na arcade hry proč overkill

16916,"Played 20 minutes in 2017 and hated this game. Decided to give it another try after seeing some meme videos on youtube and i feel stupid not giving this game a chance. Absolutely love how it can be serious by carefully planing movement, using stealth and a bunch of gadgets to distract/take care of guards and civilians to be an absolute ghost or it can be super wacky and dumb such as running at cops with a giant golden spoon that sets them on fire while running at super sonic speed.

Also, obligatory ''Dead Game'' meme
"
16917,"This game is so adventurous, marvelous, and everything that is ""good""-ous that I never get frustrated. Freakingly love the design, content and the logic of this game. It would be great to experience such a game with improved graphics and gameplay."

16929,"PayDay2 or the Heisting simulator, seems to be one of the only game i don't really have a complain. The gameplay feels natural, the updates are present, patches, everything! But the DLCs. Oh no. My biggest complain, (Even dough i said I dont have any) its the fact that 60% of all the skins, can't be apllied only with a certain DLC. That is the biggest issue i can find. But should you buy this game? Sure. I whould't even think about it. I got it when it was on sale, and since then, i really enjoy it! It's a fun game!"

16940,fun game for friends
16941,stealing man ofc best thing :D
16942,"Love the game, it has two modes, one where you just walk around the bank and say hi to people, and one where you put on a mask and massacre the masses cosplaying as popular minecrafter Dream."
16943,egsfdg
16944,"Payday 2 is an exciting game with one big problem: there is nothing to do here without three friends. The point is not only the need to coordinate their actions, but also the technical implementation - the game does not have dedicated servers, the match takes place on the computer of one of the players. And if the host decides to leave the game or kick one of the other participants in the robbery, you will lose all the money and experience acquired in the current session. Is it worth explaining how critical this is for a project designed for a network game?

The ability to play alone with fellow bots does not save the situation, since computer-controlled comrades are extremely stupid and can only run and shoot. Opponents, however, are also stupid, but they crush with mass. You can’t count on a perfect robbery in solo mode: you can only go through the simplest missions alone on a normal difficulty level. More advanced tasks require clear coordination of all team members, and only with the proper level of interaction can robbers be able to give pleasure from the game."
16945,Fun but sometimes very hard to communicate with strangers and set up everything.
16946,"I honestly don't know why i kept playing this game over and over doing the same thing, i guess i just really like it"
16947,its aight
16948,"game.

16949,"I love this game , still kinda sad about how the DLCs are sold . Great game to spend time with friends but only 4 of them could join , Really should add a 10 people raid gamemode and much more enemies. Its kinda boring after you played the heists again and again. Still 8/10 for the weapon animations and such graphics."

16988,"Just had to update my old stupid review about this game.
The game is really nice game kinda addictive for me
I play it alot with friends and people on crime.net
The game is not about doing the same thing over and over. The game literally has a story and lore side and not everyone know about that.
Im currently trying to achieve the secret ending but it gonna take time for me and i might have to repeat couple heists just to get this done :p
Anyway great game and i recommend to anyone who is willing to play a heists game
BUT I highly suggest you wait for payday 3 to come out since it's coming next year (probably)
And if you really don't care then go buy the game from g2a for cheaper price and buy the legacy edition as well but as i said payday 3 will have more players than payday 2 as soon as it releases for sure
Hopefully overkill doesn't disappoint us.."
16989,"Yes, so ummm good game. Not for everyone, but i think that it deserves to be played at least once."
16990,yes
16991,I NEEEEEEEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAG
16992,"Very epic game
"
16993,"Its a wonderful day to rob a bank maybe even two. Its a wonderful day to start a gang made of me and you. When Christmas comes everybody's having fun and no ones ever expecting that a heist is being brewed. Its a wonderful day to hit a store everything's up for grabs (and i mean everything) and when you think your done well go back and get some more bags(fucking shit ton of bags). And just remember as you send your gifts away for the crew. That today its payday too.Its a wonderful day to rob a bank maybe even two or three, four, five I don't care. how else could we get the money to buy a nice big Christmas tree. So just remember as you send your gifts away for the crew. That today its payday too ( give me that guitar ya bastard. Aw yea iv'e still fucking got it.) when Christmas comes body's having fun. And no fucker is expecting that a heist is being brewed (like a nice cup of tea).So just remember as you send your gifts away for the crew that today.ITS PAYDAY TOO. YEA MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS."

17001,Lets be honest we love heists
17002,"Payday 2, a game where we rob da bank (spoiler: there's still more), fight the police, and get out with the loot. Overall, the gameplay is just as basic as I mention before, so no more explanation. There's a lot of dlc weapons ngl, but the base game weapon is enough to cover it. There's 7 difficulty in this game (cmiiw), normal, hard, very hard, overkill, mayhem, death wish, and death sentence. I'm peaked at mayhem, probably going to death wish if already on late-game. There's a skill tree, which, as you would already know, will upgrade your characters. There's 3 skill tree every category. And, it's pretty grindy, so prepare for it. The Deck perk is less grindy, but for a little. Just watch youtube about deck perk, I can't explain it. The Crime Spree mode is if not, the best thing in Payday 2. You'll do heist in a row (you can suspend it) so that your rewards will stacked. And is it just me or the rewards is much more than doing single heist? Anyways, bring friends if you have one, it would be fun (probably, I play solo or public). If you're like me, then prepare to upgrade your AI teammates. Yes, upgrading your AI teammates to ease up the gameplay. It isn't that grindy, so you're gonna be fine in here. Sitting at around 6 bucks for base game, it's pretty much enjoyable. But come on, couldn't you just spend a little bit more money to buy some dlc? it ain't that expensive. If you're lucky, you can get it for around 1 buck when it's on sale. Yes, 1 buck. not to mention some dlc get discounts too."

17030,"Payday 2 is a good game, even tho it is made in 2013 it can still be compared with games that get launched in these days, it is an unique game that feels very nice to play, the graphics are very good for its time and the soundtrack is the best one i have ever heard, i have 280 hours in this game and i am still not bored because the variety and the grinding in this game is good, i would higly suggest this game if you like left 4 dead since the loud heists are very similar in gameplay, the stealth heist are also good and feel very polished. Good job Overkill"
17031,"OMG amazing game i was to stupid to know about the 7+ years ago when it was first made and damn do i regret my life decisions ignoring this game was the biggest mistake of my life (besides losing my left nut in a bike accident) bro wait till it goes on sale and get this shit its amazing legit yall who thinkin like i was and are like ""well its a bit old"" boi do i got news for u....... ""shaders"" yep u heard me there are different filters ingame u can use as well as graphic settings ""my fav is max saturation for most color"" bro this game great if u dont get it im sorry but u will die an uncompleted life knowing that you could have got this game for 99 cents on sale but instead decided to be a loser with no knowledge of what could have been his glory days in gaming."

17045,"Very fun and almost addicting(400+ hours in a few months) good pacing in the career mode but online with friends is where its at. i've had some great memories with my squad. most of the dlc however is really game changing but its relatively well priced for what it adds to the game. all i have to say, its a real 10/good yk

Update: I am now almost 800 hours in and own all the dlc and good god has it only gotten better"
17046,I watched some people play the game and i bought it and i find it really fun to play.
17047,"yes
"
17048,I've had this game since 2013 back when it came out on the Xbox one. I've been hooked ever since. even when they screwed over the consoles... we all make mistakes. Trust me this game has years worth of DLC to keep you happy for a long while. Can't wait for Payday 3!
17049,its a really good game and i love the amount of content it has
17050,"When I first sat down to play muck I was expecting a bad free to play meme game. And what I got, was a New, Unique, and frankly Breathtaking take on the survival genre. This game is incredibly nuanced, with an extraordinarily deep, Intelligent, yet still challenging story, that will play with your emotions at every turn.

What this game feels like, is as if you gave an expert team of developers an infinite budget, and no time constraints, and told them to make what they want. Further, the graphics that this game provides are some of the best looking, realistic graphics that I've ever seen come from a video game, and it manages to keep My PC cold while doing so.

This game has one of the most intense, and rich story's out there, good enough to rival the likes of RdR2, the entire persona series, the kingdom hearts games, and much more. And with doing all of this, the game is still able to make downright genius social commentary on many real world issues. but not so much that it hampers the story in any way.

To play this game for free, truly is a blessing, Anyone who is out for money knows they could make millions off of this tremendous piece of art. and while, maybe we cant pay for this modern Picasso we can support the creator in other ways

17059,"Apart from gta5 this is in my opinion probably the best if not the definitive bank robbing experience, the robberies are challenging with a degree of variety in randomely spawning and changing elements. The dlc's are quite great and offer even more to rob and customize your weapons. There are way too much dlc's tho so wait for their 90 percent off sale to get everything for a sweet price."

17068,payday 2
17069,"Payday 2 is a great game. It got some bug but a lot of them are graphic bugs caused by the old engine soo, as you may understand, graphic isn’t a masterpiece. There are tons of achievement, challenge and jobs to do that can keep you interested in hundreds of hours if not thousands. There are more than 60 missions (big, small, indoors, outdoors, some with 2 to 3 heist) and a lot of guns, build system and in some missions you can drive some vehicles. The soundtrack is very good. In the missions you can choose preplanning which are the entrance, escape, things that may help during the heist and many more. Also there are missions for all kind of players. In most of the contracts you can choose between stealth or loud.  A lot of them are setted really good and in a lot of them there are a lot of details in and out of the map that you can see. You can play this game in solo too and I recommend you to do it at least with stealth contracts because it's hard to find people that give you an help and don't ruin all the run in stealth. The storyline is made really well for my opinion. There is a secret ending too. The community compared to other games community from my experience it's not toxic at all. It's also very easy to find friendly and funny people. Just do a random contract, talk a bit and you’ll find a lot of friends around. There are a lot of DLC but I recommend to you to buy the Legacy Collection that has a lot of good DLC. So, the game it's self cost around 0.99€ when on sale but with the legacy pack, which cost around 12€ when on sale, totally worth it. So, in other words, it’s a great game, very fun, and it’s worth it."

17090,"Personally I f*cking love Payday 2, as you can see by the time spent. There is a lot of content and things to try. Plus there is actually active comunity which is rare with this kind of game.

But the thing i f*cking hate is the dlcs, 7 euros for 1 heist. 
And if you want masks for difficulties you will have to buy all the new heists for 40+ euros, that should be taken out of the game"

17097,WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
17098,it is a very good game and mods are fun to play with
17099,"A tad too Fragmented when it comes to content, otherwise quite a fun game, it will run on lower spec hardware quite well, and heists are quite enjoyable (when they go right).
Definitely do recommend you play with friends, makes things easier, sillier, and much more fun.
The progression system is quite the grind, but is well worth it (though you can get to high levels quite fast if you do the right heists and get good teams)
Also, do the side jobs, the garand takes at 2 hours to get on a bad day and it and all weapons on the way to it are well worth the grind"
17100,best game ever
17101,amazing game people should play payday a lot
17102,If you are patient enough to retry each heist more than 20 times when playing alone and god knows how many times when playing with other players then... Welcome to Payday 2
17103,FUN
17104,"Very nice game. When you download some DLC heists, its almost endless fun"

17122,It's the second time my game gets corrupted now i'm done. don't buy this if u don't already have it unless u want to grind for hours and lose progress. i just pulled off a huge heist and it got corrupted. jesus fucking christ.
17123,"its a really fun game you can play with your friends
"
17124,"very fun but snipers, cloakers, and high level dozers will make oyu want to end it all"
17125,"jogasso, perfeito pra jogar com amigos, vale muito a pena"
17126,is good
17127,definitely more fun w/ friends
17128,"Other than the literal tonnes of DLC that the devs have made, like, wayyyy too much DLC, most of it just being new weapons and skins that you have to pay for. There are some good DLC, and this is to be commended. ALL THAT ASIDE

This game is very fun, there is a reason this game is reviewed as ""Overwhelmingly positive"". If you see the gameplay and screenshots and decide its not something for you, then theres really not a lot the reviews can do that'll change your mind. 

But if you like the idea of a game where the entire goal is to do heists and be the most overpowered robbers that ever could exist, then this is for you. Payday 1 was incredibly fun, but lacked a few things. Payday 2 improved all those things and more. If this seems slightly interesting to you, buy it and play it. It's cheap, and it's fun. There is a lot of fun to be had playing this single player style, but if you want to experience everything this game has to offer, go in with friends. This game can be challenging as hell, but there are also easy things if you don't want a challenge. Endless hours of fun to be had, you have a lot of freedom as to how you want to do heists. I won't say much about this game, you should experience it yourself. It's only 9,99, and you can more than likely get it cheaper on key sites, so there's no excuse when the overall reviews of this game is so positive, and just the sheer amount of positive reviews. You probably have already heard of this game, so if you need any confirm that this is worth your money, go watch a few youtube videos. 

Also you can play as John Wick and wack people with boxing gloves if you want to go that route."

Although steam removed over 70 hours of playtime from my profile, I would say that if you like killing and robbing people this is probably the game for you.

It runs on basically anything as long as you don't have your schools chromebook with the intel pentium lmao."

17142,"One of the best old games
I've gotten sucked into games before for days but this one I’m still not bored.Why do i like this game so much fun?Well i like this game because I’m into challenge and first person shooters.When i first heard of this game i was like i gotta get it robbing banks and shooting cloakers and dozers will be fun.Yes the game can be a little laggy at times but there’s not that much lag(At least not for me i play payday 2 on pc)Do i think you should play it?yes I recommend this game to every one into challenge and shooters.The base of this game is to rob banks,  jewellery stores and Cocaine some times. Yes this game has a bit of cursing but besides that the blood in this game isn’t that bad and isn’t realistic so anyone who is twelve or older should be able to play this game."
17143,"Actually I'm just playing this game to hunt for the achievements lol. But overall, legendary game, fun to play, but a little bit cranky shooting mechanic."

17201,"Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing

Overall Game
----------------------------------------
KnightShift is a unique blend of RPG and top-down adventure. It can be played as a strategy game, an RPG, or a hybrid mix.

Seemingly very low-budget, KS still brings an interesting, if not intricate, gameplay to the gamer. For those who can tolerate the lower-end graphics and quirkiness of the game (I find it cute how the prince takes a nap, for example, as odd as it is), KnightShift will bring a good round of exploratory gameplay in an indie package that I'd recommend for a fun few hours of Princedom.

Overall Rating: 8/10

Gameplay
----------------------------------------
Warning: There are a LOT of keys/key combinations to remember for this game.

If you're undaunted, the next hurdle to overcome is a slightly awkward mouse control that seems to be reminiscent of Windows 98 mouse acceleration insanity. Once familiarized with it, the mouse awkwardness stops detracting from the interface.

I'm not sure if there were audio cues for some things, but I learned haphazardly that the giant withcraft looking areas are healing spas. This was useful fighting my first few bears. The lesson here is just to explore the areas, as context tooltips don't really exist to assist in understanding what is around you in the game.

Although rough around the edges, the quirky gameplay and level-matched quests can catch you and lure you in for more from this game. The random encounter fights contribute a little to exp farming and provide a balanced challenge as you build up your equipment set and character.

Overall Accessibility
----------------------------------------
KnightShift has dialogue that is not subtitled, making the plot a little inconvenient to follow. I don't blame the developers, who, as a small indie group, made the game because they wanted to, and did so as best they could.

Because I was unable to properly test multiplayer, the overall rating is based on only the subtitles category.

Rating: 7/10

Subtitles/Text
----------------------------------------
KnightShift is an indie game on a unique platform. That said, it's not subtitled or captioned. Deaf/HoH players can still read the text of what was said after by hitting F2 a few times, which cycles through the 'mission log' and flavor text/mission text.

At first I found it annoying, but I find the workaround tolerable and am happy they included it.

Rating: 7/10

Chatting/Communicating
----------------------------------------
While KS has multiplayer capability, I did not test. Based on the keyboard options, I saw no key for chat.

Rating: N/A"

17346,"The game is really cool, but sadly, it's a dead game. It's hard to find people who still plays it and really does enjoy this game. Payday 2 made my childhood.

> Graphics:
-Good, they aren't the best but atleast you know what's going on. Low end PCs can play it on low graphics.

> Enjoyment:
-A lot of enjoyment. You can download some mods and play the game with friends to have even more enjoyment while playing.

> Where can you play it:
-PC, VR and controller.

> Controls:
-Kind of hard, but you can learn them in less than 2 hours.

> Story:
-It has a lot of easter eggs from the series.

> Learn how to play:
-Really hard. There's a tutorial, but it's not enough to learn.

> Difficult:
-It's a really hard game. But it all depends on your skill, mission and difficulty you are playing.

> About the price:
-I think it's too expensive, because if you want to enjoy everything in-game you have to buy some DLCs.

> Do i recommend buying it:
-Of course, but only buy it on sale."
17347,idk what to say
17348,shoot shoot bang bang i like robbing people of cocaine
17349,love this game played for hours
17350,"Payday is like a very cool drug it gives you a huge boost of adrenaline and  gives you a high feeling, when ever you complete a job it feels so good and the music is perfect for the game. Payday is fun going guns blazing and silent . when you die though just like a drug you die and get sad."
17351,"game's fun, especially with other players, difficulty jumps up quite a bit though"
17352,awesome
17353,good game
17354,"I have been playing Payday 2 since it was new, and it remains one of the games I find myself coming back to every year. Easily accessed casual mission lobbies, difficulty choices up the wazoo, gameplay that ranges from ultra fast stealth heists to hours-long siege holdouts, simple and yet satisfying strategy options... it's just good fun!
Always better with friends you know, and best using a standalone comms like discord."

17370,"Had a guy in a hawiian shirt following us around, so creepy."
17371,AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I need a medic bag!
17372,"PAYDAY 2 is a perfect example of how style can really push a game forward despite engine limitations. PAYDAY 2 is not a perfect game-- it is janky, buggy, and does not run well on certain maps and on certain computers. But it is one of the most fun games I have ever played by far, and I always find myself coming back to it for some reason or another. If you want an arcade-y addicting shooter that isn't as extreme as most others nowadays, PAYDAY 2 is perfect for you."
17373,"Somewhat hard to get into, but when you do get into it, its really fun."

17387,.
17388,"you uhhh robba da  benk 


10/10"
17389,Yes this is a game I would recommended
17390,"There are a great many things to dislike about Payday 2. The game does look dated, and it's only really made worse by some of the weird post-processing effects and grody sharpening filter. The engine is old and is particularly unsuitable as it was initially made for a racing game, despite the fact that when certain heists ask you to drive, it is horrible. Stealth is mediocre at best and infuriating at worst without mods. And although this is a co-op game, the anti-cheat implementation is laughably lackluster.

Despite all of the above, however, there are few games that bring you the joy of wading through a knee-deep sea of dead cops while you airlift gold bullion out of a bank vault you melted open with your friends."
17391,I would recommend this game to everyone :)
17392,i like crime

17550,"Amazing game! While there exists extremly many mods you can join any lobby even if they play heists you do not own and you have in the career mode the option to nearly host each heist that exist once. So you can try out each heist see which you like and then consider buying it. I would suggest you try out the base game and if you like it go for the legancy bundle with this you have a crazy amount of content and everything you need weapon and perk deck wise.

The game itself is a really fun Stealth game oder a super fun horde shooter when going loud. Both ways feel unique and require a different set of setup and playstyle.

This game is also decent to play alone. In Loud missions bots can tank a lot of dmg and in stealth missions  being alone has the benefit that less people can screw up.

Also the music in this game is amazing!"

17585,"it good to shoot, very fun"
17586,"Great game, even better with friends. Nothing really negative to say about it, overall its simply a very enjoyable horde shooter."
17587,This is a fun fast pace game that always through you in for a loop. Playing solo gives a challenge but it if really fun when you add other players. The characters add to the game by providing in game interactions .  By far the best investment I have ever made
17588,so gooooodddd cant stop playing this game

17596,"A Good Game Overall. Not For Low End Gamers, Don't Get Blindsided by Its System Requirement's. The Heists are Very Good and The Multiplayer Feature is Also Good. The Number Of Achievements are A lot in this game. I Won't Say That You will never Get Bored of this game, but I will Surely say that You will play this game for long (addictive) . Waiting For Pay Day 3 D
And If you Get This Game Under 1 USD You are lucky like me XD"
17597,"In the minefield of bad robbery games, this one comes out on top as the worst one, it's absolutely absurd that jumping cancels your sprint. This one feature of the game ruins the pacing for me. You're telling me that these robbers can take 50 million bullets to the head and shake it off, but they can't continue running after a short leap. Just 1% away from a perfect game, but you had to ruin it overkill, shame on you. :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(

Although the spoons pretty funny, and it's actually really fun, and I'm actually overreacting about a small feature as a joke, but you don't know that."
17598,"i would say only 5 hours in i felt great playing it and very good, it was amusing and im going to play sooner or later."

17624,"This game saved my life.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"

However, NEVER buy the game on console."
17682,"good game but having the worse community i ever meet so far, because this is just a PVE game but there is always, always that person that ruined the experience, they think everyone who join this game should be and must be a profesional thug or a real life terrorist to perform everything perfectly, one time i genuinely asking a question after we took all the cash into the truck ""do we need extra reward from the locker?"" and they just kick you for no reason, it doesn't even answer the question at all. the other times i got kick for using the medic bag on the ground while they doesn't even explain why, how should i know what part did i do wrong? is wrong for playing this game as a normal person without criminal record is that it? you must at least commit some genocide or warcrime in random country first before installing the game?"

When I began playing, I didn't like the game.  HOWEVER-- it was because I chose the wrong game mode!

Definitely hang in there and play ""career"" mode.  It's very very very entertaining.  You can get burned out on it, but it's a fantastic game.

Also, read about what to do in the game because it can be a bit complicated."

It's super fun, the gunplay feels pretty solid, the perks are fun to mess around with, and overall it's just a solid game. The stealth is always enjoyable when you finally pull of the heist you've been meticulously planning and attempting for hours... I will always cherish my memories of grinding Hoxton Breakout with my friends until my mom finally told me to go to bed. When the game goes on sale it's literally $1. Just buy it. You have a dollar."

we did not make much money :("

In one mission, 4 friends on co-op killed over 200 police through the mission (I killed over 350).  Part of the reason for needing to kill more police is due to the story line in game is slow and we found we were just killing while waiting to move from point to point.

17762,"Picked up this bad boy on the Steam Sale and can't put it down. Team oriented, objective based first person shooter that crushes. It was a little hard to get into but once I began to understand builds and how to use items, this game is tremendous."
17763,"⛺Graphics:
☐ Potato.
☐ Bad.
☐ Average.
☑ Good.
👉 I have 2 reasons why i put my review as ""good"", one of them is because they used an advanced and detailed weather system that took me 10h+ to recreate on ubisoft, unity and roblox studio ect. The second reason is also because this game has detailed reflection systems. Any other mod or landscape editor is not counted as this review is written based on the based game and dlcs only.
☐ Beautiful.
☐ Masterpiece.


🎮Gameplay:
☐ Terrible.
☐ Bad.
☐ Average.
☑ Good.
👉 While the animations and most aspects seem basic this game turns out to be well made to a point, and the game play is enjoyable to a level without buying dlcs. I personally don't see a bad con about the game play aspect as well you get you expect. Although if you prefer the stealth aspect more than loud than maybe this game isn't for you as these people do loud or nothing. If you wanted stealth you would have to wait 10 mins+ for a Go bank robbery.
☐ Fantastic.


💀Difficulty:
☐ Easy.
☑ Medium.
☑ Hard.
👉 At first it was kind of hard to start the game, even on medium, because a lot of information comes at once and there are many things to learn, such as what armor is better, what guns to buy, how to utilize perk decks, how the stealth system works and so on. Fortunately you can join ""Normal"" level games to provide an easy experience for any level.
Once you've learned all the basics, the game becomes much more enjoyable and increasing the difficulty shouldn't be a problem after 10-13h+.
☐ Very Hard.
☐ Death March.


⌛Game length:
👉 50h on To be considered and armature, 150h is most likely you have infamy level 2 or more and 200h+ means there's no chance you would be kicked from games.


📖Story:
☐ It Doesn't Have One.
☐ Horrible
☑ Bad
👉 Payday 2, significantly lacks story but has some lore with dallas and the other ""crew members"", other than that the only story is the backstory in character collection, and the career mode.
☐ Average.
☐ Good.
☐  Fantastic.


🎬Cinematic/Art:
☑ It Doesn't Have.
👉 Has no cut scenes except for the trailers, maybe a character pack. And the art could be considered as the quality put into the masks other than that there isn't much other than a few graffiti, ""artifacts"".
☐ Horrible.
☐ Bad.
☐ Average.
☐ Good.
☐ Like Watching A Movie.


🎵Music/Sound:
☐ Horrible.
☐ Bad.
☐ Average.
☑ Good.
👉 The soundtrack and the sound effects are both good, on a 50h game, unfortunately at 80h it does get repetitive, clearly not enough for a 250h+ game.
👉 The contractors (Bain, The Dentist ect.) most of the time have really annoying voices with an over the top static effect. Luckily there is a way around this by just simply going into settings and lowering SFX, or just muting it altogether.
☐ Amazing.


👪Player Bases:
☐ Kids.
☐ Everyone.
☑ Mature.
☑ Casual Players.
☐ Pro players.


💸Price:
☐  Full Price.
☑ Wait For Sale. 
👉 I also highly recommend getting DLC's as it adds lots of content, adds advantage in-game, this game is better bought as sale as not even one months ago it was 0.99. 
☐ Refund It If You Can.
☐ Don't Buy It.
☐ Free.


🚀Requirements:
☑ Minimum.
☑ Medium.
👉   personally I use fast, with higher end graphics cards. But although the requirements this game needs a ton of ram. So if you wanted to use fast, or medium you would need to make sure you weren't using (Wallpaper Simulator) and you would also always be using a Charger as this game also takes a lot of battery.
☑ Fast.
☐ Super Computer.


🐞Bugs:
☐ Game Itself Is One Big BUG.
☐ Game Breaking Bugs.
☐ Lots of bugs.
☑ Few Bugs.
👉 Surprisingly there aren't as many game breaking bugs as I expected. You can finish the main game/multiplayer aspect, without ever using mods.
      Only some minor cloaker/bulldozer bugs need to be fixed, and i get stuck on the wall a lot, not sure why that happens.
    
☐ Nothing.


📝Final:
☐ Terrible.
☐ Bad.
☑ Average.
☑ Good.
☐ Great.
☐ Fantastic.


🌐Others:
Multiplayer:  ☑ 
Singleplayer: ☑
👉 Single player is commonly recommended due to the toxic player base which is one of the largest cons involved in this game.

💯Final Score:
8 or 7.5/10 based on the rounding system under 5 is a non recommendation, 5 +is an recommendation ."

17779,Very enjoyable
17780,Very fun game
17781,"Nothing wrong with liking this game, but having almost $200 worth of DLC is ridiculous, plain and simple. At a certain point developers need to just let their game die and move on to the next one. Otherwise you end up with an abomination like PAYDAY 2 where you need to spend hundreds of dollars just to have access to all of the game's content."
17782,Very nice and its so fun to play with friends
17783,Game is really fun

the game itself does not stand up for todays standards"

still 10/10 great game"

17812,"really good, highly recommend 
"
17813,"Played this game on all platforms, love its mechanics and community."
17814,"Really good.
Infamy remembers me of CoD level ups, which is not a bad thing and adds even further replayability.
Stealth is amazing, and the few stealth only missions are fun both to solo as well as to try out online.
Loud is also great, with the added challenge of builds, weapon customization and perks.

Stealth and loud complement each other to make a great experience that is both replayable as well as fresh. Somehow, doing rats for the 7th time did not feel stale or boring. Good job, Starbreeze/OVERKILL"
17815,been playing on xbox for 4 years and love Payday 2
17816,i dont have 1000 hours yet so i cant say i've played only a little but its a great game tho i do need to wait around 2 - 4 hours of download time and it has 60 gb... and some-

17999,10/10 because bulldozer and cloaker
18000,they have a lot of nerve to have an 80gb game with this much paid DLC to still run 32bit
18001,I'm not usually one to play FPSs but I made an exception for Payday 2 and I'm glad I did. I love that it isn't an open world game which I find detracts from these sorts of games. There is enough variation that jobs feel fresh but not so much you feel like you are improving and can find strategies that consistently work making it super satisfying. It is also is fun to play in stealth or go loud with both sets of mechanics feeling fleshed out. Most of the missions work well as a solo player as well. My main issue is that can be so much extra content likes skins and the such that it be overwhelming and detract from the overall experience.

18008,very very very gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
18009,paymcheck 2
18010,payday 2 is the perfect bank robbing game that you'll just love. it might be an older game but it still holds up in 2022 i cant wait for payday 3 but i do wish it would come out sooner theres a couple tweaks the game needs to have with the security and how they move but other then that a 10/10 rating deffinitly love playing this with friends ps love that they added cool characters such as john wick and the biker DLC....!!!!
18011,The NPCs aren't really that great and can't really get into the game as much. If you have friends you better off than playing solo and having Ai players screw over the whole thing. Did try doing it solo with Ai players and its possible to pull it off professionally but you can only do that with friends or real players. Ai players are very sloppy.
18012,Everything in this game is awesome.
18013,Cool

18221,This is the only game in my library where I regret to have bought it. I tested to play it with friends and it was ridiculous. It was impossible to fulfill most of the missions without triggering some kind of alarm or be seen and as soon as that happens there comes a never-ending flood of FBI and police to take you down that you could keep shooting down until infinity. The game is no fun at all.

Now this review is based off my experience with the console version. The PC version is a totally different beast. And from what little I've played, it's a crime to call this a bad game."

18271,"I came to this game super late, but I haven't really felt this way about a coop shooter since l4d2. It's fun it's insane, it's diverse, it's dense. Though at it's late stages, you'd really either need guides or videos to let you know what to do, and maybe mods to turn it into a ""modern"" game. The career mod doesn't cut it"
18272,"DSOD is pain, any mission, just pain, that what makes it good."

18302,You rob a bank
18303,This game and it's six hundred quintillion dlc addons is really really really really exhausting. Like it's good. But I feel like I've ran a marathon just trying to figure out the game and it's meta. All these builds and phrases and By the time I understand any of it I haven't even figured the game out. I wish I could say it's easier if you just figure this stuff out naturally but it isn't cause you won't. Don't let that scare you though. this game is really fun if you have the patience to figure out all the tricks and traps beforehand.
18304,fun and challenging in a great sandbox!
18305,meh
18306,don't act dumb
18307,very fun to play with friends if you all have brain damage
18308,"Payday 2 is a very special game to me. i started playing it on Xbox 360 then moved on to PS4 then finally on pc. To me this game is meant to be played with friends which is what i enjoy most about it. there are many heists,weapons and masks to unlock which keeps the game fun. I plan on playing this game a lot more when my friends get a pc. I would definitely recommend this game to newcomers with or without friends it dosen't matter because this game can still enjoyable. Thank you Overkill and Starbreeze for this wonderful game and i look forward to Payday 3."

18313,it is a very fun game to play
18314,This game is very hard to understand and get into but once you do its magic. It allows for almost endless fun and endless combinations of weapons mini guns to crossbows sneaky to kill everything. You can play this game how you want but you have to get past the steep learning curve.

18331,"A fun game, more fun with friends"
18332,yes
18333,I'm still a noob at a lot of stuff and doing know the tricks and techniques but so far it's actually a great game. It's way better with friends buts it's still fun with bots and from what I've seen the community is actually really nice unlike the TF2 community. The gameplay is much better than other games I've seen but the running makes me slightly motion sick which is something I really didn't expect.
18334,really fun and challenging
18335,This game is amazing and I love how fun it is and you level up very easy 1000/10 recommend.
18336,"The mission select screen is a mess. I tried this game again recently after years, and that screen is still a mess. I just want to pick a bank level on Normal difficulty like in the trailer. Couldn't figure it out. Closest I got was playing a strange twist of a bank level on Hard where you defend a rooftop or something.

Felt like a chore to play. Too much grind."
18337,"you steal valuables, take it back to a van, and get like 2% of your total takings, leaving the rest to go into an offshore account.

18375,"One of the worst games i've ever played.

Wanted a co-op game for me and a mate. Bought it on sale for $1.50 and to my disappointment, it turns out i got exactly what i paid for. 

3 matches + a tutorial in and we both quit, unable to stomach playing another match. Matchmaking UI is terrible, sound design is awful with things constantly re-playing over the top of each other (menu music + Christmas event music + mission logs = pain. We had to mute the in-game music) and the game itself was boring as hell. Shoot waves of crappy AI, go here, hold down button, go there hold down button. On any difficulty below 3 stars, you're basically invincible.


The customisation and content side seems to be extensive, but the game (especially the non-stealth missions) is crap. One match we had a barely functioning crackhead mall Santa having hallucinations whilst we tried to get drugs off him and fought off hordes of mindless zombie-like cops. Sounds like fun? It wasn't. 


Feels like a game that you'd play in an arcade with a friend and one of those plastic coloured pistols. I can only assume the price tag and low standards are what keeps this game's reviews high, because unlike just about every game i've ever played, I didn't find any positives here. But hey, that's about what you can expect if you pay $1.50 for a game."

18520,"Great game, the first mission I completed took me and my friends hours to complete. We planned ""the optimum"" route, and we kept getting spotted and owned by the NPCs. The successful run must have taken us 30 minutes. I played it again much later solo and managed to do it without killing anyone in ~10 minutes. The game is pretty hard, but with quite a bit of thinking and careful maneuvering the missions are doable.

I'd recommend playing with one or more additional players as then you can make up for each other's failures - being spotted."

18529,fun
18530,"I have played the game for a while both on PS4 and now on my Laptop and I think i'ts time to leave a review of this masterpiece:

[b] Gameplay - [/b] As you may already know Payday 2 is a Co-op Game and it consist of (up to) 4 players playing together as heisters pulling off a big variety of diferent heists, they can do these heists either loudly (which causes the police force to storm in via assaults and forces the players to engage in combat) or quietly (which is very challenging and heavly requieres team work and organization but when pulled off successfully will give the players a boost for their next heist). When completing a heist the player will recive money which they can be used to buy new weapons, masks and moods for their weapons, and EXP to level up. Fighting agaisn't the cops can be oddly a lot of fun and complete a heist without raising the alarm can feel really sastifying.

[b] Costumization - [/b] In the inventory the player can costumize what character they'll play as and mask they'll wear (both don't affect gameplay), they can change what weapons they bring (primary and secondary fire arms, melee and throwables), they can decide either to bring armor or not, they can chose what equipment they'll bring (Medic Bags, Ammo Bags, etc...) and the last two but not least they can equip an Perk Deck which can upgrade or give the player abilities (Examples: More health, abilty to heal from picking up ammo, heal via licor, and much more!) and can upgraded via Perk Points which is given to the player as they gain EXP, and they can upgrade their Skills from 15 diferent Skill Trees with Skill Points which the player is rewarded with when leveling up. This amount of costumization and variety opens many doors for diferent play styles and is what allows every heist you do feel unique.

[b] Difficulty - [/b] The developers did an amazing job in making sure the game would never get too easy, every heist can be played in 7 diferent RIsks Levels: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish and Death Sentence. Stating the diference of each would take forever so lest just say that the higher the dificulty the more enemies there are, the more variety of enemies there is, the more damage they'll do and the bigger their accuracy. Completing an heist in higher Risk Levels is way more rewarding then lower Risk Levels, this diference of rewards and dificulty motivates players into trying out bigger Risks Levels as they get better at the game.

[b] Soundtrack - [/b] A Banger. I can't say much more, your bound to find an song that you love in this game, they all just kick in at the right time.

[b] Starting Out - [/b] The only down side I can think of is how it might be hard to understand how things work when you start out, I personaly recomend watching some videos on youtube explaining the basics (I recomend TheRussianBadger's first video on Payday 2) and do the two tutorial heists and then three or four heist offline to understand the basics, once you think you got the hang of the basics you should start playing online to learn from other players. If you have an friend that has experience on Payday 2 you probably should learn from then, if not then you can learn from random players you'll encounter while playing, you might find some that see you as an liability even though your trying your best but you can also find nicer players that are pacient to teach you how more complex stuff in the game works. Either way you'll eventualy understand how the game works and from there on out your able to enjoy the game even more.

[b] Price - [/b] I got the game while on sale but I really think the 10 bucks are worth for this game. There is a lot of payed DLCs which is necessary to unlock a bunch of weapons, masks, Perk Decks and more but even though they can be a bit expensive I think their worth it since you unlock extra content and support the developers in the process.

[b] Conclusion - [/b] Payday 2 is one of my favorite games ever and barely gets old, I think it's worth buying expecely if you enjoy Co-op games like me. Not saying I have low expectations for Payday 3 but I really wanna see Overkill Software try to surpass the game with the next instalment in the series."

18606,"PAYDAY 2. A very good game whit a unique systeam of robbing banks.

-Graphics. It isn't bad i actually like it.

-Gameplay. Very good! Love it

-Heists. Depend on how you do it           
 
            - Silent. If you manage to do it silent it's very nice and sometimes quick
                                       (you can also get some +XP for doing it silent)


             - Go in dem. Go in dem just means. put the best armor you have, take out the silencers on weapons 
                                                                       and go in dem whit all that you got.
 

 -Story. The story is very good.



                                                                  So, i am saying that 10 $ for this game is just perfect. 
                                                          if you get a discount it would be even better!
                                                   I recommend this game?

"
18642,"""Better with friends"" yeah so is getting black out drunk.  Lots of bad things are fun with friends; misery loves company.

Dumpster fire of a game engine is my main complaint, as it poisons EVERY interaction you will have.
-Awful map geometry, from inaccurate collision data to just jank map scale.
-Enemies will often teleport into existence.  Flash bangs just straight up dont have a throwing animation and will spawn on the floor.  You are getting shot at from all directions, all the time.
-Player desync, what even is this games netcode.  Kills rewinding, animations breaking, etc.
-Extra point for desyncs when players share a vehicle.  Literally seizure inducing as it updates player positions.
-""""""Stealth"""""" yeah whatever you say buddy.

Unrelated to engine:
-Are achievements and infamy the only form of progression?  This game feels so fucking pointless.
-The """"""Stealth"""""" gameplay devolves into ""restart after one mistake"", as there is no consequence for restarting and nothing to gain from going from stealth to loud.
-Friends required, you're a masochist if you enjoy the public lobbies here."

18682,Fun with friends. AI is super buggy and pointless. The enemy AI either completely misses 50 percent of the time or they all have aimbot. Friendly AI just follow you around and shoot very little at enemies. They don't deliver things to a drop point. Incredibly frustrating playing with AI. Great with friends though. 7/10

18840,"It's not every day that you could play on a shitty wifi router with your friends & still have a stable connection,

Goobisoft & Breakpoint, eat your heart out; single player & still has connection issues.

Also comically large spoon ftw"
18841,"If you like movies like Point Break and Heat, then this is the game for you! Super fun game and gets even better when you play with friends. Casing missions can be frustrating at times because it's pretty easy to get detected, but overall it's a blast."
18842,"pretty fun with friends, don't recommend public lobbies though"
18843,it does a glitch when you exit out the game it makes your whole screen tiny. Aside from that its a very good game

18848,This game has given me the sudden want for a medic bag
18849,"It’s a wonderful day to rob a bank
Maybe even two
It’s a wonderful day to start a gang
Made of me and you

When Christmas comes
Everybody’s having fun
And no one’s ever expecting
That a heist is being brewed

It’s a wonderful day to hit a store
Everything’s up for grabs
And even when you think you’re done, well,
Go back and get some more bags

And just remember
As you send your gifts away for the crew
That today is payday too!

It’s a wonderful day to rob a bank
Maybe two or three
I mean how else could we get the money
To buy a nice, big Christmas tree?

When Christmas comes
Everybody’s having fun
And no one’s ever expecting
That a heist is being brewed

So just remember
As you send your gifts away for the crew
That today is payday too!

18939,Swan song + Leech + Messiah = Unkillable Dallas
18940,"while the game is fun for the first 20 hours or so, you start to notice how much stuff is locked behind DLC. the base game is 10 dollars but to really get a full game you need to dish out 80 dollars or so on DLC. 
the gameplay also gets boring after awhile, because most of the time you're waiting for a timer to run down. weapon customization is great, but most of the modifications are behind DLC walls. at first glance, weapon variety is fantastic but when you look at the stats you notice most of the guns are near identical. 

tl;dr buy payday the heist the soundtrack is better and while there isn't as much content as payday 2 its way more replayable and challenging."

Steal nukes, grab the package of a war veteran that's wheelchair bound and kill the guy that killed Hitler in the end because he tried to kill someone you've never seen before. If your first instinct in this game is to play stealth lobbies, just remember that your brain will slowly leak out of your ears as it is replaced with nothing but bottomless rage as you'r kicked from the lobby by the host who has 40 detection and brought a saw for Ukranian Job and manages to ignore pagers. In all seriousness though, the game is good. Else I wouldn't be well on my way to 1,000 hours on it."
18948,Gud
18949,"THE DAMN DRILL BREAKS EVERY 6 SECONDS. I AM STARTING TO LOSE MY MIND. YOU HAVE TO BABYSIT IT CONSTANTLY. WHENEVER I HEAR THE SOUND OF A BROKEN DRILL I GET ANXIETY. I WANT TO CRY. I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE.

Otherwise 10/10 would recommend"
18950,you know  the game is very good the dlc are good almost every heist has 2 mods loud and stealth in my opinion stealth sucks and loud is superior

18956,A very calm and friendly game<3
18957,"A very fun game, with a lot of interesting mechanics to learn. Personally learning how to do a heist stealth is the most interesting part of this game. It has downsides too, such as having to buy every dlc to play it, but its endless fun afterwards. Not a fan of finding random people to do multiplayer with, so having people to play with greatly influences it. Really well polished difficulty system, making it a game for casual people but also for people that want a challenge."

18968,Walaupun ini game yang bisa dibilang lama karena rilisnya tahun 2013 tapi ternyata itu mengubah ekspetasi gw yang tadinya gw menyangka bakalan dead game juga ternyata payday 2 masih memberikan update besar besaran tidak seperti game lain yang bila gamenya sudah bisa dikira deadgame mereka justru malah merilis game baru yang menurut mereka akan sukses untuk kedepannya. Overall ini game bagus banget (9/10)

18975,"Arkadaşınız ve DLC'niz varsa belki dünyanın en eğlenceli oyunu olabilir. Ama bir süre sonra tekrar ediyor.
Gerçi benim gibi adrenalin boşalması yaşamak isteyenler için gürültülü görevler çok iyi ama sabahtan akşam kadar oynatmaz. Arada girmelik, bana göre güzel bir oyun.

(Güzel silahların çoğu DLC'de o nedenle ucuzluğuna kanmayın, en azından 6-7 DLC almak isteyeceksiniz)"
18976,"good game
"
18977,gud game
18978,خوبه
18979,"Straight up one of the best games ever, there's a lot of weapon variety as well as perk decks and skill trees which allow you to build anyway you want from maximizing stealth and launching security into empty rooms with a shotgun or going completely loud with heavy body armor and an LMG. Plus the difficulties that can go from casual shootouts with tons of swat and police to insanely chaotic wars with entire armies. i totally recommend this at $10 and even more so at $0.99 as well as most of the dlcs if you want more guns and missions."
18980,"-Very few stealth levels.

-AI does stupid things like walk into walls and get stuck and just stand in place because they can't remember how to walk.

-Player base is pretty toxic.

-You get punished for playing your favorite maps too often.

-In game voice actors are ungodly annoying, but some missions unless you know exactly what to do you can't finish without enabling the voices.

-Upon anyone joining your match the AI with quick hands(or w/e it's called speeds up interactions) is ALWAYS taken out first.

Just not as fun as I remember played a lot recently the main tactic is kill em all... I guess if that is what you enjoy...

Anywho, im a bit late for this review since its been about 6 years since ive seriously played, but redownloaded a couple months back and had almost as much fun as i had back in the day. Great game, still holds up. the only thing is that without buying dlc the game is significantly harder.

All of us are hyped for Payday 3 when it comes out, but until then, Mask Up Heisters because we got Banks to Rob.

I recommend playing the offline tutorial, and taking the start slow. You can start getting cocky after your second Infamy (Prestige) look up guides if you want to be great, but remember you still need to hit the enemies to kill them!"

19154,It's a very good game.  But its also hard to play over and over again and have fun
19155,pretty wide selection of places to rob here
19156,Payday time baby
19157,Every time I think I'm out I keep getting dragged back in
19158,fire game
19159,"funny gun go brrrrrr
"
19160,let get them hell boys
19161,All I have to say: Payday VR is amazing and if you are capable of PCVR then get this game.
19162,"a perfect game i played 6.8 in my first day play
they also have movie"
19163,fun
19164,amazing
19165,g
19166,the game is pretty fun but I have no idea how to stealth heists.
19167,fun
19168,💰💰💰💰💰
19169,"Not bad, game play are interesting. Weapons, character, bots. mods, skill and a lot of game mechanism are customizable. There is also tons of mods that enhance the general gaming experience throughout the game. Recommended!"
19170,"solid game would recommend
"
19171,You truly feel like a gangster robber.
19172," OH SHIT, BULLDOZER!!!!!!!!"
19173,boring af
19174,Nice
19175,You do get paid

19180,goood
19181,"absolutely horrible, atrocious, disgusting experience built on a racing game's engine that will anger you at any opportunity, of which it gets many.

19184,"sure
"
19185,"its mid 
"
19186,"Fun game but had a game breaking glitch or bug or something.

Recently, a new update had come out and of course, I wanted to play. I opened payday2 but it crashed after the intro screens. I looked into it and I have no mods, no conflicting software, and I've even tried uninstalling and re installing but nothing has worked."
19187,very epic game teachs me how to rob very helpful
19188,It's quite good for people just wanting to pop some heads with guns.
19189,is good
19190,"If you have friends, this is a great game to play with them.
If you don't have any friends, this is a great game to play alone.
If you don't have the game to play, get the money for it.
If you don't have the money for it, get a job.
If you don't have a job, rob the bank.
If you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried."
19191,Got to save the city from goats for a crazy Ukrainian while using a golden spoon that sets people on fire while some boomers ate pizza rolls in his moms basement telling us what to do. Pretty neat.
19192,Chains is in a pickle!
19193,picked it up for a dollar not expecting much. wow was i wrong. very very wrong
19194,all around fun with friends
19195,Totally a banger. This game really is great and you do get the feel of doing a real heist. This is just the game you want to play with friends like Left 4 Dead 2. Price is great I got it from a sale so was cheaper but gameplay-wise it's good. Mechanics also great and AIs I think are srt of realistic. They do take cover behind a pillar and then shoot to take cover and to hand the bags well you need to throw it at them so they carry it otherwise they don't bother in any way. Great game 10/10 and I soon hope PAYDAY 3 comes and this game is no more milked like Grand Theft Auto V.
19196,"Very fun, very silly, many guns, lots of strategy.

10/10 would (and will) play again"
19197,You cook meth under a police assault defending yourself with a thick luger. also its really cheap

19215,"bruh this is gaming
"
19216,help
19217,"One of the best games of all time! Payday2 is an absolute steam classic. Solo or co-op this game is amazing, perfect for scratching that heist itch. There are class builds and several options for customization."
19218,"Today on x factor ill be performing--  Today is  payday Too (Xmas song 2021)


it’s a wonderful day to rob a bank
Maybe even two
It’s a wonderful day to start a gang
Made of me and you

When Christmas comes
Everybody’s having fun
And no one’s ever expecting
That a heist is being brewed

It’s a wonderful day to hit a store
Everything’s up for grabs
And even when you think you’re done, well,
Go back and get some more bags

And just remember
As you send your gifts away for the crew
That today is payday too!

It’s a wonderful day to rob a bank
Maybe two or three
I mean how else could we get the money
To buy a nice, big Christmas tree?

When Christmas comes
Everybody’s having fun
And no one’s ever expecting
That a heist is being brewed

So just remember
As you send your gifts away for the crew
That today is payday too!




I hope you enjoyed that because i sure did      


(pls send gifts i need for family :)   )"

19223,very easy to level up
19224,LMG = openis
19225,"Payday 2 succeeds in what a lot of games these days, even major titles, do not - being a fun, casual game to play after a long day of work and just cool off a bit. The majority of games these days stress you out more than cool you off, and this was never intention.

19379,"it's awesome, especially with friends. buy it."
19380,"Mixed review, i got nothing to the game itself because its decent. The only problem i have rn with it is the people playing it. People kick you out just because they want to play with their friends, so here's a guide for you FRIENDS ONLY LOBBY. Number two is new players being toxic over nothing or just troll. I had a few situations where they join a stealth lobby with a rocket launcher and just down you with it alerting everyone in the process and then leave.So you might just say ""ohh quit crying about it and just put ur game private"", no i won't because i want help some people out to let them in after im done with the hard part of the heist, i just cant help it. So i cant really give a bad review because game itself is fine, just community is mixed"

19416,One of the best games i ever played
19417, murdering murdering murdering fun
19418,gud gam
19419,it is ok
19420,"I bought this game as a spur of the moment purchase just because I knew Jacket was in the game, and I was coming off of a Hotline Miami hyperfixation, but after playing it a bunch with my friends, I've found this game is really cool, and wish I had picked it up way earlier. There's an unfathomable amount of variety in missions and strategies, and the game gives you a ton of flexibility in ways you can approach anything. Theres a massice amount of customisation options, and completing anything feels really satisfying, rewarding you with a ton of weapons and gear, new cosmetics, and a ton of achievements to visualise the progress you're making as you chip away at what the game has to offer.  Even alone, I think theres plenty of fun to be had, but to get the most out of this game you absolutely have to play it with a group of friends. Overall, everything this game has to offer rocks, with the exception of the driving. Cars suck really bad lol. 8/10"
19421,I have had this game for ages it's a old game now but i still play it the xbox version is out of date and doesn't have half the stuff the pc one has. I got back into it awhile ago and found out you can have a almost limitless amount of bodies or maybe even limitless? i am not sure anyways despite the game being old i haven't really seen any issues with it the graphics aren't the best but they are still good especially so when accounting for how old it is. It get alot of updates too some that add heist mostly ones that are bug fixes and such. It works perfectly with a gamepad or keyboard and mouse. if you like shooters i would recommend shooter must have.

19439,"i like gaem it fun
"
19440,had the game since 2015 with over 500 hours into it this game is absolutely worth it and for only 99 cents it would be crazy not to get it
19441,PAYDAY 2 is an amazing game especially the sheer amount of fun you can have alone or online and in my opinion it is a 11/10 game also it has probably the best soundtrack
19442,BIg gun go boom!! very fun

19449,AAAHHH I NEED A MEDIC BAG
19450,Played this a ton on Xbox before buying it on Steam. It's a great game and plays well! I'd recommend this to just about anyone.
19451,Consume Payday Content
19452,i can vent in this game
19453,Great game came from console to pc there's definitely a lot more players on pc as well as its a lot more enjoyable. Always enjoyed the games hope to see another one in the future but for now I am just happy overkill still supports this game.
19454,The one about the goats is funny

19462,"Really Nice Game i enjoyed it but if u want to get better and 1 shot enemies....
u need a nice shotgun with a suppressor attached to it so u can 1 shot ur enemies in mid range andddd close range as well.
if u r new to this game like me, its better to watch sum stealth gameplay and see how other people play stealth like @#!$
and it totally worth it cuz its winter sale and its only 0.99$!
so catch it rn :)"
19463,"
Fun
"
19464,"Overkill should be proud one of the greatest games ever but they should give stealth mode more love next game because stealth mode in payday 2 is almost none existence why should there even be a pager limit doesn't make sense and hope they fix how the guards can see you and add different ways to interact with you
make the stealth mode more like stealth make it more realistic is what i'm trying to say and loud is great too in general it's a 8/10 for me if they fix stealth in payday 3 i would give this game a 10 also another take that i want to give is most people play this game for the stealth mode it's more challenging and rewarding not everyone want's to go guns blazing because that's what most people think when they see the word heist it's why i'm playing payday 2 but it needs a lot of changes and new futures better mechanics better AI to make it great in payday 3 if this is not done it would be another payday 2 with new missions. like look at watch dogs games and other stealth games Overkill can definitely make a better stealth mode in this game or their new game i'm looking forward to what they will bring for us in payday 3."

19478,gun go pew pew
19479,So ya shoot cop get monee
19480,"I know I'm late to this particular party, but what happened here? The game seems to suffer from extremely poor balancing; at least in the career mode the first ten missions or so are just you standing around for five to ten minutes while an automatic drill opens a safe, all the while hundreds of policemen will throw themselves at you only to be mowed down while unable to deal damage to you.

Maybe this changes in later missions or different game modes, but so far I'm wondering about what the hell this is supposed to be. Cops-commit-suicide-by-gangster simulator?

There's also no real tutorialization for many things, but that wouldn't fix the strange gameplay unless it would tell me how to get to the parts where the game is remotely balanced.

The gun customization is top notch however."
19481,NICE
19482,"just a game about some clowns trying to make a functional drill.

19511,I can now run this game but I can still kill the frame rate with a dual weld full auto shotgun and a spoon. 10/10 must play but at some point I wish the console Payday 2 could be at the same update as the pc.

19671,it good
19672,good
19673,"I have recently tried to play this game many years after. Situation is even worse than before.
It is still absolutely childish gameplay. It is still totally screwed up stealth gameplay. Cops count during the assault has even increased since before. Now it looks like a bloody massacre during the ""mission"", especially if corpses count is maximized in options.
Game wants to look like a high-end stategically planned S.W.A.T. operations antipod, but this is only a comic parody. Absolutely unserious.
The last nail to the coffin is the DLC count. DLC's are everywhere.
Sorry, but not, could not call this ""the classics"". Even with the advetersiment support of the famous movie series. Might be interesting for children, maybe, whom ""criminal dream"" is to rob a bank."

19684,its worth the money
19685,"I did not recommend the first Payday due to the small number of single tasks and dead online.
The second Payday lives and smells, online is full of players and finding a lobby is not a problem at all.
For the single player campaign, more tasks have been prepared here, plus no one has canceled the training missions.
Surprisingly, unlike the same Insurgensi, Payday is easy to play and understand all at once. Even for those who do not really understand, mission markers are made here. The tasks here are not boring and interesting, sometimes you even need to break your head (as is the case with the prisoner's cell number).
In general, I recommend this part. It's almost perfect for cooperative playthroughs or playing with friends.
(Moreover, I got it for free).

Supplement to the review. I would like to slap a minus for the fact that fucking Jewish developers, who are very fond of DLS, make you buy an add-on if you want to go through the PLOT. It's just beyond evil, of course.
Neutral score is what this game is all about. But it is not there and I will leave a plus sign only because even in the standard version, without dls, the game can entertain you for 7-10 hours."

19708,"played almost 10 hours in today, I feel kinda bad about that but it was worth it. Lvl 56 and I already have the max gun. It is really fun since there are so many unique missions and goals. To get attachments for weapons you have to draw a chance card after every successful heist you do. But the suppressor is just there for stealth options. You can go in quite or loud, many options. Then if you think this is fun wait until 2023 when payday 3 releases.

Only downside, more than 70% or so of the guns take DLC packs. They aren't necessarily better, but it gives you a hole lot more options to choose from. Then how if the host of the party leaves, the match gets cancelled. Only downsides are those 2"
19709,"literally doing 4 skulls in sneak mode, literally cant do it, 7 hours later on the same mission i gave in. im hurt, but i must try again!"
19710,Very good especially with VR. It’s really smooth and responsive overall an amazing game.
19711,it is definitely one of the most games I have ever played
19712,"Game is either great or shit. Sometimes, you can actually be a cool bank robber, making millions, other times, you spend an hour praying the servers dont crash. My god Overkill, the amount of times i wait for someone hosting a rare heist to pop up and then it crashes 5 seconds before completion! And the expensive dlc thats terrible! Fix the crashes and this game would be much better again."
19713,yeah it's pretty sweet

19742,Very fun game.
19743,this game is like really good to play with friends by your self  the story is all over the place for me but im still getting use to it there is only one thing i don't like is that you have to buy most of the dlc to have like good weapons cool masks and skins for your guns not only that most of the missions are dlc  and then theres the characters you play. they don't have any effect in game play over all i really love this game very much.
19744,fun co-op game with buds.

19771,fhdfhgd
19772,yes
19773,"So, the game wants me to believe, that the police strategy in a hostage situation is swarm the god damn building with at least 10 SWAT teams, let the hostages die, and in the meantime let hundreds of police officers die, cause why tf not.

2 guys vs 100 police officers. Who would win?

Other than that:
* Hostages clipping through the ceiling (one hostage was literally flying up and down through the ceiling in my first ever attempt in the game)
* Police dropping down on the rope through the damn ceiling
* Police spawning behind your back or even literally inside of you
* How in the world can the police mobilize tens of officers within 5 MINUTES?! Tell me where I can find police like that PLEASE. Where I live, pizza is delivered faster than the police arrives - and we're talking 2 officers at most.
* And in all of that me just standing in the middle of a crossfire, staying alive."

19846,Def a fun game that's basically Left-4-Dead 2 but with cops instead. With over 100+ weapons you can essentially blow enemies away in any fashion you choose (yes even with a comically large spoon made with literal gold that's so hot it burns them!) but don't worry if you don't own the DLC heists as you can connect to someone who has it. However to use DLC weapons and attachments you have to own said DLCs but the vanilla weapons are as strong as their DLC counterparts. If you like banger soundtracks this game has plenty so overall i'd rate it 9/10 and would def download it period.

19870,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed and four player game. It is a co-op shooter where the players put on their masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains as they descend on Washington DC for epic crime sprees. 

The game consists of a variety of ""robberies"" that a player can choose to carry out either alone, with AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are robberies such as bank robberies, drug trafficking, election fraud or theft of secret nuclear warheads. Some of the robberies place a lot of emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and cash upon completion, and some robberies can only be done in secret. Shipments appear periodically as contracts on a map of Washington, DC The player can get an open contract, participate in a contract that has another player start or buy an in-game cash contract in an offshore bank account. There are seven levels of difficulty: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish and Death Sentence (formerly One Down), with increased money and experience paying for higher levels of difficulty. Currently, there is an option to activate the ""One Down"" function in any difficulty, which means that players can only go down once before being detained (goes up to two downs with the ""Nine Lives"" ability aced)Some Payday 2 contracts take place over several days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives. After a few days of robbery, do not kill more than four pager guards (the number of paratroopers can be reduced through modifications to the ""crime spree"" game mode). SWAT and by private security contractors GenSec.

Payday 2 is a collaborative first-person shooter video game developed by Overkill Software and released by 505 Games. The game is the sequel to Payday 2011: The Heist. Released in August 2013 for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. An improved version of the game, subtitled Crimewave Edition, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015. A release for the Nintendo Switch was released in February 2018.Two years after the events of the previous game, the Payday gang comes to the metropolitan area of ​​Washington to carry out another robbery spree. The player takes control of one of the twenty-two gang members and can commit robberies alone or with up to three teammates. The player can take part in various robberies, including, for example, bank robberies, shops and armored cars, as well as drug production and distribution. The game differs from the previous one by allowing much greater customization of the player (aesthetics and gameplay), somewhat improved graphical interface and experience, greater variety and reproducibility at the levels and has redesigned stealth mechanics.An accompanying online series has been created to promote the game. The game was profitable only from pre-orders and received positive reviews. Payday 2: Crimewave Edition, which offers improved graphics, new content and some DLC, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015.A sequel, entitled Payday 3, is currently in progress and is scheduled for release in 2023 and will be published by Koch Media. It was also announced that Payday 3 will be made on Unreal Engine.

19895,The difficulty curve makes this game challenging all the time and while the heists could be in danger of feeling same-y after a while the seemingly random variations keep things interesting so you are never fully on auto-pilot. You still have to think your way through a lot of problems and even seasoned veterans can choose wrong forcing them to adapt or die.  I would say the skill tree for being sneaky is way too short. You run out of good ways to upgrade stealthy methods without getting particularly good but you can improve your loud profiles into juggernauts that still lack balance because you've run out of skill points. Which is too bad because loud combat-driven methods are usually the least interesting in this game.

Parts of its presentation are lacking, and the state of its single-player is criminal, but overall, it's a deep, addictive co-op shooter that tickled my inner burglar.I hope you found this review helpful!                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
Please leave me a rating, and give me your thoughts in the comments, as I would love to hear feedback, ideas, and what personal experiences you've had with this title."

19979,Don't fuck with us Payday fans. We hate Payday 2.
19980,"The best heist game I've every played. There is a ton of heists to choose from with multiple difficulties and approaches for each of them. If you get bored of the heists included in the game you can always buy more DLC ones for very cheap or download community created ones off of https://modworkshop.net/game/payday-2. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes an arcade shooter and heist games, I have been playing this game for 152 hours at the time of review not counting the weeks of playtime I had on console. My only complaint is that the game isn't the most friendly to beginners and could seem complicated or cheesy and scare them off."
19981,Better than roblox payday
19982,"funny clowns with comically large spoons beating cops, what else could i ask for"
19983,it good
19984,"-Very few stealth levels.  

-AI does stupid things like walk into walls and get stuck and just stand in place because they can't remember how to walk.

-Player base is pretty toxic.

-You get punished for playing your favorite maps too often.

-In game voice actors are ungodly annoying, but some missions unless you know exactly what to do you can't finish without enabling the voices.

-Upon anyone joining your match the AI with quick hands(or w/e it's called speeds up interactions) is ALWAYS taken out first. 

Just not as fun as I remember played a lot recently the main tactic is kill em all... I guess if that is what you enjoy..."
19985,very good
19986,Wholesome family entertainment
19987,"Grap a gun, a mask and enjoy this masterpiece. There is fun all around and some of the best music to ever be made for a game."
19988,Addicting once you get into it. Payday 3 better be good.
19989,It was good at its time (Xbox 360 - PS4) but when it came to PC it was a shitshow because people are cheating with Pirate Perfection but without it it is a AMAZING GAME

19999,"Cool robbery simulator, only downside is with each 90mb update is 30gb of verifying files."
20000,It gets repetitive after a while I guess...
20001,"It is a good game in its own style and I give it a score of 8 out of 10 because of the variety of weapons that come in different shapes and because of all the features of the game, most of which are not very important except for cameras and other weapons, but in The whole is fun and suggested .It can and has a small price"

The jester and the king is one and the same
The question of who really runs this freakshow
Will have you rattle your brain
The sharpest elbows, the sharpest of minds
No compensation for the honest and kind
I'm digging deep to find the flaws within me
Before I'm falling behind
You can't control me
I can't even control myself
You can't control me
I can't even control myself
Steal from the rich, give to myself
Steal from the rich, give to myself
I stack the decks and I'm rigging the race
I take a shortcut to the end of the maze
And all the while I got this faint suspicion
That I have fallen from grace
I make belive that I'm dining with kings
I'm justifying reprehensible things
The wind is rising underneath my feathers
The sun is hot on my wings
You can't control me
I can't even control myself
You can't control me

Also you can also buy most of the DLC is a reasonably priced pack and the base game for pennies. Unlike Left For Dead there is progression and choice.

Here's my honest opinion:
It's a shame seeing this game fall from grace of one of the best bank robbing games. If i would've reviewed this game some years back i'd  definitely recomand it, but at this point it's just a sad game from what it once was. You can still have fun in it, but with all the DLC's and the how much they cost and it's locked behind.

20118," Now that I have a VR headset, I figured now was a good time to review the game so my beautiful 666 hours would be forever immortalized. Honestly, I love this game but it is so hard to recommend. If you love repetitive games, then you would probably like PAYDAY 2. I play in month long spurts, where it is essentially the only game I play, then I don't touch it for a while because I don't want to do the same thing over and over again. STARBREEZE and OVERKILL used to really care about this game, but once the company went under and we all bid PAYDAY 3 to its early grave, they came back with all the cash grabs they could for PAYDAY 2. Honestly, this game had always been a DLC cashgrabbing hell hole, but I own it all. I just don't feel like I get enough in the new packs to want to buy it though y'know? Its an old game and you know what you're getting into if you buy it so honestly I don't even know why you are reading this. I recommend a metric ton of mods though."

20163,Very fun game with a unique concept
20164,this is one of my favourite games the gun play is fun there is plenty of content personally I love the stealth missions and running a dodge build with the akimbo strikers is super fun the game play can range from way to easy to extremely hard with the variety of difficulty settings I would 100% recommend this game to just about anyone
20165,"BANE! BANE, I NEED A MEDIC BAG!"

"
20175,"I NEEEED A MEDIC BAG

Cloaker/10"
20176,"4/10 
bought this game for 2 dollars and i still want my money back

Pros:
Many different missions, and different difficulty levels for refreshing choice
Many different guns and melee weapons,
Has a skill tree

Cons:
Many different dlcs for the most basic of things.
Outdated Graphics and no new game in the franchise
Feels like the developers are milking this game for money, 
Weapons skins cost real life money
Upgrading weapons is too complicated and requires tokens for upgrades
to get the tokens you need to grind for hours
The VR mode is timely to set up, and the controls are weird, there is no tutorial for the VR. and it has a completely different reloading system than all the other games. Even Arizona Sunshine had a better reloading system than this"
20177,"Incredible bank heist simulator. I've personally solo'ed every silent heist in the hardest difficulty and loved every single minute. I personally think it's a shame there isn't more expansive heists added but it makes me even more eager for a Payday 3. There really isn't another game like this, definitely worth a purchase."
20178,"I fucking hate Shields

20179,I like the teamwork u need in order to complete a hard lvl

20187,yes
20188,if u like robbing sheit get dis game
20189,"Help, I am extremely addicted to this game and I require a medic bag."
20190,"this is a great game specifically if you have a group of 4 players to run with. That way you can all specialize in a different ability and work as a team. with less players it can fall short, but you will still have a fun time"
20191,THIS GAME WAS SOOO FREE SO EASY I LIKE BOXED IN A LIKE FISH  fortjnite i like faze jev and banks and my favorite youtubesrs tfue and ninja (tfue would win)  thank you bethesda and my mom for buying to for me
20192,"This is a really great game! It is worth its price and is suitable for many different types of players. It allows for sneaky peaky on-the-spot improvisation to get past guards and cameras or mowing down hordes of enemies with you newly bought machine guns. I also love the gun and character customisation, there is a great amount of unlockable perks for you character to enable a large variety of different playstyles and many attachments for your guns to fulfill all of your needs.

The DLC's and add-ons are also great if you feel that you want more from the game, I myself most enjoy the weapon DLC's."
20193,"I am just starting out, but I can say that it is a pretty good game. Very much fun with friends and there is plenty to do. 
One thing that I have found out i dont like is that there is wayy too many dlcs. It isnt that expensive at the end of the day, when they are on sale, but i think they shouldve just not make that many of them lol. 
Solid game"
20194,good game

20204,"Nice game, rob bank"
20205,this game is amazing.if you like robbing places then this is the game for you.i could not recommend this enough because i have played this so much and its never once gotten tedious for me.this is one of the best games i have ever played.The one thing i would change is that there is a breaking bad dlc but other that its a great game
20206,Look i didn't bring a mini-gun and play razormind to raid the department of justise peacufuly
20207,best heist game out there
20208,vwry good coop and team work game i recommend it
20209,"i luv it
"
20210,8 years later! Love the game but damn it was time for payday 3 years ago
20211,"Very good game, but for quite a while it's optimalisation isn't the greatest"
20212,"Robbed a bank as a chickenman and beat SWAT agents to death with a giant spoon, 10/10 would heist again"
20213,"great game, like replaying Ukranian Job 4 EZ $$"
20214,good stuff
20215,gg
20216,Honestly just enjoy the game for what it is if you are looking for a unique heist experience this is the game to go for. Even tho it has its problems theres a reason why people come back to this game years after. In any case hf heisting and keep those helmets flying!
20217,jobama :)
20218,this games lit
20219,bruh
20220,"Taking into consideration this was designed on the diesel engine (used for a 2001 racing game) and it was created in 2013, I would say it has been one of the best games I have ever played. Of course due to the diesel engine capabilities, there are plenty of glitches in the game's software. Sometimes the game even crashes throughout a heist for no reason. And don't even try getting anywhere near 30 frames unless you have a dedicated gaming PC, designed to handle COD at a high framerate. But even though I only have 282 hours on the steam version, I've played for much longer on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One S/X versions, and love to see new content is frequently coming out. The only other problem I have with the game is the large amount of packs for the game. At least 1/8 of the heists need to be bought, and some of the best weapons need to be bought through another pack. However, these are all reasonably priced and aren't required to complete the entire storyline so you don't even need them anyway. Overall, great game, and I definitely recommend you buy it, unless your PC is a literal potato"
20221,yes
20222,"Payday 2 is an outstanding Co-Op game with an UNREASONABLE amount of customization, and every bit of it is absolutely perfect for your merry band of idiots that have nothing better to do than bully each other for being anything less than an absolute god at gaming. You can get spinkicked in the jaw to make money, and you can bludgeon everything in sight with a Comically Large Spoon to inflict maximum hilarity on everyone in your crew. If you have ten buck to spend and nothing to spend it on, that last condition better exist solely because you don't already own Payday 2. because anyone who enjoys fun even a tenth of the amount that they enjoy breathing should absolutely put this gem into their regular rotation of Co-Op games.

My only complaint is that I can't bully an even higher amount of my friends at the same time, let me play with up to seven friends simultaneously you cowards."
20223,"fun
"
20224,its payday cmon man
20225,"Payday 2 is a Co Op game. While it might have benefitted with a cool story arc for a single player mode the game offers a great outing with 3 other friends for an experience that will keep having you come back for more. Payday is simply put the improved, polished and closest experience you’ll find to robbing an actual bank. It’s just legal."
20226,"I'll Try Not To Lean into this game to hard

20274,bank
20275,"this game fucking sucks but it's kinda fun, they never properly explain infamy to you so I just spent all of my time not infamy'd until today since I didn't realize you get extra skill points. I'm not recommending it because the new one releases eventually and this game runs like shit, but I got it for free and I think it's kinda sorta maybe a lil enjoyable. if you play death sentence you are dumb
I will give overkill one thing though, I'm glad they reworked infamy to give you all skill point bonus' from infamy 1. it's now more cosmetic than anything, and I'm glad about that because the old infamy system blew my dick, balls, nuts, and cock"
20276,"Payday 2, the sequel to the critically acclaimed game Payday: The Heist, is one of the most fun times with friends I've had in a 4 player setting. This game honestly rivals L4D2 in terms of sheer fun to have, however, Payday 2's community is alive and well, with its parent company having a 3rd game in the works. The game has community events and maps, not to mention new skins being released on steam. 8/10, wish I had a better computer to run it on."

20299,"Imagine Grand Theft Auto V, except it's only the most fun parts - the heists. There's no filler fetch quests or lengthy setups, just heists where you make decisions on the spot. That's what PayDay 2 and what it excels it.

Graphics:
It's definitely not dated, but it won't blow you away. Basically on par in most scenarios with GTA V

Storyline:
I'm actually not aware if there was a storyline. Either way, a concise story is not the focus of this game.

Price:
At full price ($10) this game is a steal. I got around 3 hours of gameplay per dollar spent out of this game, which is quite good!

Difficulty:
Depending on the difficulty you choose (and which map) it'll either be a cakewalk or a day in hell.  Perfectly accomodates for casual players and tryhards.

AI:
They're not stupid, but not the best I've seen. Definitely put up a good challenge though, they know how to group up and attack from all sides.

Cutscenes:
Relatively simple cutscenes, but I'd say that's fitting. The game doesn't try to overwhelm you with them, rather wow'ing you with the actual game.

Fun:
I had a blast in this game... but that's because of two reasons. Firstly, I played with friends. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but it's miserable if you don't have at least 1 other person to play with (I'd suggest in call). It just gets lonely and infuriating. Secondly, I cheated. This game is truly meant for players willing to put in hundreds of hours to unlock new weapons... and that's just not me. Luckily, the devs understand this and have no cheat prevention (even having a toggle in the pre-heist screen allowing players with cheats to join!). I ended up using WeMod for unlimited cash and the occasional unlimited health/ammo.  

Sounds/Music:
I'd say they're perfect. It's obviously lots of shooting, but the game has some great hype music and general noises too.

Replayability:
As stated previously, this game thrives when played with friends. If you have people who are willing to play - you can play it over and over again. Once they inevitably quit, though, it just loses its replayability. I would love to pick up this game and grind out some matches again, but all of my friends have abandoned it so I am now too.

Controls:
Amazing gun mechanics (especially for a game this old!). It really shows the love and care the devs put in. 

Performance:
Runs on absolutely anything.

Modding:
There's no content mods that I'm aware of, but there are plenty of cheats.

Selling Out:
Overkill Games has sadly gone the route of selling out. There is currently 72 DLC for the game (as of writing this) that would cost $173 to buy all. That's over 17 times the price of the base game! It's sad to see, but the one benefit is that if one player owns the DLC then everyone they invite can play it too.

Similar Games:
The heists in the GTA series of games.

Bugs:
The only bug I experienced was falling out of bounds a few times. Nothing major as you're immediately teleported back into the playable area.
"
20300,yes. very good.
20301,"A very fun horde shooter with tons of support from the community and the devs. The amount of DLC this game has is staggering, but you can tell just how much the devs care about their game and players. Like any co op shooter, it's a whole lot more fun with friends, but the AI is competent to keep a fun experience if you can't find a match."
20302,Fun game

20307,good game and very enjoyable. can be little touchy sometimes when you wanna go fast and release the buttons too soon but other than i enjoy it very much. appeals to several different types of game play styles. stealth and loud or in-between.

20314,hi brandon hop on payday 2
20315,Its impossible for you not to get addicted to this game and if you were burnt out from this game. play it once and now your addicted for a year or 2 and also they do dlc's right for example payday 2 vr its free unlike other game companies *cough* *cough* *Bethesda* *cough*. The soundtracks are so good that there's no way that you can pick a favorite because theres just too many good soundtracks. So our result is...... wait what it has an obama mask you say oh i was gonna rate as good game i changed my mind its now god tier game
20316,"good
"
20317,"Very funny game, also cheap and cool. Buy it right now. lol"
20318,"Do not be fooled by the amount of time I've played this game, which is considerably nothing compared to others. I spent most my time repeating missions or fixing a drill. I did enjoy throwing grenades on stealth missions though, and annoying my friends. Would definitely recommend if you want to play a game with a friend"
20319,sample invalid
20320,"This is a great base game, it has been bloated over the years with DLC however."
20321,"Mhm Good

20326,"guys the thermal drill, go get it"
20327,"This is probably in my top 5 favorite video games of all time. Its fun, fast paced, good to play with your friends. The most important thing is you get to steal shit and kill people which now that I'm typing it that makes me sound insane but anyways the game is fun and you should buy it."

20338,"🤑If you like robbing then this is the game for you, aha. Rob banks, jewelry stores, trains, armored convoys, drug lord mansions & much more. From several characters, masks, weapons perks there is surely something to suit your player style. There are ridiculous difficulties for heists and the highest called ""Death sentence"" With option of One down activated which is extremely difficult without the correct equipment, skill and team. On top of that of course is the best possible reward.💰

♠From the time of review everything has been fine so far. To be honest i don't think this review will change as I've played payday 2 on PS4 so i know what to expect. it's funny how this game racks more players than the popular titles, aha. now it's difficult to give this game cons because you need to understand the age and what type of players play. personally i think some of the professional players need to give some the new comers a bit more of a chance. just because someones new doesn't automatically mean there awful.♦

✅Pros
+Decent graphics.
+Tons of content.
+Fun to play.
+Large player base.
+More money than you could ever want, aha. 💲

❌Cons
-Can't find one. 😆

20351,"It's a very good game and much do to in it. One thing I like the most is the progressive system, I'm a very grindy type of person. You also get rewards every time you infame which is also nice. The only downside I can say is that it's a little bit slow early on with infamy but it isn't like it's the end of the world and really not that bad."

20384,GOOD
20385,"Bought this back when it first came out, played off and on through their updates, including the safes aka loot-boxes I took a massive break to find out all those safes that once needed keys are now just free to crack open, the company keeps adding in new content, some pay for, some free, overall I think the game is solid, however my only gripe I have is there is no real new story content or overarching goals to keep the community busy while we wait for the third game in the series so far. Past that I would say a solid 9 for me I put in a good amount of hours and I'm certain I'll keep doing that for 2022 off and on while I wait for hopeful news of PD3."

20398,very fun. Only with that it was cross compatible with console
20399,"I got this game for free at 2017. I'll be honest I pirated the game before. It was really fun, but i have no 4 friends to play. But after this free ones, i finally experience how fun it is for multiplayer. So i decided to buy the ultimate editions at sale, never regret. The only downsides of this game is stealth only map desync making it almost impossible to do, hackers with no punishment, pro that ""too pro"" kick out low level player, low level player that too confident despite not knowing how these heist works and thinking its another battle royale games, and ofc the wait for drills. Despite for those flaws, i loved this game. They almost gone last year but bounce back, idk if i will get those 2 new dlc because some reviews saying its repetitive and unpolished, also the content isnt that much needed. at least for me. But thumbs up they still care about this game. Now with unlockable missions upgrades that finally get rid the paywall weapons mod, i think its time for me to return.."
20400,ok
20401,"Definitely have to play with friends. The only issue is that random lobbies is full of cheaters and will get you millions on just one heist. Some missions are near impossible without other friends to talk to which limits the repeatability of some missions. However, the game has been released since 2013. Instead of buying this game now, I would push the devs to make Payday 3. Even though you would still get your $10 worth out of the game - I would not recommend this game in 2021 because of how old the game is."

20476,mmm
20477,"PAYDAY 2 is a fun, horde-like looter shooter that incredibly satisfying. The amount of weaponry and customization for said weaponry is enormous, if you say that there is no gun in this game you like, you're lying. The game combines horde-like gameplay with the objectives of a looter shooter. You will likely be going to somewhere to steal something that always gets you paid, sometimes the mission will give you the option to be stealthy in a heist (or it'll force you to go quiet). But you can choose missions that allows both quiet or loud. If you go loud, a police raid will commence, depending on your difficulty depends on what type  of officers you will face. You can take hostages to slow the raid and get some needed breathing room to get your objective done. To complete the mission, you must pick up what you're stealing, then walk it back to your truck and leave (this is shortened down to almost nothing, and will not go this smooth in loud missions).

TL:DR Fun horde-like shooter with a looter shooter objective, immense amount of guns and customization, and an addictive gameplay loop."
20478,its fun
20479,host your own game stupid
20480,very good
20481,"payday 2 more like payday wooo

20483,"Go stealth with friends and laugh in a vc while you make mistakes and restart the level over and over

Or go loud and shoot cops in the face with your buddies! It's a great time with lots of different levels with tons of different objectives, enemy types, weapons to bring, builds to make, and lots more :D

So much love, so much heart went into this game, I can't wait for the 3rd installment ♥"
20484,Just a great game to play with friends and have some laughs. The only problem is Nothing. Just (To me) a great game I would definitely recommend this game. And only being like 10 bucks I say thats a pretty good deal.

20569,"It's my absolute favourite heist game, it offers open-ended heists with both action and stealth elements. It's amazing if you wanna be casual and roleplay or use stupid weapons, and it's amazing if you actually learn what the optimal builds are, to the point where i pick two weapons and make a build for them for fun.

It's an incredible game to play with friends , the dopamine rush of finishing a clean stealth heist or a difficult loud one is almost umatched.

The game offers and insane amount of customization in it's masks and has many many fun characters.

Sure , the DLC can be pricy if you buy it all, but the core dlc's to be compettive are cheap, and you can play heist dlcs anyways if you have a friend that owns it.

oh, plus, this game goes on sale like every other month."

"
20579,"All around a very fun game.  Grab some friends and co-op, or simply jump in a lobby.  Fun either way!"
20580,"This is one of my top three. For a game that came out in 2013, it still stands to meet the excellence of a modern triple A game. I've played for 24 hours and I have to say I've never been so attracted to a game. It's music is comparable to DOOM, with incredible sounds and the dialog is incredible! Live action cut scenes make you feel more connected to the game, and the amount of weapon customization is incredible, not to mention the fact that you could drool over the massive perck decks all day, and another one was just added in time for Christmas. With a third title coming in 2023 I can't emphasize enough just how much you need to play this game for yourself."
20581,Really fun
20582,good stuff
20583,"as in all games you get glitches and i'm sure i will come across some in this but i've played over 230 hours in this game and still not come across one the graphics are good, sound good, lots of levels for unlimeted fun and difficulty levels that can drive you crazy at times my preffered games are stelth there mor chalenging you can chage loadouts when you want easy to navigateits just changing all the way graet fun
"

20585,"One of the best hoard shooters and has a great amount of replay ability.

"
20586,Fuck you cringelords kicking me out of your lobbies for tripping an alarm.
20587,Good game
20588,"This game fucking rocks, basically: Stealth is a nerve wracking blast to play sneakin by guards and shooting cams up and rarely infuriating and loud, oh LOUD is the way to play as the enemies have the same amount of braincells as I have after geography lessons but they still will kick your fuckin ass but just uh, shoot them.
10/10 is fun, will be fun"
20589,"Tho this is a thumb up, i don't recommend this game to those who don't have friends to play with or want to enjoy the campaign by yourself, because it often ends up you being overwhelmed with higher difficulties or having friends carry you through the entire game ( atleast that's my experience )."
20590,if you dont buy this you a bitch
20591,Good game but buy dlcs or else it migth get repetetive and theres not a hole lot to do in vanilla without dlcs in my opinion.
20592,i am a huge first person shooter fan and I loved this game my favorite part is the stealth because it is like call of duty but with suspense and a challenge and unlike the call of duty it is not a cash grab and has reasonable prices when I first saw the price I thought it was DLC but 10 dollars for this game is unbelievable for all the stuff you can do in this game. I love the weapons and the customization. I would hands down recommend this game to anyone as I already have to which he watched me play bought it with his own money now we play it and mess around we are probably the worst heisters. I am pretty bummed out that they canceled support for XBOX because that was what I mainly played on and it would be cool to do the white house heist with some of my friends because my friend's mom and dad won't let them buy M games but let's them play them because they think it is a waste of money because it is on game pass. Now I understand I might have played this for 35 hours but I guaranteed you very soon it will be around 700 because I play this so darn much. I have no complaints for the game and I love that it has constant reasonable updates like Halloween outfits and Christmas songs with the glory leech pack. I would recommend you buy this game and support the creators I cannot wait for payday 3. my rating for this game would be a 10/10.

If you *don't* have people to play with, its still *fun* but the harder missions are kind of impossible and the normal ones are boring because the AI are mostly just used as revive slaves while you do everything yourself, and trusting randos online to stick through the whole thing is just too risky."

I will do my best to review and summarize it's contents.

The Catcher in the Rye, novel by J.D. ... The novel details two days in the life of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield after he has been expelled from prep school. Confused and disillusioned, Holden searches for truth and rails against the “phoniness” of the adult world. He ends up exhausted and emotionally unstable......"

20633,"(please dont make fun of my mistakes). Payday 2 is a kinda horde shooter. think left for dead but cops. its gots hundreds of weapons to test them out on cops with tons of gadets to put on that gun to make it better or there might be a draw back with that weapon mod. The dlc is defintely worth buying id recomend buying the legacy collection editon whatever its called. cuz it comes with lots of weapons fun maps and lots of money. 1 thing i dont like is the difficultiy spike from death wish to death sentance. is insane detah wish is doable if your brain isnt smooth and your not below lvl 100. but death sentance even as a lvl 100 i could barley go 1 second without dying. Now skill trees are insane the master mind skill tree with inspire and hostage taker is amaazing. Having everything aced in hostage taker (EXEPT THE FIRST ONE) can help a lot
espically aced stokholm.Another thing that makes payday 2 such a good game is the comuinty the devs alimr listo. We got a fucking golden spoon because some russian badger that drinks gamer sups said. ''gimme da S P O O N please'' and mr listo did. the story is amazing too go watch thekknowley video on the storyline of payday its worth the watch i promise. And as a recent payday fan im happy to hear were getting a payday 3 that im defintly going to buy but i give payday 2 a                 9.4/10"

20655,"Payday 2 is a pretty good successor of the original payday. It's definitely fun to play, solo and with your friends. Of course it does more fun and sense to play it with your friends, because there are many heists you can only go once in and out with your loot. It is relatively user-friendly, but make sure to waste a lot of time to understand the level and ability tree fully. It's totally worth to pay the price to play this game with your friends!"

20771,"The idea of this game is great .....but the execution is really poor. The weapons aren't well balanced (I can snipe a sniper from half a block away with my shotgun, but there are assault rifles that can't), the AI is non-existent ...the cops just run at you in swarms. The stealth missions are stupidly difficult on normal difficulty compared to going in guns blazing on very hard. The missions are mostly really repetitive and the grind for XP and money is tedious. I want to like this game but in all honesty I can't recommend it."
20772,despite them wanting every cent you have with 30 billion dlcs still a fun game
20773,This game has many glitches like i was doing the train heist i got the turret shells i threw them on the boat and it didn't count. And i cant get the bag because i cant get on the boat .

20778,"Take this with a grain of salt because I hate dlcs and think the practice needs to die.
I have about 39 dlcs of this game and have little to know record much money I spent on this game.
It's not a great game, I understand it's probably intended for children and I'm not target audience but I just don't think it's very good. The hostage system is not accurate at all and for a game as old as it is it's still very unpolished. 
The whole point is that it's supposed to be immersive but then you mow down hundreds of police officers and drive off like nothing happened. I keep expecting a negotiation when I have hostages but the ai have no quarrel shooting over the heads of civilians, which unless  the officer is a sniper a normal police officer would never do.
The stealth is okay, but I'm starved for good stealth mechanics so a normal person will probably hate the stealth in this game.
All and all, very mediocre. 3/10 wouldn't buy again."

3 : A lizard snake person that literally has a 50% chance to completely ignore bullets and full speed sprint through entire missions without being seen or heard

and much more, you can create some low key mentally deranged builds like me, I originally intended for my character to be a cold heart'ed killer with a love for knives

Payday has the classic cops and robbers feel that a lot of people enjoy, yeah?
A cops and robbers shooter with customization from what skills you have, your perk deck, melee, guns and attachments, your character, your outfit and mask? Holy. Shit.

If you're a gun nut, into horde shooters, and love a large variety of personalities through heisters, this is your game.

20903,"This game is a guarantee buy. This game has good customization, good weapons, good heists, good feel to the gameplay, and most importantly the game challenges you well. Progression doesn't feel too gated but it works well. I love how they give you just a very simple choice of choosing whether to stealth or to go loud. Both has pros and cons. Some issues are monetization, sometimes the stuff you want are gated behind a $1 wall and it sucks but it's worth it if you are in it for the long run. Perks are really fun to choose as they all are similar in some ways but differentiate them selves very nicely. I recommend this game! 9/10, it goes on sale often if you don't want to spend $10 on it."

20950,"So, listen to this comedic story. It starts with two individuals, King Bach, and his friend. King Bach gets famished and thinks of means to remedy his hunger. He finds that only ice cream can fix this hunger. King Bach then asked for ice cream, but unfortunately, his friend (in a rather disappointed tone) says that King Bach could get only a spoonful. Hearing this, Mr. Bach responds by changing his body language, bringing out a comically large spoon. This means that if Mr. Bach were to get only a spoonful, it would empty the entire quart of ice cream, leaving his friend with no ice cream and nothing to eat but his words. Why did King Bach have that spoon with him in the first place? Did he know that his friend would retort only a spoonful when prompted for ice cream? Why bother carrying around a large spoon when you could have bought the ice cream for yourself? Why are you still reading this? The price of a spoon that big would have more than covered the price of a tub of ice cream. Why does King Bach have to steal his friend's ice cream through a feat of semantics? It is not fair!"

20958,"i played this first on ps4 and it was awesome but rn this is all i play and im happy i got it. my favorite character is sydney because shes aussie and im aussie and its fun to have something in common with who im playing as but the greatest thing is the different levels of difficulty and the style of the game i recommend it to everyone honestly 

i also had an idea that maybe the character you use goes to prison and you could wait a day or two for them to come out or you could break them out but they go into custody in the heist you do but then when you fail the mission you gotta choose a different character and break out the other character you were playing as and the higher the level on the heist the longer the days it takes for the character takes to come out of jail and you could break them out and maybe you could choose the difficulty of the break out but i dunno i thought  it would be a good idea. amazing game though i love it and it'll always have a place in my heart."

20973,"Payday 2, an old classic that still holds up 8-ish years later. It's about a group of robbers who rob stores, banks and the White House along with other locations. Although the game is primarily set in Washington D.C, a very unique choice for a heist game it also takes place in places like Russia and L.A. It's quite simple, slightly frustrating and very fun. A must buy, but be aware to upgrade your guns you need to buy the quite cheap DLCs. 



GAMEPLAY: 8/10 

The heists are very creative and well thought out, and are not just your run of the mill heists. One mission you may rob some stores for a mob boss, and the next mission you steal a election. 


GRAPHICS: 7/10

It's 2013 for gods sakes, still holds up.

GUNPLAY: 10/10

Somehow, Payday 2 has better gunplay than later releases from big name game companies such as Battlefield 2042, and even has more historical accurate guns (if you don't bubba them in customization) than Call of Duty WW2 and the new release COD Vanguard. The gun sounds are quite crispy, and may reminds you of the OG COD 4 reload sounds, and the customization system is the 2nd best IMO."

Secondly, you also have the option of playing alone if you choose.         ( some games like this you usually can't play alone ). Finally, the last thing i'm going to mention is that when you ""Prestige"" there is a separate skill tree / skill points for that so it gives people a reason to prestige and not just to restart and get a number or emblem to show for it."

21012,"In short: I was convinced this was a different kind of FPS, but there does not seem to be a point to it besides having more money. A few hours in and it appears I have seen everything the game has to offer, just not at its hardest levels of difficulty. I am sure it would be fun if goals were more obvious - I spent much of the time having no idea what to do - and if I had more time and a group of friends to coordinate multiplayer. 

More details of my experience:
I jumped right into normal difficulty missions because I had no idea what else to do and could not find a tutorial. I completed the first mission, though probably because other random players joined and met the required goals.  After many failures of a second (normal difficulty) mission, and a crash or two, I did an Internet search to find a tutorial (I had to learn through the key binding menu what buttons I needed to press to accomplish tasks).  I learned the game has ""the basics"" hidden away in a menu.  

First stealth tutorial mission made me think I had to rush, while also requiring me to hold a button for 10 seconds, with only about 1 second room for error or immediate failure (and you cannot press the button you know you need to press immediately, you must wait).  Maybe it is a scripting problem but from 10 feet away from a guard the default pistol can be aimed at a head, fired, and have no result.  I slowed down and finally finished Day 1.  I start Day 2, follow the prompts and realize I did not hold a new button long enough - immediate failure.  I try again, press and hold the button this time, now I learn I am not pointing at something I am supposed to point at - immediate failure.  On the third try, I found there are cameras to face while holding a button down. I got one but ran against a timer or something so I did not get the second - immediate failure.  Fourth try, crash.  Load the game up again and find no way to start Day 2 of the tutorial, I have to do Day 1 again.  Begrudgingly load Day 1, crash.  

While I am glad I did not purchase this, I am sorry for the friend who bought it as a gift. About a year later it was free for everyone on Steam too - just a sprinkle of salt in a wound I guess.

21101,"rec
"
21102,is fun
21103,"Great cooperative first person shooter in a scene where options in the genre are lacking. What's not to like?

Well, it's extremely buggy and there's tons of DLC, but it often goes on sale for a hefty discount, and $20 is well worth the price for the game AND it's additional content, despite the bugs. Honestly most of the aforementioned bugs are humorous anyhow, and not that game breaking.

Either way, if you're looking for a fast paced, first person coop game? This and Left 4 Dead 2 are still solid first choices. Just wish there was more like 'em out there."

Payday 2 is a collaborative first-person shooter video game developed by Overkill Software and released by 505 Games. The game is the sequel to Payday 2011: The Heist. Released in August 2013 for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. An improved version of the game, subtitled Crimewave Edition, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015. A release for the Nintendo Switch was released in February 2018.Two years after the events of the previous game, the Payday gang comes to the metropolitan area of ​​Washington to carry out another robbery spree. The player takes control of one of the twenty-two gang members and can commit robberies alone or with up to three teammates. The player can take part in various robberies, including, for example, bank robberies, shops and armored cars, as well as drug production and distribution. The game differs from the previous one by allowing much greater customization of the player (aesthetics and gameplay), somewhat improved graphical interface and experience, greater variety and reproducibility at the levels and has redesigned stealth mechanics.An accompanying online series has been created to promote the game. The game was profitable only from pre-orders and received positive reviews. Payday 2: Crimewave Edition, which offers improved graphics, new content and some DLC, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015.A sequel, entitled Payday 3, is currently in progress and is scheduled for release in 2023 and will be published by Koch Media. It was also announced that Payday 3 will be made on Unreal Engine.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game consists of a variety of ""robberies"" that a player can choose to carry out either alone, with AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are robberies such as bank robberies, drug trafficking, election fraud or theft of secret nuclear warheads. Some of the robberies place a lot of emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and cash upon completion, and some robberies can only be done in secret. Shipments appear periodically as contracts on a map of Washington, DC The player can get an open contract, participate in a contract that has another player start or buy an in-game cash contract in an offshore bank account. There are seven levels of difficulty: Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death Wish and Death Sentence (formerly One Down), with increased money and experience paying for higher levels of difficulty. Currently, there is an option to activate the ""One Down"" function in any difficulty, which means that players can only go down once before being detained (goes up to two downs with the ""Nine Lives"" ability aced)Some Payday 2 contracts take place over several days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives. After a few days of robbery, do not kill more than four pager guards (the number of paratroopers can be reduced through modifications to the ""crime spree"" game mode). SWAT and by private security contractors GenSec.

21284,"It's all the robbing fun, without any of the consquences!"
21285,"Great game. Great gunplay. Dynamic missions. Even if you don't buy any DLC, you aren't exactly blocked from any meaningful content and all the DLC heists are playable for you as long as you find someone else who has that DLC to play with. Gun selection is limited though and most of the weapons are locked behind DLC."
21286,This is a very fun game to play with friends. It may be repetitive but the different difficulties always spice things up-

21332,"amazing game!
"
21333,very pog. But kinda pay to win because some of the good guns are behimd a pay wall. And some dlc after you buy it you need to either own a completely different game to use some of the content or just have it not there completely.
21334,"this game was made for retarded crackheads, and that's good, really good, it's fun, has nice music. it's buggy as fuck, but fun"

21354,"good

"
21355,raven go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
21356,"Typical relaxing shooter with endless mobs, sorta. A great ""brain-off"" game to play with 3 pals; can also have brain-on mode with stealth, sorta."
21357,super cool xDDD
21358,inside we all sometimes need a medic bag
21359,"haha cloaker brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"
21360,this game surprisingly hard hard i though its easy game but it hard is fun
21361,"Payday 2 Pros and cons
pros-
everything well done but one mission
cons-
you have to spend a hour on a mission where you get a thermal drill

overall best robbing game i've played
"
21362,"Really fun game, use to play on xbox one, and xbox 360. Worth the purchase"
21363,rob an elderly womans home 10 out of 10
21364,"its good, unless u have pepega friends who fail every stealth"
21365,I personally like how fun it is to learn the game and how to play it. It can be a little repetitive at times but overall I think some of the weird ways the gang robs people is cool.
21366,"Ironsights? What's that, food or something? Git Gud"
21367,Its fun with friends.
21368,very fun
21369,bank
21370,great fun
21371,stupid fun
21372,"gud

edit: yes, it still gud
"
21373,played a lot of hours of this game not only pc but ps4 and this game always has kept me entertained and with friends it can be a good laugh if your not trying to be serious
21374,John wick
21375,"best game recommended for 100% for sure
nice teammates they really try to help beginners and i have never seen such a great heist game 
when u play it you will for sure have fun with your friends or stranger teammates .
i played this game for only 3 hours and i really like it
so yeah recommended for sure nice game 
have fun and enjoy the game
good luck robbing banks <3
"
21376,Razormind
21377,fun cop murder
21378,"the game runs very smooth,  a lot you are spoiled for choice in gun choices esspecially masks and mask customizations, if you're looking for a game that you can do loud but also stealth  and that has plenty of maps and missions to do while earning quite the generous amount of money then this is the game for you.
It was very ahead of it's time the year it was released 10 years ago"
21379,I can wear a pair of glasses and no one will know it's me
21380,"for now, lets say its a good game, will see in a few days. I will post another review so stay tuned"
21381,bought the dlc tho
21382,it's payday 2
21383,"good game would recommend
my favourite part is when you heist"
21384,gamedaubuoi
21385,"No matter what happens ... I always end up coming back to this game to get addicted for a long time.

Also BANGER ost"
21386,gut gam
21387,yes
21388,"This game is a long term investment with your time and money. Your health and social life will suffer cause of it. Can you handle the pain?! and the sorrow that comes after

By the time you have all the achievements done....the world around you will be different. Everyone you once knew are no longer alive. it is only you at the computer...alone. You'll look at your hands....and see how dirty and broken they are. You'll get up from the crusty chair and look into the mirror. The only thing you'll witness is how old and ashy your skin has become. Then you'll walk over to the window and only see desolation. Where has the time gone? What have you become"
21389,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree."
21390,Achivement hunt simulator 2015-2021
21391,"пробежал в джаггернауте с пулемётом перед охранником, а он не заметил"
21392,"For now,I like it"
21393,
21394,"game
-kill everyone
-rob everything"
21395,this is one of my favorite games to play with friends.
21396,"It's repetitive, it's community toxic, artificial intelligence is retarded, perk system is inconsistent...

overall it's: 6/10 for me :p"
21397,A game who needs to be played with friends especially but some of the heists are unplayable on online like big oil wich is very hard i stayed 7 hours a day for it and did not complete it.
21398,Played it since 2013 demo on Xbox and i love it
21399,"bag throwing simulator,worth it!"
21400,"nice 
"
21401,very very good
21402,fun game to play with friends
21403,I need a medic bag
21404,yeet
21405,bruh
21406,love it
21407,"Very addictive and fun. Had the game 2 days now and have played in total 16 hours! It is a game you need to master but is very welcoming to new players too! Not to mention the cheap DLCs. If you bash games daily, this is the game for you. I received no compensation for this review, this is my honest review."
21408,good game
21409,no body is on line any more. They could have made a new game with the money they used for spamming facebook.
21410,"still a good game to this day, even better with friends."
21411,really fun game would recommended if you like to be a sneaky MF or just want to shoot some sh*t to have fun with friend

21414,yessir
21415,"dead game but maybe one more update? or should we add another? hmm not sure maybe it needs another update then it'll truly be dead, or is it? ahh whatever throw in another update"
21416,i downloaded a mod that made the bodybags into anime bodypillows
21417,not bad
21418,"Payday 2 is a action-ego-shooter in which you as a robber have to make various raids to get money and xp with which you can improve your weapons and states. 
You always do these raids with 3 friends who are controlled by other players or by npc.
There is a story mode with an genious story and a multiplayer, in this you can do raids with strangers in the world, which means you can get money and xp for your equipment. I love Payday 2 because it's a lot of fun alone and with friends and it's just a wonderful game. I recommend this game to anyone who likes to play bank robbery games and I recommend you to play the story with friends rather than alone because it's just a lot more fun.
9/10
""it's just a wonderful day to rob a bank.."""
21419,Definitely.
21420,"Its fun and its cheap 
recommended if you need that fleeting moment of joy in your life"
21421,Chains is in a pickle!
21422,"Love this to play with friends. Going stealthy is tricky, going loud is difficult. Very fun each time when in good company."
21423,"rob banks, kill cops, smoke green. really fun where my only issue is with how the camra shakes when shooting any gun but its a fun game so i can look past it"
21424,Goodddd Game !
21425,these guys are really gonna need Saul Goodman :/
21426,Very good game. I had a lot of fun. It is not confusing at all. I knew prefectly what was going on all the time. Love this game. One of my favourites. 10/10
21427,*chef kiss*
21428,"noice
"
21429,niceeeeee!!!
21430,"Really you guys?, you haven't played this game? what are you waiting for? its great, specially with friends, its only 2.49."
21431,old but great !>!
21432,"Very, very fun game. Can take some getting used to, but has infinite replayability, and is amazing with friends.

P.S. Grinder OP"
21433,"Best described as Left 4 Dead but instead of Survivors you get Heisters and cops/mercs instead of zombies. The game has a MASSIVE selection of weapons and weapon modifications (and most gun models are GOOD), considering the game favors stealthy approach for most missions. Then again, the music does not. Plenty of difficulty levels, tons of features confusing for a first time player, frustrating achievements, and great voice acting with funny accents (most of the time). The game has modding support and the developers still create updates and patches, whether the ungrateful player base likes it or not.

The base game is rather cheap, and while you will be locked out of a ton of DLC content, it should be enough to find out whether you like the game or not."
21434,rushun bajur
21435,Best game
21436,"Committing Tax Fraud never felt so much fun, 11/10."
21437,the funny
21438,.
21439,"After 8+ years it's still an incredible game, full of content. Playing it with friends it's amazing. Can't wait for PayDay 3 to come out."
21440,This is it give em hell
21441,shit cunt fuck dick balls
21442,giid game must recomenmfd
21443,good game denique buy bassiepro innit!!!
21444,Very good 10/10
21445,Razormind
21446,Probably one of the Best horde shooters I have played and had the most fun with
21447,Funnier with friends
21448,crimes >:)
21449,"This Game just won't die, which is great."
21450,"Late to the Payday 2 party but I do not regret getting this game at all. Good music, good stealth, a much more laidback fun game, and the community is overall friendly. I would recommend the Legacy bundle: all the fun in a pack!"
21451,gooood game i love it
21452,Game is only tolerable with friends.
21453,makes me feel like i should be in jail for 43 years for all my crimes that I have committed. it's great!
21454,<3
21455,Nice Game ^^
21456,love it
21457,Getting dropped kick by a cloaker was the reality check i needed thank you Overkill!
21458,"its good game for free time but this game have problem . problem is a crash . 
and have cheaters and thats good because cheater in my team XD"
21459,dont play i beg of you
21460,good
21461,"I would 100% agree that this game is so much fun to play with friends, hours of entertainment and replay value. 
The price is great, but since this game requires so much dlc, just wait for bundles to go on sale.
Modding this game is great too, so many talented people making things for the game.
Hard to believe that this came out in 2013.
Feels bad for the console players, game's been abandoned on there."
21462,the soundtrack is very good and this game is very memeable remember to bring your medic bag while playing
21463,Nice Game ?!!
21464,good
21465,"Steam made me do this, fun game."
21466,"This is one of those games you stumble upon and get addicted to almost instantly. It seems like a game that might not well age well. A horde-shooter on DIESEL? From 2013? This game has no business being good at all. Somehow, though, it deserves a try. The core game mechanics are rock-solid, with solid gunplay and decent progression but incredible build customization. 23+ perk decks and around 180 skills (Basic/aced), you can make builds for all of the many weapon categories. There is also a massive amount of heists released all the way since the inception of the game in 2013, with more being added every few months. Even though some heists are garbage, there are still heists with tons of replay-ability. There are probably too many difficulties, but this just adds to the amount of replay-ability, especially with how punishing DS and DSOD can be. All this, the heaps of content, good gunplay and progression, a relative lack of grind (unless you want to get EVERYTHING),  an amazing soundtrack with (occasionally) funny dialogue makes this game well worth purchasing, along with the legacy pack. Especially since the summer sale bring the game to under a dollar. If this isn't a labor of love, then what the Fuck is?"
21467,"This game is crazy, fun, rewarding, and has tons of content. Its only better if you have a crew of friends to play with."
21468,"fun for some hours, but incredibly grindy and gets stale.

6.5/10"
21469,Fun ass game!
21470,good
21471,great game
21472,theft
21473,"good
"
21474,"This is one of the best games you can find on steam really cheap. The thing about PAYDAY 2 is that even tough it was released in 2013 it is still a good one. The Soundtrack is extremely good and the gameplay as well, I would give this game a perfect 11/10 because of how fun it is to play by yourself or with friends! The only bad thing I can really say about this game is how many GB it is and I personally think there is a bit too many DLC but I don't really care so yeah that's the end for PAYDAY 2 can't wait for PAYDAY 3 in the near future!!"
21475,need more cocaine
21476,GAME GOOD
21477,fun
21478,killing civilians is fun
21479,Old but great !!!!!!!!!
21480,pee pee poo poo
21481,"The game is buggy at times. The models and graphics are outdated. The ragdoll physics are broken. 

I goddamn love it because its so ballsy."
21482,yes
21483,This game isn't dead (yet)
21484,can u be pregante
21485,"Playing through the lower difficulties is fun, but if you wanna play the harder difficulties you must have a great build, guns, and crew. If not, you are gonna be restarting a lot. There are so many dlcs that new players have to spend so much if a sell isn't happening. A lot of the great guns are locked behind dlcs and/or achievements."
21486,other than it being annoying as FUCK to mod its pretty cool
21487,funny masked men
21488,HAHA Tank build make me go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
21489,Amazing Game with amazing ragdolls and special police that kicks my ass but  im having a bad time from grinding because no friends to play with.

21496,"What can I say about paycheck sim? 1000 hours, 1000 achievements. Secrets done, safehouse customized, And many, many cops retired. Payday 2 is a fun, buggy, and sometimes frustrating game that, for me at least, holds a place like Fallout or the elder scrolls where it's good on it's own, but becomes great with mods. 
Learn the game, do the damn tutorial, and once you're familiar, mod it until it breaks."

21523,"noice

21524,"The game is old so I would NOT pay full price for it. But to get it on sale and support their efforts in keeping it alive its deff worth it.

The game is quite fun and can be modded to make the way you play fun if you prefer. 

Overall I could lits tons of cons, but if you buy it on sale, then who cares about the cons, you Did not pay full price and you have a great game with a TON of content to enjoy :)"
21525,"Pretty good horde shooter (there's regular units and special units, that are fun to fight). 
Customization is insane, I couldn't make it justice on a review. 
Soundtrack is amazing and varied. 
Don't get discouraged by the amount of DLC, the base game is pretty cheap (specially on sale) and has a good amount of weapons, cosmetics & weapon mods (which you can unlock at the end of missions and thru achievements), and maps."

21535,d
21536,Yes
21537,"Highly recommend this game. Found it through a THERUSSIANBADGER video, and it looked like fun. While yes, the abundance of DLC can be troublesome, you don't really need the DLC to play those campaigns, and in any case, the Steam sales help a lot fo adquire them."
21538,Kind of fun for the first few hours. Very quickly becomes boring and is showing its age.

21621,"Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good game. I enjoy what there is to do.

But this is not a game for anyone who is not good at stealth or first person shooters or any game where concentration and perfection isnt your strong spot.
I've been playing with my friend, and all its done for me is remind me how dumb i am every time i mess up one simple thing.
Playing the same level over and over just to make sure i dont even think about accidentally stepping out of line (as someone who makes mistakes all the time) just makes me very stressed and upset with myself.

So, if you're not good at fps, stealth, or anything else i mentioned, avoid this game if you want to remain happy with yourself."
21622,it fun and you rob peplo
21623,It's a fun game to play with friends or alone and provides multiple different ways to heist.
21624,:)

21637,"After almost 800 hours on PC and over 1000h on consoles, I can't tell you how much this games rocks. It isn't updated on consoles anymore sadly but it has been an amazing game since 2013 and I cannot wait for Payday 3 to come out. This game has everything a good PvE game should have to offer, whether it's mindless shooting with your friends for hours, build creation and higher difficulty game play, achievement hunting and a non linear story line. Everyone who enjoys shooters and like to kick back can fall in love with this game. There are multiple game play systems in the game already like loud/stealth heists, Armoured or Dodgy builds, over 150 weapons and a variety of melee weapons, perk decks to further specialise how you use your build and all of them combined make the overall experience just more unique. All of this combined with the uncountable amount of mods available from the community that vary from basic skins for your guns to complete remodels of the UI, custom heists and changes to game mechanics, there's a mod for everyone and they are a great addition to the Payday experience. The only downside of the game is that, while they aren't needed, there is over 160$US worth of DLC. They aren't all needed to enjoy the game(as a matter of fact none of them are) but they do give you access to launch DLC heists (you aren't required to own a DLC to join a game that is running its heist), special weapons, masks, heisters and gun mods. Altho getting all of them at once would come up fairly expensive, the vast majority of them are worth it and if you are a new player you should look into which ones would be good to prioritise before just getting a random one. oh also, did I say VR ? yea, VR is available as a free DLC that allows you to launch the game in VR, you get  sick main menu, it's the exact same heists and builds and you get to play with PC people ( It's always funny to see someone wiggling their arms around or blind firing a sniper rifle mid heist)"
21638,f
21639,great game even for low end spec laptops and computers
21640,why is dallas in minecraft bain? explain bain
21641,awesome game
21642,I started playing this in like 2015. its now 2021 and im still playing. Nice.
21643,cloakers scare me. drills always work :)
21644,"Love the game hours and hours of game play, pick up and play. with mates is the best"
21645,"This game was my childhood and i still love it to this day, i recommend this game to everyone above 16 years old, this is game has so much content for the price so please play it if u can afford it"
21646,mom
21647,I used to play this game a lot on my xbox 360 and ps4 and there were so many glitches because they stopped updating on console. I knew they still updated on pc so when I got one I immediately bought this game. There are no glitches that I have experienced yet and it is a great game. The only thing I disliked was I had to restart from infamy 4 but that is not the games fault.
21648,"this game is a great wacky lil thingy to play with friends, but it get a tad boring without friends imo"
21649,"I didnt ask for a game this good, but i got a game this good."
21650,i rob banks yes

21653,I think the devs is secretly EA
21654,finally be being a clown has paid off
21655,A really fun game and there are some funny bugs but a overall good game
21656,"Fun game but better with friends and DLC. Unfortunately the game is more heavy on the DLC side but can still be enjoyed nonetheless. The best part about the game is not the gameplay or the story, but the amazing soundtrack."
21657,Guns go pew pew haha.
21658,only a spoon full
21659,The one FPS game you're able to come back to no matter what.
21660,"Beyond the fact that getting all the DLC is expensive, this game is great.

Wide variety of heists to do, wide variety of weapons, different playstyles.

If you're a completionist its great with all the achievements to get. Also fun to speedrun certain heists. 

Community is pretty good and the modding community is pretty good.

If you don't mind tossing another $200+(prob like $75 during sales) on DLC get it.
Though to be fair all DLC heists are still play-able you just can't be the one to start them."
21661,"I would prob be in jail for terroristic acts of man kind if this was real life!
Would play again committing terroristic acts of nature"
21662,nice
21663,very nice game
21664,"It's a great game (And very cheap currently only 2,50) that doesn't need an amazing pc to run, there's a lot of content which is all replayable ofcourse. With the DLC' s there's even more to do, but they aren't required."
21665,Good game 🎮 👍 BUY IT BUY IT
21666,"very good even after years, every music is gold and enjoyable during fights"
21667,yeah its a good game i got it for cheap and it was worth it if you are lucky you can get all DLCs for 9 dollars

10/10 would need a medic bag again"
21719,it's pretty pog with friends
21720,laal
21721,"Sunk about 900 hours into this game at this point, and it's a ton of fun.  It's got a steep learning curve and several levels of difficulty for you to get accustomed to, plus lots of heists, weapons, characters, skills, and perks to play with and over 1200 achievements to gun for, not to mention one of the greatest soundtracks in any game ever made.  It has a dedicated development team that are still updating the game regularly after 8 years since it's release and a fairly accepting community that is fun to play with."
21722,"Well, it's a fun game especially when you play it with friends.
You can choose the difficulty of the missions and that's a good way to learn about the game"
21723,Robbing banks and shooting a lot of cops is definitely my idea of a good time

21732,"Payday is THE shooter game for me. It's not competitive so there's no stress about skill or bad teammates. It's just pure fun.

The game has constant sales, and even the DLC pack comes fairly cheaply around holidays. You'll actualyl be lucky if you see the game NOT on sale.

Gameplay is satisfying, feedback is godly, customization alright, and balance not terribly bad. You'll want to have the DLC pack for the best and most fair experience, as most harder difficulties are made to be a challenge even for those with the best weapons from DLCs.

All around a really enjoyable game and one I hope I get more motivation to play more of  it at some point."

This is one of the ""old but gold"" games.
It is amazing to me how the game is still going strong despite it was released almost a decade ago.
If you don't want to bother reading the entire review, take a ""that's a must-buy-game"" from me right away!
For everyone else, this is what the game has to offer:

[b][PROS][/b]
- satisfying overall gameplay
- headbanging soundtracks (including DLC'S)
- a ton of weapons and modifications (including DLC's)
- best fictional contractors on earth (e.g. Bain, Locke)
- team based
- near to infinite possible loadouts (including DLC'S)
- diversity in missions and tasks (including DLC'S)
- optimizable (mods and community/workshop)
- platform friendly (tested on Win7 and Win10)
- regular updates (even in 2021)
- a lot of creative achievements (+1000)
- amazing characters and voice lines (including DLC'S)
- breathtaking atmosphere (e.g. Big Oil Day 2, Green Bridge, Birth of Sky, etc.)
- creative events (e.g. X-Mas, Halloween, etc.)

[b][Neutral][/b]
- storyline (meh)
- secret storyline (creative meh)
- visuals (it's justified due to the very old engine)
- weapon balancing
- funny bugs (like cops casually walking through walls at times, nothing gamebreaking though)
- infamy leveling (or grinding I should say)
- mask customization (there are a lot of options, yes, yet only three categories of customization itself)

[b][CONS][/b]
- overpowered bots (most of the times, bots are a better solution for harder heists than real players, making it hard for newbies to enjoy online crime.net)
- some perk decks are really useless (esp. on higher difficulty) and received no balancing in the last years (have fun playing with gambler, maniac or biker on DSOD)
- some glitchy physics (including bags, shields, body ragdolls)

[b]OVERALL EXPRERIENCE[/b]
This game has brought so many smiles and laughter to my friends and me.
It is very enjoyable, satisfying and just amazing to play - every single time.
No matter the contractor or heist, there is always something new and unique in each and every gameplay.
The more time you spend with the game, the more you will find yourself loving it!
I can just recommend this game with all my heart and wish you all the experiences I had the opportunity to experience.

Thank you for reading this review, it really means a lot!"

21765,"Pretty interesting game. Stealth heists can be great fun and exciting to play. Though there's only a very low number of missions where stealth is actually fun and viable.

Going loud makes for rather boring gameplay as the game just keeps sending more and more enemies that keep getting stronger - it sets way too much emphasis on a mass of enemies which makes it more of a (tower) defense game and grind and less of an actual heist. Police doesn't care about you having taken hostages, to them every cent you steal is more valuable than hundreds of lives. This makes for a rather bad atmosphere and gameplay once the alarm goes off.

In the end it's still fun to play occasionally with some things done well, but there's definitely a limit of that."

21861,"Played it around 2013 when I was still mostly a console player. Loved the concept and lot of the stuff the game does, but came to a rage quit and sell when the host just at the last minute streches decided to kick everyone out, and I had wasted about 10 minutes of my life, because of there no proper ways of avoiding cockthroats like that.

Came on back around a few months ago for PC. The lot of the stuff I love is still here, but so is the things I hate. I'd still have to recommend the game, just because of the unique aspects and how well it mostly executes them.

Just try to convince or blackmail 3 people you know and trust to get it and play with you as well, or get ready to drive yourself as mad as I am trying to wrangle the A.I. teammates. The best I can say about them is that they are more useful than the Daikatana A.I. partners."
21862,yes
21863,Good Game :)
21864,"All I can say is, it's an amazing game with amazing heists. It also has good weapons. You can play it with your friends, other random people, or by yourself. If you're thinking of buying it, do it now and you won't regret it."

21878,"From gameplay that doesn't get old, (most) characters that have a lot of love put into them, to a story that you have to work for in order to understand, Payday 2 is a timeless classic. If you want a good gun game that's also a horde shooter with some really wacky objectives, this is the game for you. Not to mention, 4 people can play this at once, so, there's that really neat fact. 

Also the game isn't dead you narks, they're just giving us more content to keep us tame until Payday 3. It's what Dying Light is doing until Dying Light 2 comes out."

22006,I may be incredibly late to the party but Payday 2 has quickly become one on my favorite games in the past month. Becoming one of the only games ive played ive really enjoyed the gameplay and most importantly the music. I can't reccomend this enough to anyone who enjoys shooters. Ive found the higher the difficulty enjoyment rises rapidly because eventually mindlessly executing police on very hard isnt as fun but with Death sentence the game will always challenge you.
22007,good
22008,"I love the shooting mechanics, but I'd personally dislike the amount of cops that spawn, like they were L4D zombies or something.

Not that they're going to change it, but I'd simply like to know a game that feels like this one when shooting, but with less and more resistant enemies"

22018,"God I love this game, an amazing team shooter that doesn't need a pvp aspect in order to be fun. the variability in gameplay styles and just the sheer thrill of pulling off a successful heist makes this game stand out from the rest. And even now, nearly a decade after release, it is still getting new content. Probably one of, if not my favorite, semi-fps game of all time"

Hoping they learned from this game and Payday 3 will come out a blast of a game

Not sure how much trust i have in it yet tho

Even tho this game is still worth a play alone or with a group

ONLY BIG - IS ALL THE DLCs for all the weapons and stuff after we got promised this was gonna stop, but they need money i guess."
22038,"This game fulfills my heist dreams and helps me let out my anti-cop sentiments in a safe environment. Make a ton of money and kick the fuck outta the law. No end, lots of fun maps, and semi-frequent updates makes this game damn good. I wish the AI would get smarter as well as stronger as difficulty scales but you can't have everything.,"
22039,"This game somehow does so much with the strange hand it's been dealt. Payday 1 was cool and 2 somehow survived publishers, fraud and bankruptcy.  It's still getting updates bringing things like crossovers and VR and I'm so glad that it has survived to bring about a sequel.
Yeah there are some jank parts and lets not really talk about how stealth is done, but for some 4 player horde shooting its one of the best with plenty of weapons, build variety, maps and difficulty to get into."

22109,"When I first started playing this game, I somehow didn't know you could change difficulties and that stealth was a thing, so all I would play were Normal difficulty loud missions. Safe to say it got pretty boring for me pretty quickly... until I discovered what the *real* game was when I dug a little deeper and saw some videos on it. Shortly after, it became one of my favorites and my most played games. I'm a big fan of PvE games and I've also met some really cool people along the way! Legacy Edition is an absolute steal if you manage to catch it on sale, definitely worth a buy."

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?"
22139,"Fittingly, PayDay 2 is a lot like a bank heist. If you pick your crew well, everything comes together like a well-oiled machine, and everybody gets rich. If, on the other hand, you leave the guy with the IQ of a toaster in charge of grabbing the money while you guard the hostages, you’ve booked yourself a one-way ticket to San Quentin. Like most co-op games, PayDay 2 is only as good as the people you're playing with, but when everyone involved plays it the way it's meant to be played, the rewards include challenging, high-tension action, and intense running gunbattles.


The core four-player co-op gameplay is really strong, as are the many systems and mechanics that feed into it. Crime.Net is your principal gameplay mode, where you'll choose missions from an interactive city map and get matched up with some partners in crime. Things like safe, guard, and camera placement are randomized every time you play a mission, keeping you and your buddies on your toes at all times, but in a creative and thematically appropriate idea, you get dropped in to case the joint as civilians first so you can get an idea of what to expect. Though it might sound boorish, it's actually one of the best parts of the experience. I never felt more like an uncatchable thief than when I started calling out guard positions to my teammates while waltzing through a jewelry store undetected.

Walking around the maps can be a jarring experience, though, due to some graphical inconsistencies. Out in the streets, environments feel believable thanks to impressive daytime lighting and some truly authentic-looking architecture. But that believability crumbles the moment you step inside, where the geometry is so basic, and the textures so flat, that you'd think you were playing a different game. Both could definitely use an extra round of bug fixes, though – I wanted to immerse myself in the fantasy of being a big-money bank robber, but an endless stream of snafus kept shattering it. Invisible walls? Check. Endlessly repeating civilian character models? Everywhere. By the time I noticed I could stand inside of innocent bystanders, I wasn't even surprised anymore.

Thankfully, the excellent sound design does a lot of heavy lifting, rescuing some of the atmosphere. Rifle fire rings out across the streets as beautifully as a church choir, and the muffled sound of a guard getting plugged with a silenced 9mm feels ripped right out of a good caper movie. Paired with a wide variety of well-animated hit reactions, the sound effects give PayDay 2's gunplay a punchiness that invited me to pull the trigger again and again. The dynamic soundtrack isn’t quite as memorable, but musical flourishes accompany each shift in pace, cuing you in that you need to either buckle down for a big firefight, or haul ass towards that escape van when the cops are hot on your tail.

But unlike its predecessor, that won’t happen every time you play – at least, if you play well – because PayDay 2 actually recognizes and rewards a smart, stealthy approach to bank robbery. Though some of the multi-day missions have unavoidable armed conflicts, most heists allow for a skilled crew to ace them without the cops ever getting involved. Disabling alarms, silently taking out guards, and effectively controlling civilian crowds all have a huge impact on how fast and how severe police intervention will be. A flawless heist is incredibly tough to orchestrate, but it IS possible, and that possibility kept me chasing perfection match after match.
Part of why it's so challenging, and alluring, is all the different details and elements that play meaningful roles. Downing security guards means you'll have to answer their radios to avoid alerting others. You'll need to balance your load-outs between mobility, utility, and concealability. Four robust skill trees affect everything from the kinds of gear you're proficient with to your skill at hand-to-hand combat or lock-picking. The amount of depth is impressive when you add it all up, and the result is a surprisingly strategic affair disguised as a fast-paced shooter. But the best part of all is that even once things invariably go wrong and the focus shifts from executing a plan to thinking on your feet, PayDay 2 remains a blast. The ensuing firefights are long and intense, and the varied types of foes that get thrown your way require good resource management and quick thinking to best.

Which leads us to PayDay 2's biggest, most glaring issue: the offline single-player mode. It should be clear that this is a co-op game that’s meant to be enjoyed with four human players, but if you had any aspirations of making bank as a lone wolf, you might as well shelve them. These AI helpers aren't even capable of interacting with objectives or carrying money bags, making even the simplest, most straightforward missions nearly unplayable. They’re fine as mobile meat shields, but otherwise, they make PayDay 2 look like a much worse game than it is. It’s honestly baffling that they’ve even been included in their current state.
Verdict
Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big. Parts of its presentation are lacking, and the state of its single-player is criminal, but overall, it's a deep, addictive co-op shooter that tickled my inner burglar.

22235,"The devs have made numerous missteps throughout the games long history, including briefly adding microtransactions, a bait-and-switch ARG that turned out to be an advert for another game, and other things that offended the player base at large at the time, however at its core it is and has generally always been a good game. An occasionally janky game, but a good game.

The number of DLC is meme-levels of intimidating, but heist DLC you only need to host and not to play, so there is no fee to play with friends with different DLC than you, and the rest of it is weapons and characters, that while nice to have, doesn't change all that much. Except maybe the sniper pack. Being able to penetrate shields is pretty big. There is nothing in it that separates the player base though; you can even have a miss-matched team with some people playing in VR, which is a rarity in itself.

The graphics are lacking in some of the more modern effects, but hold up well enough, the gameplay is solid a co-op FPS mission based affair with good gunplay, the story has historically taken a back seat to gameplay, but has developed over the years to a state of 'existing', the voice acting is a mixed bag and is generally fine but has some exceptional performances as well as some characters that can't even maintain an accent over a paragraph, and the music I subjectively find a bit of a mixed bag; mostly ranging from electronica to industrial and even drifting near yacht rock at times, but I like the majority of it and it's grown on me over the years.

Overall it's an enjoyable experience that I repeatedly come back to. Or maybe that's the Stockholm syndrome speaking."
22236,"In this game you play as a funny guy with a mask, and rob places."
22237,"Amazing game that I keep coming back to even after completing the main tasks!

Story: 8/10 If you don't care about the story, that's fine since they don't force you to learn it or punish you for not getting into it. If you want to learn about the lore......Well, you're in for a ride. With it's story mode (as well as the videos/trailers outside of the game), you can enjoy piecing everything together like one of those conspiracy theorists. Only problem it isn't 10/10 is because I personally haven't gotten to checking it out.

Visuals: 8/10 Even without mods, the vanilla version of the game has some pretty beautiful visuals. It's not the main focus of the game but it still manages to stick in my head. If you feel like adding to/changing the visuals, they have their own settings with different filters you can mess around with (you can even change the colour scheme to only black white and red). I wouldn't say it's the most beautiful game I've seen however.

Gameplay: 9/10 Lots of fun playing through all the different heists. They also have a TON of different weapons and other things you can combine in your loadout to make your game unique! As for the difficulty of the game, it's of course also customizable too! Only problem is that it is possible to get bored of the heists if you play this game all the time.

Characters: 10/10 OH. MY. GOSH. Where do I even begin? Well for starters, the heisters (of course). All of them (excluding Ethan and Hila (sorry))  have their own unique personality and voicelines that - combined with their own outfits and loadouts - make them special and so interesting. And it doesn't stop with the other non-heisters too. The contractors, the villains, the side characters that we only hear once or twice, they're all so unique that they stick in your head anyway! I don't really know how to say this, but the characters are just.....EVERYTHING!!!
 
Other: 
- The price is originally around £9, so even if you (somehow) don't like it, it's only £9 wasted.
- If you're scared of losing interest in the game, don't! The devs bring out new heists more often than you think...
- The addons (in my opinion) are a little overpriced, but don't forget all the sales they put on this game! They aren't small discounts either (20-80% off sometimes)!"
22238,i laik mone
22239,"Pretty interesting game. Stealth heists can be great fun and exciting to play. Though there's only a very low number of missions where stealth is actually fun and viable.

Going loud makes for rather boring gameplay as the game just keeps sending more and more enemies that keep getting stronger - it sets way too much emphasis on a mass of enemies which makes it more of a (tower) defense game and grind and less of an actual heist. Police doesn't care about you having taken hostages, to them every cent you steal is more valuable than hundreds of lives. This makes for a rather bad atmosphere and gameplay once the alarm goes off.

In the end it's still fun to play occasionally with some things done well, but there's definitely a limit of that."
22240,"Do I write this review to pimp out my steam badge ?


Maybe...."
22241,"Despite it's buggy drawbacks and controversial history, the game still stands as one of my favourites. Doesn't get old, especially in pubs lol"

22249,"Is it flawed? yes
Are there way too many dlc's at way too high prices? oh freaking definitely dude
Do I still love the game to pieces? YES

There's a great bit of customization, the gameplay is good (And due to workshop support can be changed if it gets repetitive), and in general it's a great experience.
Do take friends with you though, it is INFINITELY better that way
And do your wallet a favor and buy when there's a sale, + check which dlc's are trash and you don't need. You don't want to pay the equivalant of 2 full AAA titles just for the dlc."

22279,"Payday 2 is the ultimate turn your brain off and play sort of game. It takes about ten minutes before you unlock everything you'll need to have fun. Achievements, grinding, customization, and heist variation all bring you coming back for more. Get it. It goes for $.99 when on sale. You don't need to own the DLCs to play the DLC heists, only know someone who does. Plus you can get all old DLC for cheap. Well worth it."
22280,If you ask if this game is worth 40 bucks or dollars why is it ten I'll explain it this is a heist strategy game guns missions all that good stuff but to run this all you need is a average computer to run it yes you have to plan to win it isn't pay to win sure there's Dlc but to play none required.

22286,"I've played this game for the longest time, and the gameplay never gets any less boring, especially on higher diffculties. I'd highly recommend it if you've got the cash and are ready for an excellent (if buggy) game."

22288,Very Intense Action !
22289,"Fun coop game with friends. Easy to learn, hard to master. Not a recent game, but still getting content updates. Lots of replay value and space to hone your skills if you want to dive deeper.

Loud missions: Guns go BRRRRR.
Stealth missions: Plan A: Guns go brrrrr. Plan B: They go BRRRRR.

Be prepared to restart a lot of a stealth missions at first. It's worth trying. If it does not work after a certain time, just do it loud to preserve your sanity and retry it stealth later on."

22304,dalas
22305,ok
22306,After all these years PayDay 2 is still as fun now as it was when I first began playing this game over 2 years ago.
22307,"hehe funny medic bag
"
22308,"only a spoonful, of Cloakers"
22309,"Lots of content, while most of it is behind DLC, you could easily play the base game by itself and have a lot of fun, you can still play DLC locked heists, if you join an online lobby where the host owns one, then you can play even if you don't yourself.

 Heavy grinding, which is extremely fun (or get carried to max by your high level friends, but don't do that please, you will miss out on the great feeling of accomplishment and reward)

 Great variety of weapons, equipment, skills, and other unlockables, like masks for your character and outfits, skins for your weapons. Weapons and skills go on to affect your play-style in missions, making you go either stealth, loud, in-between, or even just a gimmick.

 And then you have the enemies which are a huge variety as well, with ""specials"" and encounters unique to heists and all.

 Easily one of the most fun co-op horde shooters around to this day, with only the heavy monetization being arguably the only thing keeping it from being as accessible as let's say Left 4 Dead, still a decent game.


(I'll edit this review by saying, that there's quite literally no other game like Payday 2, this game is one of the most unique games I've seen in a while, it gets VERY complex and you have to be really into it to sink as many hours as most of it's players do, monetization is still fucking trash, engine is one of the absolute worst (mods are fun), balancing is all over the place as Overkill doesn't even know their highest difficulty (you don't have to be a meta slave to play ds stop inhaling that copium) but still good game, would recommend.)"

22326,A great game with so much content and the difficulty system is great. Able to be played solo or with friends or just randoms and it is stealth capable or you can go in guns blazing overall plenty of content and dlcs to keep you going so make sure to buy silk road or legacy if you want to be able to play the levels when you want although they aren't required to play the dlc maps but you need them to make your own lobby with that map.

also, a tip for new players wanting to stealth a map; get a feel for the map, either by playing it a lot or if you're stuck watch someone else play it on YT or somewhere else."

Referrences in achievments are funny part for now too :) 

After all this is way better heist simulator than a GTA V was for me. I think this game is underrated :)"
22382,"Gun goes brrrrrr

Fun game to play solo and with others. Mow down the endless horde of cops and become a billionaire from the criminal lifestyle. Play as Keanu Reeves or Tony Montana as you heist. This game can be really chill and very intense at the same time. There is a bunch of heists, weapons, camos, masks, perks, skills, builds and achievements to keep you entertained as you play. I do recommend you get this game, especially when its on sale, its a steal."

It's a B I G and L A R G E Spoon meele you can equip and if you kill alot of cops with it then you get your 24k B I G funny Spoon with a chance you can actually burn somebody with it.This game has also great soundtracks like Razormind, I will give you my all and even more! So now that's out of the way.. Buy it NOW!"
22389,"My original review was negative after watching 50 precious infamies go down the drain due to a save corruption. Now I've got my progress back and can finally talk positively about the game.

Just buy it. Seriously, this game has quite a lot of issues, but you can look past them due to the addicting gameplay this game boasts in both loud and stealth. 

There are so many heists to play and learn to keep you busy for ages. It's good fun solo, with friends, and even in pubs (most of the time...). Along with this, there is so much replayability and experimenting available to you with the profiles. There are loads of guns you can use with loads of different attachment combinations. Along with the guns, there are loads of skills and different perk decks you can combine to either make the most effective builds possible, or just to piss about.

There is a lot of DLC in the game, sure, but you can play the DLC heists online through a different host who owns the DLC. As for weapon and weapon mod DLC, there are plenty of free weapons and also perk decks that are quite viable on the toughest of difficulties. The only DLC I would say should be considered to be bought is the Spec Ops DLC due to the sheer effectiveness of the Speed Mag.

The game is also extremely moddable. Mods come in many different forms such as music, heists, HUDs and even things like new weapons or custom perk decks. Just don't be a douche and get cheat mods like P3DHack or super OP perk decks and guns. Also, if you do mod your game, please make backups of your save... I learnt this the hard way..."

While a ""meta"" certainly exists, you can totally get away with playing how you would like to play on lower difficulties, and once you're used to the game you can fairly reliably get away with Overkill difficulty for solos with bots.

22469,"A lot of stuff to do, a ton of different play styles and generally a great game solo and multiplayer. Definitely worth the 3 dollars on sale, only thing is there's a whole lot of DLCs but you'll be fine with just the regular game. Highly recommend."
22470,"Good and funny game:)

22472,"A solid (though 'arcadey') first-person shooter that routinely gives you something new to do.  The missions can feel a little overwhelming at times, especially when you are trying to go a stealth route, but it gets a lot easier and a lot more fun when you can work with friends to try and pull something off.  I haven't put a ton of time into this game but it is really easy to jump in for a few rounds/missions."

I thought they will stop at 2018... Kinda nice, kinda weird!
Although I like the idea of the game a lot! Challenging and/or relaxing. Made for newbies and hardcores.
Great to play solo or with other people."

22478,"Loving this game, best with friends and good team mates. I am lucky enough to have a friend that know a lot about the game. So try to talk to people and ask if they can help you to learn the game.

Heres what i've gathered from playing the game for 9.5 hours:
- Depending on the heist. You sneak around the bank, spot cameras and guards.
Then put on your mask and do what it tells you to do in the top left. If your doing it stealth, do so sneakly.
- If your doing a loud mission/Heist then you will die instantly. Nah just kidding... kinda. As of me only doing harder heists im not sure how an easier loud heist would be.
- Equip and use your med kits, because you will be needing them a lot.
- Doing just a easy heist will not give you that much money. So try and do a harder heist that will get you around 1 mill. Try and join a hard heist that have other people in it, for the best chance of escaping with the goods."

-Some Cloaker"
22498,"A fun casual game to play with irl and online friends. Also some pretty challenging and fun end game content on dsod loud if you're into that. The skills/perkdeck builds are always interesting to make and try out. Stealth is always a fun challenge to play with friends. The new maps and updates have been pretty good as well. 

End Game Side Note:
(I'd like to see the skills expand a bit more like a PoE type skill tree, or like having a chance of finding rare or legendary items to give an incentive to keep playing since honestly infamy levels alone doesn't really do it for me.)"
22499,"DLCs guys, go get them"
22500,"fun, haven't played this game in decades lol"
22501,Great gambit

22525,"4 Player madness of bank robbing and heisting.
Drop-in / drop-out, play with friends, randoms and AI.
Can fit different play styles of loud and stealth.
Various customisation, maps, modes and difficulties.
Continuous updates and DLCS.

Some Negatives:
- Large updates
- FPS shooting isn't as smooth/satisfying as it could be
- Can be nauseous over-time from the movement
- Long-time missions can get tedious
- Becomes lock-pick / bag simulator

Overall: Good

22526,Payday 2 is hard but very fun. Especially with friends.
22527,"Its a pretty decent game with nice graphics, lore, the OST is just freaking beatiful, variety of weapons and equipment and many ways to complete heists but i feel like it lacks maps, dont get me wrong maps are awesome but after some time you can feel like theres only a few of them and enemies aren't surprising."

22532,"This game is a long term investment with your time and money.  Your health and social life will suffer cause of it.  Can you handle the pain?!  and the sorrow that comes after~  

By the time you have all the achievements done....the world around you will be different.  Everyone you once knew are no longer alive. it is only you at the computer...alone.   You'll look at your hands....and see how dirty and broken they are.  You'll get up from the crusty chair and look into the mirror.  The only thing you'll witness is how old and ashy your skin has become.  Then you'll walk over to the window and only see desolation.  Where has the time gone?  What have you become~"

22583,Genuinely really fun game. You can either go stealth or guns blazing. But it doesn't force anything which makes the experience all the more fun. You don't need a lot of time in game to realize how fun it is.

22599,"If you buy base game Payday then prepare to be kind of disappointed, but when you start to get some of the DLCs in there it becomes a great drill repair simulator. The DLCs are fairly inexpensive especially because a majority of them come in a bundle that you can get for something like $10 on sale. This game is even better with friends, and whether they suck or are great you have a great time either way."
22600,"Pros:

- Great graphics for the time it was first released
- Great mechanics
- Lots of character costumization
- VR Support
- Lots of weapons and items
- A pretty neat level up system
- Many characters available
- Weapon skin system
- Lots of different builds one can make, the game will always be different due to these (Making it less tiring)
- Lots of different levels and maps
- Various difficulties with the design of the characters changing (+ new enemies as the difficulties increase)
- The game is still being updated to this day
- Mod support
- Various game modes to choose
- Great voice lines and voice acting
- Amazing story
- Has live-action episodes

Mixed:
- The bot's AI is reasonable, but sometimes pretty messy.

Cons:

- Most characters are from DLCs
- Most weapons are from DLCs
- Most skins are from DLCs
- Some maps have various glitches
- Some actions are often slow or not accurate such as changing weapons or certain ragdolls going crazy
- Driving in this game is terrible (ironic considering the story of the engine it was made on)
- Sometimes the character movement can be frustrating, often jumping too high or low and getting stuck

22602,this game sucks my nuts
22603,"PAYDAY 2 is the best crime simulator I have ever seen. The game combines suspense and action beautifully into one glorious masterpiece. I would highly recommend this game, considering its' low price and amazing play ability. With tons of heists and countless achievements, I can guarantee you there is years worth of content."
22604,Yes
22605,"Guys, It's a good game. Go get it."
22606,stelph.
22607,Good but repetetive
22608,"i like the game but the vr is really bad and i dont know how to fix it its very choppy with its looking around 
"
22609,its pretty good
22610,"Excellent game if you can deal with random crashes and bugs here and there. Most the bugs I've encountered don't repeat/reoccur and the crashes don't usually repeat/reoccur.

I've played since 2013 and it's kept me playing until now. Play it with friends, go for an achievement milestone.
This game can be played on a surface level or as intricately as the games engine will allow. Most missions can be done ""loud"" with police/swat assaults (which I find to be the most fun, the gun play is fairly varied with the many skills, weapon types, and perk decks), or, stealth, which demands you avoid getting spotted by guards, cameras, and civilians. Stealth has some minor issues, but for the most part you can learn to circumvent alerting guards and such. 

Notably, though, playing with a competent team can determine the outcome of a run. Idiots will facilitate the crew being chain-downed (everyone getting downed in order, trying to get one person up), and a great crew can play confidently on death sentence difficulty. Again, I urge you play with friends so communication isn't hindering progress.

Most of the DLCs add a lot to the game if you can get a bunch of them on sale, otherwise play in public lobbies with the base game. Some DLCs really don't add much other than cosmetics, but if you get invested enough you may find it worth your while for custom masks, gun skins. On that note, back when they had the Safes with Drills (loot crates with keys) that was a terrible move. Terrible enough that its functionality has been removed from the game for years now. Now, you get skin drops randomly.

Overall, get some friends, hop on discord, and pop some helmets."

throw bags and wait 
only good part is buying guns and customizing them"

22618,"this game was already too much fun and then they added VR support.
holy fucking shit if you have VR you need to play this and if you dont you need to consider getting it just for this title, yes this fucking old ass game in VR its some of the best experience ive ever had on VR.

22632,"very good with varying difficulties and TONS of contents, a bunch of guns, types of guns, and a ton of heists the only thing is that a lot of stuff is behind a pay gate (DLCs) but since it costs anyway you'll be fine and its not necessary to get the best stuff, you just miss some content"
22633,Gud game

22636,"This game is so much fun.  It can get chaotic at times, but overall, gives you a great time!"
22637,Medic bag moment
22638,Man I love this game while it can be repetitive at times the modding community makes this game feel different each time you come back. There is a lot of heists and a lot of variation on builds to keep it fresh. Can not wait for the third one.
22639,"Tonight, on this episode of “Gus Fring forces h3h3 and John Wick to steal an ancient eldritch box while simultaneously murdering thousands of police officers while listening to “Donacdum” for 4 hours straight”…"

22649,"I Really love this game 
Love the grind
Love the charecters"
22650,fun
22651,i LOVE seeing my friend going warp speed while holding a minigun gangster style and BLASTIN EVERYONE while im sitting in a corner with a starting shotgun almost dead
22652,"Very enjoyable game (unless you play loud Death Sentence heists, in which case your suffering is immeasurable)"
22653,Love robbing banks. Wish there were more stealth maps and missions though. Stealth is by far the best part of the game.
22654,20/20 good game. Goes waaaay deeper than I thought.
22655,"I based a build around shotguns, turning one into an LMG and the other into a sniper rifle. No other game lets me do that ;P"
22656,:____)
22657,gg!
22658,"Its an amazing game to play with friends, to create friends, or to murder in cold blood whole squadrons of police officers without a care in the world, amazing, the community and the devs are great, and thank fuck that its old because even garbage 10 year old laptops can run it, meaning youll find infamy 99 players playing the game in 15 fps."
22659,pog not too bad
22660,"Im love crime
"
22661,"shoot cop
steal money"
22662,"very good devs, they carry the game"
22663,"So after i left PD2 for almost 3 Years...

I still like it. 
If you're interested in the story, there are some videos that are around 4h long explaining everything.
I think it's better with friends or solo. 
Public lobbies sometimes are just a pain in the a**.
Regarding fun: Just take your time. 
I noticed that if you try to rush a heist, it's not always as fun as if you had taken your time with everything.

- Fax
 
"
22664,i like game
22665,This pure feeling when you can steal and run without getting caught... with your good friends. Or if you are loner - with bots. Awesome game for stealth and rush genre.
22666,The game is still fun
22667,"rob banks, cook meth, commit many more crime and scream for a medic bag"
22668,"If you have a fantasy to become a goat-masked bank robber that wants to constantly rob the same lowly secured bank (that poor bank manager) to make profit....this game is definitely worth your time !

Got friends with the same urge for mayhem ? Great ! Go grab 'em and your Comically Large Golden Spoon and go thwack some 'good' guys' to steal some gold. If gold isn't your style, there's a wide range of missions, events and story line to complete and get your teeth stuck into. 

Skill, Perk Decks and a selection of Equipment and weapons allow you to play how you want. Whether, you want to be a tank or run a stealth build, you have the freedom to do that. And with character customisation, you and your friends will stand out from the crowd...not that the poor AI know that...yet. 

For a game that was released in 2013 the gameplay is sturdy and reliable from my experience. Graphics are decent, weapon and map models voice lines and visual AI are of good quality. 

Weapon play is decent. It can get a bit messy and all over the place at times but you'll find what works for you without a doubt. I've found that once you've unlocked some sights and attachments for weapons you'll stop having such sloppiness. But you'll have to rely on RNG or in game currency to unlock these, so there is a bit of a grind for them. But when it come to bullets hitting things,  the hit reactions are spot on. 

Difficulty levels. They actually hurt the higher you go, so there is always a challenge waiting. However, I don't really advise playing a higher difficultly on your lonesome, or playing this game by yourself, as the AI doesn't help all that much and you'll find yourself doing all the work. 

Overall, for what this game lacks in makes up for the laughs and gripping mayhem you can get out of it. You find yourself looking past the sloppiness and barely there bugs to just enjoy casually walking into a bank, a minigun in hand, with your mates. 

10/10 would definitely recommend.                                                :)"
22669,Awesome stealth game or hoard shooter depending on what you're going for. I love how its still getting updates and how the community is top tier.
22670,steal bnak :)
22671,drill
22672,Ridiculously fun. I recommend it fully. It has enough content to possibly last you years of gameplay. And there's a comically large spoon.
22673,this is kill simulator
22674,"you shoot guns and get loot, what more is there to say?"
22675,It is still fun if you got friends to play with.
22676,I need a medic bag.
22677,Play if you like robbing people and killing cops and serving for game robbery.
22678,rob bank get ricj
22679,great game so much fun lots of action I love it
22680,"i have a bank

i have the gang

22697,"One of the best games to play with friends. It was a real pleasure to play hundred of hours with you, Hunk (stealth) and Demonn (loud)."
22698,"a guy called me daddy, 10/10"
22699,"Endless hours of fun, enough said."
22700,i need a medic bag when i play this
22701,Ahhhhh I need a medic bag
22702,"amazing game, i played enough to say this is an absolutely amazing games. Constant updates keep the game just as alive as the community. Balancing can be a bit wonky but that's the fun of it. Playing it with friends gave me TOOOOOOOOOONS of hours of fun that kept me engaged. Achievement hunting is fun except for a few odd achievements. 
Overall the game is absolutely amazing and i would definitely recommend it!"
22703,yeah
22704,"A Oldie. Very fun game with many differing play-styles. The game may be frustrating when you mess up a stealth mission, but with minor adjustments it can make it easy. They STILL update after many years which makes playing more an easy task. DLC is cheap and can help you with somethings. Fun with friends and I'm sure it will still be fun for many more years.

Overall, A Classic."
22705,Great game that is still getting updates and content.
22706,"I used to love the hell out of this game, and you can probably tell judging by all the hundreds of hours I poured into playing it. Thanks to their numerous updates and constant game modifications, however, the game files are literally too big for me to download and continue playing. There are some games I refuse to uninstall to make room for Payday (specifically GTA V because I'll spend two days trying to reinstall it), but even if I did uninstall them I don't think there'd be enough space on my hard drive to allow Payday to be installed. Good stuff"
22707,good game
22708,"Nice game. I bought it, I went to rob a jeweler, a bank and a prison. And after I got home, I started this game and had deja vu. I recommend it nice and warm <3"
22709,"Payday 2 is a great game which is still supported by the developers.

A lot of heist missions to choose from offering replay-ability."
22710,"The game has quite a lot of bugs, but it also has a very loving community and passionate developers. So mask up Heisters!!"
22711,"A masterpiece and a great co- op game with friends
great gameplay
great story

and tons of fun"

"
22790,game good
22791,"Great fun to play solo or with friends, the game caters for all kinds of playstyles and lets everyone build their loadouts the way they want. The game uses RNG in heists to keep each playthrough of a level unique so that you cannot predict what will happen all the time making replayability much better and enjoyable. 

Music is fantastic, great tunes to jam out to while you're popping heads or sneaking through facilities though most of the community would agree that doing heists loud is the proper way to appreciate the awesome tracks of Simon Viklund.

Overall it's a great game to play and when on sale it's an absolute steal for all the content you get for free!"

22864,"Great game, had fun gunning down civilians and failing stealth heists, 10/10, fuck shadow raid"
22865,"New players may find the different ""profiles"" and ""skill sets,"" two different menus to mix-and-match, to be a tad confusing. Otherwise, it is simply a fun game that can get addictive. Game-play aspects can be simple enough to understand, aim and shoot cops while stealing money, while creating builds, and understanding the less-intuitive mechanics like ""dodge,"" help to also make the game complex. With the continued support by the developers, and funny vr heisters waving their arms everywhere, this game is worth getting. 

It is a shame, though, about new players missing out on the removed dlc's. Perhaps the next game can better prepare for future-proofing that (like kingpin + other things). In the mean-time, though, I guess people can go crazy with a giant spoon. Maybe after some hours in the game, a new player could even watch a few videos on the game, figure out some neat tricks, try a few mods, and look into the ""secret ending"" for the game.

Buying the Legacy Collection is highly recommended if you wanna play on the higher difficulties, but it's still fun without any DLCs and you can still join the DLC-specific heists, just not host them.

22890,"[h1] Payday 2 Review[/h1]

Before starting my review, I suggest you buy ""PAYDAY 2: Legacy Collection"" while on discount so that you can experience the game with a lot of DLC's. Moreover, by buying it you will not need to purchase them one by one and can save large amounts of money.

[i] Payday 2 has a lot of sides to play by enjoying it. Firstly, there are a lot of maps you can play, and the mission in them varies. Also, you do not need to own all map DLC's to play. You can join the players who own them. Secondly, if you get used to the game, you can play it for hours. In other words, if you have any friends who own the game, do not hesitate to play with them because you wouldn't even realize how many hours you have played. Thirdly, there are many weapons you can use and they vary from type to type also, some of them are funny to use. This situation, of course, is to some extent, because you will eventually get bored of them after a while, Therefore, you should consider buying weapon DLC's. They contain a lot of weapons, but as I mentioned at the start of my review, you can buy ""Legacy Collection"" so as not to purchase them one by one. Finally, in the game, there are many skills and perks you can experience. Also, they change the way you play in addition to some new play types you can develop. Nearly most of them are found in the Character DLC's and they come with them when you order. To me, these are the things that make the game most playable. In conclusion, these things make the game enjoyable and playable, especially with your friends! [/i]

22944,PAYDAY 2 is one of those games you can all ways come back to and still enjoy the game play after 10 years of the series and the community being one of the better gaming communities out there
22945,"To be honest 

The game is not ""buggy as hell"" as people has stated it is, where as there may be a couple of bugs, the game is still extremely playable, and those bugs do not show their head much at all, I've experienced a bug, probably once or twice.

I've seen people say that the guns are terrible, feel awful, and that Call of Duty has a ""natural feel"" where this can not be further from the truth, Payday 2 incorporates recoil control, and attachment selection in order to fit the gun to the playstyle you are going for, Aiming down sights feels as natural as it can, considering the games age, Bare in mind, the game was released in 2013....

The AI, can be stupid at times, but again, this is due to the games age, which you can not deduct points for, as they work a lot of the time. People complain that they are sluggish or don't follow commands, However, if you are calling them to you, and they are shooting, they are not going to just run through everyone, because that is not realistic at all, they will seek cover, and shoot their way back safely, this is how the game is designed.

As for the person who stated ""The game is rubbish solo"" This is completely incorrect, I have personally completed every heist on solo, loud and stealth, you need to learn to understand the game and its mechanics and character build system before making a judgement that is factually incorrect.

As for being cheaply made, the game was made in 2013, Overkill was still a small studio, and what they did, with the budget they had, was phenomenal, you can not compare this game to games like Call of Duty, or GTA, because its just wrong, the studio was small, and are still supporting the game to this day, they are a fantastic studio, that has created an amazing game, and for that. 

Thank you someone for helping me :D"

23034,"When I first got Payday 2, I expect to get, maybe a dozen hours from it, clearly, I got more then i expected. Due to solid base gameplay, interesting situations, and great customization, I find Payday 2 to be a worthwhile, if sometimes janky experience. Of course, it has an annoying amount of DLC, much of which feels too much like it's needed for the game experience, but even with out the DLC, the game in it's current state is great, and with Overkill continuing to update the game, even after no longer needing to, it still offers a great time."
23035,"Even though this game is really old and is made on an even older engine, it is still one of the most fun I've had in a game in a good while. Gameplay is fun and simple to get into while still having some complex mechanics to it, there is a lot of grinding however for me it never really got boring or old as the game encourages you to play multiple different heists rather then grinding the same heist over and over again. Music is amazing, it always fits the mood and setting for every heist even though there are multiple genres of music in the game. I would highly recommend this game for most people, even if you have no friends to play with you can still play offline mode and have just as much fun."
23036,"forever a super fun game that feels good and occasionally hilarious to play. a ton of heists, the VAST majority of which are great or better. its still fun alone, especially for the cheap price, but the best way is with friends. try it for cheap on sale, tell your friends to try it for cheap on sale, then one or both of you buy the legacy edition, on sale, and then play 200+ hours and fall in love with the game. 100% recommend, at least try it."
23037,"This game is incredibly fun to play with a group of friends. More could have been done to make pre-planning and scoping locations out a bigger part of the game. Overall, it is a great game to waste hundreds of hours on."

Payday is a very good game to play because of how you can cooperate with your teammates to do objectives and complete missions both in loud and in stealth.
The game takes a bit of time to get used too because of the mechanics but makes the experience smoother when you nail it all down.
The solo aspect of it comes from doing stealth and how it gives the player a challenge to do objectives in a quiet manner. 
The only complaint i would have is that the game has a bunch of DLC that is optional but add more to the game and i hope there's less DLC for PayDay 3"
23042,very fun game once you've levelled up high but a bit hard to get into and a lot better with the amazing mods the community has made.

23047,"You know what, It's about time I reviewed this absolute Masterpiece.

Music: One of the best Soundtracks in Gaming.
Customisation: Weapon Crafting and Masks allow you to create your own personalised heist experience.
Gameplay: Simple and Fun, What else do you need?
Medic Bags: We have them.
Thermal Drills: Go get them."

23060,"The best simulator of robbery, Game is active after 8 years of release date. One of the best choice of Linux Gamers"
23061,"Loved the game.
One of the best game to have a coop vs AI experience with your friends. You can play competitive and go for achievements or just play chill. It has also a great story line which can be followed in game and with little ""short films"" available on youtube, that reflect some of the game heists and story.
One of the things that make this game unique is the dev team, this team is composed of professional meme lords. They like to troll the player with weird achievments and sometimes events like the comically large spoon or the fact that they wear ""Dead Game"" shirts on dev diaries.
I recommend"
23062,Heists & Payday.
23063,"Dead Game



Still fun, though"
23064,hey why did i get downed again
23065,"Its pretty good. Wish it didn't have so many paid DLCs, but aside from that it's a pretty good game."
23066,"This game is incredible. Despite the age, the engine, and the controversies, the game is incredibly well-made and incredibly replayable. The developers continue to update the game, making new and improved contracts to try out, all while working on its sequel. Even without friends to play with, the experience is amazing. I highly recommend you try it out."
23067,Stole 600 hours of my life and a ton of money. I guess it did pull of a perfect heist on me.
23068,"Have you ever wanted to do heists with your friends without any repercussion?  Well then this game is exactly what you need, tho I wouldn't recommend doing so IRL. 
Pros: you can steal stuff both stealthily and gund blazing, lots of weapons and ""jobs"". 
Great music
Fun with friends.
Cons: easy to learn, hard to master
You don't have all the things unless you buy the DLCs
A bit grindy but overall fun so that balances it out I guess."

23073,i like it and it's very nice
23074,"Fun by yourself, fantastic with friends."
23075,"Fantastic game, Great time with friends in tow."
23076,I would definitely recommend this game if you like to grind and somewhat improve. The community is somewhat good depending if you're joining appropriate difficulties and not just leeching from other people. A problem is this game has too many DLCs if you're poor and most people just use cheats to get everything unlocked.
23077,so coooooo
23078,"Aside from occasional instability and less-than-mediocre DLCs as of late, Payday 2 is a fun game that has very high replayability."
23079,"Good game, I recommend."
23080,its very good
23081,"Pretty fun, especially with friends. About 33% of the heists are DLC but it is cheap and often goes on sale. 8.5/10"
23082,This is an amazing game that has stood the test of time. It's a great game to play with friends.
23083,Almir Listo is a champ
23084,payday
23085,"Great game that I'd recommend even now as it still gets regular updates with new content. Sometimes the age of the game does show, however many if the issues are very minor and can be solved with basic mods. Pick up this game while you're waiting for Payday 3 in a couple years."
23086,"Coolest multiplayer game ever :
-a ton of fun
-a lot of customization
-very cool and different missions
And a good communication system.

This game isn't for putting in a trash bin."
23087,kasa dzień 2
23088,good game. very broken
23089,have fun! do crime!
23090,"Firstly, this game is SO FUN. I always seem to find myself playing through different missions having a blast just shooting things up and switching weapons just to have FUN. The gameplay is awesome and will keep you entertained for hours on end through the series of heists. Although I typically prefer more story centered games than ""shut your brain off and have fun"" type games, this game certainly does suffice. My only real complaint is the ridiculous amounts of constantly respawning enemies. Other than that I have no serious grievances.
             My final rating? 8/10"
23091,Epic!

23108,"Really fun game if you either want stealth plays, mow down hordes, play with meme builds, or play on a bdsm torture difficulty. this game has it all as it's constantly updates with free or paid content. only issue i have is the engine of the game has issues sometimes, it's hard to convice people to play since so much stuff is paid dlc which has good and bad stuff, and how sometimes you get bad sports in a lobby. despite that this is my favorite game that I wish more of my friends wanted to play."
23109,Money heist simulator.
23110,rob stuff
23111,"This game was good, I never had any dlc and I don't plan on buying them, but for 66 hours I've played, I'd say about 50~ hours was truly worth it. I played 40 hours vanilla and the rest with mods, playing mods was funner and gave me a more enjoyable time however by the time I got to like 55 hours I didn't have anything to do, I beat most, if not all vanilla heists on overkill+. The game got more and more boring, doing the same heists over and over and over, and then I realised it was just a grind for exp and the heists weren't exciting anymore, as much as I enjoyed the start, which was probably the best part for me and my friends that played this together since we were much more squishy and died easier which led us to try doing it stealthy, which would work 0.5/10 times. I wouldn't recommend playing for more than 60 hours but hey, if you want a game you can just play and shut your brain off, this is the game for you, though this only applies to later stages in the game."

23119,Turrets.
23120,it is time for money
23121,"Such a good game for already so many years. Its so old, but still getting now and then updates. its great keep it up."
23122,"I only play this game once in a blue moon, but that blue moon is one of the most fun nights i can have. From the enjoyable music soloing loud heists, to more enjoyable music with friends whether or not we're in VR.

It has its quirks that are well explained by many other reviews and it has had its time through both good and bad...

I'm not good at this but payday 3? Sign me up."
23123,Great game

23126,They spam the steam group
23127,"Absolutely amazing game. Sure graphics aren't up there, and the story is a bit convoluted but it's still one of my favourite games. The amount of build variety that you can do just adds to the fun of mowing down endless hordes of cops. Add the fact that the Devs are still adding new content to the game cements in my mind that this is one of the best games on steam."
23128,"just a damn good game (quick tip, flamethrowers solve everything)"

23170,good game
23171,"After all these years still new content, very nice! Awesome game."
23172,"Let's be honest. This game is very good in one and very bad in another.
Good at a variety of contracts, RNG, planning execution of heist, a variety of music and its dynamics, builds opportunities, a large number of achievements, a large number of weapons, perks, skills, masks, customization, live online and mods are also important (jokes about dead game are more ironic than reality).

But you don't have to go far to find cons in this game either: a large number of DLS, the first experience can seem very difficult and possibly boring (mostly the drill is to blame for this), terrible optimization of some contracts (White House, Black Cat, Henry's Rock), on the highest difficulty (Death Sentence) on loud, revealing the rubbishness of most of the perks, skills, and weapons.

This game will be loved by those who are willing to spend a lot of time learning the mechanics and like to experiment.
This game will be hated by those who get tired of constantly failing.

Of course, I mentioned only the most important points, there are also many more pluses and minuses in the game itself."

Jokes aside, PAYDAY 2 has had a rough history but it always overcame the bad bits and continued flourishing. It's an antique with its age but the developers still actively work on it and interact with the community to a small degree. OVERKILL have earned my respect for coming clean with their bad calls and admitting that they've returned supporting this game after its supposed end mainly due to financial pains. 

The gameplay itself? Simple but not always simply executed. You are a robber. You got a gun, several even if you count your sidearm and potentially up to 6 sentry guns if you spec for them. You shoot gun at police who try to stop you stealing or doing whatever it is you do though usually it involves illegally acquiring goods. Depending on the difficulty set, the cops may be utter pushovers or demigods of crime containment. While you, the players, can have absurd abilities thanks to the skill system, the cops got their own special units to make your life of crime all the more enjoyable. Shields, tasers, cloakers, medics and bulldozers who will also appear more and more frequently the higher your difficulty.

Not a fan of mayhem and epic music blasting at loud intervals? Stealth is also an option for quite a few heists. It's not perfect but it works, especially once you figure out how to cheese certain aspects of movement. Unlike in open assault, kills have to be kept to a minimum on almost all heists since you need to answer the pagers of recently permanently retired guards and after 4 the guy on the other end won't buy your excuses anymore.

The endgoal of the game? There is a storymode available although it's more of a checklist with narrative. A good way for players to orient themselves on what they should do. Otherwise it's all about getting dosh without end, leveling up, unlocking skills and perks, enhancing your arsenal with a gigantic availability of firearms, launchers and other exotic weaponry and then once you hit level 100? Go infamous, start it all over again with more and more extras unlocking. And with more than 1200 achievos waiting for the taking, completionists will be kept busy indeed.

All in all, I recommend a healthy dose of PAYDAY 2 for everyone who likes illegally acquiring currency through the use of highly looked down upon methods. Did I mention you can bring up to 3 friends for even more craziness?"

23270,"The game is really good, enjoying playing stealth/loud and it was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, i have some performance issues with newer DLC after White House Heist released (San Martin, Buluc Mansion, Ukrainian Prisoner Heist, etc) the developer really didn't tell us exactly minimum specs to run it. I really give up until i downres and low graphics the game so beware for buying DLC if you have big beefy PC, these heist are not optimized very well. I recommend this game overall, if you like it most i suggest buy the legacy edition instead of newer DLC."

23282,"This game is like a Nicotine addiction. I only play with other people. It's horrible and degrading but calming and satisfying at the same time. And no matter what I do, how often I quit to try another game, I will inevitably come crawling back to this god damn game. I love it and I don't know why other than I just do. Even through the great updates, and the broken ones, I just always come back."
23283,I have 2 hours on this game at the time of writing this. As someone who did not pay for this game (My friend bought it for me) its not challenging at all but still somehow is really fun in single player. Probably a great game for people looking for something they can chill in. The 2 hours ive had had been disturbed by 1 problem with this game. I some levels it tells me to do a task though I can not get to the area I have to do it in. I wish this game would be more clear on how to get to places.

23294,"I cannot fully describe the essence of Payday 2. I can't describe the fantastic times and the hilarious times I have with friends, which you should play with. It's always better with friends. It's a beautiful game. That is all I can fully describe it as."
23295,Incredibly exciting horde-shooter with a stellar degree of customization that draws me in every time I feel like going all in on character design. A slightly comedic undertone across the game means that you will have a grand ol' time murdering hundreds of cops and becoming the single biggest enemy of the entire country.
23296,"alright ramblers, let's get rambling

i would say this or that about payday 2 but honestly everyone else has said everything you already need to know. stealth is great, loud is great. sadly the meta is restrictive, but not in the ""not everything is viable"" way. there are actually so few things worth using on much harder difficulties. if you are just interested in playing loud and casual just cap your difficulty at overkill, trust me mayhem is just so much harder. but for stealth... there is no difference in gameplay besides the money you get for winning. getting detected is basically an instant loss if you are playing on harder difficulties and actually an instant loss on missions where stealthing is a requirement. its just a fun game that is very engaging. as the payday 2 twitter says, ""play payday""."
23297,The game is fun but Cloakers exist.
23298,funny
23299,Fun

23306,Very halah gameplay!
23307,"Used to be great fun a few years ago. In 2021 i would sadly say its not worth it anymore. With years of development locked behind paywalls in the form of DLCs it is very difficult or expensive to enjoy the game.. for me anyway. Now there are mods that let you access all of the DLCs, which tags you as a cheater and doesnt let you join most public lobbies (you can still host or join lobbies that allow the ¨cheater tag¨), but thats another story. The graphics, especially on some maps just arent good anymore, the whole game is made on a shitty engine and doesnt run well. The veteran community died out and now it just seems like a fairly populated, toxic wasteland of free to play players mostly. The old, polite community was decimated by actual cheaters, ruining heists and lobbies within seconds and taking the fun out of the game. However, if you have 2-3 friends to play with, this game IS still very much fun, the stealth is enjoyable, the gunplay is still decent and if you dont like something about the game, there is probably a mod for it, all of which are multiplayer compatible obviously."

23355,"My Personal Payday Review
======================================================================
🗹Multiplayer
🗹Puzzle solving
🗹Horde shooter
🗹Hours of replayability
🗹CO-OP/Teamwork centered game
☐Good single player
☐Good tutorial
======================================================================
Like most co-op games, PayDay 2 is only as good as the people you're playing with, but when everyone involved plays it the way it's meant to be played, the rewards include challenging, high-tension action, and intense running gunbattles. The core four-player co-op gameplay is really strong, as are the many systems and mechanics that feed into it. The placement of guards and objectives are randomized every time so no two heists are alike. Payday realy shines though in its stealth heists, Heists which can be done silently, never having to get into gunfights with the cops. Stealth heists are fun, filled with tension, and are a great fun with friends. Speaking of, Payday 2 is a heavily Multiplayer game, meaning that lots of objectives or heists are easiest when playing in a full lobby of 4 people, While all heists can be done solo It isnt as fun or as easy as playing with friends or some people online. But overall I say that payday Is a fun game worth the pricetag and is definately worth your time to get."
23356,"Pretty good game, lots of fun killing police forces."
23357,"RussianBadger introduced me to this. So me and my friend decided to join in on the fun, so, quoting the cloaker: ""Better late than never!"""
23358,"load up, mask up, an get ready boys an girls for a wild ass ride of mayhem explosions bullets an bodies layed out on the streets. they wont call you clowns for nothing."
23359,yeah pretty cool

23368,Nice music!
23369,"A lot of things are behind a paywall, I do not remember there being so much paid DLC for this game when I played it previously."
23370,"this game is a good time, my only complaint is that they locked the king pin perk deck off for anyone that did not own the scarface caricter pack instead of making it availible for everyone for free but otherwise 9/10"
23371,I love this game
23372,very fun
23373,"Game is a lot of fun to play with friends, specially if at least one person has a bunch of the DLCs.
Game has a LOT of DLCs that range from Must-Have to Useless. Still worth to pickup the DLC bundles on sale.
The game is pretty easy to pickup, but you'll probably need to search online for builds for high level play, if you care about that.
I recommend the game IF you have friends to play with, because playing with randoms can be a mixed bag, specially because of hackers."
23374,yeah it's fun
23375,"I only go loud when I mess up a stealth heist... So I always go loud.

Scarface DLC.
Regretful, there's no way to get it anymore. I think it's because that scarface is not one of the gang members anymore but other things inside should be separated from DLC.

Expect to be dropkicked by psychotic black-ops spooks that jump out of sewers, humiliated by said spooks, and bonked by a man in an EOD suit with an M249. Expect shenanigans, and most of all...

23494,"I’m pretty satisfied with my experience with PAYDAY 2 so far. However, there is one core flaw, one crippling, mindboggling decision that was made behind the scenes, that almost makes me want to uninstall PAYDAY 2 and never play it again. 

Why is there an option to turn the music off? Who would ever pick this option and why would you ever commit such a sin as to turn it off in the first place?"

23520,"Of course, after playing this game for 90 hours, I need to review. This game in infinitely re-playable, I have played this game for 80 hours without friends, and still had a blast robbing banks and museums. The story I don't even understand its so complex, the difficulty modes are perfect for everyone of every skill. There are over one hundred weapons, and over one hundred attachments. The perks are an entirely different thing, being able to tune it what you what, either be a big chunky guy with tons of health, or a fast guy with high dodge, there are plenty of play styles for everyone to try out. There are plenty of heists, it would probably take a few hundred hours to beat all of them on death sentence. It would take hundreds upon hundreds of hours to 100% the game, including the secret ending which is beautiful. Just buy it already, and get it with friends, it is 2x better with someone to crack jokes with, one time ended up with me and some friends just singing songs. Buy it. Do it. And get it with friends."

23522,"Cock and ball torture (CBT), occasionally known as penis torture, dick torture, or male genitorture/male genital torture, is a sexual activity involving the application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks."

23534,"i mean come on its payday 2, shout out to russian badger and his awesome videos for even making me get this game, even as old as it is it still has a thriving fan base of active players"
23535,Its good
23536,"A literal amazing game, with an even more incredible easter egg. It's somewhat fun playing by yourself, but if you can get a group of 3 other friends to play with you, the game goes from being ok to being literal god tier content. Sure, playing with friends leaves more room for error, but that's only part of the fun of Payday 2.
I would however, recommend getting it on sale, especially when the dlc pack is on sale as you will miss out on a lot of content if you do not purchase the pack with DLC."
23537,mods are fun af
23538,it good
23539,my friend force me to buy this game but i like it

23555,"Look, you wouldn't believe the lore of this game if I tried to tell you. Just know that PAYDAY 2 is the keystone that connects all fictional media. Hotline Miami can reasonably exist in the same universe as High School Musical because of this. I'm not joking."

23566,"I'll keep it short and sweet, and though my hours say just 48, that's not wholly true.
Payday 2 keeps some of the same mechanics you know and love from other modern shooters, you've got your iron sights and crouching and left clicking shoots, that's all fine, but Payday 2 beyond that is far from generic, allowing you to do so many more things you could barely dream of in other shooters or wave shooters, such as converting the people who were JUST TRYING TO KILL YOU to YOUR side so they can shoot the SAME SQUAD MEMBERS THAT WERE ALSO JUST SENT TO KILL YOU. I can't really think of many games that allow something like that.

The variety bag of weapons, explosives, equipments, and throwables make sure there is always an option and a favorite for anyone who wants to play. Would you like to slowly and methodically sneak through an art gallery with a silenced Glock 17 (Chimano 88) or 1911 (Crosskill)? Or would you like to tear through that gallery with a minigun like your ass is on fire? How about throwing cards as a lethal weapon, or even a large, plastic spoon as a melee? Both very real options to choose from. Getting into perk decks is a different beast as investments into making you a full blown min-maxing terror from the depths that the SWAT will soon wish they never got out of bed for.

All in all, there are thousands of combinations and with your imagination I'm sure you'll find something you'll love, and the police will regret taking the call for, enjoy."

This is a great game for some coordination with friends, or just trolling in publics."
23683,gun go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
23684,"Incredible game if you have 1 hour or more to spend since heists can take a lot when done solo, it's also really fun played with a group of friends (If you have any). I would complain about the heckton of paid dlcs but knowing the developer's reasoning for them it's entirely understandable.
Another thing to note is that some heists can get really laggy and will heat up decent-ish gpus fast as hell, so I'd recommend playing it with a cooler if you play on a laptop. I don't blame the developers for the lag either, since the game runs on a garbage engine. 
So yeah, play it and support the devs. It's fun."

23750,"I fucking adore this game, its immense customization, and the fact that it convinced my friend to play an FPS. I couldn't imagine a better horde shooter game with more personality and fun story than Payday. Can't wait to shit myself when I get dropped by a cloaker in Payday 3. Buy this game, buy Hotline Miami 2, enjoy the shit out of playing god. 

""I really enjoyed that"" -Jacket, Me, and Everyone else who has ever played this"
23751,This game pissed me the truck off. Missions don't complete and you get stuck in a never ending trap of crap. I could stand on the middle of a crowd of shooting police and take 0 damage. Broken game.

23764,Fun with friends and on your own. But game play is fun and you can keep coming back to the same mission over and over again and it wont get boring. DLC are fun and where worth my money the guns and the missions. Would highly recommend to others. And like i say on all of my comments john Arbuckle you fucking shit
23765,yes

23770,"Absolutely fun game, many mission, many weapons, builds, overall absolutely stunning game"
23771,Great outlet for those who want to recreate their own heists like in the movie Heat. 8/10 for the sole reason the game can sometimes overwhelm you with enemies.

23776,"I was recommended to do a review of this game even though I just posted a review about this game. Having played at release, this game does not have the thrill that it once had. Prestige system is lackluster and only exists for those who like to start over. It can be fun, but there is not enough incentive. The incredible amount of DLC makes it a fairly boring game to see on the shop. I will admit, I owned all the DLC before the Legacy bundle became a thing. However, as it is now an 8 year old game and trying to come back and seeing another $100+ worth the minor DLCs, I am again discouraged to jump back in. I choose to make the dive every couple years to see if I can get back into the scene, but am always driven back to uninstalling. The community is unforgiving to new/returning players. My attempt to join games is met with outrage that someone who is ""Infamy VI"" has no clue on what weapons are considered good. I want to like it, but this game is not for new players. This game is for those who want a first person shooter that demands a meta and to know the content before you enter. These types of games are not fun.

Addition #1: Game has two modes. Stealth and Loud. In Stealth, you spend a bunch of time sneaking around (who would have thought) and if you mess up, you're doing it Loud, whether you're equipped for it or not. If you do Loud, the gameplay is exactly the same. Shoot anything and everything that moves and hope your teammates are good enough that you don't have to constantly revive them until they are placed in custody and you are forced to play with one or more players down until the assault wave ends and you have to hope you can get enough hostages to bring your teammates back. Gameplay does not have much variance beyond that. There are different maps with different objectives, but the gameplay remains the same."
23777,brain needs big for this game me donnt have that so me bda that being said godd game 10/10
23778,yuo can hit fbi guy with spoo
23779,"Very fun PvE experience that can be enjoyed both solo and with friends, though with friends offers the most fun."
23780,good
23781,"really funn and intresting game, but i bet playing with firends is more fun, even tho every mision is really the same"
23782,nice game
23783,this game is so good i swear plz get it or wait till payday 3
23784,"I am a 55 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 12 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"
23785,very good game but not for noobs aka HassanHussainOG

We made fat stacks of cash an I bought several guns, upgraded my skill tree and perks only to close out and loose everything.  Not sure i'm going to play this game again if I keep loosing my hard earned loot."

23847,boring without DLC someone gift me a few.
23848,Hehe bank go boom.
23849,fix crashing though
23850,"It's an amazing game. The stealth is really good if you are into that type of stuff. Or just go guns out you can go both ways. You can play with up to 4 players or go solo with bots (They don't anything before it gets real hot) For the price it's a really really good game. There is a lot of missions 12 i think, but if you buy the Legacy Collection like I did for just 10 more bucks you will have 30 missions to play and a lot more weapons to play around with. For the 4 hours I played back In the day when there was free days on It I fell in love with this game. And now I bought because me and my friends upgraded from our potato laptops and now we can play this game all day long. If you are into Robbery and that type of stuff I recommend you try this game for SURE!"
23851,shoot people
23852,"This game is amazing! It has great and high quality graphics and textures, and is even very greatly optimized. It even has great voice acting that triggers at certain events. It also has great developers as well as actors for the gameplay and trailers. I would highly recommend getting this game, if you could afford it, but you may have to buy a few DLCs to unlock many of the fun weapons, but the weapon packs are rather cheap."
23853,"Fun game, I love playing as a screaming yakuza man mowing down rows of police with a spoon."
23854,good game
23855,this game lets me become my inner Walter White and make meth 100/10 ign

23864,.
23865,"How do people even like this? The AI is terrible, controls are terrible, nearly impossible to die, missions/story line makes no sense. The online multiplayer is slightly better but the police AI is still awful, what a waste of money. Even for a game this old. Would not recommend."
23866,fun
23867,"One of the best heisting games ever to be on steam!

"
23868,"It's Payday 2 - what can I say?

It's held my interest to the extent that I've played it for over 1900 hours.

You can draw your own conclusions from that. :)"
23869,It's a huge blast to play. I'm not exactly a fan of how difficulty works in this game but other than that you have no reason to not pick it up.

23880,Becoming a M249 wielding maniac while mowing down thousands of police is so much fun in this game
23881,"All around amazing game. My only complaint is that the mandatory stealth missions are super unbalanced. There are 2 guards and a camera in every major location and we only get 4 pagers to answer. The guards also have no set patrolling path so you can't memorize their paths in order to avoid them. Their pathing is entirely random. On top of that, the guards are apparently psychic, they have the ability to spot you when you are above and/or behind them. Even with the lowest detection score you can possibly have, you are detected way too easily."
23882,no
23883,"Very fun, you can steal stuff."
23884,good game
23885,this game is a classic.
23886,"i was gifted this by some random guy on discord, im in love with this game now"
23887,"This game has been out for more than 10 years, and I would still say this game is worth the money. It's nice to play with your friends. Either having great teamwork to defeat high difficulty levels or just fooling around with the various weapons. But it's also a great game to play solo."

23943,yes
23944,"Payday 2 is a fun game with friends. It is rewarding if you can sneak through a mission without setting off an alarm. If that sounds boring, you can go guns blazing in the loud missions. There is something for everyone. Even though it is a great game, it has cons such as AFK hosts, instant kicks, and bad ai (stuck guards, team bots can't save you in certain areas, and weird movement overall). Guards walk backwards, walk over doors, and desks. Sometimes you can even experience the black screen of death. Still it is very addicting and worth checking out."

24075,"Payday 2 is a very fun horde shooter. It has many different things about it and that's the fact you rob places for money and its nice to have an objective and the objectives you have to protect and make sure they are not disturbed from your enemies. The enemies are very unique as well we have the standard cops they show up to get the main event started, next is the swat member there are two versions a normal and a ""tougher version"" of a swat member, then we have the cloaker they are basically a ninja that will beat you to the ground, call you names, put dirt in your eyes, and put lemons in your wounds, The next is a shield its basically a wall that can fall with explosive rounds but you can just shield surf over them, The medic is exactly what it sounds like, The Dozer is a wall that can and will chew you up, they are basically menace and good at taking the payday gang out unless you hit his face, The last one is the taser he shoots you with a stun gun and makes you shoot like a bat out of hell and you have to hit him before you run out. But overall I'd give payday 2 a 10/10 fun gameplay, good music, good dlc, and great dlc and the missions are fun are amazing"
24076,"This is a great game, which at its core is a horde shooter, and is a great one at that. It may seem like a serious game at first, but the absurd amount of absurd things that the player can do in this game makes it even more enjoyable. I sure do love taking out law enforcement with a comically large spoon of gold."

24142,"Payday 2. A timeless classic, With the third one in the works let's talk about this iconic shooter. Since launching in 2013 payday 2 went from four heisters to plenty of them. Including a few big crossovers like John Wick from the franchise of the same name to Jacket of Hotline Miami and sigh... h3h3 productions...The weakest crossover of the game personally. I have the important DLC like the biker pack with ron perlman did i mention that these madlads got RON PERLMAN? the console ports are abandoned, though but who can blame them? 

But with all that the game feels great to play I tried the VR stuff for it it can get motion sickening at times, I can deal with it though. Like russian badger said... Getting choke slammed for money is what you want i can give payday 2 a chance."
24143,This is game is a blast with friends! So many hours of fun to be had and so much content.  The developers really care about their game.  Can't wait for Payday 3!

24263,"In real life, few people sympathize with robbers, assailants, bandits, and other social factors that make a living by robbing the population and nation of material value.
Many modern first-person shooters focus on collaborative passages-such games are especially popular on Steam game services.
Payday 2 deals with the same theme as the first part. Four friends, known as Dallas, Hoxton, Chain, and Wolf, take on criminal missions of varying difficulty."

I just despize that the total cost for DLCs is 164€, like you dowloaded ALL the content when you got the game but you have to pay real money to use it :(

I decided to buy it then, I have not regretted that at all, its an awesome game, solo sucks cause the NPC's are simplistic and not very bright at all. but mods fixed that problem.

24483,"Things i liked:
-very in-depth customization system
-gameplay loop
-voice acting
-the dev team that actually listens

Things i didn't like:
-repetitiveness
-very complicated story
-graphics
-the amount of dlc

I would give this game a 7.5/10. I love payday 2 a lot however I can't say it's perfect. The graphics haven't aged the best. They weren't the best looking even in 2013. There is a lot of dlc which is a bad thing to some people. Personally I'm fine with the dlc because they're fairly priced and you actually get content from the dlc packs. The amount of dlc can be overwhelming to a new player. Also after awhile the game becomes very repetitive. The one thing that you can do to make the game fun is just play with friends. Playing with friends can make any experience fun. Even if you don't have friends I suggest you to get this game. It becomes extremely low priced for almost every sale."

24515,VERY GOoD AND FAN
24516,"Its fun though, it takes a bit to download,"
24517,"Even without any dlc this game is amazing. It's alone in its theme and style in that few if any other games revolve around this kind of heist setting.
If you like stealth games the stealth missions in this are good for you. They're like puzzles, with many different variables and features unique to payday, and working through those missions will scratch the itch of a player who wants likes strategy, puzzles, or stealth in games.
The ""loud"" violent heists are a classic shoot-em-up with many different enemies to fight and a great many weapons with which to fight them. It is a lot of silly and exciting fun to play through the chaos of a high-difficulty loud mission.
This game has coop for up to 4 people, and if you can't get your friends together for a heist the single-player ai companions are quite nice. You can have serious, well planned-out, heists with up to 4 friends simulating your heist and going through the stealth and strategy together. It tests communcation and can be a lot of fun for anyone looking for that experience. If you want a silly and exciting mess to jump into with friends you can do that too, and have a heck of a lot of fun with friends.
The npc teammates don't annoy or get in the way like so many other game's ai companions, and they won't ruin your stealth playthrough because they'll purposefully stay outside and simply blend in. The game does a good job of informing you of this subtly and in context with the setting and the characters kindly stay out of your way but will cover you if you get caught.
In summary: the game is amazing, can be played single-player without losing its value or can be played with up to 3 other friends, and it provides wonderfully for anyone looking for stealth, puzzles, strategy, or just a test of mechanical skill and a chance at chaotic fun."
24518,It would be way funner if you could actually play payday 2 with friends on any console.

24529,If you like playing Stealth/Rush games this one is for you. The possibilities that are in the game and achievements are amazing! There is also so much different guns and perks/skills you can get. One final thing that is kinda stupid is that there is so much DLCs that cost a few bucks.

24542,good game
24543,The game is well worth it especialy if you get it on a discount. The only drawback is that like 80-85% of the guns/characters/equipment are DLC locked and so are many of the heists. 8/10 The game is worth it but the DLCs are a little bit too much.

24560,haha cloaker goes WULULULULULULU
24561,"very nice, would recommend this"
24562,stupidly fun with friends. fun without but best experience with a few close friends
24563,"Ohh man. There is loads of reasons this is one of my best favorite games . Hats off to starbreeze.
First of all one of the things what made this game one of my favorites is the language. 
The rude rough funny as heck and though meanings comments and speech made by the characters and the big variety of them that still suprises me when i hear something new said from a character i played alot alongside is wery cool, same goes for the cops i think i heard it all then comes a new comment lol, some of the funniest stuff i have ever heard and encountered in a pc game in that aspect i have never experianced anything like it and that factor alone goes along way adding to gameplay . Its worth adding more of it 200% and there is room for it and it does alot.
The gameplay is wery smooth even for weaker computers graphics is simple and nice. Appriciated when you run in a replica of scarface house and a copy of the desk in the movie and the jacuzzi with the bed hes wife was laying on. Lol stuff like this gives this a edge and well known enviroments can still be added from movies and its wery nice to see.  I Do miss some more objects that can be destroyed with weopons so when i see bottles i shoot them theres no shortage of windows that break though.
This gameplay is so basic that this game can be addapted and expanded in a million ways. I Joked to my friend the other day and said hey man imagine gta payday lol. The missions that have a more military campain with more open areas and other enviroments than only square building heists like smaller banks if it isnt the big banks with some space to run in is a nice diversity and such scenarios can easily be made to diversify gameplay even more by adding things like manual turrets trenches covers etc abit like a battlefield incoperated. It gives you the notion that its just not a ordinary heist.  The Ai is not bad ofcourse ai is allways one of thoose subjects that allways can be worked on, but i think you guys did a pretty good job. Animations are good and fluid and the ragdoll effect is well made. Bugs in this manner like if a enemy is blown up and get stuck to a chandaler hanging down from the roof or enemy that dies in a sitting position with the chin resting on a low walls edge just makes it even better and funnier. Some more effects can be added even if it exists for bloodspread and bulletholes and all the necessary interactions its allways nice with more of them they dont need to be placed all at ones to eat the gpu or cpu but placed in order . The wepons are well made. The skins are nice some sights cover to much screen like a sight in the tailorpack bundle with the crossing border missopn the wepons mods are wery nice indeed and there is alot of them and the wepons can be modded to become wery accurate and higly effective.The shotguns are abit weak and to slow loading a automatic highly destructive one would allways be fun. The deployable devices are really nice you could add a drone to the game for funs sake automatic or manual with protective functions or offensive or for scouting
googles for nightime and xray so you can see enemies behind walls that you also can shoot with a strong enough wepon ad there is some of them thats also pretty nice high tech and modern, the 50 cal sniper is a beast but its damadge level isnt really reflected on everything becouse one shoot should be enough taking into account that a high caliber rifle like that can penetrate a manhole lid with right ammo .
Prices are pretty low on most Dlc and that is wery good. Becouse a game is just as good as the brand is well known and its better to be cheap and gain many players and get a strong well known brand than be greedy , In long term that is a winning concept. I dont play this game much for graphics egen if there is some pretty nice scenarios but i play it for gameplay. And in that regard starbreeze has done a pretty good job.
Iam totally satisfied and if you dont like the game becouse its to simple looking you must either be deaf or have a wery bad sence of humor becouse the speech in this game i hilarious and it is therefore more close to real life due to its not politically correct than most things ive seen. That was a brave and innovative move by the developers abit groundbreaking and a good decision. Even if i heard some funny stuff in Gta nothing comes close. 
If you havent playes this game and you arent a snowflake i suggest you try it atleast.
Another thing i appriciate alot is that there is no rivalry amongst players .
Becouse you will be playing against bots trough teamwork with teamates that is a wery wery nice feuture so there is no intresst of conflicts between players, thats something ive seen to often in other games. 
The modulators that can be added to change gameplay like abduction enemies split into 2 or explode when they die is also a wery good and clever idea to prolong gameplay longlastibility diversity, a couple of more or this ones just in the right manner can change the gameplay totally and could be combined with bonuses for enemies killed in numbers or in certain ways becouse some people want to play just for the shooting fun aswell. A New enemy character ? I think the game has a pretty good number of different enemy types but ofcourse there is allways room for something different like Granadier Rpg or wallbreakers that use c4 to breach a wall to suprise you. Miss the element of smoke granades but they are not that important becouse its mainly used to storm snipers and blind them at the same time with a flash and the snipers in the game can be taken out anyway. So that was a good thing becouse i hate games with to hard snipers that you cannot storm or take down and you miss the tools for it. A motorcycle police is still missing in the game. Taking down a armoured turrent truck and even better 2 or 3 of them with a rocket launcher would be nice. The cars level of destruction could be worked on it does alot to a scen after a battle if you see uther destruction afterwards becouse the level of shootings in this game beats the hell of anything i played its obvious when you change the avanced graphics body count settings to ultra lol ohhh man you guys are the best but it would be nice if there would be some more impact destruction on the enviroment after a battle, cars expecially its allways one of thoose things you allways expect to be able to destroy alot for added realism , i know it can be hard to keep a game balanced and its obvious that the developers want everyone to enjoy this game even poorer people with weaker computers its reflected in the prices aswell as the game and i have respect for the developers for thinking about this. But also remember that destruction can be added in parts it does not all need to happen at once. I Said to my friend put yourself into the mind of the developers. This guys are groundbreaking keep it up with the straight forward no bs attitude i love it. I Allways try to play a games that has a element of uniqueness in it and this one has it not only the things i mentioned above but how many games do you find that is a pure heist game?
And when did you last time see a ninja cop that jumps you with a baton and shouts stop resisting while beating the crap out of you. 
Also there is a sence of realism in this game that stands out abit missionwise. Rigging elections political misssions corruption and rigging drugs at politicians homes are wery down to earth and realistic things that most games never have even mentioned but yours do and definatly a thumbs up for that. Beeing intense drives a action game and with different levels you can customize resulting in different amount of enemies and kinds of them definatly makes it intense love the chaos. Sometimes you dont want the missions to end and that is a good sign. 
This game has all the elements to be keept alive for a wery long time and becouse it has lots of room for expansion and adding so many things that can make the gameplay last."

24604,you haven't lived until you've committed several atrocities robbing a first world bank' - Sun Tzu
24605,Great game!
24606,boring af
24607,I tried this in real life and it worked :D
24608,"Payday 2 is... Kind of weird when you look at it from a genre standpoint; it's a 4-player co-op horde shooter with RPG-like skills in the form of the skill trees, and classes in the form of perk decks. That said, it [i]really[/i] works well; most skills feel very impactful to the gameplay, and the perk decks can [i]radically[/i] alter your playstyle. Combine this with a dizzying roster of weapons to choose from, [i]and[/i] the extensive modifications you can make to those weapons, and you have an almost limitless potential for all sorts of crazy builds. It's a real tinkerer's paradise, and it's glorious--sometimes I'll even spend hours on end just building, labbing out, and tweaking different builds.

Of course, the gunplay is also excellent; almost every gun in the game feels visceral and satisfying to use--wouldn't be much point to any of this if that wasn't the case. General gameplay is... Well, it used to not be so much about sheer volume of enemies, but now you will probably scratch your head at how the DC Metropolitan Police Department has managed to apparently enlist the entire population of Maryland to throw at you. That said, it's still a fun time, and turning the heat up with Death Wish difficulty can give you a real challenge. Death Sentence on the other hand is... Decidedly less fun.

Payday 2 has definitely suffered in accessibility from having 8 years' worth of DLC, but thankfully, there is the Legacy Collection which will singlehandedly get you up to speed on all the DLC that was released, up until 2017. Anything after that you still have to buy separately, but [url=https://youtu.be/lyPNFvtcWRA]given the absolute wild ride that Overkill and Starbreeze went on circa 2015-2017[/url], they really do need the money, and I think it's worth supporting them, given their sheer perseverance through it all.

But yeah, overall, Payday 2 is another one of those ""essential multiplayer games"" that everyone should have on Steam. Get it, and get it for your friends too, and [i]definitely[/i] buy the Legacy Collection whenever it goes on sale. It's all worth every penny."

24621,"Very good game, worth 12 dollars even though I bought it while the halloween sale was happening"
24622,yes :D
24623,Very good game. But comes at a price of a hefty addiction to crime.
24624,soundtrack slaps
24625,very fun game i very do the reccomending
24626,I brought this game for £2 because it was on sale celebrating its 10 year anniversary. Money definitely well spent! Payday 2 is an awesome first person shooter with probably the most coolest DLCs I've ever seen. What makes stealth in this game so great is that focus is key to passing the stealth missions. The character customisation is just fantastic and the countless amount of masks are amazing. I absolutely would recommend this game to those who haven't played yet

24646,"It's such a great game, the more you get into it the bigger fun it is. I like stealth mission in particular since they're always something else than just shooting and securing something. But need patience and focus. The game gets even better with friends that play with you, giving a completely different atmosphere.

There's so much achievements tho that it's confusing, to get some you need the dlcs and some others are very specific. Surely pretty hard to achieve them all.
I think everyone knows this game by now and yea, for the 1€ price it's a damn good deal."
24647,"I remember playing this game back in 2013, good times"
24648,I was payed $50 to play this game.

24653,po
24654,No game until this moment has taken my breath as much as Payday 2 stealth missions.
24655,"Ommm this hard i say anything about this game but i can say something, if you don't have time for playing this game, please don't buy, because lot missions needs lot time, example: 30 min - 1 hour or more... Yeah and this game is so hard, don't think if you be level 100 (Max) you can do anything, its not you need to get infamy with level 100 and 200M Offer... money, if you do infamy anything will be delete, like your level, 100===>Infamy===>Level 0, Skill points===>Infamy===>I think 0 or 1.
I mean is infamy is not if you do infamy you will be god, no no no, if you want be a pro, you need do 100 Infamy, and you be level 100, and be good in a perk.
Needs to say anything in this game (Not really anything, i mean is lot things) is DLC and my friend said in this game if you want buy all DLCs you must pay +$100, but i remember this game is very very very very very good, its so role play, and remember its best role play game in robbery.
And remember if you don't have time don't play, because you will deliver all bags (Example: 45 Bag I mean is lot bags) in 1 hour and 30 min, then you will die with fall damage in bad location (Sometimes, your teammate (Bots) can't come in that locations) and you will lost!!!!! When you can escape with full bag and lot moneys!!!!!!!
But still i will say this game is best game i played.

(Edited on 6/25/2022)
Hello everyone!!! Thanks for reading, my review was on almost 200 hour but now it is 737 hour, now i have 20 infamy, and i can say i love this game more, infamy don't give you anything its just a work will make you to play more and fix your problems and learn the game better, i always when do infamy will be so sad, because i just lose my level, but guys i can say however maybe lot people hate infamy, but now i can say its really funny because it make you pro without you even feel or understand it!!! OVERKILL You are so smart!!! Guys just play and have some fun with your friends and find people from your country to play with them more, and be friend with them, you can do it guys, and when you guys was alone like me and i know and i can understand you its so sad, try to get achievements until you find some friends however from your country or just talk with them english, or just get achievements until your friends be online, good luck, have fun guys!!!"

24690,Very entertaining. I bought this game 2 days ago and I am already addicted. The only issue I see with this game is the overwhelming amount of DLC... Most of the base-game content gets boring after a bit and you will eventually have to buy some DLC weapons to keep the game from being boring. Still an absolutely amazing title and I'm excited for PayDay 3 and what it will offer on its eventual release.

24728,I know how to cook meth now
24729,This game reminds me of how broke i am
24730,"[h1] Played first few days and i can tell.. [/h1]
[olist]
 [*] I´ve been surprised how simple is run through all enemies. Normal and Hard option is really like that, possible to do rambo style etc.. But then you realize later with higher difficulty -  Loud way isn´t the best or even fastest option.
 [*] Great to play atleast in 2 friends, and fun is scalling with another one!
 [*] Do the tutorials and career missions so You understand basic mechanics and options of approaching. 
 [*] You´ll get another skill tree list at lvl 50. So till that time you have to change all skills outside of heist prep. Have that on mind! Same with perks... I dont se option to restart a get your points back, so i put all in to the hitman. But some heist demands rambo style, and me with akimbo pistols, reaveal chance 3 and light vest is not the best option now! 
 [*] PC req are really acceptable, no problems to play on classic office NTBs so all your friends can play with you!
 [*] As some people said, its a really DLC simulator, but just wait, i got some Legacy pack around 11 Euros, which is nice i believe, thinking I will finish collection, because only Party leader have to own the DLCs, while others just connect and can play with him! Thats good!  
 [*]Hope this helps to decide zou to buy or not.  Newbies like I am, if you want to play with me, feel free to add me  ;)"

24747,"This game is fun with friends. Very fun with friends. Lots of random stuff can happen. however, i really can't recommend this game. There's WAY too much waiting around for doors to get drilled or computers to get hacked, and because of this the game gets repetitive way too fast. There's also the problem of the truckloads of DLC in this game. And it's not just a costume or a mask, it's a heap of content locked behind even more paywalls. It's a very solid game, but too much waiting and way too much DLC for a game that already costs money."

I true gem among games. It its still shining bright after all these years. Sure, the graphics arent the newest but there still great and it allows more payability on lower end devices. And the gameplay and characters are just great. Great customization and varitey. And the best part? its only 15 bucks! The only downside is there are a lot of DLC`s, but they have frequent sales so its fine if you wanna take your payday 2 experinace even further!

P.S. I live in Australia so its 15 dollers for me. Its about 10 bucks in USD im pretty sure. 

Also it has a Jobama Mask."

But you blast the face off his partner with your shotgun and he gets shits his pants and just gives up for bit. You destroy your prey, and like the doom slayer you draw power from your fallen foe. You then continue beating human sized cops to death with your large spoon. 10/10"

Additionally, client settings aren't verified so what's the point of even trying to be legit. DLC has gotten out of control once again! All they had to do was improve the AI, /smh..."

But all memes aside about my addiction. Game is great if you don't count certain people kicking you out of low level diffs lobbies because u are a new player of course.. But as my hours show at this moment I am really enjoying PayDay2 trying to do stealth solo or with other new players slowly figuring out what to do for the next step or just going in like Rambo is a lot of fun and it's just the beginning, the more I play more enjoyment I get. I recommend this game to anyone who likes to hide to not alert the guards, finding clues,  escaping without letting anyone to know, etc. or going in and shooting how much u want while doing side stuff to get rewards.

Ps.I am not addicted."

Much like any other complete rando on the internet, my bias when reviewing games shows big time. For the first one to three days when I originally got this game, I was hooked. I was hella hyped to just play with a good online friend of mine and share some memories. But then in came a game franchise I've known since the early 2010's and boom, down goes the ship of motivation. I still did have one-off experiences here and there but when looking at my limited history behind playing this game, the downshift is obvious.
Outside of that, I really don't know enough about the game's lore or culture, so it's hard to say anything outside of it being a great experience for when you want to attempt friend group cooperation and end up screaming down one another's throats for not sticking to the objective and repeatedly dying to a clutch chokepoint that has half of the entire mission's wave waiting for your squad's lowest rank to get their ass capped.
11/10 because we got to see Gus Fring at his part-time job as a dentist."

24970,"This game is soooo underrated

Pros:
- Very great heists like Bank Heist and First World Bank.
- Cool customizing weapons, armor and characters like my favorite colors.
- Obviously awesome soundtracks.
- Surprisingly overpowered like deck perks and special enemies.
- Teammates must be great in their job.
- It's fun.

However, sometimes I really don't feel like I get it but I'm not sure, cons:
- A problem is disconnecting from unfortunate lobbies in a coop, I see 200+ times.
- This is really the toxic community I think.
- Cheaters unintentionally.
- Unfortunately got kicked or banned for no reason.
- How about dlcs, shame about one of them. How about Scarface DLC?
- Unintentionally crashed after restarting any heists 3-4 times.
- Useless AI bots.

Anyway I wanted to rate it 4.5/5 stars though!"

24975,"as most people already know, the best way to play this game is with DLC's and mods, other than that ill say that this game has a lot of really good stuff and a lot of bad shit. Be careful what maps you play and try to make friends and this game is easily worth the sale price + legacy edition

Edit: this game straight up broke for me, i cant play it anymore, whenever i try to run it the game just crashes. i have no mods and the files are correct so idk man. It sucks that i cant play it anymore but hey, its still good."

I now crave death with the amount of stealth I have done. BUY. SPEND. GET DLC. 
Guys, the thermal drill, go get it

24980,This is the only game I know of where you can beat the shit out of people with a massive spoon of gold that lights people on fire. Enough said.

literally the best multiplayer experience you could have."
24984,Good game.
24985,gun and bank and mask and second gun and hoxton and john wicked
24986,"If anyone else played this originally on console when it first came out like me, this feels like a new game. This feels like the game i should have had when i bought it the first time. Its is certainly repetitive but if you like unlocking things and achievement hunting, its worth the couple bucks."
24987,fun game
24988,"Great game.

Now I can't sleep in peace because of cloakers."

24998,Good game
24999,"Amazing game, gunplay is very well done. The reloads are 7.5/10 but they aren't the focus so it's fine. You can sink thousands of hours into this game with all of the builds and possibilities for strategies. At it's core, it's a game about stealing shit and killing people, but it's become so much more than that with its story and personality. I 100% recommend PAYDAY 2 to anyone looking for a rewarding game with tons of replay value."
25000,It's very fun and engaging even though its like years old. I would recommend playing it.
25001,"good game cause i said so.
"
25002,This game is awesome and i recommend this game to anyone that likes fps games!!!!!
25003,"you can drown your pain in alcohol while you beat a cop to death with a wad of cash as you lament why Bain got a piece of shit drill for an elite heist.

if you unsure buying this i recommend you to play the roblox version called ""notoriety"" first before buying this"

25006,played this for one day and im hooked!
25007,i think best da fps game :D:D:DD
25008,Very epic game 100% worth the 10 bucks
25009,"A very well-done coop shooter with cool mechanics and level design. A problem is that the base game has ONLY TWO playable female characters. If it wasn't by that, I would say that this game is the best choice between coop heist games."
25010,nice
25011,Don't you hate it when cop #93485375983759746 shoots you in the face? He always seems to get me in custody.
25012,"It's really fun game, you can do funny stuffs and play with your friends, do some heist it could be Loud or Stealth it's your choice and decisions. 
SO FUN and there's a lot of perks and skills to have, lots of guns and lots of heists
pretty cool right?
i recommend this game because it's fun and why not try it :)"

25023,"this game is fun, even tho it says i played it for 64.6 hours, I've played for an additional 77.6 hours on xbox, i love this game. the only thing that you could nail this game on is being a dlc sim, but just get the legacy pack, then just buy the heist and the weapon packs, and anything else you see and like oh i want that"
25024,i am going fucking insane

Offline mode is fun too, put your skills to the test, and learn the maps, there are many maps to play BTW.

[b]ºWeaponsº[/b] There are many weapons to choose from, customization's good, the RPG  element they implemented, it's not pay to win because it's not PvP.

[b]ºGameplayº[/b] is good and fluid.

[b]ºServer lag and graphic optimizationº[/b] The graphics are good, they haven't aged badly, the lag of the servers does not exist, I never had a problem with internet lag aswell."

I didn't even know how good the modding was and being able to play with other people is amazing. There still are some problems like how its engine isn't great and the graphics aren't either, but its about the enjoyment. There's nothing more that i like than robbing banks with strangers :)"

The ""heist"" theme seems to suggest that there is some kind of Oceans-11 style nuance to the game, but there isn't in any way.  Blast baddies, run to the next highlighted objective while blasting baddies, push the controller button that it tells you to push, blast more baddies, run to the next objective, rinse, repeat ad infinitum.  Probably a good game for someone who likes the tap-tap-tap mobile games.  I don't."

25104,3 years of this game how long must i suffer
25105,"Amazing game with a great community of passionate players. It has an amazing Modding community too, with unique and cool mods being made each day 
The game does still have a lot of bugs / issues that haven't been addressed by overkill in years, however, the awesome community has made mods to fix most of these issues. 
There is zero anti-cheat present, and while it is a PvE game, you will find some people sad enough to cheat in this. Luckily, it's pretty rare, and since you can check what mods people are using in the Player List menu option, you can easily kick or ban these players from joining your session. 
Regardless of the bugs, it's still a great game and has been my favourite game for multiple years.  10/10."

25121,"PAYDAY 2 is a game about 4 men (or women) wearing funny masks, wielding a 1300th era longbow and a pistol-looking shotgun with a comicaly large suppressor, quietly robbing a variety of different places, guarded by people with eyes on their backs, such as:
A bank
A bank, but big
A bank, but with gold
A bank, but with cash
A warehouse, [spoiler] containing nuclear warheads [/spoiler] 

But... what if you don't like being a ninja(with a longbow)?
What if you want to blow up hordes of [strike] zombies [/strike] cops?
What if you like being kicked in the balls by a man with NVGs wearing black clothes?

Well then, the [b] Loud [/b] and [b] Fun [/b] approach is for you!
Get your RPG and minigun ready
Put on your heavy armour
And start blasting those Dozers
(just don't get kicked in the balls)
And, most importantly...
Don't forget your comicaly large spoon to beat up the cops with.

All in all, 10 out of 10 game, please make less paid DLCs and more free updates next time around."

25149,"Best thief simulator ever. Buy it, it won't disappoint you."
25150,"The pros of this game are:
[list]
[*] Customization - You can customize your perks and weapons freely, depending on situation of the gameplay.
[*] PvE focused - This game has Paid DLC which unlocks the weapons and characters, or perks, however this game only includes PvE and not PvP. So even if you don't own DLC, you can still play without any difficulty issues. (That means Pay 2 Win does not affect the gameplay even if you have all teammates with no DLCs)
[*] Mod friendly - Overkill officially allows people to use mods freely, unlike other online games.
[*] Beautiful Graphics - Even this game is released on 2013, it has awesome graphics.
[/list]

The cons of this game are:
[list]
[*] DLC - I understand that developers needs money. But Paid DLC is somewhat excessive. It would be better if developers keep Paid DLC to minimal.
[*] Not really Mod friendly (Interface thingy) - Supporting mods are great decision, but there is no specific interface about mods (For example L4D2 has it's own interface named 'Add-ons' to allow downloading mods easily), even there is no official guide about installing mods, which makes hard for people who wish to install mods.
[*] Lack of Multi-platform support - This game only supports Windows and Linux, but not macOS. Even this game works better on Windows, and it has less optimization on Linux, which makes game stuttering on some places.
[/list]

Even there is some problems, this game is really awesome Co-op game. It is recommended to play with more players."

25154,"Payday 2 is an interesting game with some rather flat game play loop and you know what I am fine with that, the only thing I can really say is that the massive amount of content locked behind a pay wall is rather disappointing and is the main problem that brings the game down, which is ignoring the rather bullet sponge of a.i targets and funky movement system, however I would say this game is worth it on a sale as the dlc on average drops down with it and the base game is rather dull without it."

25170,"I bought the ultimate edition which promised all future content for free, but Starbreeze broke their promise (again, see Microtransactions) and charged everyone for new DLC despite that. I get they want to use the money to keep creating content, but after the promise I was never going to pay for more DLC anyway. Shame they announced they weren't honoring their word instead of giving customers the choice.

I can't bring myself to open it and replay old content because it's tarnished by the knowledge I paid for content I have no access to.

Game's ok; harder modes tend to be more grindy as enemies have insane health and do insane damage as opposed to changing up much. Makes stealth in harder modes ideal when possible."

Played it on the ps4 since 2016, and moving from console to PC there is a bunch of extra content for me discover.
This game has badass soundtracks that I would listen to outside of the game.
The gameplay is pretty immersive and is a guaranteed fun experience, especially if you bring a friend or two.
For a game that seems to be ""old"", it still has a good portion of active community members, so finding lobbies are almost never an issue."

Payday 2 for me has given me many hours of entertainment. Enjoyed solo or with friends, I could play this game for hours on end. Sure, it can be rage inducing every now and again but it does not mean it is a bad game. However, there is one thing that really ticks me off. That thing is a broken promise. Let me paint for you the canvas for this problem. Imagine you are young again, maybe 10 years of age. Your friend who you really trust has promised that he would let you go on his bike for as long as you wanted the next time you see him. However, after that day you did not see your friend for a while. You eventually managed to meet them on the street, but before you could catch up to him he just speeds past on his bike. 

The same thing applies for Payday2. When they first released the ultimate edition of the game, they promised that any upcoming DLCs would be given to players who bought ultimate edition for free. However, after pretty much abandoning the game to go work on their ""walking dead"" game, they faced bankruptcy. All because of  legal problems within the company. Now, they announced the end of Payday 2 and even created a whole ending easter egg for the game. But then they came back and just began making dlc's again. We don't want dlcs, we wanted the company to create payday 3 for a long time and only just now are they beginning to open their ears to the community. I just don't think that its right for you to make a promise only for you to not be able to keep it. Let alone abandon the game that made you guys famous to go do something else, and then come back to it when you failed. That is just disgraceful and truly breaks my heart to see that this is your attitude towards the game that you so called put your heart and soul in. While I recommend the game, my feelings towards it and the overkill will never truly be the same."

25244,"Methamphetamine[note 1] (contracted from N-methylamphetamine) is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity.[17] Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine.[note 2] Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical substance, the racemic free base, which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms. It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy such as Adderall and Vyvanse. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine.

Both racemic methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use. The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia and Oceania, and in the United States, where racemic methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances. Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States.[note 3] Internationally, the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries, due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug, racemic methamphetamine is illicitly produced more often due to the relative ease of synthesis and regulatory limits of chemical precursor availability.

In low to moderate doses, methamphetamine can elevate mood, increase alertness, concentration and energy in fatigued individuals, reduce appetite, and promote weight loss. At very high doses, it can induce psychosis, breakdown of skeletal muscle, seizures and bleeding in the brain. Chronic high-dose use can precipitate unpredictable and rapid mood swings, stimulant psychosis (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, delirium, and delusions) and violent behavior. Recreationally, methamphetamine's ability to increase energy has been reported to lift mood and increase sexual desire to such an extent that users are able to engage in sexual activity continuously for several days while binging the drug.[21] Methamphetamine is known to possess a high addiction liability (i.e., a high likelihood that long-term or high dose use will lead to compulsive drug use) and high dependence liability (i.e. a high likelihood that withdrawal symptoms will occur when methamphetamine use ceases). Withdrawal from methamphetamine after heavy use may lead to a post-acute-withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period. Methamphetamine is neurotoxic to human midbrain dopaminergic neurons at high doses. Methamphetamine has been shown to have a higher affinity and, as a result, higher toxicity toward serotonergic neurons than amphetamine.[22][23] Methamphetamine neurotoxicity causes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in grey matter volume in several brain regions, as well as adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.[23]

Methamphetamine belongs to the substituted phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine chemical classes. It is related to the other dimethylphenethylamines as a positional isomer of these compounds, which share the common chemical formula C10H15N.

Medical

Desoxyn (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride) 100 tablets.
In the United States, methamphetamine hydrochloride, under the trade name Desoxyn, has been approved by the FDA for treating ADHD and obesity in both adults and children;[24][25] however, the FDA also indicates that the limited therapeutic usefulness of methamphetamine should be weighed against the inherent risks associated with its use.[24] Methamphetamine is sometimes prescribed off label for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.[26][27] In the United States, methamphetamine's levorotary form is available in some over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant products.[note 3]

As methamphetamine is associated with a high potential for misuse, the drug is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act and is listed under Schedule II in the United States.[24] Methamphetamine hydrochloride dispensed in the United States is required to include a boxed warning regarding its potential for recreational misuse and addiction liability.[24]

Recreational
See also: Party and play and the Recreational routes of methamphetamine administration
Methamphetamine is often used recreationally for its effects as a potent euphoriant and stimulant as well as aphrodisiac qualities.[28]

According to a National Geographic TV documentary on methamphetamine, an entire subculture known as party and play is based around sexual activity and methamphetamine use.[28] Participants in this subculture, which consists almost entirely of homosexual male methamphetamine users, will typically meet up through internet dating sites and have sex.[28] Due to its strong stimulant and aphrodisiac effects and inhibitory effect on ejaculation, with repeated use, these sexual encounters will sometimes occur continuously for several days on end.[28] The crash following the use of methamphetamine in this manner is very often severe, with marked hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness).[28] The party and play subculture is prevalent in major US cities such as San Francisco and New York City.[28][29]

Contraindications
Methamphetamine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of substance use disorder, heart disease, or severe agitation or anxiety, or in individuals currently experiencing arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or severe hypertension.[24] The FDA states that individuals who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions to other stimulants in the past or are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not take methamphetamine.[24] The FDA also advises individuals with bipolar disorder, depression, elevated blood pressure, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome to monitor their symptoms while taking methamphetamine.[24] Due to the potential for stunted growth, the FDA advises monitoring the height and weight of growing children and adolescents during treatment.[24]

Adverse effects

A 2010 study ranking various illegal and legal drugs based on statements by drug-harm experts. Methamphetamine was found to be the fourth most damaging to society.[30]
Physical
The physical effects of methamphetamine can include loss of appetite, hyperactivity, dilated pupils, flushed skin, excessive sweating, increased movement, dry mouth and teeth grinding (leading to ""meth mouth""), headache, irregular heartbeat (usually as accelerated heartbeat or slowed heartbeat), rapid breathing, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, high body temperature, diarrhea, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, twitching, numbness, tremors, dry skin, acne, and pale appearance.[24][31] Long-term meth users may have sores on their skin;[32][33][34] these may be caused by scratching due to itchiness[33] or the belief that insects are crawling under their skin,[32] and the damage is compounded by poor diet and hygiene.[34] Numerous deaths related to methamphetamine overdoses have been reported.[35][36]

25245,medic bag funny
25246,"I havent played that much but i can see myself playing this game for a while due to how much content there is to do. If you are looking for a linear path to follow than that is really present here you kinda get to do what you want and just level up and get more money.

I find the game insanely fun the guns are all incredibly fun to use and there are LOADS of guns to choose from. The contrast between stealth and loud gameplay is really small in terms of enjoymant. I love playing stealth just as much as I love going loud AND if you fail stealth you can easily transition into loud allowing for a super fun and creative way to do different heists. 

The game also has such a great range of difficulty its great, you can have a super easy time where you are practically god and you can kill everything and everyone or you can make it seem like a simple scratch would kill you. Stealth also isnt the most easy thing to do so is super rewarding when you fully succeed and pull off the perfect heist without anyone knowing you were there.

If you are an achievement hunter well you are going to have a field day with payday 2 there are so many achievements its actually scary. 

I fully recommend the game even at full price for the hours of fun you will get out of it, its by no means flawless but its just so insanely fun the flaws wont bother you as much."

2. Two complete ways of dealing the heist such as stealth where you can be the ultimate ninja you secretly wanting to be a ninja or guns blazing taking on waves of cops as if your rambo.
3. Modding makes the game more fun too requires less step to also get into modding the game.
4. Active community game still getting updates till today.

25357,"It's PAYDAY 2 Fellas!

PAYDAY 2 is a 4 player co-op heisting game and a sequel to the original PAYDAY: The Heist. Letting players commit an incredible crime spree as they rob everything from Money to Gold to Nuclear Bombs. Since it's release in 2013, PAYDAY 2 has been continuously updated after all these years with new content to keep things fresh thanks to the game's infamous use of tons of DLC packs. It's certainly one of the most uniquely structured first person shooters ever in terms of style, personality, and gameplay.

Gameplay of PAYDAY 2 takes a lot from Modern Shooters, With sprinting, iron sights, and a slight focus on cover. However, what makes PAYDAY 2 different from all those generic shooters is practically everything else. Heists either range from simple bank jobs to absolutely ludicrous heists and it doesn't shy away from having some incredible and memorable heists. They often more or less feel like real places that you're robbing either loud with guns-ablazin or stealthy by lurking in the shadows. Gunplay of PAYDAY 2 is pretty much what you'd expect from a modern shooter but the sheer amount of weaponry as well how much fun it is to shred down squadrons of SWAT and it's not boring for how much the enemies and rip you to pieces if you're not careful which helps reduce the game of just mindless shooting. Furthermore you're allowed to choose what kind of armor you have, a multitude of equipment to help you out, Skill and Perk decks to give you game changing special abilities, and insane amounts of melee weapons if bullets just aren't enough. Lastly for gameplay there are a multitude of different difficulties to adjust to how skilled you are and as a reward get more cash in the process.

One HUGE aspect that I adore about PAYDAY 2 is how much of the game is customizable. Starting with weapons, not only can you out fit EVERY single weapon with gadgets, sights, stocks, etc to your liking but thanks to Weapons Colors and Skins from free drops you can customize the appearance to suit your needs. But that pales in comparison to one of the most iconic parts of this game, Your Mask. Not only are there 100+ masks to choose from but nearly infinite ways to customize with materials, patterns and 2 colors to personally craft the perfect mask for you, plus some masks are nods to other games or internet culture. Lastly you also have the ability to customize the skin on your armor similar to Weapons Skins but also have entire full outfits that while not as customizable fit well with PAYDAY 2's theme of customization.

Another thing PAYDAY 2 does extremely well is having a ton of character. While the setting and weapons are undoubtedly kinda generic at times. The characters, from the heisters themselves to even the Police Force have that extra characterization that prevents them from being generic cops and robbers. For Example, a majority of the Heisters come from different countries making each heister unique in both personality and how they sound, like Dallas' signature ""Medic Bag"" lines or Sydney's Australian chaotic-ness. Each one brings something new and doesn't feel like a carbon copy of each other. Like before even the Police have this sense of character, mainly with the special units, such as the Cloaker or Bulldozer with their constant taunts and chatter. This even seeps into their variations in different countries or other factions. Even your mission guides have a ton of character from the iconic Bain, to the Russian Vlad, the mysterious Dentist and many more.

Of course I couldn't make a PAYDAY 2 review without talking about the absolute fantastic OST. Simon Vikland not only voices Bain and the Cloaker but also composed the majority of this game's stellar soundtrack and with his spiritual successors carrying that touch of having some outstanding tunes. I feel the reason why PAYDAY 2's soundtrack is so well regarded is that while it often does the electronic, loud music it's never too shy to try other genres and make them work so well. Some tracks include Jazzy instruments, others completely with classic guitars and drums, some with inspiration from outside culture such as Mexico, others go for a grand musical style with Opera singers, one straight up makes it's own 80s-like song complete with lyrics and there is even Badass Clown Music! PAYDAY 2 wouldn't be the same without it's incredible soundtrack.

Overall, PAYDAY 2 is a great time, either going alone or going with a squad, it excels to continuously being fun while repeating gameplay which boosts it's replay ability. Furthermore as of this review, PAYDAY 2 is still being updated so it's never shy of having new content to be played. Really the only truly bad thing I can think off is how poor the driving controls are which is ironic since this game runs on the Diesel Engine, a Engine made for driving games. With PAYDAY 3 hitting stores in a few years I can't wait to see what our favorite band of heisters will get up too soon!"

Genuinely this game is good even though I have a really shitty computer."
25360,"The game is fun, there are a lot of posibilities in this game.
This is a must have if you like shooters and robbing things.

The only problem with this game is is a huge part of the community, don't get me wrong a lot of users/heisters are nice and are forgiving for you'r mistakes and are willing to help, but most of the time you get kicked for making one mistake and perhaps getting insulted along with it.
So if you can handle that (unlike me, who dove into this game without getting a brief look at toxic people of this game) be sure to buy it"

I've owned this game for a relatively short time compared to other games in my library but that has not stopped my from getting completely addicted to it. If you ever want a game that you can just load up to kill time then payday is that game. If you ever want a game that you can get lost in for hours then payday is that game. I can see it appealing to many different groups of people and I'm sure those people would all enjoy this game. Definitely recommend."

but this game is also perfrct"
25437,"Unironically one of the most fun shooters I've played this year. It just feels... correct... that's the best way to describe it. If I could have only one game + dlc in my entire library right now i'd pick payday. 

Imo another really fun thing about this game is the MANY ways you can play it, you can be an 800 pound gorilla terrorising cops with an lmg or a ninja throwing skurikens and cutting peoples heads off.

The one bad thing about this game is the amount of dlc it has, the base game just simply does not have many of the cool and interesting things i just described, at least pick up the legacy bundle if you're gonna be getting this game."

25446,"If you're looking for a immersive heist based game, look no further. Payday offers it all from sneaking around, avoiding cameras; setting up turrets, to simply stealing cops and lighting the very world on fire. Worth the price, the DLCs are a bonus allowing for customisation of outfits, masks, weapons, new heists to ignite the world in new ways."

But of course if you want a real challange you can play on nightmare mode, wouldnt recommend this mode with bots tho, just get some mates for that!"

The stealths are very enjoyable with friends, even if it takes all day just to complete one."
25532,"The game is is a ultimate heist game if you thought the heists from gta 5 where fun? 
You gotta try this.The amount of cheap dlc packages maps guns costumes and ways of beating levels is insanse
Speaking of beating levels its like fucking your girl over and over and over again in different ways when you play good levels over and over again wanna go sneaky? sure slap a silencer on your gun play this like its assassins creed.
Wanna go straight in loud af get a damn minigun shoot the place up
I recommend you to play this game with friends cause it will be way more fun faster and better
And please do not sleep on some dlcs like the Scar face one if you like challenges big gun fire and lots of lots of money buy the damn dlc all you need is a kitted out team and boom your good your set up to be the next bezezozozozs 
If your seeing this review i encourage you to buy this game even tho is 10 years old it aged well with a nice community you wouldnt see everywhere like the dudes who give you moral support
In the end its just a well done fun and nice game for letting of steam or to play while being bored.
I hope this review found you well and.

the result will be payday 2 
rob banks,shoot cops,many perks,characters and heists  
every 3 or 4 weeks  ,they make a new dlc of weapons and heist 
btw,if you have money issues or game seems boring ,the mods can makes the game that everyone would enjoy"
25546,"I've never robbed a bank in my (real) life [strike]yet[/strike]. But it was an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.

I installed Payday 2 because it sounded fun to play once in a while and since i got the base game for free ages ago, when they gave away a huge number of copies for it, why not at least try.
I was not ready for it. I started my first heist, and after a few minutes, I couldn't put the game down. The gameplay loop consisting of shooting cops, repairing drills, and stealing all kinds of loot, from toothbrushes to cocaine disguised as christmas presents and just regular gold bars, while trying not to get kicked, tazed, punched or shot. The game offers multiple build options, which are balanced terribly, but can work if you’re good enough. I’ve found myself thinking “this is the last one” or “one more score and I’ll stop” and then I proceed to spend hours upon hours running with bags in different ridiculous masks and gun combinations, like an anime girl wielding an assault rifle equipped with an underbarrel grenade launcher and a rocket launcher secondary, that gains a few seconds of infinite ammunition when using an ammo bag.

The stealth mechanic in this game is amazing and absolutely ridiculous at the same time. You can have a guard 10 meters away staring right at 4 masked heisters with big shotguns who are pointing and yelling different variations of “look out guard”, but because they’re all outside the range nothing is done. This and you can hide behind the thinnest pole, but since the spotting hitbox is in the head if you can’t see their head, they can’t see you.
I know this sound very ridiculous, but in practice it makes stealth amazing.

This is barely scratching the surface of all the content and ridiculous stuff you can do and i didn’t even mention the huge number of mods there are for this game. I highly recommend you at least give this game a try. Most of the games price comes from the huge amount of DLC, which i do recommend getting if you find yourself enjoying the game. It is playable without em, but you’ll be lacking a lot of quality content.
Also Payday 3 is currently in the works, so while waiting for that, why not give this a shot?

Even though its an first-person, stealthable, horde shooter game made on a driving game engine its by far one, if not my favorite game of all time."

25557,i love this game
25558,"This game remains absolutely one of the best games I've ever played! It is a hidden gem from 2013. If you are on the fence about buying it or not, buy it, you wont regret it. Even to this day I make great memories playing this game whether it's with friends, or randoms. Yes it can get a tad boring at times, but that's with all games. It will keep drawing you in and make you want to play more and more and more. Most of the Dlcs and gun packs are worth buying too. 10/10 game."

25586,"A quick review as one of many ADHD players.

This game is pretty cool overall, i never have seen anything like this throughout the years of Gaming on both consoles and PCs.

The game does have alot of issues with textures, bugs and such. But the feel of the game, the story and everything else just overshadows the whole experience which makes this game legendary.

Personally, i have alot of issues of staying in any game for a while because of my ADHD. But this game, even if i do take frequent breaks always brings me back. The progression keeps me pumping and all the options of customisations, skills, perks, different ways of going throughout the heists always makes me stay for a while and keep me going, and always makes me come back to it.

10/10 for the game as a reviewing view
9/10 for people with ADHD who want to try it out. For the only reason that it makes you come back, without having a hyper fixation to the game.

I cannot wait to see what the developers will bring to the payday 3, and i will for sure buy it as well, no matter what, out of respect."

25599,"The drill, go get it."
25600,"Great game, can be repetitive like most games if played for too long but such a large arsenal of guns and everything. it is 100% worth every dollar. the fact that you can ""attempt"" to conceal carry an rpg and a mini gun and the cops only get suspicious when you put on a mask or a pair of sunglasses. they deserve to lose every dollar in that bank."

OVERKILL knows how to treat their community and I always felt at home with them. This is one of the best games I have ever played. The game-play is varied and wonderful, the customization is out of this world, the lore is well put together, and the memes are amazing. 10/10, if you haven't played this game or the ground-breaking Payday: The Heist, do yourself a favor and get it. Can't wait for Payday 3!"

There are so many mechanics to learn but if you are patient they can be understood. Overall, Payday 2 still holds up well for being over eight years old."

25647,"Payday 2 is a great heist game and a great first person shooter, you have different roles in the game, you either choose being a support, an infiltrator or a hitman. You can build up your character has you like, with a skill system, a perk system, and a lot of guns, guns in this game are fun and easy to use, some of them have a bit of recoil but nothing too crazy. The problem i see with this game is that you need some of the dlc to experience a ""Complete"" experience, i feel like the majority of the guns should be non-dlc but they arent, wich makes you buy them even if you purchased the game full priced, i think is not fair, and i now they are cheap, but for a game that is multiplayer and paid, this should not exist. At the end of the day is very fun and requires a nice curb of learning to master, great game!"

25665,"Pay Day 2 is not an ordinary bank heist game , there's so much more to it. It has a great story line , game (stealth) mechanics and  good looking graphics . There are different  variety of guns , accessories for guns ,perks ,skills sets , outfits , masks and missions . It's quite satisfying experience when u finish heists with friends and yes coop is necessary for this. You are not a overpowered character like in gta series.
At first it's too overwhelming understand mechanics but it's easy to master.

25946,"The hours really piled up fast. There are so many fun ways to play that you'll die of old age before you get to play all of them. Just have fun with what you want to play with, don't listen to meta-huggers unless you plan to play on any difficulty higher than mayhem, and don't get mods until you've played every heist. Highly recommend to everyone."

hope you enjoy playing.
Good Luck🌹

26091,"Before I played Payday 2, I had virtually no knowledge of the series.I had played Goat Simulator: Payday, but that was basically it. One day my friend gifted me this game. I played it more and more and eventually got addicted to payday 2 because IT IS MORE ADDICTIVE THAN SUGAR. I have had the game for less than 2 months and at the time of writing this I have 235 hours on the game. Payday 2 is an amazing game with lots of heists to do and literally HUNDREDS of weapons. The gunplay is super fun, even with heavy armour I can still dart across the level and shoot hundreds of police officers with ease, and the skills and perk decks add a lot of variety to the game. I have no complaints except for the escape mechanic, where you have a chance to not successfully escape from whatever heist you were doing and be forced to do a boring mini-level where you have to haul all your loot to a different van, AFTER waiting 3 minutes for it. Not to mention the risk of cops stealing your loot in the escapes when you get more than 4 bags."
26092,I enjoy.
26093,Meh

26103,"the AI is awful, the game barely runs and most of the game is paid DLC 10/10"
26104,"An epic FPS heist game with so much fun its impossible to not like. Every heist has its own unique flavor of action packed combat or satisfyingly sneaky and tense stealth. There is so many guns, skills, charachters, customizations, and gameplay styles to choose from. They aren't all perfectly balanced, but the wide range of difficulties allows for all loadouts to be fun. I would highly recommend this game, as well as the legacy bundle for another world of content. With its frequent sales going to $1-5, buying the game is practically a robbery."
26105,absolute dlc shitshow but i still love it
26106,Heist
26107,fun to play

26149,this game is realy good and its fun to wear idiot masks. tbh masks are the best thing in this game
26150,"The game can be enjoyed,
If we are playing solely with such buddies or friends,
whom we love and play in duo, Trio or Squad,
Alone as a beginner is not recommended if you don't know what you do.
The game works with VR devices if someone has a VR devices.

This is not a game like CSGO or any FPS game,
to kill, steal and ready for the mission,
Here is a very important teamwork,
It is very important to build your character,
How do you disguise yourself not to be striking.

Perk's use and setting also depends on many things,
To what you need for you most, how do you play.

Oh yes, and if you seriously like the game,
almost certain that many DLCs should be purchased,
Because without DLC, the game will only be able to play weak difficulties,
very difficult levels without DLC almost impossible,
Very difficult difficulties at levels without DLC, very forget it.

In which I am sad, There are too many bugs in the game, too much bug :C
In the game, many bugs may occur, crash, black screen, freezes the game,
enemies or corpses that have been stuck in a door or walls.
(mainly then crash the game, If we add auxiliary package as a medication, Ammo or whatever before starting a mission.
Adding MOD files can only be solved by unofficial DLL file from a separate source.

That really bothers me,
that I am Xbox Controller playing,
or mouse + keyboard. If you are playing Xbox Controller, the mouse + keyboard does not work,
If you play a mouse + keyboard, Xbox does not work,
I do not know why you need to disable other peripherals if you want to use a keyboard and mouse instead of Xbox, you need to restart the game to replace a periphery.

I don't play with random players,
I'm just playing only with friends.
(I hate online random players in every game)

In summary, it's a great game,
But as a beginner, it is very difficult, especially if you are playing alone."
26151,i like very much is fun especially with friends
26152,"amazing, i am currently not eating anything as i type this comment"
26153,noice game
26154,it will
26155,Still good as usual.
26156,honestly if you are looking for a game to play with friends or even by yourself i'd go for another game this is just not it i was trying to join a multiplayer heist each time i would join into the lobby i get a message saying lost connection to host and I've tried basically everything i found online to fix the problem and nothing worked there are plenty of other people with the same problem but yet nothing has been done with it and and that's not the only problem the game has bots in career mode on your team don't even help you they just sit there not shooting although they pick you up they still just sit there and watch you die not a game i would recommend to anyone looking to have some fun 0/10

26173,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree.The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.

26195,"Game is fun but i recommend to get the legacy version as without all those DLC there is only a handful of guns and general content.

Personally I don't understand why games do this... why not just increase the game price instead of making it so cheap but reliant on so many DLCs."

26206,Good game
26207,"4/5

I physically cannot say that I don't like this game, undoubtedly the most fun game I've ever played
annoyingly the game is kind of pay to/get the full experience and have the most fun

talking about all the DLCs which are absolutley justified, it's an older game, it's considerably cheap for a game with infinite replayability, and sadly is Overkill's main source of income atm and they need the support

I think with good support Overkill is gonna go far as a Dev team
can't wait for Payday 3 :)"
26208,"Okay to start off with i played this game on 360 years ago and it was fun for a little while but it got old fast, now im playing it in VR and WOW i love it, i just cant get enough. 

The only one complaint i would have is the ""snap turning and not having the ability to change what button turns your body left or right"" how is it im supposed to let go of my movement thumbstick to turn left ????? like WTF am i the only one that has this issue. Have the devs tried it in VR yet??? 

It is horrible not being able to map buttons, PLEASE FIX IT???"

26273,"This game is a lot of fun, Solo and with Friends. It's one of those games where you can take it absolutely seriously or not at all seriously. You can be a serious stealth master sneak thief with impeccable timing and perfectly optimized guns, or you can be a derp with a minigun mowing cops down like you're cutting grass on your lawn. There is no limit to what you can do with Hundreds of Masks, Hundreds of Guns, Hundreds of ways a Heist can go right or wrong, Ragdolls galore, a GODLY soundtrack and a powerful sense of Dynasty Warriors style smiting down hundreds to get to your goal! It does have a few setbacks though. The Paid DLC can be...well in a word, costly. So be sure to have a hole in your wallet if you wanna get everything the game offers. Plus the space this game takes up is horrendous. Not like COD Warzone levels of huge but still it will chew up a hefty amount of storage space on your PC with a, at the time of writing this review, almost 80GB of space. And Death Sentence Difficulty, even when you're Max Level and with the most decked out builds ever, is not for the faint of heart. Stealth Missions can go as smooth as butter or as horrific as doing the mission over 30 times because you either screw up yourself, a camera spots you or that one random guard is like ""Duuur hey what's goin on in here?"" to the point you just go ""FRAG IT!"" and go loud anyway because you're fed up and impatient. Overall, an amazingly fun game and I do recommend it. But just be mindful it isn't a flawless game. It takes hours of playing to even complete it 100%. So you either have to be a God or just an Uber-Masochist to the point Dark Souls is getting jealous. But if you're in it for fun and not completing it, then you bought the right game."

Either I made the lobby or my friends did, nothing worked. We tried public lobbies, but I just kept getting kicked. I've tried everything I could find online: Flush DNS, reinstall, turned off all background running programs, adjusted the in-game network settings, and nothing worked. 

I played this game on the same network with the same group for those 11 hours of fun, but I hate losing everything because of network issues that I don't have on any other game. Until this is fixed, I will not be returning."

26388,"If you enjoy thrashing your hard drive, this game is fantastic."
26389,"the bad
-this game's mechanics really didn't hold up over the years, newer games have much more crisp and satisfying gunplay and movement, the movement is really ""slidey"", i have motion sickness and this triggers it a little bit.
-headbob is pretty insane, i have motion sickness and got sick after a couple minutes of playing, thankfully there are mods that remove that completely. 
-this is a swarm game, i personally find this genre boring(especially when i play solo), especially with so many weak enemies, i prefer a less swarmy game with more tanky enemies.
-the objectives are boring and consists of waiting, and waiting, and waiting plus more waiting.
-really grindy, especially the ""reset your progress to gain a little bit more"" type of progression, so there's not really a ""late game"" content expect playing the hardest difficulty and yet meeting the same types of enemies over and over again.

neutral
-high learning curve, i usually like this in a PvP game, but i usually play coop PvE game to unwind and turn off my brain.
-somewhat elitist community and the modding community is pretty toxic too, but there are just as many opposing them, so try to avoid engaging with any of them.

the good
-so many customization. the skills, perks, classes, weapons are all awesome and impactful.
-pretty much the best game with this theme.
-really cheap on sale.

this game is a 5/10 for me, i'll probably play it if i have friends that play this game, the gunplay and movement is just too much for me to tolerate it and play solo, but if you like the theme and tolerate the gameplay mechanics in this game, it's definitely worth it on sale."

26489,"I obtained Payday2 about half a year ago in behalf of my dear friend. Later on I bought the legacy edition myself on the summer sale.
I put more 600 hours in this game so far. At my first day after some of my friends has teached me the neccesary knowledge about how things works in the game it became much easier, although the game have complicated mechanisms behind the scene...

Payday 2 is always better with friends. Random lobbies most of the time come with hardships. However among the medic/ammo bag eaters new heisting partners also can be found. 

The game offers you 3 types of gameplay; 
- The most common one, LOUD - there are heist that can only be completed in loud.
- Stealth - same as loud, few missions only can be completed while stealthing.
- Death Sentence difficulty with one down activated - a.k.a. cover hugging simulator - a place for psychopats or poor souls trying to get the ""Hardest Difficulty"" achievements :D

Payday 2 offers a variety of playstyles, and a lot of combinations of skills and perks, but most of the players usually sticks to the meta, althought it's entertaining to test your own ideas.
When you hit lvl 100 you are able to reset yourself, which gives you rewards and pernament prestige next to your name - this is where the grining part comes in, but it is not neccesary for enjoyment.

The game is still relevant, it does have an active playerbase. 
It is getting updates frequently, such as, new heists, accesories & cosmetics and of course new wepaons.

(TL:DR)
In general, if you're looking forward to rob some banks with your friends or some random players and have a lot of fun with different variety of weapons and you wanna play with mods and spend quite some money on Downloadable Content, this is for you

(Review)
Now don't get me wrong, PAYDAY2 is amazing.
I've played this game so much and I can say with honesty that this game is a blast if you play with random people, or your friends, sure there's a storyline but, some people would rather just play random heists and have an amazing time. The guns in this game is a pure arsenal with over 100+ and more weapons to choose from (most being DLC weapons), a lot of customization attachments, a lot of masks to choose from and in general 50+ heists to pick from. This game also features mod support which makes this game more enjoyable if you get tired playing the Vanilla PAYDAY 2, trust me there's a lot of mods to choose from once you're done playing PAYDAY 2 by default.

The community from my view is..mixed. I have met tons of great people, but also a lot of negative ones, I really do not understand the reason why people kick you out from the match when you play the game as it should be played, or just because you're a low level in the game. Sure it can be justified to kick low levels but some people are looking forward to this game and to have fun, sure this may not happen all the time but, atleast let the new players enjoy PAYDAY 2.
The worst part about this entire game is the overwhelming DLC's that kept getting released. as of this review date edit (05.11.2021), the entire DLC pack costs over *170,02€*. If you have the money to buy this pack, go ahead no one is stopping you, but if you only want to buy that specific DLC, no ones stopping you there as well. I mostly buy weapon DLC's since I love guns, a lot in this game. But the amount of DLC's getting released in this game makes it feel almost pointless to complete your weapon collection from my side when they keep on releasing more and more content. Some of the DLC's are the same thing, actually. Just that its a different model, with different statistics, and a different price to pay.

Now before saying why am I complaining about DLC's and not shutting up about it, is cause how annoying it gets to actually complete the bundle of DLC's that PD2 has, only to release another DLC. Ultimate Edition/Legacy Collection SHOULD'VE BEEN the last bundle of this entire game. I mean I can understand that the company is currently *kind of* bankrupt and struggling financial support, but it doesn't mean people wont agree the same here.

That's all I can write on this review, if you read this review, thanks a lot for reading, I hope you have a great day and enjoy some PD2!"

26605,it is really very fun if u play it with your friends OwO
26606,"it reminds me of a day long ago where you have a summer breeze going through the air, everything so peaceful, the calm before the storm, and then everything go TERRIBLE, you have to sacrifice everyones lifes for others and your own but atleast you have them right? WRONG, that is a terrible idea because you don't know anybody of the opposite gender besides family but you're not gonna procreate with your own family or the future generations are gonna be inbred dummies, but didnt we all derive from the same two people technically, so we are all inbred humans it seems but somehow we fixed ourselves or we didnt who knows, we could be super dumb compared to the humans of the past, who knows amr"

But after some years and after the Epilogue of the game i was burned out. The game is great, especially with friends. The only thing that can turn you away is that most of the content, as in guns,maps, characters etc. is locked behind dlc. If you don't mind paying a little more -on sales of course- then i recommend you this game."

26630,"Date of Monetary Acquisition 2: Electric Boogaloo is a video game almost as poorly put together as the US government. In your ventures as John Payday and Dallas Cmeddikbehg (the C is silent) you will find yourself slaughtering endless hordes of police and swat officers so eager to die you'd think they ran a cult and the environmental challenges and advantages each heist brings. 

Taking Shillings 2 is rather known for its rocky development to bring it to where it is in today in 2022, but is in a very acceptable state at the least. From the surface the game seems like a mindless PVE horde first person shooter where you and three others construct a bridge out of the flesh and bones of anything in front of you, and to an extent it is, but much more lies just below to entice and engage you. Such things lay waiting in the expansive customization. 

There are 4 different ways to customize and curate your personal experience and affect the experience of those around you. The first facet is the selection of your gear. Your arsenal of anti-governmental tools of justice are the centerpiece of your terror. Pick whichever primary, secondary, throwing weapon, armour, melee and deployable fit your needs and synergize with the aspects of your build. Every individual weapon can also be customized further to fine tune your exact experience. Guns frequently feel good and shooting them feels fun, and there's a gun for every person out there to enjoy. 
The second decision comes in which Perk Deck you would like to own. Perk Decks are permanent, linearly unlocking stat and equipment bonuses that you pick one of and swap out whenever you please. You may have equipped one Perk Deck that allows you to have the highest possible health and passive regeneration, but then swap to another that allows you to hijack nearby enemy's radios and stun them with noise. You preferred Perk Deck generally shapes your gear and skills.
Speaking of skills, the Skill Tree is a wonderful way to upgrade yourself and spec into whatever you desire. You unlock skill points upon leveling up and use them to purchase malleable and interchangeable skills to benefit you and/or your team. Every skill in the tree feels impactful and worth the price. There are no miserable minor stat increases, only things you can feel in gameplay with and without them on. You find yourself weighing out the pros and cons of taking a particular skill over another often, and how that will affect your next match. But do not put any stress on it! At any point in time you may remove your skill and refund your points to spend elsewhere.
The final and arguably most practical customizable and personalized array of options is your thriving fashion. You have masks that you may edit the pattern and colours on to match perfectly with your outfit, and outfits with numerous colour options to suit your mask. You can even add charms and skins to your guns for a more fun and visually interesting homicide. You also have the option to pick from a roster of heisters all with unique dialogue, personality and interactions. Even some crossovers too! (Coke Jimmy my beloved) A man with no style receives no respect in the criminal underworld. Down here, its drip or drown.

The pinnacle of the gameplay being the heists, more well defined as simply missions, are your setting and your reason for bringing an illegal firearm into a peaceful upper-class neighbourhood. With some outliers, many are outfitted well and designed nicely for both loud and stealth (for the chromosome deficient) ways to approach each situation. You are given a set of goals and it is up to you to complete them for yourself. Much of these missions see to you robbing a group or individual and carrying their bags of stolen goods back to your escape vehicle but others have more nuance. Scan superhumans in a russian bunker and return the data to your employers or scavenge cocaine in festive christmas presents falling out of trees. Not often is there a boring objective in Unauthorized Withdrawal 2 Fast 2 Furious. Not many of these missions get boring, either since the objective is never too time consuming or takes your focus from the action, instead usually building upon it. Not to mention layouts of buildings and spawns change every time you do a mission again, and the online multiplayer aspect provides a pretty vast modicum of replayability. 

There's even the added benefit of this game running well on potato PCs. 

Grab your guns, a drink, a friend or two, a medic bag, the Legacy Collection on one of it's frequent sales and get ready to roll.
Because tonight boys, its payday.

But that's just a theory... a game theory."

I decided to bite the bullet and slowly start playing, and this game on PC is so amazing.  The console version feels like a demo after playing the PC version"
26645,"This game is the dumbest game I've ever seen and I love it. There is a gun for you in it, no doubt, from a Minigun to a WW2 SMG to a literal money bundle as a melee weapon, you will find something for you."

26658,"Shoot cop, get rich."
26659,"Payday2 is a fun game to play. There are lots of way to keep it fresh with customization options like the skill tree, perk decks, modifiers and DLC. The game can be as challenging as you would like with six difficulty settings to choose from. The graphics are sharp and the game runs smoothly. Plenty of guns to play with from normal handguns to grenade launchers. I enjoy the using the throwables as well. Rarely does a heist stay the same with a wide variety of mask, costume and weapon selection. Biggest downfall of the game is the lack of committed players. It's tough to find a good group of players willing to take on contracts at the Death Wish and above setting while trying to tackle achievements. Sometimes the movement from the cops is predictable and repetitive. Overall I truly enjoy the four player co-op style game in a first person shooter with heisting!"

26683,"A beautiful game, but technically and graphically outdated. Payday 2 is a simulation of bank robberies, safes and vaults. Play alone with bots or 4 in co-op. Gameplay is to prepare for robbery: the choice of customer, quiet or noisy, the choice of modules and weapons. Then there is the process itself: a lot of shooting and hauling bags. Missions are quite replayable. In different ways change either the maps, or the key, or the person. The game has a kind of storyline, linking a lot of missions, leading to certain consequences. Extensive selection of perks and weapons. Suitable game for anyone, for as much as 6 levels of difficulty. Different unique opponents to counter players. Good music, there is a lot of it and you can always choose for any task."

26695,great game both solo and w friends. it's fairly easy to learn the basics but the skill needed to pass a loud overkill heist keeps you playing. little bit annoying to have the good guns locked behind a dlc paywall but the basic guns should be enough to get you through the game.

You can have a shit ton of fun with your friends too.

tl;dr I have a love-hate relationship with this game.

Note: To all the newbies out there, please start from the lowest difficulty and then work your way up slowly. Also, lower detection risk does NOT mean it's a stealth heist."

This game is an under rated coop heist gem,, i mean not to many games like this that i know of at least its not been overkilled, dug up and grinded down further. Its countless days of missions and levels, in stealth or loud, there's driving in some missions, if your a gun nut your gunna spend a lot of time buying and building guns, masks, characters, up grading skill tress and not just having one you can have multiple skill  trees for different types of ""social work"". Its fresh and and still gets new content and seasonal events and etc. Like fore the money its worth the full collections pack, BUT it does take a lot of time to grind and learn but its made fun. 

Really tho I can go on in short the games super fun with friends or online with the right randos. especially if you gotta crew of 4."

This game can also pose quite a chalenge in some aspects since on some missions, you can try to stealth them which is something to keep in mind if you're trying to get better at the game."

26849,"What I like about Payday 2 is that this Game has MANY MANY MANY Possibilities on how to Pull Off the Many Heists that the Game allows you to do. I should say that the Music is Just Under the Great Music that comes from the Classic Video Game called ""Perfect Dark"". Oh, and the Graphics are Pretty Smooth. 1 Downside about the Game is that the Highest Difficulties will KICK YOUR SKULL IN DEEP, so if you want to Suffer, then Payday 2 is the Game for you. Other then that, I Love the Game. Highly Recommended from me!"
26850,good.

26952,"If you don’t want to spend money on dlcs don’t buy it. I recommend getting this with the legacy edition as that will give you most of the content that’s paywalled in the game (mostly guns and maps). The difficulty system is the top tier. There are like 7 different difficulties for a range of playability. Making builds and grinding infamy is what keeps this game interesting. 
TLDR: Get the game if you are ok with getting dlcs."

26977,"is good

update at 4.5k hours: still good. death sentence makes me feel like a little b*tch still sometimes though."
26978,Hugely addictive multiplayer and solo experience. Particularly enjoy the stealth focused missions but the gun-play going loud can also be fun. Very creative level design.
26979,"good

"
26980,good
26981,Fun With IzzFizz
26982,"This game is really nice with friends and in solo it has so many heists and you can choose how you want to do them such as Loud and Stealth and I think something else I don't remember. There's different type of mods to make the game however you want it such as silent assassin which when you apply the mod If you kill a guard without them spotting you don't have a pager. There's hundreds of exciting robberies you can do in this game. And even better there's levels you can choose your heist as such as normal, Hard, Very hard, Overkill, Mayhem, Death wish, And last but not least Death sentence the hardest one of them all. There's also one down which takes away 2 of 3 of your downs so you can only die once it doesn't really matter if you have it on or off in stealth but in loud it does. You can also get achievements from playing on one down there's one achievement that Im trying to get which is rob Golden grin casino with one down enabled and only use pistol. I think you get a trophy too. also there's different characters and different customization for your characters. Such as suits, Masks, Armor. Also there's skills in this game. Alot of them, And it's just a fun game in general. You can also play with randoms by pressing online and clicking a heist which has a players name below them, or above them I don't remember. Overall If I had to rate this game out of 10 I would rate it a 10/10 and I would recommend it for other players. Especially if you like robbing games, I can assure you that this will be the best robbing game you will ever play in your whole life."
26983,Rob
26984,Payday 2 has all the right ideas but with poor execution. This game may be considered old but it had constant updates with 70 DLCs since so not much of an excuse. Very good mod support and community. The gameplay is a mess not much of a fan myself great game structure great customization and some pretty good ideas but most of the time with bad execution. Everything usually sounds satisfying but disappoints. I still recommend this game especially with a friend although a guide or an already experienced friend would be amazing. I have faith and respect for the developers can't wait for Payday 3. Buy Payday 2 it's cheap buy dlcs even just buy it.

This game is really fun, basically you are bank robbers and you pull heists with the help of 3 other players/AI bots. You can finish the heists loud or silently and equip yourself with all different kinds of gear and modify it out as the situation calls for. You have a wide selection of characters to choose from, many of which are from movie franchises like John Wick and Point Break, as well as cool cosmetic masks. This game was released years ago and as of writing this (the end of 2021) it is still popping.

best game ever 10/10"
27063,"CAREFUL EVERYONE!

This game gets so addicting that even users that your familiar with start going a bit coo coo over everything.

AAAAnd it's quite tiring to argue for 8 hours and do nothing in those 8 hours but listen to a rant about how everyone needs to do what they do.

THEN YET they still scream at you like it's some kind of item from your household that makes you lose your BLOODY MIND!

==============================================================
1. Eh I solo and still get bored pretty fast.
2. I hosted and everyone doesn't type in chat until someone messes up and well snaps at you.
3. I joined someone hosted world and they don't tell me what to do aaaaaaaaaaaand they snap at me because I wasn't communicating. = Hah discord users are very funny when they assume your in a call with them.
4. Achievement junkies = oh man they need a reality check from the screaming or turning on damage team players because they get so angry.
5. The constant friend requests I get and everyone defriends me when I say ""I'm taking a break from PAYDAY 2.
6. Users who want to switch the map with the highest difficulty to waste your cash in game.
7. People who order you to get discord or use discord
8. Friends Private Lobby filled with grouchy log sitting wannabe cool guys.
9. The boredom from everything when you play PAYDAY 2 way too much to the point you keep on playing and act like a zombie around others waste ""MONTHS!""
10. Freak outs over age groups.
12. The dudes who brag about doing PAYDAY 2 for hours about console and failing every heist.
13. Lazy People who prefer someone else completing the heist alone.
14. Arrogant Prestige jerks who go on and on about their builds are the best,but never share.
15. The users who use their microphone and mumble or talk about their life story.
16. Host who wait in lobby for hours while everyone doesn't leave,to be polite to the host when that person starts a heist,until that very same person says ""I'm gonna get off,BYE SUCKERS,Oh yeah how about tomorrow, Ugh you guys waited that long?""
17. Trolls = when your about to complete a heist then the last person goes loud on  stealth only or kills civilians,prevents everyone from winning by acting afk or kicking them from heist when their hosting.
18. Restarts = 59 restarts on a Diamond store because the host or someone else who replaces someone else complains they don't lead the victory win or was even in game.
19. Tired of this game when 9 out of 67 to 200 users your acquainted with keep on asking you to play this game when they didn't want to play with you for entire month,year on their time when they played mmo or some FPS games and you answer their request politely and they defriend you because of your rank or knowledge or achievements of PAYDAY 2

20. Great game for people that are new or starting fresh,but for the people who listed in these 1-19 seriously take a break OR STOP PLAYING SO YOU CAN DO MORE THINGS IN YOUR LIFE UNLIKE MOST OF THE ZOMBIE MINDED FRIENDS I HAVE WHO HAVE HOURS PAST 40,000!
=============================================================
Is being rude and angry worth the ""Achievement Main quest line that everyone spends day and Night to complete worth it?""

Honestly no."

Six Sense is a joke, the NPC's walking patterns are absurd, you can magically get handcuffed even when you're pointing a 9mm right into the skull of the guard arresting you, and the list goes on. Also, don't forget, if you fail the level because of either one of these problems you either have to close and restart the game or lose a shit ton of money due to you having to re-buy all the assets. Absolutely pathetic."

27084,"Stoic perk goes burrrrrrrr. its just dumb fun were stealth is ""optional."" but loud is always a blast. I would give it a 5/5 just for all the stupid shit you can do, the fun weapons like the comically large spoon and my personal favorite the addition of the H3H3 productions cast. so if you don't already own this game why not get it its a hell of a good time."

27114,"It's a pretty good hoard shooter, you start off pretty weak doing small damage so harder difficulties are extremely hard early on. As you level you gain power though and the game starts to really balance itself out. Do you like gun porn? well too bad because this has a ton of it, so sit there and enjoy it you bastard. 

The DLC's are too many and too damn expensive, best advice is to wait until they go on sale for $1 and really make sure you only buy the ones you know you want 100%. 

This was a quick review but I'd highly recommend it, the mask customization is something I wish TF2 would've done with their hats, the gun play and customization makes it very apparent that the weapon designers used Airsoft models for reference (there are few models where you can see the bb feeders lol  ), and it's just a good ol' time to have with 3 other friends as you plan out and poorly execute said play.

When i joined I made so many friends who have taught and helped me get better at the game.
Overall very friendly and kind people.
Definitely worth getting especially when on sale. 
However, without the DLCs the game is not as good, but still fun and playable, or you could wait for the sale or play with a friend who has them.
Best game I've ever played so far."

27214,"This game is downright one of my favorites, as it has mass amounts of detail and story. You get to engage in compelling heists like robberies, stealth missions, and other objective-based heists. You get to unlock new items and shit and it lets you customize your mask, outfit, firearms, and modifications to the point where you can express yourself. You can choose to upgrade your safehouse for continental coins, and you can choose from a wide variety of characters, heists, firearms, firearm modifications, soundtracks, and more. The game has many soundtracks to choose from, and you can play singleplayer or multiplayer with friends, or find a game on the lobby network. I 100% recommend this game as it is worth the money, and you can even watch it's own live-action webseries on steam. 

The game has almost 1300 achievements to collect, and trading cards as well. You can purchase other shit from the community market. Unlike valve's games Payday 3 is happening.

100% get game now"

27220,very fun with friends
27221,"This game is a hoard shooter like CoD zombies. It is nothing like GTA five. The game play is linear and straight forward; almost every mission's objective is the same. The game can get repetitive if you do not own the DLC's; by the way there are too many DLC's. There are such few base game heists. Certain weapons are also DLC locked; which is acceptable. But when they make attachments DLC locked, that's just annoying. If you own a gun you should be able to use it in it's full potential without having to pay for it. My second complaint are the hostage AI's. It is so bad. Sometime when you're trying to move a hostage it goes to the other direction which is a threat as other civilians may see the hostage. Good game over all just too many DLC's and hostage AI is crap."

Yeah the game has issues (Disconnects and sometimes bugs preventing you from completing the heist) but when the game is functioning which is 99% of the time in my experience this game is a blast, Especially if ya got some buddies to bring along with you on the way on you're heisting escapades, There's plenty of content and the customization is something to behold from customizing you're masks to you're weapons and yes there's alotta DLC but that's completely optional and does not need to be required for this game to be fun, In my opinion if you like first person shooters and stealing stuff and listening to awesome music, You'll like Payday 2"

27275,"its the funny mask heist game
But seriously, Payday 2 is a LOT of fun even for the base game, I picked this up during the summer sale and I was not disappointed, this is quite worth your time and money, as it's fun to unlocking new things, play with other heisters around the WORLD, and with the expansive DLC (which I have yet bought but I have plans to), it is a HELL LOT OF FUN as I mentioned
Oh? Did I mention that this game can also support VR mode? Playing in VR is a lot of fun, but I'm not a fan of the teleport mechanic, luckily I installed the VR+ mod and it made the experience much more enjoyable (for me at least), but if you have a VR headset, I recommend giving Payday 2 VR a shot! It's fun to move around like you're robbing a real bank or something, plus it's fun to see the reactions of everyone else watching you flail your arms!
This game is worth your time and money if you can buy it, and get some of the DLC too if you can!

27289,"Not a stealth game. Anyone that tries to convince you otherwise is huffing something dank.

This is a horde defense shooter fever dream that allows us oppressed peasants to live out our fantasies of mowing down legions of cops while robbing banks, meth labs, literal fever dreams, gangster hideouts, military compounds, trains, armored trucks, secret russian laboratories, stores, malls, the forest, an earthquake zone, prisons, casinos, and more, in order to become rich af."

27324,"I'm probably gonna be at around 1-200 hours by the end of the year, but I wanted to review the game now since I feel like I got pretty much everything I need to review it. 

Payday 2 is hard to define. It's an FPS heist-organizing game based off two different dichotomies: Loud and stealth. 

The loud sections center around waves of enemies that are akin to Left 4 Dead where there's certain special enemies that are defined relatively similar to L4D. You have bulldozers that are basically tanks, Cloakers which are a lot like the Witch (but more aggressive), Tazers that are like the Smokers, and Shields/medics that are just kind of their own thing, and self-explanitory. Sometimes there is a ""Captain"" mechanic where you have to kill the captian to end the wave. I'm not sure if he is surrounded by a bunch of upgraded shield enemies or he is one of the shield enemies himself, but it can be annoying. There's also swat turret trucks that will spawn on higher difficulties, and they're the worst things in existence. When one of them comes in, you're in for a hell of a fight. Pretty much all of the loud missions deal with lots of hacking or drilling, and often they will keep turning things off or disabling your stuff and it can be a tad annoying sometimes.

The stealth sections center around avoiding guards and tying down civilians to look for ways to get inside. These are really engaging for me, but sometimes just feel unrealistic. It is to be expected of course. There are ways for your hostages to be impossible for the enemies to detect, even if they're literally sitting right out in the open. I've had instances where guards were too close to windows and I accidentally shot the window out while killing them and it ended my entire run. A lot of the stealth missions depend on RNG too; to get the easy objective placement, which hurts some of the difficulty of these things. A lot of the stealth seems like you got BS luck and that's why you failed; rather than it feeling like you made a mistake. Some of the missions that you do stealthy are sometimes almost impossible, or become extremely difficult if you fail at stealth; so some missions you might end up resetting like 50 times to finish. Not the best game design, but at least you can restart instead of having to pay to do a heist again or something ridiculous like that. 

There's a lot of heists and a ton of variety, and a lot of the heists are fun to play themselves. They created a lot of creative heists for this game, and many of them have their own quirks. They've recycled a few heists over the years, but I feel like there's so many different heists, that I don't care about that too much. It kind of sucks some of the heists are way easier to do, and give out way more XP than more difficult ones or ones that are longer, but a lot of other games operate that way, so it's a small complaint. 

Preparing for heists is relatively extensive, as there's a lot of guns and skills to decide on, as well as perk wheels, infamies, and many other things that give this game a lot of depth. Naturally with most build-centric games; there's lots of imbalances. Builds centered around pure stealth and dodging seem objectively better than other builds, and it kind of sucks. Seeing how the devs have fixed guns, I hope they make some builds more viable sometime. Would be nice if tank builds had the same survivability as dodge ones. 

The weapons also suffer from similar imbalance, as dual-wield SMG's and Shotguns tend to dominate, where assault rifles are kind of left behind despite some exceptions like the FAMAS.

Unfortunately, most of the depth is lost due to the fact most of the weapons and whatnot are DLC, as well as a few heists, but only few of them are important. Some builds want guns that are DLC, and it's quite frustrating, but the devs filed for bankruptcy a while back, so I guess I understand why they had to charge for expansions, but they shouldn't have went against their promises. At least the DLC is cheap, but quantitatively it's very expensive, at $160 for all of it. Hopefully sales dial that number back a lot. 

The level system sucks, and I hate the gacha mechanic for getting attachments and stuff. It gives you coins to unlock attachments, but you don't get a lot of them. I've only been able to unlock 10 or so attachments in 50 hours of playing, which kinda sucks, but I guess it's not a huge deal. There's also a CS;Go system for weapon skins, but at least you get them all free.

All in all though this is a fantastic game. I feel like there's plenty of charm and replay value to this. Very enjoyable game that is full of content. It's a great example of a game getting constant updates over a long period of time done right. They've screwed up a few times, but even with some of the bugs or weirdness with the AI; I still have a blast playing this game. I regret not ever touching this back in the day when I got it for free. I missed out on one of the most entertaining games I've played in a long time. For $10; I feel like this game is a steal. Absolute must to pick up."
27325,"Hilariously fun, even better with friends. Also, crank the voice lines up if you don't mind hearing ""Guys, the thermal drill, go get it."" over and over again, because the voice acting of the actual playable characters is HILARIOUS."

27339,"I just ate some fried chicken. The breasts were juicy, and the buns were soft and warm. Afterwards, the division manager of Popeyes came up to my table and asked me how the meal was.I said I was satisfied, but the meal lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. He apologized profusely, and said he had something to show me that would make up for it. He lead me to the back of the popeyes, to a room soaked from floor to ceiling in blood. In the center of it was a live horse, chained by all four legs to the structural supports of the warehouse like room. As I watched, employees of the popeyes cut large sections from the horse, which was whinneying and screaming in horror, the remaining sections of its body covered with festering sores and a froth of sweat. The popeyes employees took the chunks of horseflesh and sliced them into pieces, then they rooted around through the bags of trash strewn around the room to find discarded chicken bones. They quickly tenderized the meat with sledgehammers and fed it into a machine which formed the horsemeat around the bones, then they breaded and deepfried it. I asked the division manager why he had led me back to this place, and he pointed at the steed's rump, the diseased a‎s‎s‎h‎‎o‎l‎e puckering rythmically with terror, squirting pus with each convulsion. ""We're just about to use that section, would you like a crack at it first?"" I quickly unzipped my pants and wasted no time jamming my er‎e‎ct p‎e‎n‎i‎s into the stallion's defenseless a‎s‎s‎h‎o‎le. With each thrust, I donkey punched the horse in the back of the head, making it clench its a‎s‎s even tighter. I came just as the horse died. I was delighted. Popeyes definitely went the extra mile to make me a satisfied customer."

27343,"I remember back in the day when I paid a LOT of money to get this game and all of the DLC for it.  I wanted to wait until the developers said there would be no more content for the game coming, so I waited and went and purchased all of the DLC when they said ""there will be no more new content for the game""

Look where we are now.  There are 15 new DLC packs that have come out since then.  The devs are liars and swindle their players out of money.  They have the balls to charge full price for a game, load it with hundreds of dollars of DLC and then switch to microtransaction loot boxes.  Absolutely unacceptable."

Payday 2, while having released 9 years ago, still has a bustling community of heisters, and a genuine team of people who care about the game, as you can see visibly through the many DLC released to the game, while the DLC's might sometimes get on the more expensive side, they all bring a good amount of diversity and variation to change up your playstyle.

Overall I would give Payday 2 a 8/10"

The 40+ guns and perk decks and leveling system all scratch a itch not many games scratch and I 100% recommend this game to anyone unless you need super good graphics because that is the only area this games lacks in. Also the music is fucking amazing.

27531,"No realism at all, way too many cops shoot at you at once with weapons that hit like Nerf guns.
It doesnt feel like youre robbing anything, you just commit genocide.
You can try to do it stealthily but the game makes that way too hard, once you mess up one detail you have to do the whole mission again and chooses not to help you at all if you keep it stealthy.
If I'd actually wanna win a stealth mission I'd have to watch a walkthrough and trial and error, which can't happen because the missions maps just change after you retry a few times for some reason."

1. it.s not COD. It's actually fun. Real loadouts  for REAL MEN!. Oh and ladies!!!
The fun in team is just fantastic. And if you are playing with actual family friends. Then the game is that much more involved. I mean specialist on a bank robbing looting kidnapping art stashing fun can not be had anywhere else.  FBI/ Pfft FBI who. Cops. Bah.. bunch of babies to your four man squad. This is some of the most fun 4 people can have with out actually getting arrested.  Game has been out for a while. and I am just 2 hours short of 1000 as I write this. Just about to reinstall after playing a few other games. But, this game has fun moments. So fun, Reinstalling it and robbing banks today. Just for the Shits and giggles of it :)"

The VR experience is also surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable. This game is best with at least one friend to play with- the online community can be a bit toxic and solo play only realizes about 70% of the games potential. Definitely buy, on sale or at regular price."

On Mayhem and below, you can pretty much use any perks, perk deck, or weapons you want, but Death Wish, Death Sentance and the hell that is One Down is where you either play Stoic, Kingpin, Dodge, or Anarchist/Grinder (preference really) or you just go down in 2 hits playing basically any other deck. Weather you like to play the game casually on Overkill and below, or go balls to the walls on One Down, you'll hopefully have fun either way. I give PAYDAY 2 a 8 outta 10. Its not a perfect game by any means, but being a cop horde shooter made on a racing game engine? They sure did a damn good job"

To make things worse is that people spent hundreds on this game for expansions only to have the game bomb out months afterwards. Developer basically gave away game for free and DLCs for free.  Game was good now is crap.

27760,"This is definitely one of the top games for any game system.  This game has been around for years, and it has just gotten better and better.  Why mess with a good thing.  It is better than the typical run and gun because there is some strategy involved as well as a goal.  It has a uniqueness that has not been seen any any other first person shooter.  This game started out way back in the day of the playstation 3, from there is moved up to the ps4 and finally on computers it has turned into a bird that has opened its wings and flew into the sky. Once you play the game in VR there is no going back.  There is still a simplicity to the graphics but there is an overwhelming immersion that brings and absolute realism."

[b] too many DLC Content! [/b]

[b] Pluses: [/b]
- Simple game mechanics;
- Funny gameplay;
- A lot of contant (Guns, outfits, missions and heists and more);
- Intresting perks and skills tree.

[b] Minuses: [/b]
- Too much paid content. Yes, a new gun is cool, but pay a lot of real money for all of them is not cool. PAYDAY 2 community, i hope, will understand me :D;

27826,"So much potential, such a good premise, wonderful concept for a game.

Terrible execution. The mission objectives are utterly incidental, no tactics or strategy is needed to complete any of them, and the game is really just a mindless boring killfest of endlessly spawning utterly stupid mobs. Fun for a couple of hours, but that's about it.
"
27827,"I've let my cousin play this game on my computer for a few hours while i was away.



Let's say after a few days i heard from my relatives that he stole something from the store.







THIS GAME GIVES YOU IDEAS HOW TO ROB THINGS!"

27836,"I hope Ovk will overhaul infamy system , so it wouldn't be just a grinding simulator ( each infamy would give you some bonuses for example +2% damage  +1 movement speed and so on). The damage range multipliers shouldn't be even implemented. 

And here is a list of other things which are really  annoying or poorly implemented in this game.
1) Lobby system.
2) Lack of anticheat.
3) Weapons and perkdecks balance.
4) Optimization
5) Player progression
6) Developer attitude towards players ( just stop trying to sell us weapon reskins and ugly skins and new heist which we gonna complete once and forget about them)
7) Countless amount of bugs and crashes.

The only positives about this game you probably already heard about like soundtrack random level generation ability to complete heist in different ways. I strongly suggest you not to buy this game or new dlcs to it just save your money and buy a different game. Deep rock galactic is a great alternative."
27837,"amazing game but should add more places to rob
"
27838,Fun.
27839,this game is good
27840,"One of the most fun shooters I've played, once I picked up it up I never put it down. I love perk decks, skill trees and the wide customization of masks and guns! I wish perk decks had a bit more diverse abilities other than ""better armor"" and ""better health"" but that's just because I love making stupid builds in this game and I want to make the even more stupider."
27841,this game has the worst fucking game mechanics I've ever seen in my 16 years of gaming
27842,"Probably the best horde shooter out there. Lotta DLC, good servers, fun missions. Difficulties that actually do get more difficult and add more mechanics. Pretty neato I must say. Definitely something you want to play with friendos though. So if you're a solo sadboi probably should steer clear unless you wanna run PUGs"

27851,"this game is one of the worst games I have ever played cuz this game is a huge DLC simulator all the cool stuff is in a DLC like skill trees, guns, characters, masks and don't make me start with the h3h3 DLC and the characters from h3h3 are sooooo ugly. Now the skins let me say it 90% OF THE SKINS ARE TERRIBLE and sometimes when you get a skin for a gun you will need a DLC to use it. and on some heists 4 people are not enough if you are doing death wish or death sentence with or without one down option this game is unplayable but overkill doesn't give a shit all they want is money and this game is a big, big, BIG trash."

You can do stealth so if you want to take it more serious and sneaky, or you can go out in style shooting armed police officers before you escape.

27905,its a really good game that has hundreds of different guns and multiple difficulties that add harder and more advanced enemys to the fight that change how you play all together. you can go stealthy or loud and there're skills are perks that dictate how good you are at certain things and its really good for 15 and with some foul mouth and a little payed dlc that are usually a 2 bucks. so over all a great game that i recommend for teenagers.

(PS: Its best to play alone/solo, Because everyone that joins is worse then the bots)

(Edit: Every... LITERALLY every game i play with people online... they either completely useless or the expect way to much out of you.. there no chill no in between)

the DLC packs are a little overboard.
As most missions in the DLC are not that fantastic.

The game itself is fun to play.
It is a absolute blast in co-op.
Even single player has some great moments.

this is a really solid title that gives you tons of funny moments when you go and play in co-op.

Well me neither, that's why I play Payday, the only game where you can abuse the justice system to turn you into a free man by raiding the god damn WHITE HOUSE in a drunken rage that heals you, along side your friend with an ECM jammer that gives feedback to cops, simulating the sound of a Justin Beiber concert. Did we also mention the guy who can decide bullets don't work, 60% of the time? What about the guy who can spam a tape recorder at someone, while blasting them with a double barrel shotgun the size of a flintlock, and immediately pulling out a greatsword from the dark ages and going Hamlet on someone.

28001,"Great game for some fuckery with friends.
< Could be even better if some bugs were patched and some quality of life updates were rolled out.
 < P.S. Don't expect any changes or updates, both companies that own PAYDAY 2 are bankrupted and fucked.

Pro Tips:
1. Avoid taking hostages on stealth missions, the pathfinding is FUCKING HORRIBLE. You'd have a better chance of finding your father again after all those years than these hostages finding the most direct way to you.

2. Careful of not being spotted through walls, as that can be very inconvenient for most.
(Yes this is a thing that happens on VERY RARE occasions.)

3. Play this game with friends, not randoms. People in most cases are obnoxious and selfish. Avoid them at all costs.

Final words: 8/10 ""GET THE FUCK UP!"""

28016,"I originally started playing this game on Xbox, where it has since been more or less abandoned by the devs, and had a ton of fun with it, so I decided to buy it on PC where I knew it was still getting love, and I was NOT disappointed. It's well worth its relatively low price tag, particularly for a game with no microtransactions (a rarity even in full-price AAA titles, unfortunately) and no ""always online"" foolishness. It's largely playable solo, especially on lower difficulties, but is of course much better with a team. It's also thoroughly playable without DLC, although you'll want to buy the addons regardless for the fun of it. Our characters feel like more than an arbitrary model we put on for the game, and the lore runs deep, but you can freely ignore those things and play just to rob some banks.

Mechanically speaking, I appreciate that how everything works is very plainly spelled out with numbers right there for you to see, as well as the ability to plan your heists ahead of time, the ability to conveniently swap between your custom preset loadouts and skill-sets, and that the developers have chosen to allow mods even for online play. The shooting feels smoother than most games have for me on keyboard and mouse, and most heists are pretty straightforward- the only one I'd call convoluted is Big Oil, and even that can be figured out if you stop and think.

Lastly, I appreciate the touch of humor the devs have finely sprinkled like good kosher salt over the dialogue, visuals and overall concepts, the way they've managed to use politics in a tasteful manner instead of ramming it down your throat like a Catholic priest with a choir boy, and the fact that everyone, even NPCs, more or less talks like a person instead of a deadpan automaton"

28030,"Mort meets King Julien and Maurice for the first time when he falls out of a tree in “King Me”. Mort is depicted as an important character in All Hail King Julien, and is one of the four members of King Julien's royal circle. It is in All Hail King Julien that his love towards King Julien's feet began. Mort is somewhat creepy at times, but also humorous. He claims to live in his own world, and can turn in to many versions of himself inside his mind.

However, in All Hail King Julien: Exiled, he becomes one of the significant characters who assist King Julien, by getting information and spying on the enemy, Koto, while he acted as his jester. Mort was able to plot plans to assassinate Koto, but was unable to be successful due to his bad luck. Mort was clever enough to generate tactful plans in trying to free the prisoners in various ways. He played a crucial role in collecting an army (the Mort Horde) for the war against Koto. His actions helped King Julien, leading to his victory.

It is indicated in Revenge of the Prom that Mort was abused sexually by Grammy Mort, leading to her consumption. He creates a romantic relationship with Zora in the All Hail King Julien: Exiled and marries her in The Day Before Tomorrow. However, in King Julien is Watching You, Zora leaves Mort and decides to live with Uncle King Julien.

Madagascar

King Julien just before kicking Mort

Mort was partying with King Julien and his people. Out of the blue, the Fossa attacks them and was surrounded by the Foosa. When he was just about to be eaten, Alex comes to talk with the Foosa, allowing him to escape. When King Julien want to see the true character of the Zoosters, he kicks Mort towards Alex. Alex tries to cheer him up but causes him to cry. After he was comforted by Gloria, the lemurs surround them.
Back at the plane, he even gets scold by King Julien since he states that he love the Zoosters more than anyone and King Julien hate them compared to how much he love them. This annoys King Julien. Compared to his witty character in All Hail King Julien, he seems to panic easily since he screamed in fear when King Julien reminds them how they were dreaded by the Fossa.

When Alex performs at the foot of the Central Boabab Tree, he bites Marty. When the whole kingdom sinks in silence, he claps which adds humor. Later, when Alex roars, he says that he is ""Going savage"", causing all to run. At the end of the film, Alex decides to eat Sushie. King Julien offers Mort to Alex, as a Plan B, so he could eat him. This event adds humor.

Merry Madagascar
He is the only one who comes for the Zoosters' leaving party. This amazes them since King Julien would never miss a party. Later, he is one who is drumming when King Julien, Maurice and the lemurs catch the Zoosters, thinking it is the Red Night Goblin. He was then accused by King Julien and says to stop laughing. Ironically, it was the Red Night Goblin who was laughing.

He appears again when Alex goes to lauch the attack. He was screaming at that time. At the end, King Julien realizes that he must share gifts. Mort is the first lemur to get a gift from King Julien, which is a coconut. At the end, King Julien and Maurice are trying to hit him. He wishes the audience Happy Christmas and Julianuary and then gets hit by a coconut."

Possibly a bigger tutorial phase to really make sure you understand the load-out's and skill-set trees. There is a crap ton to consider before actually doing the heists; which is amazing. Especially just for new gamer's and the solo players that know no one who has played this game before. As well as maybe make the difficulty ratios different. If Mayhem is crazy online I feel like it shouldn't be the same as playing offline with your ai's; if the objective is to get them to play oniline more, than maybe you could not make anything after very hard in solo mode offline. You can have fun by yourself up to very hard, after that your AI's cannot keep up. They go down faster than a hooker for 20$."

Of course, I modded it, not to an insane amount, just a graphics mod, a viewmodel hud so my gun is angled when crouching, and a hud mod, couple more but these are more notable.

Anyway onto the game.

You survive waves of police and grab as much money as you can. Gets pretty crazy at points, that cloaker sound just makes you paranoid.

Good game, better with mods."

28104,"Payday 2, man do I have a few things to say for this little gem. With my time on this game, it's honestly been a good chunk of fun and laughs. And with all these new updates and heists, it just keeps this game alive, something I am quite fond seeing. And yes, the most glorious addition is the mighty golden spoon, LONG LIVE THE CUTLERY. Well, that's about all I got, get those masks on heisters, we got a Payday ahead of us!"
28105,"What a perfect game. Where do I even begin with this game. The game play is so good and never get old, I mean NEVER. The amount of content that is here is really big having 78 heists, hundred of guns and attachments to play around with, and lots of skills and perks decks to choose from. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is genuinely one of the best soundtracks that i have ever listened to. This game is a blast to play with friends, and if you don't, you'll still have a really great time. It is one of the best criminal games out there and the best hoard shooter ever.

28134,"The game is a clusterfuck of shouting, gunfire, and music. I have loved about 80% of my time playing this game and can't wait to see what they can squeeze in before Payday 3.

Pros++
*Infinite Replay-ability
*Great game for playing with friends *groups of 4 or less*
*Gun Porn
*The Gun Porn
*Hilarious and Heroic moments brought to you by police AI.
*Did I mention the Gun Porn?
*The music slaps so hard my neighbors asked me to turn it up.
*Incredible variety in build and playstyle choices. Want to stab a dude with a grill fork and make his buddies panic? Check. Mow down waves of dudes with an M60 like you're on a hill in Vietnam? Check. John Wick with a kink for pain? Check and check.
*Mods are available online to enhance your experience visually and several for gameplay changes.
*Heist variety. Oh baby, do you have a buffet of options to choose from. Bank heist? Got it. Military compound? Done. Vault under a stadium during a rave? Oh, you betcha. You can spend weeks learning every heist and I've personally spent years trying to master many of them. 


Cons--
*Cloakers. Sam Fisher with a single 3-phase order. ""Find them. Beat them. Make them stop resisting.""
*Matchmaking can be buggy. Between hosts having mods that cause issues, connection drops, and voodoo magic.. sometimes things just drop. Nothing like spending half an hour on a heist just to disconnect on the way out.
*The DLC chain is horrendous and a genuine eye sore to look at. It's also scary to look at for someone trying to come into the game at this point in its life cycle and see so much DLC. It's mitigated by host-reliant heist DLC so if the host owns it anyone can run with them. The content lost in firepower is a genuine tragedy.
*Cheating is common but the game DOES have a cheater tag for people who are caught. It will alert the other players in the game without alerting the cheater. Kind of a ""Play at your own risk"" situation after that. Gone are the days of ""rage cheaters"" that will spawn 100 bags of loot after spending 30 minutes doing it normally and get everyone in trouble with the VAC.
*Cloakers.
*Unbalanced perk system. In-game you have perk decks and skill sets. It allows you to create a unique play style for any situation. In theory; it's a way for someone to play any way they want. In practice; the perk deck system has many ""potatoes"" with a couple outstanding exceptions. Stoic, Grinder, and Anarchist can effectively carry someone through any difficulty shy of max.
*No grapple system. In a game that has some-what functional melee system; there is a lack of ability to choke someone out in stealth or grab a shield off a cop when things go loud. I don't know the work that would need to go into that though.

Summary&&
This game is a blast from start to finish. It has huge, elaborate, and difficulty heists that you can tackle like a ninja or a warlord. It's not without flaws but what it provides is the FPS experience with an option for stealth. It feels so rewarding to complete a heist totally silent for the first time. The rush of dodging guards and stealing paintings, cutting glass display cases, even moving money without being seen. It can make a 30 minute heist feel like 10. Going ""loud"" with guns blazing can making a 30 minute heist feel like an hour sometimes with the monotonous dakka and waves. The point is that you have the option the change things up. I may be bias on what my preferred method is. Give it a chance. If you can't afford the DLC paywall don't panic, you can genuinely enjoy this game at it's base with no problems. None of the DLC is a requirement to play. Even the heist packs you don't buy are available to you by joining players in the community that bought them already. 

I look forward to seeing your ping on Crime.net. I need to go find a Medic Bag.

28142,this game is so fun
28143,"Payday 2 is one of the best ""bang for your buck"" games. It features endless content, weapons, builds, full coop and a very nice, free VR mode with crossplay capability and perfectly decent controls (looking at you, borderlands 2). The DLCs are a but hit or miss but the missions are generally pretty good and you can join DLC mission lobbies even if you dont own them yourself. The levelling system is a bit slow but much better than in Payday 1. For the extremely low prices that this game is frequently on sale for, its really a no-brainer, especially for VR players looking for new (coop-)games!"
28144,SOMEBODY GET DALLAS A MEDIC BAG
28145,"Except the countless bots coming to find you in the limitless abyss of drilling, its nostalgic and fun."

28155,"Consider that i am playing this game, so long after the release, lemme tell you It's Just that good, it's always a rush to play missions even if you can't find many lobbies the AI and offline mods is epic in itself
You are never bored coz you are getting shot from all directions and MY GOD THE ACHIEVEMENTS, there is literally a shit ton of them, to the point of Absurdity

Only Complaint will be the fact that most of the gun's are DLC locked but let's just cross it down with the fact that i am too poor to buy any DLC, So yeah Epic game to play with friends and stuff

Also good luck finding online lobbies tho, Those are a fiction now

28158,"I am a 58 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

28349,"Payday 2 is an excellent, best of breed co-operative FPS heist game with short, exciting rounds, solid PvE gameplay and a wide variety of missions, robberies and drug deals.   No two heists are alike, and there's quite a lot of them. 

Top tier contemporary visuals, 4K support, a pleasing array of visual and performance tweaks hammer down the technical side of things.  The game features an excellent progression and skill tree system, supplemented of course by a comprehensive array of weapons. 

The only caveat is that this is best played with friends, but pick up groups are easy to get into too, and you can play single player with bots.   The $10 USD price tag for this is entirely too generous considering how much gameplay you can get out of this game, so I'd consider this a must-have for co-op fans."

gud game"
28362,"I know this game is old but theres a reason why a lot of people still play this game its good i dare say one of the best game of all time along side Left 4 dead 2 and dark souls as my fav games. This game has something for everyone want a simple run and gun game, a stealth heist like how i would see a real life one happening. a Hardcore only on mistake. Etc. It has many play styles want to be a guy running at moc 10 with bullets flying past or do you want to be a alcoholic who drinks the pain away like my father or be a man pumping more drugs into his veins then roiding out almost anything is there. Hey they put this game on sale on any main sale for like a 1$ usd thats 89 less for new crap AAA games with mircotransactions.é"

28382,"amazing gameplay, tons of guns and story, lots of dlc and unlockables and even more funny characters. also AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I NEEEEEEEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAAAAAG"
28383,good soup
28384,"This is still just as fun as it was in 2013. I highly recommend this game, it goes on sale for nothing all the time."
28385,"This game has held up for many years, I have recently just come back to the game after only starting it ages ago.The game  still holds up and is fun to play. I am definitely going to more time into this game. The game also has a great balance of easy to  insane difficulty levels which accommodate all kinds  of players which is great!"
28386,"yes
"
28387,"its good, too many dlcs thoug, but what can you expect of such a long lasting game :)"
28388,epic game if you wanna hit cops with a really big spoon
28389,you stupid cloaker
28390,It's a great game though I wish the developers would make Payday 2 cross-platform with up-to-date updates. I also wish the Payday 2 was bit more stable but what can we do. Hope Payday 3 holds up to the reputation of this game.

28397,"Ever wanted to embody the spirit of an Edgy 14 year old who thinks they understand the world, using cursed guns and robbing people? Here you go."
28398,its kind of a grind but once you get the hang of it its pretty fun and addictive
28399,it is so fun
28400,"Definitely fun, it'd be hard to say ""no"" to a good game like this. Can be played solo, offline with bots, online with players, or both players and bots. More than plenty of content, extending past just robbing banks."
28401,pog
28402,"This game is amazing. No other game dev has created something quite like this. I mean, not only can you steal goats, whack people with oversized cutlery and fight off hordes of swat officers but even heist nuclear warheads. 11/10"

28404,I'm too lazy to write a review!
28405,lol
28406,"This game is really good,i know i havent been playing for long enough to fully review it but from all the matches i've played,i've enjoyed em all,i laughed,i cried,and i screamed while playing this with my friends,so i think it's worth the money"
28407,Pretty good
28408,yese
28409,its ok
28410,with recently getting a gaming pc i have now tried this game on all devices. And the pc is by far the best and will never look back

28445,society
28446,I NEED A MEDIC BAG
28447,it's fine
28448,"good game with an immense amount of replayability by the sheer number of heists and theirs countless little change here and there when replaying one. If you really think you'll like the game, you should buy the legacy collection of the game because 3/4 of weapons and heists are locked behind dlcs (you still can join a heist you dont own, but you cant host it). You should also wait for a sale if it isn't already because the game sells for dirt cheap during them (literally less than 5$)"
28449,funny money man need medic bag
28450,rob bank then leave
28451,"Because of this game, I lost 150 pounds of weight, finally went out and touched some grass, went to the gym, and got a girlfriend. Thank you payday 2"
28452,[h1][b]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I NEEEEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAAAAG[/b][/h1]
28453,awesome if you are playin with your friends
28454,"A fantastic game to play with your friends! Normal difficulty is a joy to play and overkill is enough to make you want to gouge out your eyes. It has talent trees, collecting, upgrades, what else could you possibly want? The AI is a little derpy if you solo/duo, but with friends this game is an absolute blast."
28455,i love this game! it has the perfect balance of funny and customizeability and an all around great game
28456,Good game
28457,Fun to play with friends. Also make me want to try this in real life ;)
28458,"game good game monke enjoy 
all you hestiers better equip the commicly large spoon"

"
28469,Best game ever
28470,"BuY Product Newo B!TcH
"
28471,"there is something for everyone, you can go loud and reduce the population with the sheer amount of cops you kill, you can go stealthy and rob people blind. its honestly just a good game, also there's a giant spoon in the game so yeah"
28472,"Verry cool game , acutally the first game i know that skins help you ingame."
28473,"This game is stupid fun. You get to do alllllllll the dumb shit. You can cook meth while wielding a minigun and fighting SWAT team after SWAT team. There's a stealth mechanic, but I can't say anything about that because I only run loud. I won't get into detail about all the things. But if you like killing cops and robbing banks then go ahead and cough up 10 buckaroos"
28474,"This is game is a blast especially with friends, the only cons in my opinion is the greedy amount of dlc and the vr support

VR DISCLAIMER - fair warning the vr controls are prob on the top of my list for worst button layout, if you are still interested in trying this on vr highly suggest modding with superblt and improvement mods. Can be a bit confusing at first but theres a lot of helpful guides online about them. Good luck!"
28475,"Pretty good, i heard it gets hard in the later heists"

28487,m
28488,"fun
"
28489,yes
28490,Really great heist game. Got it from a friend but haven't played much. Leveling up and customizing your robber is a lot of fun and so are the robberies. With all the DLC there's so much to play and keeps you coming back for more.
28491,the clown car is here
28492,"um 
"
28493,fun

28495,d
28496,gud
28497,"Cool game, easy to run, only downsides being not able to fullscreen and the sensitivity is slightly broken."
28498,"I've played 3.2k hours. And I still love this game. I've done everything in the game by now. But that's why I've started modding the game. Custom soundtracks, heists, weapons, attachments, you name it. I like helping friends get masks, achievements, etc. It's a difficult game even with custom stuff. Terrible engine. But good game nonetheless!"
28499,dlc heaven
28500,Its like the radiohead of video games
28501,"Good game with a frustratingly bad engine, if you can't wait for payday 3 releasing 2023 then i would recommend this game. If you can wait until then I would. PD2 is on the Diesel engine which was a private engine made for racing games a long time ago, hence the bugs. PD3 is on Unreal engine, a much better and more modern engine which should fix most of the problems this game has.

Edited for steam awards 2021: Gud Gaem"
28502,"Great game with almost endless replayability, however the amount of DLC required to get the complete experience is rather annoying. I'd give this game a 8.5/10, definitely recommend especially if you get the Legacy Collection"
28503,i have a huge weenus
28504,this game is so stressful but so fun. i definitely recommend it 10000000000/10
28505,i love this game

28507,murder
28508,IT AIGHT.
28509,masked babies robbing banks with comically large spoons.
28510,"good game, dlc is too fucking expensive"
28511,sneaky
28512,"a great fucking game
"
28513,"I guess this is a good time killer with some pretty good mods...there are a lot of achievements  to complete. This is must buy at a discounted price. But I don't like the dlcs...I mean there are too much of these which cost a lot after so many years....
Just don't try this in real life.
Play the story of 'Four thieves and their unconditional love for a broken drill'."
28514,
28515,great game. Love the wacky ways to build ur character
28516,"hi

28522,yes
28523,I kill cops and buy guns
28524,"its shooty shooty steal steal fun
"
28525,"Satisfying HEDSOT, very good."
28526,yes
28527,"IS very good, highly recommend."
28528,This game has some terrible UX/UI. I installed recently to give another chance and its still dogwater.... Don't waste your money or your hard drive space
28529,"""That which does not kill me has made a tactical error."""
28530,NEWS UPDATE: DRUNK ROBBER LITERALLY TOO DRUNK TO DIE
28531,"Это игра убьет ваше время ,силы и деньги."
28532,when's the 3rd one coming
28533,crash game
28534,"Great Game, played on my old 360 and Xbox One before I switched to PC, it's fun and has lots of content to choose and explore with. Overall 8/10. Since it is old it has some things that could have been fixed but never have been, graphics are hella good for 2013 game so no complaints there. Bottom line: Buy if you like to rob shit, kill cops, and build your own little money enterprise."
28535,good pay day 2 but i are gooder
28536,Pretty fun game if you like run and gunning and grinding
28537,"played for a few minutes, kinda alright i guess"
28538,haha funny comical spoon go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
28539,"If you want my review, then you need to buy ""Fox's review""DLC first, Overkill. XD"
28540,trust me

28542,Good
28543,Me love
28544,mhm

"
28546,go en rob banc rich
28547,Mask up
28548,it's payday fellas!
28549,you get to play as the paycheck crew and rob banks it's pretty rad
28550,"it's fun 
"
28551,this game is awesome man reccomend it to gta players
28552,only buy it if you are fine with dishing out money for dlcs also the game runs like crap

"
28564,"[Verse 1]
I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind
And when they ask me how I'm doing I say, ""I'm just fine""
And when they ask me how I'm doing I say, ""I'm just fine""
But the fact is
I can never get off of my mattress
And all that they can ask is
""Why are you so sad, kid?"" (Why are you so sad, kid?)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

[Chorus]
So you can see I'm tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's rеal, so long, it's real
[Verse 2]
Always bein' judged by a bunch of strangе faces
Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages
But I've been places
So I'm okay-ish, so I'm okay-ish
Yeah, I'm okay, bitch
But the fact is
I need help, I'm failin' all my classes
They think that I need glasses
I just really wish that I could pass this (Wish that I could pass this)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

[Chorus]
So you can see I'm tryin', you won't see me cryin'
I'll just keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
And it just keeps on pilin', it's so terrifying
But I keep on smilin', I'm good (Yeah, I'm good)
I've been carin' too much for so long
Been comparin' myself for so long
Been wearin' a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's real, so long, it's real

[Outro]
So long, it's real
So long, it's real

Highly recommended for the mission variety, variability, depth, and customization that significantly adds to the game's replayability. Definitely more enjoyable with friends. If this is remotely interesting, you owe it to yourself to try it."

Controls too sensitive and hard to tune on PC (is it better on other  platforms ? )

28720,iss gud
28721,Definitely worth it in a steam sale when it's like 74p ($1) but in my opinion if there's no sale on then it's one for the wishlist until it's on offer
28722,very good
28723,"Man this game just doesn't want to die. There is just no other game like it. It's ugly, it's old but my god is it fun. Stealth is fun and challenging but loud is amazing and hard. You have a lot of freedom, more weapons than in many new games and so much customizability. 

Sadly if you want most of the content today you'll have to buy some DLCs. One DLC is cheap but they stack up and become a price of another game. But it is worth it."
28724,"The game consists of a variety of ""heists"" that a player can opt to either carry out by themselves, with the AI, or as a part of the multiplayer game. There are heists such as bank robberies, drug trafficking runs, rigging an election, or stealing smuggled nuclear warheads. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion, and certain heists can only be done in stealth.
The level selection menu is styled as a fictional website, Crime.net, where missions pop up periodically as contracts in a map of Washington, D.C. It is not possible to max out every single tree and players are often encouraged to mix and match skills from each tree to maximize usefulness. Players also receive ""perk points,"" in proportion to their experience earned, that can be used to unlock additional bonuses from 17 ""perk deck."" Players can switch between 15 profiles of skills, perk decks, weapons and equipment at no cost before starting a heist.
When a player reaches level 100, they can opt to raise their ""Infamy"" level, up to level 500. Becoming Infamous grants a player access to special skill trees and items and gives them special poses in lobby screens. However, raising one's Infamy level causes them to lose all of their spending money and experience, and a sum of $200,000,000 is deducted from their offshore account until they reach Infamy level 5."

Been Playing Payday 2 for a reaaaaaaaal long time now. There´s a ton of variety and lots of fun challanges to do. This game is also an Achievement Gold Mine (with 1000+ Achv., from which 500 are very easy to unlock), if you are looking for that. Music is good and often times fits the atmosphere. Story is fantastic, made me cry a few times. Total of 5-6 Difficulties, each one having their own characteristics. 

All in all, good game.

28760,"Payday 2 is an amazing heist ""simulator"" that has kept me entertained for a long time and driven me to grind the achievements. The wide selections of weaponry, perk decks, and skill trees give you a lot of choices for what you want to do. I always find myself running Stoic or Anarchist, but I also tend to lean on Sociopath and Burglar. 

The enemies are great, by the way. Bulldozers are good challenges, Medics tactically heal SWAT closest to them, and Cloakers are just walking memes. Fuck the Snipers. They're the only bad ones.

Definitely recommend. Currently have 177 hours and I plan to add way more."

28766,This game is incredible with action packed game play from first person shooter to stealthy slow game play giving a variety of game style with the same reward. The game is addictive with a variety of fun awards from creative masks too different weapon skins and mods. The DLCs are also very interesting with fun action packed heists which are as well fun with friends to play and the community is amazing to interact with. I would easily rate this a 5 star game.

28780,"In his cinematic work known as 'Only a spoonful', Mr. Bach subverts the audience's expectations, creating a humorous work. In the beginning, the protagonist, presumed to be Mr. Bach himself, asks his friend if he could eat ice cream. His friend responds with ""Only a spoonful!"" creating the audience expectation that the protagonist will only eat what is known to be equivalent to a spoonful. However, the protagonist uses a comically large spoon, juxtaposing the audience's expectations whilst technically obeying the rule of ""Only a spoonful""; despite the spoon being comically large compared to a regular spoon. The protagonist also creates a face when revealing the comically large spoon, implying that the usage of the comically large spoon creates ingenuity. The cinematic work also uses music around the time of the revealing of the comically large spoon, implying that the protagonist will be celebrating consuming the ice cream due to the music being happy."

28835,"A solo/offline player review

Probably should be mentioned, i bought the legacy bundle which is 8 years of DLC for cheap. The vanilla version is playable but very barebones.

Tried the demo expecting 1 hour of faffing about but this turned out to be alot of fun for me offline with bots.

They cant do stealth or objectives and the only commands you can give are ""follow"" or ""wait here"" (theyll follow beyond a certain distance anyway). They help somewhat with transporting loot in that you can throw bags at them to make em carry those. They soak up unreal amounts of damage and give pretty powerful buffs, in the end i was mostly playing on mayhem (which is difficulty 5 of 7), abit of a challenge but absolutely doable. Bots are very good

Regarding the gameplay : you do crimes and if you do it the shooty bang bang way the police turns on the cloning vats and endless hordes of kamikaze cops swarm you. 

Theres multiple scenarios and levels ranging from simple bank robberies to breaking a dude out of prison or stealing nukes and then putting them into a muscle car to drive em around. Theres also randomization, there can be extra or less guards or civilians or more cameras or an extra objective like a vault having an extra door, whole sections of level architecture can be different aswell. This was a big part of keeping me playing.

With the DLC theres a huge amount of guns (albeit especially pistols having alot of samey ones) and you can go tactilol and put scopes on scopes to improve stats and stuff. Theres also some buildcraft with different perk decks and skill sets. You can do stealth builds with only a suit and sneaky skills, Critical hit builds which can do lots of damage but can be relatively glassy or tank builds, theres alot of variety.

Theres a career mode which provides some overarching story in the mission briefings or you can just jump into any mission you want right off the bat

Didnt like :

- constant nagging by handlers. Id sit in a corner being besieged by enemies or doing some stealth stuff and every 3 minutes or so id be reminded to OMG GUYSE WHY HAVENT YOU DONE X YET. GUYSE YOU NEED TO DO X. HEY GUYSE DO X. Extremely annoying

- crit builds favoring or at least being somewhat dependent on silencers. Just not a fan of my guns sounding like farts all the time

- three guns and a color costing the same as an indie game. Remedied by the legacy bundle

Tl;dr : coop game but perfectly playable solo"

28841,best game for masochists
28842,"God. This game is amazing. This game has insanely good and grindy progression. No joke, if you don't like grinding don't even think about getting this game but if you're a grinder then this game is for you. Amazing gameplay with unique and awesome looking graphics, textures and models. The heists are cool and have many ways of being executed. One thing that can be seen as both a con and a pro is the DLC system. There is insanely much DLC. For most people this is gonna be a pain in the ass, but for people who got their mom's credit card on hand the DLC system is very rewarding. Like when you wait for a long time to finally get to play a certain heist or shoot some guns that were locked behind the pay wall. If you wanna get most out of the game it's gonna be expensive and I'd go so far as say that if you aren't planning on getting all the DLC it isn't worth it, but if you're gonna get DLC to experience an experience like no other then buy this game. Overall this game is really good, has some glitches sometimes but nothing game breaking. The DLCs will be a problem for most people but other than that this game is absolutely amazing, masterpiece! Good job overkill software, you're very talented devs who just need some money."

The gameplay is fun, every mission is different without feeling like a copy paste, the sound design is amazing, it has a brilliant sound track, and it's a load of fun. if you like blowing stuff up, running down a hallway with a machine gun or sneaking in and out of military and cartel bases, this is your game. on top of that, the free virtual reality dlc is an amazing addition to the game, allowing a more immersed experience. there's never nothing to do, and there are always people to jump into a game with. Honestly, for $15, this is an absolute steal. I highly recommend, as this is my favourite game on steam!"

The ability to go loud or stealth allow for diverse gameplay enough to keep you going for hours on end. Best part is you don't need a beast of a computer to run this game and still get around 60 FPS. It is worth every cent you have to pay to play this game.

The game feels like L4D2 except that the zombies have guns and can shoot with little breathing room for the player. I didn't play that much after a while away from it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt."

28950,payday 2 stealth be like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHx2hAu6PTA
28951,"This isn't a heist planning game. It's a game where you just shoot hordes of cops. 

The game purports that stealth is an option in most maps. But it isn't. ""Stealth"" in Payday 2 is just going in through the back door rather than the front, before you inevitably raise the alarm and do it loud. Because basic stealth elements like distractions or even shutting doors so you can't be seen from the other side of the building are just completely absent. The only stealth gameplay is playing hide and seek with guards going down pre-defined routes. And even then, if you do it slowly and stealthily the game will shout at you to get on with it, flash objectives, the whole nine yards.

What's more this game is stupidly bloated. There are multiple different sets of skill trees because one set got added later and the previous one got reworked. There's a constant grinding mechanism to get random loot from the heist (and the inevitably bloated list of weapons and equipment which goes with it), and plenty of elements which haven't been updated or fixed to reflect that - I couldn't actually finish the tutorial without having to have done another job on the side because the devs screwed up the xp calculation when converting it into one of the new skill trees.

Before going in to this game, I asked about whether the bot AI is good enough to facilitate solo play. I got told that the bot AI is better than most players. However when it came down to it and my task was to escort 6 bags to the escape point, the AI didn't bother going for them. They just followed me around. And the escape point was behind some minor geometry (roof ventillation system) on the map which the AI could not possibly figure out a route for. So I even with being able to throw bags onto the AI's back, I still had to deliver them one by one and go chasing after the bot when it didn't know what was going on.

And from my brief outreach in the community, this is what to get. Stealth gameplay is apparently unpopular (gee, I wonder why something so underdeveloped and poorly made would be unpopular) so the community just go for the loud, horde shooter approach instead. Even the few stealth recommendations I could get were exploiting game mechanics rather than playing the game."

29024,"Very fun game with both challenging and not so challenging heists that let you experience a new way of doing things every different heist. Also has different difficulties that change how you play in the heist very drastically (if you play loud, stealth just changes cameras but makes it harder i guess).

WARNING: If you play stealth too much and keep failing, you might have a problem with anger issues and broken friendships...

Also just a quick tip: Go to play online, filters on the top left and change the difficulty level filter to death sentence if you are doing stealth as nothing is different except the cameras which can be disabled by security rooms and then you can basically get lots of money and xp every time you complete a heist."
29025,i don't have to rob banks irl cause i am rich but ii would recommend the game if you want to feel how it feels to be rich because you have lots of money in the game like i do irl so i don't have to play it to feel rich but it makes you feel rich just like me so i would recommend it but i see big amounts of money in real life so i play this for fun not for feeling of being rich but you can feel rich for not much money so it won't make you broke probably if you have at least 10 dolars i have like 500x that amount in real life so i am not broke like you probably are but the game is fun if played with friends you can have more than 500 hours i don't have but i have friends i just don't play with them cause they are not as rich as i am so thank you for reading guys make you feel rich

Pros:
Replaybility
Alot of heists (sadly most of them are behind paywall)
DAKKA- I mean alot of guns.
Ridiculously giant customization range

Cons:
Alot of DLC's which may cause problems if you can't invest 60+ dollars into it.
Really big learning curve.
Buggy physics (More of a pro actually cause of how funny it looks)

29054,"Thousands of cops lie dead, all with the objective of finally stopping the world famous ""Payday"" gang.  All having years of training under their belt for nothing, nothing but to be shot dead immediately and have no impact on the fight due to the lack of funding on the police department, which had all been used to produce an infinite number of cops.  Soon with one cop standing, he held the body of his fellow officer.  One he had been a friend with since they weird babies.  Soon he heard the door of the room being broken down, now being frozen in fear the cop prayed for his life, hoping that whoever this figure is would have mercy upon his soul and spare him.  He turned to his left and grabbed a pistol as the door finally broke open, light filled the room as the figure finally became visible.  He asked the figure why they did this, what was the meaning of this.  The figure had one response



""gg ez noob"" before beating the cop dead with a giant spoon, leaving to return with his gang with a goat on his back.

29065,"I don't even know where to start with this fking steaming pile of dog sht!
The absoulte [b]WORST[/b] game I have ever kept playing because I'm apparently a sadomasochist that would rather lose my mind and punch my knuckles bloody on my wall from playing this sorry excuse of a game than uninstall it and burn the HDD it defiled by being installed on.
Not at all surprised that it comes out of a Swedish studio like most fking trash games.
Multiplayer is [b]NONEXISTENT[/b] if you're not in a fking LAN with the people you're playing with!
The amount of times you just sit and wait for the absoulte worst AI in any game to walk away so you can continue your ""stealth"" mission is probably close to 200 of the 281 hours I've played at the time of this review. The ""difficulty"" in stealth missions comes 100% from RNG and how well you can cope with tha fact that the AI will magnetize toward the player for no reason other than to say fk you and force you to restart the map. I wish I had a hard copy of the game so I could make a YouTube video of me taking a sht on it and setting it on fire.
[b]DO NOT BUY OR EVEN PLAY THIS GAME!!![/b]
Driving an ice pick through your eyeball into your brainmatter is probably more plesant than even launching this garbage"

Not really sure what, in the 2.6 hours i have in this game. But i'm certain that it relates to you having a job. The day in the name is related to when you have to work. So if you really think about it, PayDay 2 isnt a mcdonald simulator. Its a burger king Simulator."

29159,"[h1] [b] One of the heisters' tips was not to try this in real life...[/b][/h1]
[spoiler][strike]what they didn't tell you was how real life is harder than ""Death Sentence One Down"". At least you can retry after DSOD, but not in real life.[/strike] [/spoiler]

The game is still thrives, the fact that it survived longer than most of the recent triple A games proves this game is a game that is worth it. There are multiple ways to play too. Its usually best to play whatever you want the first 5 prestige's... [spoiler] after it you might have to start playing a bit meta. [/spoiler]

[b] [u] DLC's are a mix; some are good, some are bad, and some are just ugly. [/u] [/b] 

The payday community is nice and respectable, for a game about robbery and thievery; most players you'll meet will try and teach you or help you. Some players will literally not do that but just carry you the entire mission.

29220,"This game is awesome. Unless you are doing any stealth mission in this game. If you want to have the most frustrating and difficult time or you just plain hate yourself play stealth missions. The guards for one have eyes in the back of their head, So you literally can't sneak up on them without them starting to detect you. Two its not even worth it to kill the guards in stealth because in the majority of the missions the guards have pagers that you will have to interact with so they don't sound the alarms. This in itself is not a bad part of the game by any-means, but you can only kill up to 4 guards by this method. Killing a 5th guard will result in the alarm being triggered even if you use the pager. This wouldn't be an issue but the guards respawn thus, making killing guards more difficult for you than not. Plus The A.I. for the guards is just annoying. Oh and it feels like the game punishes you for going loud anyways because all the wait timers just get longer. Everything else in the game is pretty fun though."

29276,10/10 would recommend. Game is absolutely fun sometimes it gets boring doing things solo but overall it is worth playing. Stealth is the best mode on the game change my mind
29277,yes
29278,Going stealth in a public mission is the worst decision in your life.
29279,:/
29280,ok
29281,"Pros: 
+ High replay value
+ Large arsenal of guns, crossbows, etc.
+ Many different playstyles can be used
+ Pretty good VR experience 
+ Stealth gameplay for people who likes them
+ Highly customizable with mods
+ The game will still get updates for a long time
+ Awesome soundtrack
+ Collab with many famous films/games
+ You can probably play this game on a microwave at 30 fps

Cons: 
- Can be very buggy
- Melee is a joke
- You will most likely give in and buy all the DLCs because of the limited amount of base game guns
- 84GBs of disk space
- Sometimes no matter how good your PC is, the game would still get framedrops 
- Pub stealth
- Some heist can feel drawn out, insane cop spawns with very little cover
- The story is... weird
- Can be very addicting

29290,"Shit game. Apart from the controls being so difficult to handle, the objectives are impossible. On this mission 'Go Bank', there are no keycards wherever you search and the drill takes a good irl 5 mins to open the safe. And then there are 50 vaults inside that each need about 15secs to open each one. One time I found both keycards and it wouldn't even let me pick both up, and the one that I could, I had no clue what to do with. It can't be used to open the safe nor the vault. And then the cops come about and it just becomes a shoot and steal objective. I think this game is good only for people who are learning fps."

After I had 3 bags I was in the van when time went out and guess I failed. Maybe I wasn't exactly in the zone but either way I was soft locked into loosing a lot of money. Wasted like 45 minutes.

29311,I enjoy this game very much and it is very replayable due to the fact that rng on different heists is different and no one heist will ever be the same as another. Also very moddable and just overall a fun game

It's like the heists on GTA on crack. In first person, with your friends. 

Plus custom masks are great. Gotta practice social distancing and whatnot. 


TLDR: Buy it, devs are still updating, balancing and improving the game years after and it has a great community."

29379,"I don't review many games, but I thought this game was well worth the time. If you don't know already, at the time of this review, PAYDAY 3 has been revealed to release in 2023. So, if you truly want to save that experience, go ahead. Now onto the review:

I'm a competitive FPS gamer. Overwatch, COD, valorant, you name it. I've played it and probably loved it.  So when I first launched payday, I didn't know what to expect. Graphics are subpar. Nothing trash, but nothing breathtaking either. However, while the graphics themselves aren't that impressive, THE PLACES ARE GREAT. You could be robbing an everyday bank in a regular neighborhood, or you could be in a Vegas casino robbing an underground vault. Wanna fight off waves of invaders while cooking meth and non-stop action? Or do you prefer slower, more strategic gameplay on shadow raid? And this is, in my opinion, paydays strongest plus. There are so many heists, so much content, and so much variety in that gameplay itself. It's not a point A ----> point B adventure, it's a chaotic mess and I LOVE IT.

So a strong start with atmosphere. Next let's talk about gunplay. The weapon customization and class customization is the most complex, yet straightforward thing I've seen in any game. Literally 100s of weapons to choose from, so again, VARIETY. Sniper rifles, akimbo pistols, shotguns, or even god damn FLAMETHROWERS, if any kind of modern (or unmodern) weapon ever existed, it's probably in payday 2. There is only one thing I have against these amazing systems, and I believe the guns, attachments, and perk decks don't deserve to be partially locked by DLC. I'll take about DLC later, but just know this is the one place where it straight up is unfair. 

Now, the HEISTS. I already showed variety before, but it needs to be mentioned again. Seriously. It's amazing the amount of learning you can put into the game and how quickly you can become a master at these masterpieces. You can do something straightforward like bank heist, or do something more complex like framing frame. It's all up to you. And while, again, DLC locks about 30% of these heists, I think it works fine here because everyone would already get the same payday experience (unlike weapons/perks)

While this is about it, you cannot mention payday 2 and not bring up the MUSIC. If there was a god that existed in today's day and age, it would be the sound producers at overkill and songwriters. Donacdum, backstab, and now we run/wait, break the rules, and I will give you my all are my personal favorites. And there's again, about 100 songs to choose from. They really just had the word (variety) on the drawing board at overkill huh?

Overall, payday 2 gets a 9/10 from me. There are only a few minor issues I ever have. Wonderful game."

29524,"Back in the day, Payday 2 was the game to play. Unfortunately, it has seemed to have lost its touch in the modern era.

OVERKILL, this game's developer, has had its fair share of problems in the past, but really seemed to strike a goldmine with Payday 2. It's essentially a heisting game where you try to break into various locations, either ""loud"" or stealthily, and make it out alive with the valuables. 

There are tons of different strategies and maps and what not more, but it was promised by the developer a few years ago that there would be no more DLC. It didn't take them long for that promise to be broken. Now, if you log onto the game (even someone as myself who had ALL the DLC via the Ultimate Edition), most everything is DLC and requires additional payment. It's frustrating to say the least, especially when the developer promises something and flat out breaks it.

Payday 2 had its prime-time run, but unfortunately its number is up."
29525,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, I NEED A MEDICBAG!!"
29526,funny big spoon ha ha
29527,"PAYDAY 2 is total crap because:
1) To get more achievements, you need to work hard and buy a lot of DLC.
2) They force you to replay missions in the story, even if you have completed such a hundred times in free mode.
3) If you are not a stealth player, then you don't have to think about such missions.
4) The police have no tactics (stupidly rush and rush).
5) Clockers.
6) Skins have depreciated.
7) It gets boring over time.
Although there are pluses in the game, I won’t say them, because I’m writing a review in a negative mood after I spent 1.5 hours on an unsuccessful passage of the Oil Business robbery on Very Hard difficulty and an analysis of which engine to take ( depends on the number of valves, what gas, etc.)."

29534,Loads of fun if you have people to play with. Aight if it's just you.
29535,So I played this game back when it came out and dropped it from my usual rotations when the DLC started to look like microtransactions and stayed away when those were officially implemented. Coming back to the game after playing it to its entirety on PS4 I can definitively say that this game is 100% worth it's current pricing and hopefully Payday 3 isn't riddled with bad dlc and microtransactions.

I bought the default version but if I knew that the game is so good I would have bought the Legacy Edition.
Very nice community, almost no toxicity at all!
Definetely worth the 10$ + 2DLC's!"

9/10 (needs more free content)"
29580,"this game is very strange but in a good way
see at the surface it is a simple bank heist game but in actuality it contains some of the greatest music produced in gaming, the most detailed story involving ancient kings and body swapping not to mention the insane amount of customisation and arsenal of guns
all of this allows you to achieve your payday fellas"

29585,very much lots of sex? would recommend this because i love this game and i like shooting at people at real life and games some times when i have free time! so if u like killing the police then its a game for u
29586,"Accidentally tossed a smoke grenade into the back ally of a jewlery store. 

everyone freaks out calls the cop ""THERES A ROBERY"" noone has even seen me or heard anything besides a smoke grenade.

then one the second attempt i have the entire bank held hostage no cops called. my ENTIRE ai team just standing on the road doing nothing. meanwhile a civillian walks past the store front, and starts to call the cops. my entire AI team standing right next to the dude DOES NOTHING.

starting to regret this purchase."

29590,"Fun heist game with the best stealth in any heist game and really gets the heart pumping and the tension high fun gun play, however the game does have its floors"
29591,"Some of the most fun i've ever had in a PvE game. It's hilarious, sometimes intense, sometimes weird, but always fun and rarely frustrating (with the exception of a couple of heists).
 
Movement is smooth, animations are top notch, you get a ludicrous number of ludicrous weapons and the voice acting is awesome. The initial grind is really worth it (all you'll get later on are cosmetics), and so are most of the DLC's if you get the Legacy Edition. (Don't get them on their own, though)"
29592,VERY COOL GAME I RECOMMEND!
29593,"a very good game, especially for the price, graphics look amazing for a game made at the time, runs good on both good and bad pcs, never had it go below 60 fps and i have a potato, defintely would recommend, and i did, my friends and i love it!"

29657,it's great
29658,"I have followed Payday 2 release from the days where perk decks didn't exist and Overkill was an actually hard difficulty. I've seen the ups and downs, consoles being screwed over, overpowered stealth, the Hype Train mess, safes, etc. And I still come back to this game. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the music is top-tier, and the characters are great.

So yeah, it's pretty good."

9/10 medic bags

~ SUMMARY ~
Not played the pc version for too long but been playing the Xbox version since 2016. If you're grindy and want to forfeit  fun for xp then go stealth missions but if you sacrifice mortal possessions such as xP and lEvElS then load up i will give you my all or break the rules and wonder if you accidentally injected drugs into yourself this morning while headbanging so hard to the godly music that you give yourself and your desk head trauma. Overall definitely a game you should get but does get repetitve to a certain degree.

29716,"I am a 42 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Faide montages on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories"

29768,"Absolutely titallating, damn near a century old and well taken care of. Though I don't usually buy DLC, this game is pretty much strong-arming me into it, as the base game isn't particularly dense and only one sniper came? I have to pay to thoroughly experience pretty much every weapons class? I guess so, ya lil shits."

29795,Very fun game I enjoy screaming at my monitor every time i get down for no reason. I do recommend this game if you enjoy getting kicked out of the house for screaming at the top of your lungs.
29796,"A very nice game to play with your friends, if you like to work as a team then this game is surely made for you."
29797,Money
29798,this is an amazing game if u like shoolter it is so easy if you come from a fps game
29799,"game runs bad because they're pushing the graphics of the engine too hard, the developers suck at optimization and there are like no settings. no turning off post-processing or shadows, no turning off unnecessary props, model LODs don't really seem to be a thing either? really good idea with vast open spaces with a bunch of props sprewn about. mods can partially turn off post processing but the bloom and depth of field is jammed into the same shader responsible for the very much necessary outlines because reasons.

the compression of the assets is complete ass. windows can shave off 20GB of data with its simple ntfs compression from the year 2000.

32-bit and dx9 support are there, which is really cool for backwards compatiblity (and could run well, too) but it doesn't mean much when the entire game is a mess technically."
